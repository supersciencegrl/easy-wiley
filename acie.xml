         <title>Online Coupling High&#8208;Temperature Electrolysis with Carbonylation Reactions: A Powerful Method for Continuous Carbon Dioxide Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous process for carbonylation reactions based on the online coupling of dry, high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis with a coil reactor has been reported. The strategy relies on producing CO/CO2 mixtures onsite, without H2 or H2O entering the product gas, thus providing a safe and fast concept for the synthesis of several carbonyl compounds. The method demonstrated widespread applicability in amino&#8208;, alkoxy&#8208;, and phenoxycarbonylation, in carbonylative Sonogashira couplings, and in the synthesis of redox&#8208;active esters. The corresponding products were isolated with excellent yields in just 40 min.








Abstract
Despite being widely available, the broad utilization of CO2 for chemical production remains in its infancy. The difficulty of using CO2 as an important resource for the chemical industry lies in the high stability of the molecule and its associated inertia. In this work, we demonstrate how to overcome these limitations by utilizing a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) with an optimized cathode to produce dry CO through the high&#8208;temperature electrolysis of CO2. We further integrate this process with a synthesis setup in a continuous&#8208;flow coil reactor to boost reactivity in various carbonylation processes, including in amino&#8208;, alkoxy&#8208;, and phenoxycarbonylation, carbonylative Sonogashira couplings, or the synthesis of redox&#8208;active esters. Ultimately, our approach offers a platform strategy for the rapid, scalable, and continuous production of carbonyl compounds directly from CO2 while eliminating the requirement for storing large CO quantities.

         <title>Engineering Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites in Ordered Macroporous Architectures for Enhanced C2H4 Production from CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst was constructed by in situ creating Cu&#9472;In active sites within the three&#8208;dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) In2O3, which demonstrates a dual&#8208;engineered strategy integrating 3DOM architectures with heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal active sites to synergistically enhance C2H4 production in photocatalytic CO2 and H2O conversion.








Abstract
Photocatalytic C2H4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O by utilizing solar energy represents a promising sustainable process, yet its efficiency remains significantly limited. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;engineered strategy integrating 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) architectures with heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal active sites to synergistically promote the photocatalytic C2H4 production. As an example, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst was synthesized by in situ incorporating Cu single atoms (Cu SAs) into 3DOM In2O3 through a template&#8208;assisted pyrolysis process. The strong interaction between Cu SAs and In2O3 resulted in the formation of charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#9472;In active sites along with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs). 3DOM architectures serving as special nanoreactors displayed significant advantages in promoting CO2 enrichment and confining key intermediates, thereby increasing *CO coverage. Meanwhile, the charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#9472;In active sites effectively mitigated electrostatic repulsion and promoted the formation of *CO&#160;+&#160;*CHO intermediates, resulting in a thermodynamically spontaneous C&#9472;C coupling step. Therefore, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst exhibited robust CO2 reduction to C2H4, achieving high C2H4 evolution rates under various CO2 concentrations, including pure CO2, 10% CO2 in Ar (simulated flue gas), and 0.04% CO2 in Ar (simulated air). This work offers a novel strategy for the construction of photocatalysts with tailored microstructures and specific active sites to promote the conversion of CO2 and H2O into multicarbon products.

         <title>Microporous Hard Carbon Support Provokes Exceptional Performance of Single Atom Electrocatalysts for Advanced Air Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe single atoms in microporous hard carbon (Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC) possesses a microporous structure with crumpled graphene sheets, which serves confined microenvironment for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC yields a remarkable ORR performance, and hydrogen bonding between the intermediates and micropore interior surfaces accelerates ORR kinetics. Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC shows outstanding performance in zinc&#8208;air batteries and industrial chlor&#8208;alkali process.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts embracing metal&#8208;nitrogen (MNx) moieties show promising performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The modification on spatially confined microenvironments, which won copious attention with respect to achieving efficient catalysts, are auspicious but yet to be inspected for MNx moieties from modulating the energetics and kinetics of ORR. Here, Fe single atoms (SAs) are immobilized in microporous hard carbon (Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC), in which the microporous structure with crumpled graphene sheets serves confined microenvironment for catalysis. Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC holds a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.927&#160;V and excellent stability for ORR. Theoretical studies unveil that hydrogen bonding between the intermediate of O* and micropore interior surfaces substantially promote its protonation and accelerate the overall ORR kinetics. Both the aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries driven by Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC air cathode show excellent stability with small charging/discharging voltage gaps. Importantly, when used as the air cathode for industrial chlor&#8208;alkali process, the applied voltage of Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC&#8208;based flow cell to reach 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is 1.57&#160;V, which is 210&#160;mV smaller than Pt/C&#8208;based one. These findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into the confined microenvironment of MNx moieties for boosted electrochemical performance, and pave the pathways for future catalyst development satisfying the requirement of industrial applications.

         <title>Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis: A Versatile Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclopropenes and Oxazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that the radical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates with alkynes and the radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with nitriles proceeds smoothly via a cobaloxime&#8208;based metalloradical catalysis (MRC) pathway, affording the desired products in high to excellent yields. Key results include broad substrate compatibility, high functional group tolerance, scalability to gram&#8208;scale transformations, and practical applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. The work not only underscores the synthetic utility of cobaloxime complexes but also expands the scope of MRC, providing a robust platform for sustainable and innovative radical transformations in organic synthesis.








Abstract
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. Here, an efficient catalytic method has been devised for the radical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cyclopropenation of alkynes and radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] oxazolation of nitriles using &#945;&#8208;aryldiazoacetates via MRC. Cobaloxime proves effective in facilitating the metalloradical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cyclopropenation of alkynes and radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] oxazolation cycloaddition reaction under mild conditions. The reactions demonstrate broad substrate tolerance, accommodating gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our findings highlight the significant potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition as a valuable tool in organic synthesis and broaden the scope of metalloradical systems in catalysis.

     alt="Cobaloxime-Based Metalloradical Catalysis: A Versatile Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclopropenes and Oxazoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated that the radical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition of &#945;-aryl-&#945;-diazoacetates with alkynes and the radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with nitriles proceeds smoothly via a cobaloxime-based metalloradical catalysis (MRC) pathway, affording the desired products in high to excellent yields. Key results include broad substrate compatibility, high functional group tolerance, scalability to gram-scale transformations, and practical applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. The work not only underscores the synthetic utility of cobaloxime complexes but also expands the scope of MRC, providing a robust platform for sustainable and innovative radical transformations in organic synthesis.

         <title>Tubular Nanostructures from Large&#8208;Pore 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavy mesoporous 2D covalent organic framework (COF) has been synthesized with a 6&#8208;nm hexagonal pore lattice. This COF forms non&#8208;covalent tubular domains that can be separated by mild sonication, yielding a family of tubular COF nanostructures that combine a 1D morphology with accessible mesopores.








Abstract
The synthesis of a wavy mesoporous 2D covalent organic framework (COF) with a 6&#8208;nm hexagonal pore lattice (Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;1) is reported. This has been achieved by the synthesis of a terpyrenyl linker of approximately 2.7&#160;nm in length and its subsequent condensation with a 3&#8208;connected non&#8208;planar cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exists as non&#8208;covalent tubular domains composed of &#960;&#8208;stacked 4 to 5 pores in 2D COF sections that can be separated by mild sonication, resulting in a family of tubular COF nanostructures that combine a 1D morphology with accessible mesopores.

         <title>Li21Ge8P3S34: New Lithium Superionic Conductor with Unprecedented Structural Type</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of high ion&#8208;conductive inorganic crystal structures remains a challenge in facilitating the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Ionic conductors reported to date have predominantly been limited to well&#8208;known crystal structures. In this work, we report a new, unprecedented crystalline structure, Li21Ge8P3S34, which demonstrates high ionic conductivity.








Abstract
Lithium superionic conductors are pivotal for enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, which aim to replace liquid electrolytes and enhance safety. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented lithium superionic conductor, Li21Ge8P3S34, featuring a novel structural type and a new composition in the Li&#8211;Ge&#8211;P&#8211;S system. This material exhibits high lithium ionic conductivity of approximately 1.0&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 303&#160;K with a low activation energy of 0.20(1)&#160;eV. It's unique crystal structure was elucidated using three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) and further refined through combined powder X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction analyses. The structure consists of alternating two&#8208;dimensional slabs: one of corner&#8208;sharing GeS4 tetrahedra and the other of isolated PS4 tetrahedra, enabling efficient lithium&#8208;ion transport through a tetrahedrally interconnected network of 1D, 2D, and 3D diffusion pathways. This distinctive structural motif provides a novel design strategy for next&#8208;generation solid electrolytes, broadening the structural landscape of lithium superionic conductors. With further advancements in compositional tuning and interfacial engineering, Li21Ge8P3S34 could contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry in Functional Hydrogel Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive overview of research progress in functional hydrogel coatings, the interfacial mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed, and the preparation methods with their respective advantages and disadvantages for hydrogel coatings are summarized. Finally, the challenges in terms of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality are outlined, and a glimpse into future opportunities is offered. 








Abstract
Functional hydrogel coatings can endow the underlying substrate with excellent surface properties, such as anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;fogging, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;abrasion, lubrication, and controllable drug delivery, while hardly changing the mechanical properties of the substrate. Through elaborate interface engineering, hydrogel coatings with high interfacial toughness and controllable thickness have been successfully constructed on different substrate surfaces for widespread applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current research progress in functional hydrogel coatings and the associated interfacial chemistry. First, the interfacial interactions and mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed. Next, the preparation methods for hydrogel coatings are systematically summarized, with a focus on the involved critical chemical groups/reactions and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we highlight the challenges from the perspective of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality, and provide a glimpse into future opportunities, hoping to promote the transformation of functional hydrogel coatings from foundational research to industrial applications.

         <title>Rapid Water Permeation by Aramid Foldamer Nanochannels With Hydrophobic Interiors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We compare the water permeability of stacked macrocycles and synthetic helical nanotubes of three different lengths across phospholipid bilayers. Our results demonstrate that covalent nanotubes with a length matching the bilayer width exhibit high water permeability, excellent salt and proton rejection, and performance comparable to natural aquaporins.








Abstract
Aquaporins are natural proteins that rapidly transport water across cell membranes, maintaining homeostasis, whilst strictly excluding salt. This has inspired their use in water purification and desalination, a critical emerging need. However, stability, scalability, and cost have prevented their widespread adoption in water purification membrane technologies. As such, attention has turned to the use of artificial water channels, with pore&#8208;functionalized polymers and macrocycles providing a powerful alternative. Whilst impressive rates of transport have been achieved, the combination of a scalable, high&#8208;yielding synthesis and efficient transport has not yet been reported. Herein, we report such a system, with densely functionalized channel interiors, synthesized by high&#8208;yielding living polymerization with low polydispersities, showing high salt exclusion and excellent water transport rates. Our aramid foldamers create artificial water channels with hydrophobic interiors and single&#8208;channel water permeability rates of up to 108 water molecules per second per channel, approaching the range of natural aquaporins (c. 109). We show that water transport rates closely correspond to the helical length, with the polymer that most closely matches bilayer thickness showing optimal efficacy, as supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our work provides a basis for the scalable synthesis of next&#8208;generation artificial water channels.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doping Engineering of Fused Olympic Cations: Metal&#8208;Free Modular Syntheses and NIR&#8208;II Radicals with Mixed Aromatic/Antiaromatic Characters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of nitrogen and sulfur/oxygen dual&#8208;doping Olympic heterocyclic cations have been modularly synthesized employing a metal&#8208;free protocol, with tunable optical and redox properties. These charged &#960;&#8208;molecules can transform to delocalized neutral radicals through single&#8208;electron reduction, exhibiting NIR&#8208;II absorptions around 1300&#8211;1400&#160;nm and mixed aromatic/antiaromatic features.








Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have attracted immense attention owing to their fascinating optoelectrical properties.

         <title>Probing Inside the Catalyst Layer on Gas Diffusion Electrodes in Electrochemical Reduction of CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind in situ confocal Raman spectroscopy technique is developed to probe the cross&#8208;section of catalyst layers in gas diffusion electrodes during CO(2) reduction reactions. For CORR in alkaline medium, the active region is identified by CO adsorption bands. In CO2RR in acidic electrolyte, CS&#8208;Raman spectroscopy reveals that only regions with elevated pH are active.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are widely used in electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CO(2)RR) in flow cells due to their ability to alleviate mass transport limitations of gaseous reactants. The flow cell configuration makes uniform distribution of reactants, intermediates, products, and speciation within the catalyst layer (CL) unlikely. In this work, a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind in situ characterization technique capable of probing the cross section of the CL with confocal Raman spectroscopy was developed to investigate the speciation distribution across the Cu CL in CO(2)RR with a spatial resolution of &#8764;4&#160;&#181;m. In both CORR in alkaline medium and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte, the active region of CL was identified as that with the presence of the Raman band for adsorbed CO (COad). The strong correlation of COad and CO32&#8722; bands provides the first spectroscopic evidence that CO2RR only occurs in an alkaline microenvironment.

         <title>Simultaneous Activation of Bicyclobutanes and Indolyl Alcohols with HFIP: Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Bicyclo[3.1.1]Heptanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indole&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.1.1.]heptanes were synthesized by the (3&#160;+&#160;3) annulation of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with indolyl alcohols through dual activation with 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol (HFIP). HFIP activates BCBs to ester enolates and indolyl alcohols to cationic indolenium species. This method is straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits good functional group compatibility.








Abstract
The concept of strain release to unleash unique reactivity that drives a wide range of synthetically valuable transformations has long intrigued chemists. Among the various strained systems, highly reactive bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently emerged as versatile building blocks for constructing bicyclic scaffolds. Despite the existence of various activation pathways for BCBs, the use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol (HFIP) to activate BCBs has not been realized so far. Herein, we report the first HFIP&#8208;promoted (3&#160;+&#160;3) annulation of BCBs with indolyl alcohols through the simultaneous activation of both partners, facilitating the metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free synthesis of indole&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Mechanistic studies reveal the role of HFIP in activating both components, and the reaction proceeds by an initial (3&#160;+&#160;2) annulation followed by a ring expansion/aromatization cascade.

         <title>Competition between One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Electron Unimolecular Reactions of Late 3d&#8208;Metal Complexes [(Me3SiCH2)nM]&#8211;(M = Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu; n = 2&#8211;4)</title>

Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and theoretical calculations on a series of model complexes determine the intrinsic tendencies of the late 3d metals to undergo one&#8208;versus two&#8208;electron reactions and unravel the factors controlling the selectivity.








Abstract
Although organometallic complexes of the late 3d elements are known to undergo both one&#8208;and two&#8208;electron reactions, their relative propensities to do so remain poorly understood. To gain direct insight into the competition between these different pathways, we have analyzed the unimolecular gas&#8208;phase reactivity of a series of well&#8208;defined model complexes [(Me3SiCH2)nM]&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu; n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;4). Applying a combination of tandem&#8208;mass spectrometry, quantum&#8208;chemical computations, and statistical rate&#8208;theory calculations, we find several different fragmentation reactions, among which the homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;carbon bonds and radical dissociations are particularly prominent. In all cases, these one&#8208;electron reactions are entropically favored. For the ferrate and cobaltate complexes, they are also energetically preferred, which explains their predominance in the corresponding fragmentation experiments. For [(Me3SiCH2)4Ni]&#8722; and, even more so, for [(Me3SiCH2)4Cu]&#8722;, a concerted reductive elimination as a prototypical two&#8208;electron reaction is energetically more favorable and gains in importance. [(Me3SiCH2)3Ni]&#8722; is special in that it has two nearly degenerate spin states, both of which react in different ways. A simple thermochemical analysis shows that the relative order of the first and second bond&#8208;dissociation energies is of key importance in controlling the competition between radical dissociations and concerted reductive eliminations.

         <title>Molecularly Designed Cathode for Copper&#8208;Benzimidazole&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction to MeOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular cathode incorporating a strategically designed copper&#8208;benzimidazole&#8208;based electrocatalyst was developed for direct CO&#8322; capture and electrochemical conversion to methanol (e&#8208;MeOH). This system follows a formato pathway, utilizing water as a proton source and thus eliminating the need for H&#8322; in e&#8208;MeOH production. The mechanism of methanol formation has been investigated by DFT calculations. The electrode's stability and recyclability were thoroughly evaluated through multiple controlled potential electrolysis experiments.








Abstract
Conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) into value&#8208;added products is aimed to develop scalable technologies to promote a circular economy. While the electrochemical reduction of CO&#8322; to carbon monoxide (CO) and formic acid has advanced significantly, a major challenge remains achieving further reduced and more energy&#8208;dense products, such as methanol (MeOH), through sustainable pathways. Herein, we report a molecular electrode capable of direct six&#8208;electron reduction of CO&#8322; to MeOH using water as a proton source with a global Faradaic efficiency (FEG) of 22% and product selectivity of 61% for MeOH. The design consists of an active copper&#8208;hydride center surrounded by two closely spaced benzimidazole&#8211;hydride units, facilitating the catalytic transfer of three hydrides to produce MeOH. The concurrent formation of formic acid and the absence of formaldehyde suggest that MeOH is generated via a formato pathway. DFT investigations revealed the complete mechanistic pathway, which supports the experimental observations. The morphology and stability of the electrode were evaluated before and after prolonged electrolysis (12&#160;h) experiments using electron microscopic techniques.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transport Divergence in Ultrastable Heterometal&#8208;Oxo Clusters Exerting Significant Effect on Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difference in orbital hybridization between heterometallic elements in heterometal&#8208;oxo clusters Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A (M&#160;=&#160;Ti, Zr, and Hf) has a significant effect on the distribution of frontier molecular orbital energy levels, resulting in the transmission of photogenerated electrons to different active sites, thus leading to different catalytic activities.








Abstract
The transfer path of photogenerated charges greatly affects the final photocatalytic performance, but this important fact has not been clearly demonstrated experimentally. Here, we construct an ultrastable crystalline catalytic system including three heterometal&#8208;oxo clusters, Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A (M&#160;=&#160;group IVB metal&#8208;Ti/Zr/Hf), which include cubic metal&#8208;oxo cluster core with eight Bi atoms at the vertices, one M atom at the body center, and six M atoms above the cubic face centers. It is worth noted that the change of group IVB elements in Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A can specifically modulate the LUMO&#8208;HOMO orbitals to distribute on different active metal atoms. This allows it to be an excellent model system to verify the effect of the transport paths of photogenerated charges on photoreactivity. In model reaction based on CO2 photoreduction, Bi8Ti7&#8208;TBC4A displays superior photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion rate of 3580.02&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Bi8Zr7&#8208;TBC4A and 4 times that of Bi8Hf7&#8208;TBC4A. In situ characterization accompanied by density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the difference in orbital hybridization between Bi and IVB group elements largely affects the orbital distribution of frontier molecular orbital levels in Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A, leading to the transport of photogenerated charges to metal active sites with different reactivities, and thus widely differing photocatalytic performances. This is the first model catalyst system that explores the effect of different photogenerated charge transport pathways on photoreactivity.

         <title>Unusual MurC Ligase and Peptidoglycan Discovered in Lachnospiraceae Using a Fluorescent L&#8208;Amino Acid Based Selective Labeling Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid probe that can selectively label the family Lachnospiraceae in vivo and in vitro is reported. The labeling position of LAA probe is the 1st amino acid of the bacterial PGN stem peptide. The unusually large volume of the inner space in the crystal structure of Roseburia faecis MurC implies its higher tolerance for substrates to some extent.








Abstract
Developing selective labeling probes for specific bacterial taxa can not only facilitate the study of target bacteria but also deepen our understanding of the microbial diversity at structural and molecular levels. The availability of such probes, however, remains very limited. In this study, by exploiting the variation of amino acids in peptidoglycan stem peptide, we designed a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid probe and found that it can selectively target the family Lachnospiraceae (a major Gram&#8208;positive family in murine gut microbiome) in vivo. The following in vitro test using two Roseburia species belonging to this family validated labeling by the probe. We then discovered that the labeling site is the first amino acid (L&#8208;alanine in most bacteria), which links the stem peptide with N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid, a process catalyzed by a highly conserved enzyme MurC. An enzyme assay of Roseburia MurC demonstrated its ability to conjugate a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid and other non&#8208;L&#8208;Ala amino acids to UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid. Subsequent X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis uncovered a substantially enlarged inner space in this enzyme, which can partially explain its tolerance to these atypical substrates. The resulting unusual peptidoglycan structures lead to significantly reduced activation of the NOD immune receptors, suggesting a new mechanism for the host to accommodate these highly abundant commensals.

         <title>Compacting Molecular Stacking and Inhibiting Self&#8208;Aggregation in Fullerene Transporting Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphate&#8208;substituted fullerene derivative, FuPE, is developed and blended with PCBM to increase crystallinity, compact molecular stacking, and improve the compatibility of electron transport layers in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The FuPE:PCBM blend presents higher electron mobility, more complete coverage, and suppressed self&#8208;aggregation, and thus enables PSCs to achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies up to 26% with enhanced stability.








Abstract
The underdevelopment of electron transport layer (ETL) materials remains a critical bottleneck limiting the overall photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Fullerene derivatives, such as PCBM, are widely employed ETL materials in PSCs due to their excellent electron affinity and energy level alignment with the perovskite layer. However, PCBM suffers from high energy disorder, self&#8208;aggregation predilection, and insufficient defect passivation ability, leading to significant charge carrier recombination and accumulation at interfaces. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;substituted fullerene derivative, FuPE, is developed to enhance the performance of PCBM&#8208;based ETLs for PSCs. Incorporating FuPE efficiently compacts molecular stacking, enforces crystallinity and intermolecular interaction, suppresses self&#8208;aggregation, and improves interfacial compatibility of the FuPE:PCBM blend. Such endows the FuPE:PCBM blend film with enhanced electron mobility (0.183&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), lower trap density, more uniform film morphology, and superior defect&#8208;passivation ability, compared to the PCBM pristine one. Consequently, PSCs employing FuPE:PCBM as the ETL achieve reduced trap&#8208;assisted recombination, enhanced charge carrier extraction, and thus a remarkable power conversion efficiency exceeding 26% alongside improved operational stability. This work highlights an effective strategy for optimizing fullerene&#8208;based ETLs, advancing the development of highly efficient and durable PSCs.

         <title>C&#9472;S Bonds Modulated Nanointerface Tension to Create Stable Magnetic Hollow Nanocarbons for Efficient Microplastics Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new perspective in creating structural stable, well&#8208;defined hollow nanostructures by modulating nanointerface tension via C&#9472;S bonds. Practiced from this stability design principle, a functional integrated magnetic hollow nanocarbons featuring an increased contact area, magnetically facilitated mass transfer, and a sulfur&#8208;modified surface, achieves high&#8208;capacity, rapid, and widely adaptable microplastics capture.








Abstract
Microplastic pollution poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Hollow nanomaterials are promising adsorbents for microplastics remediation due to their tailorable architectures, functions, and large contact area. Nevertheless, the structural stability of well&#8208;defined nanostructures has always been a critical factor, and understanding the stability principle is desired. Herein, we fabricated magnetic hollow nanocarbons as &#8220;nano&#8208;analytical tool&#8221;, revealing that the stability is related to additional pressure caused by nanointerface tension at curved carbon shell surface. To mitigate this, we introduced C&#9472;S bonds by sulfurizing carbon matrix, suppressing the condensation of oxygen&#8208;containing groups and thereby reducing interface tension. As a showcase, the stable hollow Fe3O4@C/S enabled rapid and efficient microplastics capture (100% within 10 s, 53 600&#160;mg g&#8722;1 capacity) under an alternating magnetic field, owing to the magnetically accelerated mass transfer and increased contact area. Additionally, sulfur modification broadens applicability range where carbon surface is oppositely charged to microplastics, expanding the universality in capturing multiple types of microplastics, even under challenging conditions including different pH and salinities. This work offers guidance into the precise synthesis of hollow nanomaterials from nanointerface perspective. The design principles involving sulfur modification and high&#8208;contact area may open prospects for high&#8208;capacity microplastics capture in complex aquatic environments.

         <title>Isolation of a Square Pyramidal Bis(amidophenolate)&#8208;Supported As(III)&#8208;Cation: Coordination&#8208;Induced Electromerism at As</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When a bis(amidophenolate)&#8208;supported As(III)&#8208;center is treated with typical two&#8208;electron donors, a coordination&#8208;induced electromerism induces the oxidation of the central atom to As(V) with concomitant reduction of the redox&#8208;active ligand. Due to this triggerable electronic reorganization, the As&#8208;center remains a remarkable Lewis acid and can be used as initiator for transfer hydrogenation reactions. 








Abstract
The synthesis and structural characterization of a slightly distorted square pyramidal arsenium cation is reported. Spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational evidence indicate that coordination of typical Lewis bases to the As(III)&#8208;center induces its oxidation to As(V) with concomitant reduction of the supporting, redox&#8208;active bis(amidophenolate) ligand. That reaction is reversible and represents a well&#8208;defined example of base&#8208;induced electromerism in an As&#8208;complex. Single electron reduction of the same As(III) species initially generates a ligand&#8208;centered radical, which is persistent enough to be observed by EPR but slowly decays to a heterodimer. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the utility of the As(III)&#8208;cation as initiator for transfer hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Molecular Stiffening by Macrocycle Clustering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic hosts can remotely rigidify part of a molecule, implying that this part need not be included inside a macrocycle to be stiffened. Here, we show that multiple binding by synthetic hosts CB[7] and CB[8] can selectively rigidify fragments of a tetratopic molecule in water causing a gradual stiffening from the periphery to the core. This suggests that protein dynamics (and so function) could be tuned by targeted multiple external binding.








Abstract
Allosteric stiffening of a portion of a protein surface is a strategy used in nature to regulate protein oligomerization and provide crucial functions for cells. However, a similar strategy to selectively control part of a compound dynamics remains elusive. Here we show that cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) macrocycles can bind almost all portions of a tetratopic guest molecule, stiffening the different parts of the guest to different extents. &#8220;Host&#8211;guest&#8221; interactions were found to be instrumental in selectively &#8220;freezing&#8221; guest molecular motions. The combination of 1H&#8208;NMR (1D, 2D), DOSY, VT&#8208;NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), mass spectrometry and molecular modelling enabled to highlight the crucial role of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) binding in the selective hardening of relevant portions of the guest molecule. Beyond implications for bioinspired systems mimicking control of a system dynamic to create a new function, this approach has relevance for improving room temperature phosphorescence, and could also be used to allosterically control organocatalysis in water.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Post&#8208;Perovskite for Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Hard X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5&#160;g&#160;cm&#8315;3 were achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. The assembled BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited excellent X&#8208;ray absorption capacity and high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity.








Abstract
The density properties of semiconductors play a crucial role in applications, such as radiation detection, electronic devices, and aerospace technologies. However, controlling the density of semiconductors often leads to significant alterations in their electronic structure, which can result in the loss of their original semiconductor properties. Perovskite semiconductors, known for their excellent carrier transport properties, face limitations in hard X&#8208;ray detection due to their relatively low density and loose atomic packing. This study explores a series of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5&#160;g&#160;cm&#8315;3, achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. When applied to hard X&#8208;ray detection, the post&#8208;perovskite materials demonstrated superior attenuation cross&#8208;sections compared to the heaviest 3D CsPbI3 perovskite and 0D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite. Specifically, the BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited a high sensitivity of 4126&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a minimum detection limit of 4.3&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. The enhanced density also mitigates ionic migration, ensuring excellent electrical stability. These findings underscore the potential of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors for advanced optoelectronic and radiation detection applications.

         <title>H2S Sensing with SnO2&#8208;Based Gas Sensors: Sulfur Poisoning Mechanism Revealed by Operando DRIFTS and DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of sticky sulfite and sulfate surface species is identified as the root cause of the poisoning effect of H2S on SnO2&#8208;based sensors by the compelling results and detailed analyses from operando DRIFTS experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time detection of toxic and flammable H2S remains challenging for cost&#8208;effective semiconducting metal oxide (SMOX) sensors due to the insufficient focus on and inherently poor understanding of the sulfur&#8208;poisoning effect. This research, focusing on SnO2 as a model for SMOX sensors, identifies the formation of sticky sulfite and sulfate surface species as the root cause of poisoning through the detailed analyses of results obtained from operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The formation of the poisoning species is highly energetically favorable. Meanwhile, the decomposition of sulfite and sulfate appears unfavorable at the typical operating temperature of 300 &#176;C and is only feasible around the literature&#8208;reported 500&#160;&#176;C. The sulfur poisoning effect is also likely to occur with SO2 and other sulfur&#8208;containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Overcoming this issue is expected to require surface additives and/or alternative SMOX materials capable of providing different reaction pathways. The significance of metal&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxygen chemistry extends beyond SMOX gas sensors to desulfurization catalysts, denitration catalysts, and solid oxide fuel cells.

         <title>Spiro Units Embedded in the B/N Center for Constructing Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By strategically integrating spiro polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (spiro&#8208;PAHs) either in their entirety or partially into the boron/nitrogen&#8208; multiple resonances (B/N&#8208;MR) cores, it is feasible to develop highly efficient and narrow&#8208;band MR&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), while simultaneously tuning their emission wavelengths.








Abstract
Departing from conventional molecular design strategies that rely on spiro units merely as peripheral components (side chains, terminal groups, or linkage units), we fully or partially incorporate the rigid 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] (SF) unit into the boron/nitrogen multiple resonances (B/N&#8208;MR) emitting core, thereby successfully developing a series of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomerized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, namely SF&#8208;BN1, SF&#8208;BN2, SF&#8208;BN3, and SF&#8208;BN4. Remarkably, these novel emitters exhibit exceptionally narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 15&#8211;21&#160;nm in dilute toluene solutions and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 90% in doped films. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on SF&#8208;BN1 achieved high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 29.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.08), closely aligning with the BT.2020 blue emission standard. Sky&#8208;blue OLEDs based on SF&#8208;BN3 can achieve a high EQE of 29.8%, with a narrow FWHM value of 18&#160;nm; the hyperfluorescent (HF) OLEDs based on SF&#8208;BN3 improved the EQE of 35.5%. Moreover, we elucidated subtle variations in the connectivity of chemical functional groups within emitters and the polar environment and doping concentrations of OLEDs, which can significantly impact these isomers' optical and electroluminescent (EL) properties.

         <title>Stereocontrolled Phenol&#8208;Yne Click Polymerization Toward High&#8208;Performance Bioplastics with Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereocontrolled phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization process has been developed for the first time by judiciously changing the substrates, catalysts, and reaction solvents, enabling the construction of a series of structure&#8208;defined, high&#8208;performance, and recyclable click bioplastics.








Abstract
Hydroxyl&#8208;yne click polymerization is a highly atom&#8208;economic and powerful tool for constructing sequence&#8208;controlled and structure&#8208;diverse unsaturated polymers. However, the cis/trans stereochemistry remains underdeveloped, thus lacking a stereodivergent synthesis of stereocontrolled polymers. Herein, we first report the organocatalyzed stereocontrolled phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization of bioderived diphenols and dipropiolates by judiciously changing the substrates, catalysts, and reaction solvents. Various sequence&#8208; and stereocontrolled poly(vinyl ether ester)s were effectively synthesized under mild reaction conditions, in which the trans content in the polymeric backbone can be proportionally altered in the range of 46%&#8211;100%. More importantly, the bulk properties of these materials such as thermal (Td,5% of 329&#8211;362 &#176;C; Tg of 48&#8211;92 &#176;C), mechanical (ultimate tensile strengths of 41&#8211;89&#160;MPa, tensile moduli of 960&#8211;1991&#160;MPa, and elongations at break of 71%&#8211;242%), and transport properties (oxygen transmission rates of 0.2&#8211;0.3&#160;bar and water vapor transmission rates of 1.3&#8211;2.8&#160;g mm m&#8722;2 day&#8722;1) can be tuned broadly. Moreover, the installed dynamic acetal moieties contribute to the excellent degradability and recyclability of these materials. This study provides an efficient and sustainable strategy for synthesizing stereoregulated biopolymers with closed&#8208;loop recyclability, thereby expanding the chemical diversity of click polymers with structure&#8208;controlled and tailored properties.

         <title>Constructing Mechanical&#8211;Chemical Stability via Multiphase Riveting and Interface Optimization Toward Layer&#8208;structured Oxide Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing rapid quenching techniques to construct a multiphase structure with dislocations and F&#8722; doping we revealed the advantages of dislocations and defects in enhancing the material's mechanical and kinetic performance. Meanwhile the strong TM&#9472;F covalent network synergistically stabilizes transition metal dissolution and lattice oxygen loss. The layered cathode obtained through this straightforward triple&#8208;benefit strategy demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance in the 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V voltage range.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based layer&#8208;structured oxide materials are considered as one of the most competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost and efficient sodium intercalation chemistry. Their electrochemical performance, however, is hindered by mechanical and chemical failures stemming from weak interlayer interactions, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect of Mn3+ and unstable surfaces. To address these issues, a quenching method was employed to fabricate a robust multiphase structure with a fluorine and dislocation&#8208;rich surface. Through the accumulation of dislocations and the interlocking of multiphase structures, the mechanical stability of the material during (de)sodiation processes is enhanced, while the surface fluorine anchoring further strengthens the chemical stability. Even after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and 1&#160;C within the voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V, the designed composite material P2/P3/O3&#8208;Na0.89Ni0.3Mn0.55Cu0.1Ti0.05O1.94F0.06 exhibits impressive capacity retention rates of 87.17% and 90.4%, respectively. This work exemplifies the important role of simultaneous design of mechano&#8208;chemically coupled materials for the development of high performances cathode materials.

         <title>Formation and Metallomimetic Reactivity of a Transient Dicoordinate Alkylborylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Generation of the first metal&#8208;free dicoordinate alkylborylene, [(CAAC)BCy] (CAAC&#160;=&#160;cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene, Cy&#160;=&#160;cyclohexyl), is reported. This species exhibits metallomimetic reactivity with donor ligands and dihydrogen and is more reactive than amino counterparts. Metallomimetic chemistry of the carbonyl&#8208;ligated borylene [(CAAC)BCy(CO)] is also demonstrated. 








Abstract
While existing literature has primarily focused on carbene&#8208;stabilized amino&#8208; and arylborylenes of the form [(carbene)BR] (R&#160;=&#160;substituent), herein we report the generation and metallomimetic reactivity of the first carbene&#8208;stabilized alkylborylene [(CAACMe)BCy] (CAACMe&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Cy&#160;=&#160;cyclohexyl). Furthermore, the transition metal&#8208;like decarbonylation reactions of a borylene complex, [(CAACMe)BCy(CO)], derived from borylene [(CAACMe)BCy] and CO, are described. Additional findings described include i) the identification of the coordination stages of the ligand to boron towards forming complexes [(CAACMe)BCyL] in the reduction route from starting material [(CAACMe)BCyBr2] and in the photolysis route from carbonyl complex [(CAACMe)BCy(CO], and ii) insights from quantum&#8208;chemical computations regarding the molecular and electronic structure of the borylene at various stages.

         <title>Cooperative Redox Reactions Encoded by Two Gene Clusters Enable Intermolecular Cycloaddition Cascade for the Formation of Meroaspochalasins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, two independent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), flas and epi, being responsible for the biosynthesis of aspochalasin B (7) and pre&#8208;diene hemiacetal 21 (or 26), respectively, were identified in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus flavipes. A flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)&#8208;dependent oxidase FlasF in the flas cluster catalyzes the crucial oxidation to generate diverse aspochalasin monomers, particularly the dienophile 7. The cytochrome P450&#160;enzyme EpiC and short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase enzyme EpiD in the epi cluster collaboratively catalyze the formation of pre&#8208;diene 21 (or 26), which can spontaneously dehydrate to yield diene, leading to the nonenzymatic cascade of [4&#960; + 2&#960;] Diels&#8211;Alder and formal [5&#960; + 2&#960;] cycloaddition reaction to generate meroaspochalasin (mAPO) dimers and trimer progressively. Moreover, the FAD&#8208;dependent oxidase EpiG catalyzes the hydroxylation at the C3 position of the diene as a critical step in the formation of mAPO trimers.








Abstract
Meroaspochalasins (mAPOs) are a group of intricate heteromers comprising two distinct subunits, dienophile aspochalasin, and diene isobenzofuran, of which the biosynthetic mechanism is of great interest yet unrevealed. In this study, two independent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), flas and epi, being responsible for the biosynthesis of aspochalasin B (7) and pre&#8208;diene hemiacetal 21 (or 26), respectively, were identified in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus flavipes. In vivo and in vitro studies proved that a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)&#8208;dependent oxidase FlasF in the flas cluster catalyzes the crucial oxidation to generate diverse aspochalasin monomers, particularly the dienophile 7. Interactive reduction catalyzed by the short&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) FlasG and endogenous NADPH further increases the complexity of this anabolic network. The cytochrome P450 enzyme EpiC and SDR enzyme EpiD in the epi cluster collaboratively catalyze the formation of pre&#8208;diene 21 (or 26), which can spontaneously dehydrate to yield a diene, leading to the nonenzymatic cascade of [4&#960; + 2&#960;] Diels&#8211;Alder and formal [5&#960; + 2&#960;] cycloaddition reaction to generate mAPO dimers and trimer progressively. Moreover, the FAD&#8208;dependent oxidase EpiG catalyzes the hydroxylation at the C3 position of the diene as a critical step in the formation of mAPO trimers.

In vivo and in vitro studies proved that a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidase FlasF in the &lt;i&gt;flas&lt;/i&gt; cluster catalyzes the crucial oxidation to generate diverse aspochalasin monomers, particularly the dienophile &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;. Interactive reduction catalyzed by the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) FlasG and endogenous NADPH further increases the complexity of this anabolic network. The cytochrome P450 enzyme EpiC and SDR enzyme EpiD in the &lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt; cluster collaboratively catalyze the formation of pre-diene &lt;b&gt;21&lt;/b&gt; (or &lt;b&gt;26&lt;/b&gt;), which can spontaneously dehydrate to yield a diene, leading to the nonenzymatic cascade of [4&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; + 2&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;] Diels&#8211;Alder and formal [5&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; + 2&#960;] cycloaddition reaction to generate mAPO dimers and trimer progressively. Moreover, the FAD-dependent oxidase EpiG catalyzes the hydroxylation at the C3 position of the diene as a critical step in the formation of mAPO trimers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interweaved Nanofiber Anode Coating Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework helical nanofibers obtained through the assembly of non&#8208;linear oxalyldihydrazide unit and rigid Cu3 unit has been successfully fabricated into interweaved porous anode coating for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
High&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;metal batteries call for unique interfacial structures of anode with interfacial compatibility, facilitated lithium insertion/extraction and dendrite suppression properties to meet the growing high&#8208;rate demand. Here, we develop an interweaved porous coating based on a kind of covalent organic framework (ODH&#9472;Cu3&#9472;COF) based helical nanofibers through the assembly of non&#8208;linear oxalyldihydrazide unit and rigid Cu3 unit. The interweaved helical nanofibers network with well&#8208;arranged polar groups (i.e., C&#9552;N, &#9472;CO&#9472;NH&#9472;, and pyrazole groups) could serve as nuclei sites to achieve fast Li+ insertion/extraction and dendrite suppression in high&#8208;rate conditions. Benefiting from the advantages of interface design, the resultant ODH&#9472;Cu3&#9472;COF modified anode improves the Coulombic efficiency (97.5%, 120 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and showcases a stable lifespan (1000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cell. Moreover, the high&#8208;rate property of ODH&#9472;Cu3&#9472;COF@Li||LFP full cell presents an excellent cycling stability (900 cycles at 5 C) in commercial carbonate electrolyte. Theoretical calculations reveal that lithiophilic ODH&#9472;Cu3&#9472;COF has high Li affinity to reduce the nucleation barrier and achieve fast desolvation process in an interface to promote the lifespan of high&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Biomimetic Adhesion/Detachment Using Layered Polymers with Light&#8208;Induced Rapid Shape Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geckos achieve rapid adhesion and detachment through their hierarchically structured toe pads. Inspired by this, we developed a crosslinked polymer film with a nanoscale layered structure that undergoes high&#8208;speed, reversible expansion, and contraction under UV light. This allows remote&#8208;controlled adhesion switching, enabling rapid object pick&#8208;up and release. This work offers insights into smart adhesives for soft robotics and object transport.








Abstract
Geckos achieve rapid and efficient adhesion and detachment on various surfaces within milliseconds due to the hierarchically structured fibrillar architecture of their toe pads. Extensive research has focused on developing adhesive materials that mimic these micro&#8208;nano structures. However, no conventional adhesives have matched the performance of their natural counterparts, which are both non&#8208;degrading and self&#8208;cleaning. Here, we develop a chemically crosslinked polymer film with a nanoscale layered structure that exhibits high&#8208;speed switching of&#160;mechanical&#160;motions (expansion and contraction) in equation both forward and reverse directions through controlled ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Under UV light on/off switching, the film shows reversable shape changes in the direction perpendicular to the molecular alignment. These photoresponsive molecular movements in the film is demonstrated for remote control in a smart adhesion system with rapid responsiveness and high reproducibility. The films respond to UV light to release picked&#8208;up objects and immediately regain their adhesion when the UV light ceases. Additionally, we propose the working principles and mechanisms of these reusable adhesive films, providing new insights into the development of smart soft materials. The material's rapid deformation, high responsiveness, and flexibility make it a promising candidate for light&#8208;controlled object transport and remote&#8208;controlled robotics.

         <title>Stabilizing Surface Lattice On&#8722; (0&#160;&lt;&#160;n&#160;&lt;&#160;2) for Long&#8208;Term Durability of LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs spinel and RS phases on the surface of LCO cathodes (named S&#8208;LCO and R&#8208;LCO). The spinel phase of S&#8208;LCO degrades during long&#8208;term cycling due to lattice On&#8722; (0&#160;&lt;&#160;n&#160;&lt;&#160;2) loss, while the RS phase of R&#8208;LCO remains stable due to its higher lattice On&#8722; migration barriers. This study clarifies the mechanism of enhancing lattice On&#8722; stability via phase tailoring, providing a basis for designing advanced LCO cathodes.








Abstract
The instability of surface lattice On&#8722; (0&#160;&lt;&#160;n&#160;&lt;&#160;2) in charged LiCoO&#8322; (LCO) limits its long&#8208;term cycling stability beyond 4.55&#160;V versus Li/Li&#8314;. Herein, the spinel and rock&#8208;salt (RS) phases are constructed on LCO surface to stabilize lattice On&#8722;, namely S&#8208;LCO and R&#8208;LCO, respectively. Upon long&#8208;term cycling at 4.6&#160;V, the loss of lattice On&#8722; leads to a progressive deterioration of surface spinel phase, which ultimately transforms into a strong Li+&#8208;blocking phase. In contrast, for R&#8208;LCO, the surface lattice On&#8722; in the RS phase remains stable in long&#8208;term cycles. Theoretical calculations reveal that the migration barriers of lattice On&#8722; are significantly higher in the RS phase than in the spinel phase. Due to the stabilized surface lattice On&#8722;, the R&#8208;LCO||Li cell shows an impressive capacity retention of 78.6% after 1000 cycles at 4.6&#160;V (at 1C rate) and superior floating charge durability at 45 &#176;C. This study highlights the importance of surface structure tailoring in developing advanced LCO cathodes.

         <title>Biphenylene Coordination and Ring&#8208;Opening by Alkali&#8208;Metal Nickelates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aryl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal (Li, Na, and K) nickelates that coordinate biphenylene in a &#951;4&#8208;motif have been prepared and structurally characterized. These low&#8208;valent heterobimetallic complexes undergo ring&#8208;opening and oxidative addition of the central C&#9472;C bond of biphenylene, which is highly dependent on the identity of the alkali&#8208;metal and carbanionic scaffold.








Abstract
The pre&#8208;coordination of substrates to heterobimetallic complexes plays a key role in facilitating challenging bond activations and catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a family of low&#8208;valent phenyl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal nickelates containing a &#951;4&#8208;coordinated biphenylene ligand and demonstrate how the coordination and solvation preferences of the alkali&#8208;metal cation (Li, Na, or K) influence the rate of C&#9472;C bond oxidative addition at nickel through combined structural, spectroscopic and computational studies. The rate of C&#9472;C bond cleavage can be further manipulated by replacing the two phenyl&#8208;carbanionic ligands with a cyclic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl scaffold, which affords thermally stable and symmetric spirocyclic nickelates upon ring&#8208;opening.

&lt;p&gt;The pre-coordination of substrates to heterobimetallic complexes plays a key role in facilitating challenging bond activations and catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a family of low-valent phenyl-alkali-metal nickelates containing a &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-coordinated biphenylene ligand and demonstrate how the coordination and solvation preferences of the alkali-metal cation (Li, Na, or K) influence the rate of C&#9472;C bond oxidative addition at nickel through combined structural, spectroscopic and computational studies. The rate of C&#9472;C bond cleavage can be further manipulated by replacing the two phenyl-carbanionic ligands with a cyclic 2,2&#8242;-biphenyl scaffold, which affords thermally stable and symmetric spirocyclic nickelates upon ring-opening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perovskite Homojunction Solar Cells by Buried Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite p&#8211;n homojunction is constructed via a simple perovskite buried interface engineering. Thanks to the driven force induced by the homojunction, charge carriers are efficiently extracted, and the corresponding perovskite homojunction solar cell achieves a champion efficiency of 25.0%.








Abstract
Constructing a strong p&#8211;n junction is an effective strategy to drive the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and boost the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, forming p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconductors in perovskites is not as straightforward as in archetypal Si by doping electron&#8208;accepting and electron&#8208;donating elements. Here, we observe the transition of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type characteristics in a perovskite layer via buried interface engineering. The perfluorinated copper phthalocyanine (F16CuPc) molecules with strong electronegativity are employed to modify the NiOx/Me&#8208;2PACz substrate, which not only facilitates the crystallization of the perovskite, but also induces the formation of p&#8208;type perovskite at its buried interface. We observe a gradual shift of the Fermi level from near valence band at the perovskite buried interface to near conduction band at the perovskite top surface, manifesting the transition from p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type within the monolithic perovskite layer. Such a p&#8211;n homojunction provides an extra electric field for accelerating charge carrier transportation, and thus enhances the device photovoltaic performance. The F16CuPc induced perovskite homojunction solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 25.0% and it retained over 80% of its initial efficiency for more than 1100&#160;h. We believe that the perovskite homojunction strategy will also pave the way for other perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Based Galvanic Potentiometric Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Serotonin Signaling under Psychosocial Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psychosocial stress, a pervasive factor in mental health disorders, is tightly linked to serotonin (5&#8208;HT) dysregulation. Real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of 5&#8208;HT in vivo is challenged by interference from Vitamin C (Vc) and biofouling, requiring invasive pretreatments. We present a self&#8208;powered aptamer&#8208;engineered galvanic sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) that integrates phosphorothioate aptamers with a redox potentiometric mechanism, achieving 21.5&#8208;fold higher selectivity and 98.3&#8208;fold enhanced sensitivity against Vc over conventional sensors, while resisting electrochemical biofouling. The aptGRP5&#8208;HT operates in complex biological environments without pretreatment, enabling direct monitoring in a rodent psychosocial stress model. Using this tool, we uncover a neurochemical signature of social hierarchy: high&#8208;ranking mice exhibit elevated 5&#8208;HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with region&#8208;specific correlations to neuronal activity&#8208;reduced spontaneous firing in the mPFC and increased activity in the DRN. This work resolves long&#8208;standing challenges in neurochemical sensing and establishes aptGRP5&#8208;HT as a transformative platform for probing brain function and stress&#8208;related disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Theranostic Materials and Their Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound&#8208;activated therapeutic and diagnostic materials exhibit superior imaging capabilities, efficient drug delivery and release, and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, providing for clinical diagnostics and therapy. This review summarizes recent advancements in the design, performance, and optimization of ultrasound&#8208;mediated molecular/nanosystems for diverse biomedical applications. Furthermore, the review identifies existing challenges and outlines potential future directions to accelerate their clinical translation.








Abstract
Ultrasound (US) is a promising external excitation modality for bioapplications, offering significant advantages over X&#8208;rays or lasers due to its low cost, high biosafety, and ideal tissue penetration depth. US&#8208;activated theranostic materials, comprising organic, inorganic, and hybrid&#8208;based compounds, hold particular value in synergistic cancer therapeutic and diagnostic applications. These materials exhibit excellent imaging properties, high drug delivery and release efficiency, and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, making them suitable for clinical diagnostic imaging and therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes recent research on the design, performance, and optimization of US&#8208;mediated molecules/nanosystems for a wide range of biomedical applications. Additionally, the multifunctional use of these sonosensitizers in imaging, drug delivery, and sonodynamic therapy, especially in combination with other treatments, could pave the way for innovative strategies in disease therapy. Finally, an overview of this field's challenges and potential future directions is provided, highlighting pathways to promote clinical translation and application.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Reactivity in Dense Methane&#8208;Nitrogen Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CH4 and N2 are abundant molecules in our solar system and are the primary constituents of Titan's atmosphere. Under extreme pressures and temperatures within a diamond anvil cell, CH4 and N2 are demonstrated to react to form a range of compounds, dependent on the conditions and initial concentrations. This provides valuable insight into the complexity of the C&#8722;N&#8722;H ternary system under planetary conditions.







Abstract
Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen are among the most abundant elements in the solar system, and our understanding of their interactions is fundamental to prebiotic chemistry. CH4 and N2 are the simplest archetypical molecules formed by these elements and are both markedly stable under extremes of pressure. Through a series of diamond anvil cell experiments supported by density functional theory calculations, we observe diverse compound formation and reactivity in the CH4&#8208;N2 binary system at high pressure. Above 7&#8197;GPa two concentration&#8208;dependent molecular compounds emerge, (CH4)5N2 and (CH4)7(N2)8, held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Strikingly, further compression at room temperature irreversibly breaks the N2 triple bond, inducing the dissociation of CH4 above 140&#8197;GPa, with the near&#8208;quenched samples revealing distinct spectroscopic signatures of strong covalently bonded C&#8722;N&#8722;H networks. High temperatures vastly reduce the required pressure to promote the reactivity between CH4 and N2, with NH3 forming together with longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons at 14&#8197;GPa and 670&#8197;K, further decomposing into powdered diamond when temperatures exceed 1200&#8197;K. These results exemplify how pressure&#8208;driven chemistry can cause unexpected complexity in the most simple molecular precursors.

         <title>Achieving Spectral Narrowing by Strengthening the Soliton&#8208;Like Characteristics through Peripheral Group Substitution in Aromatic Heterocyclic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soliton&#8208;like electronic structure features of compound 2AcPh&#8208;PhF are enhanced by introducing peripheral substituted groups on the parent 2AcPh, which is considered to be the intrinsic reason for its narrowed emission spectra. A sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on 2AcPh&#8208;PhF has achieved an electroluminescence spectrum as narrow as 25&#160;nm and an external quantum efficiency of up to 29.17%.








Abstract
The effect of substituents on the spectral behavior of aromatic heterocyclic systems is a significant yet highly complex issue. Inspired by cyanine dyes, it was found that emission spectrum narrowing can be realized by regulating the terminal substituents to enhance the soliton&#8208;like characteristics of emitters. Herein, compared to the parent compound 2AcPh (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, FWHM&#160;=&#160;0.124&#160;eV), the introduction of fluorobenzene&#8208;group substituents in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF narrows the emission spectral FWHM to 0.108&#160;eV. Single crystal structures reveal more homogeneous carbon&#8211;carbon bond lengths in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF compared to 2AcPh. Theoretical calculations show that the charge magnitudes on carbon atoms of 2AcPh&#8208;PhF also become homogenized, but the charges on adjacent carbon atoms are opposite. These results suggest that the soliton&#8208;like electronic structural characteristics in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF are enhanced after introducing peripheral substituents, which is considered to be the reason for the narrower emission spectrum of 2AcPh&#8208;PhF. The sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on 2AcPh&#8208;PhF demonstrated a maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.17% and a small electroluminescent spectral FWHM of 25&#160;nm.

&lt;p&gt;The soliton-like electronic structure features of compound 2AcPh-PhF are enhanced by introducing peripheral substituted groups on the parent 2AcPh, which is considered to be the intrinsic reason for its narrowed emission spectra. A sky-blue organic light-emitting diode based on 2AcPh-PhF has achieved an electroluminescence spectrum as narrow as 25&#160;nm and an external quantum efficiency of up to 29.17%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of substituents on the spectral behavior of aromatic heterocyclic systems is a significant yet highly complex issue. Inspired by cyanine dyes, it was found that emission spectrum narrowing can be realized by regulating the terminal substituents to enhance the soliton-like characteristics of emitters. Herein, compared to the parent compound 2AcPh (full-width at half-maximum, FWHM&#160;=&#160;0.124&#160;eV), the introduction of fluorobenzene-group substituents in 2AcPh-PhF narrows the emission spectral FWHM to 0.108&#160;eV. Single crystal structures reveal more homogeneous carbon&#8211;carbon bond lengths in 2AcPh-PhF compared to 2AcPh. Theoretical calculations show that the charge magnitudes on carbon atoms of 2AcPh-PhF also become homogenized, but the charges on adjacent carbon atoms are opposite. These results suggest that the soliton-like electronic structural characteristics in 2AcPh-PhF are enhanced after introducing peripheral substituents, which is considered to be the reason for the narrower emission spectrum of 2AcPh-PhF. The sky-blue organic light-emitting diode devices based on 2AcPh-PhF demonstrated a maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.17% and a small electroluminescent spectral FWHM of 25&#160;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Acceptors with a Nonaromatic Thianthrene Central Core for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept central core of nonaromatic thianthrene is explored for the first time, affording an exotic but structurally tailorable molecular platform for NFAs design.








Abstract
Despite the great role in determining molecular packings and organic photovoltaic outcomes, very rare candidates could be employed as central cores in current high&#8208;performance acceptors except diimide&#8208;based moieties. Herein, a new type of central core of nonaromatic thianthrene is explored firstly, affording an exotic but structurally tailorable molecular platform for acceptor design. A unique puckered rather than planar conformation of central core is adopted, caused by the 4n &#960;e&#8722; feature, great ring strain and largely the insufficient p&#8211;&#960; orbital overlap of lone pair on sulfur of thianthrene and coterminous benzene planes. As a result, the absorption of thianthrene&#8208;based acceptors (CS1, CS2, and CS3) shows unexpected blue shift comparing to the phenazine&#8208;based counterpart (CH20), regardless of the intrinsically strong electron&#8208;donating characteristic of low valence sulfur atoms. Even so, the desired molecular packing and fibrillary film morphology, assisted by the suitable chlorination on thianthrene, still contribute to the best device efficiency of 19.0% based on D18:CS2 blends. Such novel work renders an underdeveloped NFA platform with the potentials for achieving PCE of over 20%.

         <title>B &#8592; N Lewis Pair Fusion of N,N&#8208;Diaryldihydrophenazines: Effect on Structural, Electronic, and Emissive Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#9472;N Lewis pair fusion of N,N&#8208;dipyridyldihydrophenazine and its benzofused homologs results in steric constraints that enforce a bent structure in both the ground and excited states, reduces the antiaromatic character of the central dihydropyrazine heterocycle and promotes a quinoidal resonance structure, bathochromically shifts the absorption and emission bands, and induces aggregation induced emission enhancement.








Abstract
Doping of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with boron and/or nitrogen is emerging as a powerful tool to tailor the electronic structure and photophysical properties. As N&#8208;doped analogues of anthracene, N,N&#8208;dihydrophenazines play important roles as redox mediators, battery materials, luminophores, and photoredox catalysts. Although benzannulation has been used successfully as a structural constraint to control the excited state properties, fusion of the N&#8208;aryl groups to the phenazine backbone has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the first examples of dihydrophenazines, in which the N&#8208;aryl groups are fused to the phenazine backbone via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation. This results in structural rigidification, locking the molecules in a bent conformation, while also modulating the electronic structure through molecular polarization. B&#9472;N fusion in BNPz1&#8722;BNPz3 induces a quinoid resonance structure with significant C&#9472;N(py) double bond character and reduces the antiaromatic character of the central pyrazine ring. Borylation also lowers the HOMO/LUMO (highest occupied/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energies and engenders bathochromic shifts in the emission. Further rigidification in the solid state gives rise to enhanced emission quantum yields, consistent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) observed upon water addition to solutions in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The demonstrated structural control and fine&#8208;tuning of optoelectronic properties are of great significance to potential applications as emissive materials and in photocatalysis.

         <title>Proximal and Remote Hydrocarboxylation of Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide Enabled by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of carbon dioxide and alkenes as feedstocks for the production of carboxylic acids holds great significance in sustainable chemistry. Herein, we introduce a simple and unifying nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical hydrocarboxylation for both functionalized and unactivated alkenes at proximal and remote sites. Our preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that a radical Ni&#8208;HAT is in operation for this hydrocarboxylation process.








Abstract
The utilization of carbon dioxide and alkenes as feedstocks for the synthesis of carboxylic acids holds great significance in the realm of sustainable chemistry. Nonetheless, achieving selective C&#9472;H bond carboxylation of alkenes with broad applicability has long been a challenging task. Herein, we present a straightforward and unifying approach for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;carboxylic acids through nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical hydrocarboxylation of both functionalized and unactivated, simple alkenes, at proximal and remote sites. Notably, this operationally simple catalytic reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, having excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities, and is suitable for late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic investigations showed that a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (Ni&#8208;HAT) pathway is in operation, accounting for the site&#8208;selective hydrocarboxylation protocol for various alkene substrates.

Abstract
Following on our report of the first coordination complex between a noble&#8208;gas compound and a crown ether, (CH2CH2O)5XeO3, the reactions and structures of XeO3 complexes with 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 were investigated. The reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with XeO3 in dilute aqueous HF solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, whereas reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with moist solid XeO3 in acetone solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O complexes are air&#8208;stable and shock&#8208;insensitive, whereas [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF is a treacherous, shock&#8208;sensitive detonator. Low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystal structures show that XeO3 is coordinated to the crown ether and H2O through short Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O contacts. Mappings of the XeO3 Hirshfeld surfaces onto 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O reveal regions of negative electrostatic potential (EP) on the oxygen atoms of the crown ethers and regions of high positive EP on the Xe(VI) atom of XeO3 that are consistent with &#963;&#8208;hole bonds. The calculated gas&#8208;phase geometries, Wiberg bond valences and indices, and empirical bond valences corroborate the descriptions of the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;

&lt;p&gt;Following on our report of the first coordination complex between a noble-gas compound and a crown ether, (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the reactions and structures of XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complexes with 12-crown-4 and 18-crown-6 were investigated. The reactions of 12-crown-4 and 18-crown-6 with XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in dilute aqueous HF solutions yielded (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, whereas reactions of 12-crown-4 and 18-crown-6 with moist solid XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in acetone solutions yielded (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O complexes are air-stable and shock-insensitive, whereas [(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF is a treacherous, shock-sensitive detonator. Low-temperature X-ray crystal structures show that XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is coordinated to the crown ether and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O through short Xe-&#8201;-&#8201;-O contacts. Mappings of the XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Hirshfeld surfaces onto 12-crown-4 and 18-crown-6 in (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reveal regions of negative electrostatic potential (EP) on the oxygen atoms of the crown ethers and regions of high positive EP on the Xe(VI) atom of XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that are consistent with &#963;-hole bonds. The calculated gas-phase geometries, Wiberg bond valences and indices, and empirical bond valences corroborate the descriptions of the shortest Xe-&#8201;-&#8201;-

 contacts as &#963;-hole bonds. The 12-crown-4, 15-crown-5, and 18-crown-6 complexes of XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are also compared with the X-ray crystal structures and calculated gas-phase structures of their SbF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Carbonized Pd Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Supported on Lignin&#8208;Functionalized Phenolic Resin for Potent Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Lignin&#8208;Derived Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;functionalized lignin&#8208;based phenolic resin with a nano&#8208;chain&#8208;like structure was produced via a non&#8208;carbonation strategy with lignin and NH3&#183;H2O. This structure provides abundant &#8208;NH2 groups, enabling N coordination with Pd sites. Such interactions stabilize the Pd sites and optimize their catalytic environment, enhancing aldehyde adsorption and significantly improving the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic transfer hydrogenation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) depend significantly on their support properties, and organic polymers have emerged as promising candidates due to their tunable physicochemical properties and diverse functional groups. However, the high&#8208;temperature carbonization commonly required for conventional organic polymer&#8208;supported SAC fabrication often leads to the loss of these functional groups, thus weakening metal&#8208;support interactions and catalytic performance accordingly. Herein, we report a sustainable strategy to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;functionalized lignin&#8208;based phenolic resin (N&#8208;LPR) supports for stabilizing atomically dispersed palladium (Pd) without carbonization. Using ammonia solution (NH3&#183;H2O) as both the nitrogen source and catalyst, high molecular weight lignin fractions (L3) were transformed into N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% supports with a unique nano&#8208;chain&#8208;like structure, high surface area, and abundant amine groups, which can directly anchor Pd sites under room temperature. The resulting Pd@N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% catalyst achieved approximately 100% vanillin conversion and 97.91% selectivity for 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol at 80&#160;&#176;C with excellent cycle stability and adaptability to lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes, benefiting from the stable Pd&#8208;N coordination and the good adsorption capacity provided by the N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% support. Consequently, this work not only demonstrates a straightforward non&#8208;carbonation strategy to prepare lignin&#8208;based SACs for potent biomass&#8208;derived chemical transformations but also provides a novel avenue for the application of conventional multifunctional organic polymers as support for SACs.

         <title>Synergy Between Weak Solvent and Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enables High&#8208;Rate and Temperature&#8208;Resilient Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate and wide&#8208;temperature performance of graphite&#8208;based potassium ion batteries (PIBs) are limited by slow reaction kinetics at the interphases and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability. In this work, we present a synergistic effect of the electrolyte and SEI, which is achieved through carefully manipulating of the sulfite solvent.








Abstract
The rate and wide&#8208;temperature performance of graphite&#8208;based potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are limited by slow reaction kinetics at the interphases and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability. Herein, we strategically designed weak solvating electrolytes (WSEs) to construct an efficient solvated K+ desolvation with K2SO3&#8208;rich SEI and achieve fast reaction kinetics at the electrode interface through the synergy between the SEI and the WSE. As a result of the beneficial fast reaction kinetics and stability of the electrode interface, the graphite anode shows high levels of rate performance and cycling stability, with a capacity of 249.6 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and 96.6% capacity retention after 1600 cycles. Moreover, assembled potassiated graphite (KC8)||Prussian blue nanoparticles (K&#8208;PBNPs) cells in our designed electrolyte show high&#8208;rate performance (63.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1500&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and over wide operating temperature range (&gt;99% Coulombic efficiency for over 1000 cycles and 200 cycles at &#8722;20&#176;C and 80&#176;C, respectively). Impressively, the pouch cell shows long&#8208;term stability for 2400 cycles at 500&#160;mAg&#8722;1. This work bridges a longstanding gap, elucidating the synergy between the SEI components and WSEs, leading to fast&#8208;charging&#160;and temperature&#8208;resilient PIBs.

         <title>Antimicrobial Peptide&#8208;Peptoid Macrocycles from the Polymyxin B2 Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We optimized mixed peptide&#8208;peptoid sequences for molecular similarity to the macrocyclic lipopeptide antibiotic polymyxin B2 (PMB2) using a genetic algorithm. Synthesis and testing of top&#8208;scoring compounds allowed us to identify new macrocycles with similar antimicrobial activity and reduced toxicity compared to PMB2. Our approach might be generally useful to explore the chemical space of macrocyclic natural products.








Abstract
Macrocycles have emerged as important new modalities in drug discovery. In the context of addressing the global threat of antimicrobial resistance, here we used a genetic algorithm as a computational tool to evolve peptide&#8208;peptoid macrocycles to resemble polymyxin B2 (PMB2), a macrocyclic lipopeptide natural product used as last resort antibiotic. Synthesis and testing of 41 PMB2 analogs revealed several peptide&#8208;peptoid macrocycles showing strong, although salt sensitive, activity against Escherichia coli and multidrug&#8208;resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, high serum stability, and lower toxicity to kidney cells compared to PMB2. These macrocycles resembled PMB2 in terms of outer membrane permeabilization, inner membrane depolarization, lipopolysaccharide binding, and loss of activity when linearized, but, unlike PMB2, induced aggregation of intracellular contents, an effect was reported for other antimicrobial peptoids. These experiments exemplify a combined computational and experimental approach which might be generally useful to explore the chemical space of macrocyclic peptide natural products.

         <title>An Enzymatic Platform for Asymmetric Synthesis of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral silanols are important synthetic targets and have garnered increasing attention in the materials and pharmaceutical industries over recent decades. A promising approach for their efficient synthesis is asymmetric silane oxidation. While chemists have developed several transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed systems for asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of silanes, no biocatalytic methods have been available for enantioselective synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic compounds, including chiral silanols. Here, we present an enzymatic platform for the asymmetric aerobic mono&#8208;oxidation of dihydrosilanes using an engineered P450BM3 enzyme. Through six iterative rounds of directed evolution, we identified the optimal evolved variant, ASOx&#8208;6, which exhibits a 54&#8208;fold improvement in kcat/KM compared with the wild&#8208;type enzyme. Moreover, a variety of aryl&#8208;alkyl substituted dihydrosilanes are accepted by ASOx&#8208;6, including those bearing heteroaromatic rings. Finally, mechanistic insights obtained from kinetic isotope experiments and computational studies further elucidate the nature of this biocatalytic transformation.</dc:description>

While chemists have developed several transition-metal-catalyzed systems for asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of silanes, no biocatalytic methods have been available for enantioselective synthesis of Si-stereogenic compounds, including chiral silanols. Here, we present an enzymatic platform for the asymmetric aerobic mono-oxidation of dihydrosilanes using an engineered P450BM3 enzyme. Through six iterative rounds of directed evolution, we identified the optimal evolved variant, ASOx-6, which exhibits a 54-fold improvement in kcat/KM compared with the wild-type enzyme.

         <title>A Capping&#8208;assisted Strategy for Synthesis of Glass&#8208;like Carboxylate&#8208;based Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct preparation of glass&#8208;like carboxylate&#8208;based coordination polymers (CPs) possessing continuous internal structure and transparency is challenging due to the lack of control on coordination kinetics and subsequently the range of order. Herein, a capping&#8208;assisted strategy was presented to control the molecular assembly during the metal&#8208;ligand coordination in the solution and to inhibit the long&#8208;range of order hence building&#160;glass&#8208;like&#160;CPs (g&#8208;CPs) mimicking the polymerization process. 1,3,5&#8208;benzene tricarboxylate (BTC) ligand was used to connect the copper cations (Cu2+) into metal&#8208;organic complexes of different Cu: BTC ratios (metal&#8208;organic pool) in presence of an excess of triethyl amine as a capping agent. Concentrating the Cu&#8208;BTC complexes and further drying under mild conditions induced the decapping process which triggered the random crosslinking between the free carboxylate and Cu2+&#160;to form a boundary&#8208;free continuous internal structure. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;BTC g&#8208;CP exhibited an approximately similar fine structure like its crystalline counterpart&#160;(HKUST&#8208;1), which facilitated solvent and thermal&#8208;induced crystallization. Due to the internal structure continuity, the g&#8208;CP possesses ceramic&#8208;like hardness and wear resistance and plastic&#8208;like resilience. This capping&#8208;assisted strategy has been successfully extended to Ni&#8208;BTC and Fe&#8208;BTC systems under mild conditions and thus presenting a general method for the formation of glass&#8208;like carboxylate&#8208;based CPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Lithium Cations Catalyze Biomimetic Aerobic Oxygenation via Short&#8208;Range Electrostatic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes often involve short&#8208;range electrostatic interactions in the deliberate microenvironment for accelerating the catalysis. Comparatively, electrostatic interactions from ions in solutions are mostly shielded by solvent or counter&#8208;ion shells, creating negligible catalytic effects. Herein, we discovered that the interfacial Li+ cations accumulated on electrodes catalyze the selective water&#8208;involved O2 electro&#8208;reduction into peroxide anion (OOH&#8208;), forming an active side&#8208;on Li+&#8208;OOH&#8208; complex via short&#8208;range electrostatic interaction. This complex reduces the O2 reduction energy barrier and increases the nucleophilicity, expediting the aerobic oxygenation of ketones. Aside from trapping active intermediates, Li+ cations also attract the excessive water dipoles to prevent from quenching the active Li+&#8208;OOH&#8208; complex. By using probe&#8208;assisted quantitative methods, we demonstrated the unique under&#8208;coordinative characteristics of interfacial Li+ for interacting with reaction intermediates, and the effective concentration of under&#8208;coordinative Li+ on the interface is an order of magnitude higher than in the bulk solution. These analyses provide essential evidences about the intrinsic difference between bulk ions and interfacial ions toward catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Short Lifetime Radical Metal Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal clusters, an emerging class of scintillator materials, have attracted much attention owing to their inherently high X&#8208;ray absorption, mild synthesis conditions, low toxicity, strong luminescence, and large Stokes shift. However, the decay lifetime of metal clusters is usually on the order of microseconds, which is unfavorable for safety inspection, nondestructive testing, and medical imaging. Here, the open&#8208;shell luminescent radical ligand was used to construct the first radical cluster scintillator Cu2I2(L)4. The spin&#8208;allowed doublet emission of Cu2I2(L)4 theoretically enabled 100% exciton utilization and exhibited a short radiation decay lifetime on the nanosecond scale. Cu2I2(L)4 can be fabricated into a flexible scintillator screen for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a high resolution of 30.7 LP mm&#8208;1. More importantly, the Cu2I2(L)4 scintillator screen has no residual images during X&#8208;ray imaging. This work reports the first luminescent metal cluster with a radical ligand and presents a new strategy for constructing short lifetime X&#8208;ray scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Spin&#8208;Center Shift Enables Activation of Distal Benzylic C&#8211;O and C&#8211;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) is a radical process that commonly involves a 1,2&#8208;radical shift along with the elimination of an adjacent leaving group by a two&#8208;electron ionic movement. The conventional SCS process is largely limited to 1,2&#8208;radical translocation, while a remote SCS event involving 1,n&#8208;radical translocation over a greater distance to enable distal bond functionalization remains largely underexplored. Herein, we report the boryl radical&#8208;promoted distal deoxygenation and deamination of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines, respectively, through a remote SCS event. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom of a benzoate or benzamide. Then, radical translocation took place across the aromatic ring to promote benzylic C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N bond cleavage. The resulting radical intermediate subsequently coupled with various alkenes to afford a wide range of alkylated products. The proposed mechanistic pathway was supported by experimental investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Spherical Nucleic Acids Directed Cryo&#8208;Synthesis of Manganese Nanoagents for Tumor Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzyme&#8208;based theranostic nanotechnologies that can respond to specific tumor pathophysiological parameters hold great promise for tumor diagnostics and effective treatments. However, their clinical translation is hindered by insufficient intracellular availability of essential metal cofactors required for DNAzyme activation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy for fabricating multifunctional DNA&#8208;templated manganese carbonate nanoparticles (DtMnP). The process involves three critical phases: (i) spherical nucleic acid hybrids, DNAzyme functionalized AuNP, serve as scaffolds for spatially controlled Mn2+ deposition through phosphate coordination, initiating heterogeneous nucleation of MnCO3; (ii) rapid liquid nitrogen freezing induces nanoparticle growth along DNA templates; and (iii) lyophilization&#8208;mediated structural stabilization enables convenient long&#8208;term storage. The DtMnP exhibits pH&#8208;responsive dissolution, releasing 90% of Mn2+ within 60 minutes under tumor microenvironment conditions (pH 5.5). The released Mn2+ ion enables dual functionality: (i) Superior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast of MCF&#8208;7 xenograft models with enhanced biosafety, and (ii) Synergistic therapeutic efficacy through DNAzyme&#8208;mediated EGR&#8208;1 gene silencing (60% mRNA downregulation) combined with Mn2+&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions generating cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (45% apoptosis in MCF&#8208;7 cells). The cryo&#8208;encapsulated DtMnP exemplifies a flexible and efficient approach for integrating various functional components into a single nanoparticle for tumor theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohol Activation by Benzodithiolylium for Deoxygenative Alkylation Driven by Photocatalytic Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,3&#8208;benzodithiolylium (BDT) cation was identified as an efficient hydroxyl&#8208;activating reagent for the photocatalytic deoxygenative radical functionalization of alcohols in the absence of any electron transfer process. A series of unprecedented photocatalytic energy transfer&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical coupling reactions of alcohols with bifunctional oxime carbonates have been developed based on the activation by BDT. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical sorting followed by C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond construction facilitate the heteroselective cross&#8208;coupling of two distinct alkyl radicals originating from parallel radical relays. These reactions allow the versatile synthesis of diverse nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules, including amino acid derivatives, imines, nitriles, and pyrrolines, by using ubiquitous alcohols as regiodefined alkyl building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Activating Polydimethylsiloxane&#8208;Modified CrOx/Al2O3 Catalyst for Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic approach is a nature&#8208;driven strategy for designing functional materials to meet the industrial challenges. Here we demonstrate the bio&#8208;inspired discovery of a self&#8208;activating catalyst, with polydimethylsiloxane anchored over the surface of CrOx/Al2O3, exhibiting comparable performance with noble metallic catalysts for acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. In addition, the dynamic movement of polymer chains with high flexibility renders the catalyst to impose proactive perturbation to the undesired coke precursors generated in reaction, analogous to the function of hair&#8208;like cilia on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells, thus avoiding the site&#8208;blocking induced by carbonaceous deposits and sustaining the catalyst stable for 1000 h without any deactivation. This study paves the way to the develop other heterogeneous catalysts with high efficiency and durability via mimicking the innate defense mechanism of natural organism.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelastic with Triclinic&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Phase Transition Boosts Temperature/Pressure Dual On/Off Switchable Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals have gained enormous attention for decades due to their unique ability to manipulate polarization light. However, achieving the fascinating on/off (active/inactive) switchable birefringence under external stimuli in crystals remains a huge challenge, and the stimuli employed have been constrained predominantly to temperature. Here, through H/F substitution, we designed a three&#8208;dimensional hybrid double perovskite ferroelastic [C3H5FNH2]2[(NH4)Fe(CN)6] (1&#8208;F), which undergoes a mmF &#160;ferroelastic transition at 296 K, with the highest possible orientation states of 24 among ferroelastic crystals. Notably, the ferroelastic phase transition of 1&#8208;F can also be triggered by pressure with a low critical pressure of ~0.3 GPa. More importantly, 1&#8208;F shows the unprecedented temperature/pressure dual stimuli induced on/off switching of birefringence between the birefringence&#8208;active state in the anisotropic triclinic ferroelastic P &#160;phase and the birefringence&#8208;inactive state in the isotropic cubic paraelastic Fmm phase during the mmF &#160;ferroelastic transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of dual stimuli&#8208;induced switchable birefringence in crystals. Our work paves a new way for the switching of birefringence and shed light on the further exploration of switchable birefringence in ferroelastics.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy and Dopant Co&#8208;Constructed Active Microregion in Ru&#8208;MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 for Enhanced Acidic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate identification of catalytic active regions is crucial for the rational design and construction of hydrogen evolution catalysts as well as the targeted regulation of their catalytic performance. Herein, the low crystalline&#8208;crystalline hybrid MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 with unsaturated coordination and rich defects is taken as the precursor. Through the Joule heating reaction, the Ru&#8208;doped MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 catalyst is successfully constructed. Building on the traditional view that individual atoms or vacancies act as active sites, this article innovatively proposes the theory that vacancies and doped atoms synergistically construct active microregions, and multiple electron&#8208;rich O atoms within the active microregions jointly serve as hydrogen evolution active sites. Based on X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations, there is a strong electron transfer among Ru atoms, Mo atoms, and O atoms, leading to extensive O atoms with optimized electronic structure in the active microregions. These O atoms exhibit an H* adsorption free energy close to zero, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. This work provides a brand&#8208;new strategy for the design and preparation of electrocatalytic materials and the systematic regulation of the local electronic structure of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligoether Chain Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhancing Transport Pathways and Oxygen Reduction Activity&#160;for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligoethers with various numbers of ethylene oxide (EO) units, known for their flexibility, electronegativity, and hydrophilicity, can be leveraged to construct complex molecular architectures with broad applicability. In this study, we present the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks incorporating oligoethers with EO segments of varying lengths (2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EOs) to explore the role of EO units in modulating the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway for electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. By embedding hydrophilic EO side chains into the hydrophobic COF frameworks, intermolecular interactions are promoted through hydrogen bonding, leading to the self&#8208;assembly and spatial aggregation of these side chains. The high crystallinity of the COFs facilitates orderly stacking of the skeleton, creating hydrophilic nanoscale transport channels that enhance ORR kinetics. Among the synthesized COFs, 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EO1, which contains one EO group, exhibits a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 5820 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and an ORR selectivity of 89.2%. Theoretical calculations and in situ electrocatalytic experiments reveal that the elongation of the EO units significantly alters the electronic structure of carbon atoms adjacent to oxygen atoms, lowering the energy barriers associated with the formation of OOH* intermediates and thus promoting the 2e&#8722; ORR pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Blocking the Operando Formation of Single&#8208;Atom Spectators by Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aside from activity and selectivity, catalyst stability is a key focus in heterogeneous catalysis research. While sintering of metal species has been considered the primary cause for deactivation of metal catalysts, our study reveals that the loss of activity at low reaction temperatures in CeO2&#8208;supported Pt (Pt/CeO2) catalysts in propane oxidation is due to the dispersion of Pt ensemble sites (nanoclusters) and their subsequent operando conversion into Pt single atoms under reaction conditions. These Pt single&#8208;atom species exhibit low reactivity and act as spectators in the low&#8208;temperature reaction region. To address this issue, we engineered the surface of CeO2 by introducing NbOx, which does not directly interact with Pt. Instead, NbOx blocks the strong binding sites for Pt on CeO2, thereby preventing Pt redispersion/fragmentation and preserving reactive Pt ensembles. This strategy led to a remarkable 37&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate compared to the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Our findings emphasize the importance of suppressing the formation of noble metal single&#8208;atom spectators through innovative surface engineering strategy. These mechanistic insights not only advance the understanding of materials science of Pt/CeO2 but also extend to critical technological fields such as energy conversion systems and environmental remediation technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Catalytic Potential of Facet Heterojunctions in Platinum Alloys for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ensuring high&#8208;quality activity of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) while mitigating the degradation of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts remains challenging. A platinum&#8208;skinned truncated octahedral PtNi alloy with (100)/(111) facet heterostructures is synthesized through a low&#8208;temperature thermally driven etching strategy, demonstrating exceptional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. The heterostructure of the Ptskin&#8208;PtNi(111) facet destabilizes the *OOH intermediate and promotes the preferential O&#8208;O bond cleavage, leading to the optimization of ORR pathway. A linear correlation between the generalized coordination number (CN) and &#916;G*OH demonstrates that the facet hetero&#8208;sites optimize the adsorption of *OH to the theoretically optimal state through ligand and geometric effects. The optimized PNZC&#8208;5A160 catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity (2.97 A mgPt&#8208;1 at 0.9 V vs. RHE) and superior H2&#8208;O2 single PEMFC performance (mass activity (MA) of 0.5 A mgPt&#8208;1 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free; peak power density of 1.42 W cm&#8208;2), exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 targets. After accelerated stress tests, the loss in MA at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free and in potential at 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 is only 8% and 3.7 mV, respectively, due to the enhanced binding of subsurface Pt and Ni to surface Pt atoms through platinum skin, thereby inhibiting the dissolution of Pt and Ni.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Degradation Mechanism of Fluorinated Pollutants Using a Bilayer WO3 Photoanode: Synergistic Role of Holes and Hydroxyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated organic pollutants pose significant environmental and health risks due to the high stability of C&#8208;F bonds, necessitating effective strategies for their degradation. Herein, we present a bilayer WO3 photoelectrode (double&#8208;WO3) incorporating an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hexagonal&#8208;monoclinic heterophase junction for PEC degradation of fluorinated pollutants. The double&#8208;WO3 catalyst achieves a high photocurrent density (4.3 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.2 VRHE) and nearly complete degradation (99.9%) of bisphenol AF (BPAF), 4&#8208;fluorophenol (4&#8208;FP), and pentafluorophenol (PFP), with 99.9% mineralization of PFP. Experimental and transient photocurrent (TPC) analyses confirm that the ETL&#8208;heterophase junction structure enhances electron extraction and surface reaction kinetics while minimizing electron&#8208;hole recombination. In this process, photogenerated h+ excites fluorinated pollutants, enhancing C&#8208;F bond susceptibility to &#8729;OH attack, which facilitates bond cleavage and subsequent oxidation into CO2, H2O, and F&#8208;. This study offers a promising strategy for designing advanced PEC systems and effectively remediating persistent fluorinated contaminants.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral 1&#8208;Aryl Isoquinolines via De Novo Isoquinoline Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral heterobiaryl serves as a core skeleton for bioactive molecules, chiral ligands and organocatalysts. Enantioselective de novo formation of the heteroaromatic ring is one of the most straightforward approaches to access enantioenriched heterobiaryls. Herein, an enantioselective de novo construction of isoquinolines via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is disclosed. This approach is operationally simple, allowing for rapid access to a variety of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 98% yield and 99:1 er). The synthetic application of the current method was demonstrated by functional group transformations and the compatibility with mmol&#8208;scale reaction. The detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step and provided insights into the origin of the enantioselectivity for this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Separation of MnWOx  and NaWSiOx  Phases Boosts Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is an attractive approach for methane transformations, but achieving a satisfactory combination of activity and selectivity remains challenging, even with the promising Mn&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst. Herein, we demonstrate that nanoscale separation of Mn&#8208;based and Na2WO4&#8208;based phases results in a highly efficient catalyst, achieving a remarkable 79% selectivity for C2&#8208;C3 hydrocarbons at a 32% CH4 conversion at 775 oC,&#160;outperforming most previously reported catalysts. Our studies reveal that MnWOx phases with adjustable surface Mn/W ratios and redox activities are more effective for the selective activation of O2, thereby enhancing the OCM of CH4. The assembly of MnWOx and Na2WO4/SiO2 components in nanoscale proximity significantly promotes the formation of C2&#8208;C3 hydrocarbons by suppressing deep oxidation. We propose a bifunctional mechanism involving the transfer of active oxygen species from MnWOx to Na2WO4/SiO2, which induces selective activation and coupling of CH4 on the Na2WO4/SiO2 surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Acridine&#8208;substituted&#8208;centronucleus nonfullerene acceptors enables organic solar cells with over 20% efficiency with low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss</title>

         <dc:description>State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs) often suffer from low open&#8208;circuit voltage due to high non&#8208;radiative recombination losses (&#916;Enr), which for OSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 18% typically exceed 0.200 eV, much higher than those of perovskite/silicon cells. This study introduces a novel approach by incorporating luminescent acridine units into quinoxaline&#8208;based acceptor molecules (AQx&#8208;o&#8208;Ac and AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac) to enhance their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY). This modification improves electroluminescent quantum efficiency (EQEEL), reducing &#916;Enr. Additionally, the acridine substitution promotes molecular aggregation and crystallization, reducing static disorder and improving charge transport. As a result, the PM6:AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac binary OSC achieves a PCE of 18.64% and a &#916;Enr of 0.166 eV, the lowest reported for OSCs with PCEs over 18%. Further, incorporating AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac into a PM6:eC9 ternaryin reducing non&#8208;radiative losses, paving the way for more efficient organic photovoltaics. blend results in a PCE of 20.28%.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes presents a formidable challenge due to inherently complex selectivity control over multiple potential reaction pathways. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled, regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes and silylboranes, achieving unprecedented site&#8208;selectivity using nickel catalysts equipped with distinct phosphine ligands. The use of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, while employing (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine facilitates 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity. This method displays excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and substantial functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ligand choice is crucial for directing the reaction pathway and stabilizing &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;nickel intermediates. Our protocol provides a practical and efficient approach to synthesizing valuable functionalized allylsilanes, which are important in various synthetic applications.</dc:description>

Herein, anodic borohydride oxidation is demonstrated to have great potential for successfully replacing sacrificial metal anodes in a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic counter reaction effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 at inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.







Abstract
An efficient reaction at the counter electrode is of key importance for the success of net oxidative and net reductive electrochemical transformations. For electrooxidative processes, cathodic proton reduction to H2 serves as the benchmark counter reaction. In contrast, net reductive electrochemical transformations have less attractive oxidative counter reactions to choose from and commonly rely on dissolution of a sacrificial anode that effectively results in stoichiometric metal consumption for the processes. In this study, we demonstrate that anodic borohydride oxidation has great potential to successfully replace the use of such sacrificial anodes for a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic transformation effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 using inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycolipid Library Reminiscent of Mycobacterial Cell Wall Motif A and Its Significance by Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of glycolipids reminiscent of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall were synthesized and their supramolecular structures in aqueous acetone were imaged by transmission electron microscopy. The self&#8208;assembled structures are affected by subtle changes in the number of sugar residues, type of glycosidic linkages, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes in the lipid.








Abstract
The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) is distinguished by its unique glycolipid composition, notably mycolyl arabinogalactan, which features Araf, Galf, and mycolic acid. The terminal portion of arabinogalactan (AG) is motif A, a pentaarabinofuranoside characterized by two &#946;&#8208;1,2 linkages and one each of &#945;&#8208;1,5 and &#945;&#8208;1,3 linkages. The C5 positions of motif A are esterified with mycolic acids, further enriched by unusual cyclopropanes. In this study, we synthesized a diverse array of MTb cell wall glycolipids inspired by motif A and explored their self&#8208;assembly behavior using microscopy. This collection of glycolipids includes variations with &#945; or &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2, 3, or 5) Araf linkages in di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and penta&#8208;arabinofuranosides, esterified with saturated, doubly unsaturated, or cyclopropanated long&#8208;chain fatty acids. The TEM analysis of the resulting self&#8208;assemblies revealed that subtle modifications in the anomeric linkages, length of the glycan, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes impacted the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures.

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Mn2+&#8208;Based Scintillation Screens for X&#8208;Ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview introduces the scintillation mechanism and synthesis methods of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) scintillators, and emphatically summarizes the research progress in fabrication strategies of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging.







Abstract
Scintillators play a pivotal role in multiple fields such as medical imaging, radioactive contaminant detection, non&#8208;destructive testing, high&#8208;energy physics and homeland security. However, the traditional inorganic scintillators are faced with the shortcomings of high fabrication cost and low light yield. In recent years, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have become the promising alternatives for their excellent luminescence properties, favorable air and irradiation stability, and low&#8208;cost preparation. Among them, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) have attracted wide attention due to their particular flexible molecular structure design, easy synthesis and low toxicity. This minireview summarizes the latest progress in high performance Mn2+&#8208;Based scintillation screens. Herein, the scintillation mechanism of OIMnHs scintillators is firstly discussed. Then, the different synthesis methods of OIMnHs scintillators are briefly described, including solvent diffusion, cooling crystallization, evaporative crystallization and solid&#8208;state mechanochemical synthesis. After that, the recent strategies of OIMnHs for forming scintillation screens applying to X&#8208;ray imaging are emphatically reviewed, which are growing large single crystals, fabricating to glass or ceramic and blending with polymers. The fabrication progress and applications of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens were introduced and the structure&#8211;property relationship of these screens was discussed. Finally, the challenges of this new scintillator material are summarized, and the potential research directions for future exploration are proposed.

         <title>Fluorescent Artificial Receptor for Dopamine based on Molecular Recognition&#8208;driven Dynamic Covalent Chemistry in a Lipid Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic artificial receptor is introduced that synergically combines molecular recognition with dynamic imine bond formation inside a lipid nanoreactor, triggering a fluorescence ratiometric response. It enables dopamine detection with micromolar sensitivity and at the single&#8208;nanoprobe level, showing remarkable selectivity without interference of competing biogenic amines and multiple biological fluids.







Abstract
Molecular recognition and detection of small bioactive molecules, like neurotransmitters, remain a challenge for chemists, whereas nature found an elegant solution in the form of protein receptors. Here, we introduce a concept of a dynamic artificial receptor that synergically combines molecular recognition with dynamic imine bond formation inside a lipid nanoreactor, inducing a fluorescence response. The designed supramolecular system combines a lipophilic recognition ligand derived from a boronic acid, a fluorescent aldehyde based on push&#8208;pull styryl pyridine and a phenol&#8208;based catalyst. The recognition ligand specifically captures dopamine inside lipid nanodroplets and thus triggers imine bond formation with the aldehyde, producing the emission color change. The rational design of the fluorescent aldehyde, the catalyst, and the recognition ligand allows dramatic acceleration of the imine bond formation required for rapid sensing of dopamine. The nanoprobe enables dopamine detection with micromolar sensitivity and singe&#8208;nanoprobe imaging of dopamine gradients through its robust two&#8208;color ratiometric response. It displays remarkable selectivity without the interference of competing biogenic primary amines and biological media: blood serum, plasma, urine and cell lysate. The proposed concept of a dynamic artificial receptor offers a solution to the long&#8208;standing problem of molecular recognition and sensing of small molecules in complex biological media.

By novel molecular design, a dimerized acceptor (DY&#8208;FBrL) was synthesized. DY&#8208;FBrL&#8208;based rigid devices render an efficiency of 18.75&#8201;% and crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 18.54&#8201;%. A polymerized acceptor (PDY&#8208;FL) was prepared via polymerization of DY&#8208;FBrL. Compared to DY&#8208;FBrL, PDY&#8208;FL&#8208;based rigid devices display a higher COS of 23.45&#8201;% but a lower efficiency of 14.13&#8201;%. Importantly, intrinsically&#8208;stretchable devices based on DY&#8208;FBrL and PDY&#8208;FL exhibit excellent device stretchability.







Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are emerging as promising candidates for powering next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, developing molecular design strategies to achieve both high efficiency and mechanical robustness in IS&#8208;OSCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a novel approach by synthesizing a dimerized electron acceptor (DY&#8208;FBrL) that enables rigid OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.75&#8201;% and a crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 18.54&#8201;%. The enhanced PCE and stretchability of DY&#8208;FBrL&#8208;based devices are attributed to its extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and elongated side chains. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative polymerized acceptor (PDY&#8208;FL), synthesized via the polymerization of DY&#8208;FBrL. While PDY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices exhibit a slightly lower PCE of 14.13&#8201;%, they achieve a significantly higher COS of 23.45&#8201;%, representing one of the highest PCEs reported for polymerized acceptors containing only flexible linkers. Consequently, IS&#8208;OSCs fabricated using DY&#8208;FBrL and PDY&#8208;FL achieve notable PCEs of 14.31&#8201;% and 11.61&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, the device stretchability improves progressively from Y6 (strain at PCE80%=11&#8201;%), to DY&#8208;FBrL (strain at PCE80%=23&#8201;%), and PDY&#8208;FL (strain at PCE80%=31&#8201;%). This study presents a promising molecular design strategy for tailoring electron acceptor structures, offering a new pathway to develop high&#8208;performance IS&#8208;OSCs with enhanced mechanical properties.

Additionally, the device stretchability improves progressively from Y6 (strain at PCE&lt;sub&gt;80%&lt;/sub&gt;=11&#8201;%), to DY-FBrL (strain at PCE&lt;sub&gt;80%&lt;/sub&gt;=23&#8201;%), and PDY-FL (strain at PCE&lt;sub&gt;80%&lt;/sub&gt;=31&#8201;%). This study presents a promising molecular design strategy for tailoring electron acceptor structures, offering a new pathway to develop high-performance IS-OSCs with enhanced mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Design for Dual Circularity: Polyester with Complementary Mechanical and Chemical Recyclability under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual circularity concept was demonstrated to prevent plastic waste accumulation, where rational design paved the way. Apart from fully recovery of mechanical and thermal properties after as many as six repeated mechanical recycling cycles, the polyesters could be closed&#8208;loop chemical recycled via facile, time and energy efficient manners. In case of polymers with dual circularity, it is recommended to proceed with mechanical recycling when we can, switch to chemical recycling when we must.







Abstract
The plastic waste accumulation requires facile yet effective solutions. Currently mechanical recycling typically leads to downcycling, while the environmental footprint of chemical recycling is often unacceptable. Here, we introduce a dual circularity concept, where rational molecular design paves the way for complementary closed&#8208;loop mechanical and chemical recyclability under mild conditions. Very small changes in macromolecular structures, thermal and mechanical properties were observed, after as many as six repeated mechanical recycling cycles, showing that a wide processing window could be the key for closing the mechanical recycling loop. Facile, time and energy efficient closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling into products with identical performance to original ones was also realized, thanks to the abundant free volume and accessible ester&#8208;functionalities. With these design criteria at hand, dual circulation in recyclability can be realized; proceeding with mechanical recycling when we can, and switching to chemical recycling when we must.

         <title>Synergistic Electrode and Electrolyte Polarities Lead to Outstanding Organic Potassium&#8208;based Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the polarities of the organic cathodes and the electrolyte are tuned, the batteries show high&#8208;capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency. For example, under the high polar electrolytes, the PANI||KC8 pouch cells deliver long stability of 2500&#8197;cycles with a high average CE of 99.85&#8201;%, and the PTCDA||KC8 pouch&#8208;cell displays a high capacity of 99.6&#8197;mAh and good stability.







Abstract
Organic materials are promising as battery electrodes due to their flexible design, low cost, and sustainability. Although high electrolyte concentrations are known to suppress organic cathode dissolution, the organic cathode solubility depends on the interplay between the electrode and electrolyte polarities, which remains unexplored. Here, we elucidate the delicate interplay of electrode and electrolyte polarities to achieve stable cycling of organic cathode. Notably, we demonstrate that the solubility of low&#8208;polar organic cathodes initially increases and subsequently decreases in electrolytes with increasing polarity. In contrast, high&#8208;polar organic cathodes display increasing solubility in electrolytes with increasing polarity. When the polarities of the organic cathodes and the electrolyte are tuned, the batteries show high&#8208;capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency. For example, polyaniline||potassiated graphite (KC8) pouch cells deliver 2500&#8197;cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;%. These new insights into low&#8208; and high&#8208;polar organic cathode behavior in electrolytes lay a theoretical foundation for designing new organic battery electrodes and optimizing their electrolyte formulation.

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Enhancement of Energetic Charge Carrier Extraction and Modulation of Local Charge Density to Impact Selectivity in Plasmonic Nanometals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, silver nanometals modified with various sulfhydryl ligands (re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;R) were synthesized via photoreduction. The modified surface effectively extracts and stabilizes excited&#8208;state electrons from plasmonic nanometals. By employing substituents with distinct electron donor/acceptor properties, the surface charge density was systematically tuned, thereby influencing the selectivity between CO2 reduction and H2 evolution.







Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) metals exhibit remarkable light&#8208;absorbing property and unique catalytic activity, attracting significant attention in photocatalysts recently. However, the practical application of plasmonic nanometal is hindered by challenge of energetic electrons extraction and low selectivity. The energetic carriers generated in nanometal under illumination have extremely short lifetimes, leading to rapid energy loss. In this work, silver nanometals modified with five distinct sulfhydryl ligands (re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;R) were synthesized via photoreduction of superlattice precursors. Modified surface efficiently extracts and preserves excited state electrons of plasmonic nanometals. By modulation the local charge density at catalytic active sites through substituents with varying electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, the selectivity of the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction was influenced. The results demonstrated opposite selectivity between methoxy&#8208;modified re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;OCH3 (CO selectivity of 96.73&#8201;%) and amino&#8208;modified re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;NH2 (H2 selectivity of 96.66&#8201;%) despite their similar structures. The changes in excited states and surface contact potentials induced by LSPR were monitored using femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Meanwhile, the detailed discussion of the LSPR mechanism in plasmonic nanometals will serve as valuable references and foundational elements for future research in this area.

         <title>Hierarchical Interface Enabled by a Guest&#8208;Anionic Chemistry for High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology that involves the guest anionic chemistry activated by introducing co&#8208;solute to design a hierarchical interface of zinc anode/electrolyte is presented, where the inner Helmholtz layer on the interface has been reconstructed and derived a robust amorphous&#8208;crystalline SEI, endowing the anode with enhanced reversibility and ultra&#8208;high rate property.







Abstract
The poor reversibility of the zinc anode caused by interfacial side reactions and dendritic growth poses significant constraints on the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a co&#8208;solute, acesulfame potassium, with strongly polar, zincophilic guest anions is introduced into a conventional low&#8208;concentration aqueous electrolyte. This regulation enhances the electrolyte&#8216;s ionic conductivity and accelerates the desolvation process of zinc ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, the introduced acesulfame anions give rise to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface with a hierarchical crystalline&#8208;amorphous bilayer structure that effectively suppresses side reactions and allows for uniform zinc ion diffusion&#8208;deposition. Results show that the zinc anode in the designed electrolyte possesses remarkable reversibility, achieving stable operation under a ultrahigh current density of 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 67.6&#8201;% depth of discharge, surpassing most previous reports. Zn//I2 full cells assembled with this electrolyte exhibit high rate capability (135.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and remarkable lifespan (96.3&#8201;% capacity retention after 40,000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). A large&#8208;sized Zn//I2 pouch cell is also demonstrated, delivering a total capacity of 170&#8197;mAh with 78.8&#8201;% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 3.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, highlighting the potential of the guest&#8208;anionic chemistry in practical applications.

         <title>AA&#8208;Stacked Hydrogen&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for Enhanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a highly&#8208;ordered AA&#8208;stacked hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) as the anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion battery prepared by a scalable alcohol&#8208;thermal method. Such unique architecture enables to increase lithium binding sites and to facilitate lithium rapid transfer through the formed well&#8208;organized pore channels, thereby leading to an excellent reversible capacity, rate performance as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) has been considered a promising electrode material for application in electrochemical energy storage. However, studies on GDY featuring an ordered interlayer stacking are lacking, which is supposed to be another effective way to increase lithium binding sites and diffusion pathways. Herein, we synthesized a hydrogen&#8208;substituted GDY (HsGDY) with a highly&#8208;ordered AA&#8208;stacking structure via a facile alcohol&#8208;thermal method. Such unique architecture enables a rapid lithium transfer through the well&#8208;organized pore channels and endows a stronger adsorption capability to lithium atom as compared to the arbitrarily&#8208;stacked mode. The resultant HsGDY exhibits a reversible capacity of 1040&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 ranking among the most powerful GDY&#8208;based electrode materials, and an excellent rate performance as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability. The successful preparation of gram&#8208;level high&#8208;quality HsGDY products in batches implies the potential for large&#8208;scale lithium&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Aluminadichalcogeniranes and Aluminatrichalcogenetanes: Heavier Analogs of Dioxiranes and Trioxetanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of aluminadiselenirane, aluminaditellurirane, aluminatriselenetane, aluminatritelluretane, and mixed Se/Te aluminatrichalcogenetane have been reported. These species are the first neutral aluminum/chalcogen analogs of dioxiranes and trioxetanes, and they serve as powerful synthons for creating unique aluminum heterocycles.







Abstract
Dioxiranes and their heavier chalcogen analogs have long been recognized as pivotal reagents and intermediates in synthetic chemistry, while trioxetanes have largely remained theoretical constructs. In this work, we present the synthesis of neutral, isoelectronic aluminum/chalcogen analogs of dioxiranes and trioxetanes, specifically aluminadiselenirane, aluminaditellurirane, aluminatriselenetane, aluminatritelluretane, and a mixed Se/Te analog of aluminatrichalcogenetane. These compounds, featuring strained AlCh2 and AlCh3 ring (Ch=Se, Te), exhibit significant polarization between the aluminum and chalcogen components. Reactivity studies have revealed that both aluminadiselenirane and aluminaditellurirane show pronounced ambiphilic behavior when interacting with proximal substrates, undergoing facile ring&#8208;opening (cyclo)additions. Additionally, the coordination chemistry of aluminatriselenetane with a Lewis acid has been documented. These investigations not only broaden the repertoire of unique main group species but also provide access to heterocyclic structures that present synthetic challenges through conventional methods.

We report a lead&#8208;free, vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite Cs2TeCl6, that achieves precise temperature sensing through a novel combination of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) photoluminescence (PL) lifetime modulation and unprecedented fifth&#8208;order phonon anharmonicity. The Eg phonon mode undergoes significant linewidth broadening due to five&#8208;phonon scattering processes, with a distinct nonlinear temperature dependence up to 500&#8197;K.







Abstract
Broad&#8208;temperature optical thermometry necessitates materials with exceptional sensitivity and stability across varied thermal conditions, presenting challenges for conventional systems. Here, we report a lead&#8208;free, vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite Cs2TeCl6, that achieves precise temperature sensing through a novel combination of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) photoluminescence (PL) lifetime modulation and unprecedented fifth&#8208;order phonon anharmonicity. The STEs PL lifetime demonstrates a highly temperature&#8208;sensitive response from 200 to 300&#8197;K, ideal for low&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate thermal sensing. In contrast, the Eg phonon mode undergoes significant linewidth broadening due to five&#8208;phonon scattering processes, with a distinct nonlinear temperature dependence up to 500&#8197;K. This fifth&#8208;order anharmonic effect enhances Raman&#8208;based temperature sensitivity, yielding a specific sensitivity (Sr) of 0.577&#8201;% K&#8211;1 at 330&#8197;K and remaining above 0.5&#8201;% K&#8211;1 at elevated temperatures. This study presents the first evidence of fifth&#8208;order anharmonic effects enhancing Raman&#8208;based temperature sensitivity, establishing Cs2TeCl6 as a versatile candidate for broad&#8208;temperature optical thermometry and opening new avenues for precise non&#8208;contact temperature sensing in advanced technological applications.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar&#8208;Driven Ammonia Coupled to C3&#8208;Dihydroxyacetone Production through Photoelectrochemistry</title>

The PEC integrated system consisting of CuPd/TSSS photocathode and Pd/BiVO4 photoanode is capable of producing ammonia and high value&#8208;added C3&#8208;DHA products from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater and biomass wastes by directly utilizing solar energy, which satisfies the increasing energy demand and reduces the environmental impact.







Abstract
Conversion of solar energy into value&#8208;added chemicals through photoelectrochemistry (PEC) holds great potential for advancing sustainable development but limits by high onset potential which affects energy conversion efficiencies. Herein, we utilized a CuPd cocatalyst&#8208;modified Sb2(S,Se)3 photocathode (CuPd/TSSS) to achieve an ultra&#8208;low onset potential of 0.83 VRHE for photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis. Meanwhile, we achieved unbiased NH3 production by synthesizing major value&#8208;added C3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) through glycerol oxidation on the BiVO4 photoanode with the loading Pd cocatalyst, instead of a traditional solar water oxidation reaction. The PEC integrated system stably produced 11.98&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of NH3 and 201.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 of DHA over 5&#8197;h with ~80&#8201;% faradaic efficiency without applying additional bias. In situ analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed high catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis at the CuPd/TSSS photocathode and enhanced selectivity for DHA at the Pd/BiVO4 photoanode. This design represents a breakthrough in directly utilizing solar energy, nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater, and biomass waste for ammonia and highly value&#8208;added C3 production, which addresses increasing energy demands while decreasing environmental impact.

Meanwhile, alkalescent Na2HPO4 NPs can further consume lactic acid and adenosine (Ado) to relieve two&#8208;tier immunosuppression, realizing &#8220;relaxing brake&#8221; on immunotherapy.







Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy has been widely used clinically, but it is still hindered by weak antitumor immunity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, a kind of simple disodium hydrogen phosphate nanoparticle (Na2HPO4 NP) is prepared to &#8220;accelerate&#8221; tumor immunotherapy by &#8220;increasing throttle&#8221; and &#8220;relaxing brake&#8221; simultaneously. The obtained Na2HPO4 NPs release a large amount of Na+ and HPO42&#8722; ions within tumor cells, thereby activating the caspase 1/GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis pathway to achieve immune activation. Meanwhile, alkalescent Na2HPO4 NPs can further consume lactic acid through acid&#8208;base neutralization, and regulate adenosine (Ado) metabolism via nanomaterial&#8208;induced biocatalytic process to relieve two&#8208;tier immunosuppression. Collectively, Na2HPO4 NPs effectively activate the antitumor immune process in vivo, and dramatically inhibit primary and distal tumor growth. This work will provide unique inspiration and strategy for the regulation of both positive and negative directions in immunotherapy.

         <title>Retrieving the Stability and Practical Performance of Activation&#8208;Unstable Mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Calibrating Acidity Sensing</title>

Stabilize and improve! Mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker&#8208;installation both retrieved the activation&#8208;unstable framework of mesoporous NKM&#8208;809 and produced stabilized MOF derivatives. They established enhanced pyridyl&#8208;site density and mass transfer, and capable in self&#8208;calibrating pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. Extra quenching of emission&#8208;noise further distinguished NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, integrating quality&#8208;self&#8208;monitoring for practical usage.







Abstract
The practical applications of activation&#8208;unstable mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often constrained by their structural instability. However, enhancing their stability could unlock valuable functionalities. Herein, we stabilized the otherwise unstable, post&#8208;activated structure of a novel mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF, NKM&#8208;809, which constructed from a pyridine&#8208;containing amphiprotic linker (PPTB). We applied two strategies: mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker installation. In the mixed&#8208;linker approach, we incorporated an auxiliary linker, TPTB, which resembles PPTB, during synthesis to improve the framework's stability. In the linker installation approach, we introduced a ditopic carboxylate linker (BPDC) into the coordination&#8208;unsaturated sites of NKM&#8208;809. These strategies produced stabilized derivatives, named NKM&#8208;808.X (X=&#967;PPTB) and NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, which exhibit pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence at distinct emission wavelengths. Remarkably, these emissions shift oppositely upon protonation and dissociation, distinguishing them as highly sensitive, self&#8208;calibrating acidity sensors. In NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, an additional quenching of the linker&#8208;emission (419&#8197;nm) minimizes inherent interference, enabling integrated quality and lifespan self&#8208;monitoring. Theoretical calculations identified transitions between (n, &#960;*) and (&#960;, &#960;*) emission states during the sensing process and highlighted the role of a stable mesoporous network in achieving stronger protonation response. These findings showcase the potential of stabilized mesoporous MOFs for practical applications, alongside valuable insights into strategies for optimizing such materials.

         <title>Supramolecular Switching of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation for Orchestrating Enzyme Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple molecule comprising two naphthalene moieties linked by an ethylene glycol derivative was designed to undergo supramolecularly&#8208;regulated liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), offering a unique route to quantitively elucidating molecular&#8208;interaction variations within LLPS. The supramolecularly switched LLPS, along with selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, enables facilely orchestrating enzyme kinetics.







Abstract
Dynamic liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and associated assembly and disassembly of biomolecular condensates play crucial roles in cellular organization and metabolic networks. These processes are often regulated by supramolecular interactions. However, the complex and disordered structures of IDPs, coupled with their rapid conformational fluctuations, pose significant challenges for reconstructing supramolecularly&#8208;regulated dynamic LLPS systems and quantitatively illustrating variations in molecular interactions. Inspired by the structural feature of IDPs that facilitates LLPS, we designed a simplified phase&#8208;separating molecule, Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap, consisting of two naphthalene moieties linked by an ethylene glycol derivative. This compound exhibits LLPS under physiological conditions, forming coacervate microdroplets that undergo multiple cycles of disassembly and reassembly upon stoichiometric addition of Cucurbit[7]uril and Adamantane, respectively, based upon competitive host&#8211;guest interactions. Importantly, such reversible control offers a unique route to quantify entropically dominant nature (&#916;S=14.0&#8197;cal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) within the LLPS process, in which the binding affinity of host&#8211;guest interactions (&#916;G=&#8722;14.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1) surpass that of the LLPS of Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap (&#916;G=&#8722;2.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1), enabling the supramolecular regulation process. The supramolecularly switched LLPS, along with selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, provides a promising platform for either boosting or retarding enzymatic reactions, thereby orchestrating biological enzyme kinetics.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deconstruction of Polyolefins: A Strategy to Up&#8208;cycle Waste Polyethylene to Value&#8208;Added Alkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed method for deconstructing polyethylene into value&#8208;added long&#8208;chain alkenes. The process involves dehydrogenation, introducing 3.38&#8201;% double bonds, followed by cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene using the HG&#8208;II catalyst. This results in 58&#8201;% selective production of dodecene (C12) derivatives, with a 1:0.8 ratio of terminal to internal olefins. The method is effective for post&#8208;consumer polyethylene waste.







Abstract
Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from post&#8208;consumer waste polyolefins is fascinating as well as challenging. Here we report ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed up&#8208;cycling of the polyethylene to long&#8208;chain alkene derivatives. The developed methodology mainly involves two steps i.e., dehydrogenation of polyethylene through hydrogen atom transfer and its metathesis using the HG&#8208;II catalyst. The dehydrogenation of polyethylene using ruthenium catalysis derived up to 3.38&#8201;%, of double bonds; with 90&#8201;% of the recovered polyolefin material. The obtained unsaturated polyethylene was subjected to cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene using HG&#8208;II catalytic system. This resulted in the synthesis of predominantly dodecene (C12) derivatives, with 58&#8201;% selectivity, along with other derivatives of varying chain lengths. The overall reaction produced terminal and internal olefins in the ratio 1:0.8 respectively. The dehydrogenation of polyethylene and its deconstruction was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The origin of C12 selectivity has been demonstrated by control experiments. The scope of the methodology was extended to post&#8208;consumer waste polyethylene which gave high conversion to value&#8208;added dodecene derivatives as a major product.

         <title>Impact of Pressure on Metavalent Bonding in BiTe Influencing Electronic Topological Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressure enhances metavalent bonding in dual topological insulator, BiTe, influencing the electronic topological transitions (ETT) at 1 and 3&#8197;GPa. Pressure induced synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray pair distribution functional analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theoretical calculation of electronic structure reveal changes in chemical bonding nature and Fermi surface topology.







Abstract
BiTe, a member of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series, possesses natural van der Waals&#8208;like heterostructure with a Bi2 bilayer sandwiched between the two [Te&#8722;Bi&#8722;Te&#8722;Bi&#8722;Te] quintuple layers. BiTe exhibits both the quantum states of weak topological and topological crystalline insulators, making it a dual topological insulator and a suitable candidate for spintronics, quantum computing and thermoelectrics. Herein, we demonstrate that the chemical bonding in BiTe is to be metavalent, which plays a significant role in the pressure dependent change in the topology of the electronic structure Fermi surface. The enhancement of the metavalent bonding character with pressure in BiTe is evidenced from first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Due to the change in the Fermi surface topology, we have visualized electronic topological transitions (ETT) at ~1 and ~3&#8197;GPa through pressure dependent synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The correlation between the metavalent bonding and ETT offers insights into chemical bonding influenced transitions in quantum materials.

         <title>Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystal FeFe(CN)6 Microspheres for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline FeFe(CN)6 microspheres are characterized by interconnected pores within the entire single&#8208;crystalline body, allowing the electrolyte to penetrate into the microspheres and alleviating side reactions. The resulting structurally unique FeFe(CN)6 cathode exhibits excellent rate capability of 86.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance over 2000 cycles in potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs), also known as Prussian blue analogues, are ideal cathodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their nontoxicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, obtaining metal HCF cathode materials with both long&#8208;term cycling stability and high rate performance remains a daunting challenge. In this study, we present mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline iron hexacyanoferrate (MSC&#8208;FeHCF) microspheres, featuring a single&#8208;crystalline structure that contains interconnected pores spanning the entire crystal lattice. This unique architecture not only enables the electrolyte to fully penetrate into the single crystal, but also shorten the K+ diffusion distance. Additionally, the confinement effect of mesopores on interior water mitigates the excessive side reactions. The stress during battery cycling can be dispersed through multiple paths to alleviate the internal strain. The MSC&#8208;FeHCF microspheres exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performance, achieving a specific discharge capacity of 123.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 87.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, providing 85.8&#8201;% of the initial capacity. More importantly, the MSC&#8208;FeHCF microspheres exhibit high rate capability, delivering 86.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study introduces an innovative strategy for engineering metal HCF cathode materials, thereby opening a novel avenue for the development of high&#8208;efficiency electrode materials for PIBs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Targeting Macrocyclic Peptides as Nanomolar Inhibitors of Self&#8208; and Cross&#8208;Seeded Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

Cross&#8208;seeding of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) amyloid self&#8208;assembly by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) has been suggested to link type 2 diabetes to Parkinson's disease. Here we show that designed multi&#8208;targeting macrocyclic peptides previously found to inhibit IAPP and/or Alzheimer's amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;40(42)) are nanomolar inhibitors of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded &#945;Syn amyloid self&#8208;assembly and promising leads for multifunctional anti&#8208;amyloid drugs.







Abstract
Amyloid self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) is linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has recently emerged as a risk factor for PD. Cross&#8208;interactions between their amyloidogenic proteins may act as molecular links. In fact, fibrils of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (T2D) can cross&#8208;seed &#945;Syn amyloidogenesis and &#945;Syn and IAPP colocalize in PD brains. Inhibition of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded &#945;Syn amyloidogenesis could thus interfere with PD pathogenesis. Here we show that macrocyclic peptides, designed to mimic IAPP self&#8208;/cross&#8208;interaction sites and previously found to inhibit amyloidogenesis of IAPP and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide A&#946;40(42), are nanomolar inhibitors of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded amyloid self&#8208;assembly of &#945;Syn. Anti&#8208;amyloid function is mediated by nanomolar affinity interactions with &#945;Syn via three &#945;Syn regions which are identified as key sites of both &#945;Syn self&#8208;assembly and its cross&#8208;interactions with IAPP. We also show that the peptides block A&#946;42&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;seeding of &#945;Syn as well. Based on their broad spectrum anti&#8208;amyloid function and additional drug&#8208;like features, these peptides are leads for multifunctional anti&#8208;amyloid drugs in PD, T2D, AD, and their comorbidities, while the identified &#945;Syn key segments are valuable targets for novel, multi&#8208;site targeting amyloid inhibitors in PD and related synucleinopathies.

         <title>Design of an Ultrafast and Controlled Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Photoiniferter RAFT Polymerization for Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel xanthate molecule was designed to facilitate highly controlled photoiniferter RAFT polymerization at fast rates under visible light. This approach was applied in aqueous photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (photo&#8208;PISA). The rapid photolysis and extended absorption of this xanthate enable ultrafast and scalable fabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with various well&#8208;defined morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.







Abstract
In this contribution, we designed a new xanthate RAFT agent by introducing (5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxy (TNO) as the Z group, namely 2&#8208;[(((5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxycarbonothioyl)thio)ethyl propanoate] (TNXEP). Due to the presence of the TNO group, TNXEP enabled highly controlled and ultrafast photoiniferter RAFT polymerization under violet (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) and blue (&#955;=450&#8197;nm) light. This approach was effectively extended to aqueous media for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), facilitating the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles. Leveraging the rapid photolysis and extended absorption of TNXEP, we demonstrated the first photoiniferter PISA system realizing ultrafast polymerization (&gt;90&#8201;% monomer conversion in minutes) under visible light irradiation. Enhanced visible light penetration improved photopolymerization uniformity, enabling rapid and scalable production of polymeric nanoparticles at a 30&#8197;g scale in just 10 minutes, with tunable morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.

         <title>Mapping Dynamic Protein Clustering with AIEgen&#8208;Active Chemigenetic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctly different with misfolding&#8208;induced protein aggregation, protein clusters are often not typical phase&#8208;separated condensates, thus exhibiting extremely subtle changes in the clustering microenvironment. Here we describe a de novo design strategy of amphiphilic AIEgen&#8208;active chemigenetic probes, which has for the first time monitored precise dynamic condensed states of protein clustering/disassembling in living cells.







Abstract
Protein clustering/disassembling is a fundamental process in biomolecular condensates, playing a crucial role in cell fate decision and cellular homeostasis. However, the inherent features of protein clustering, especially for its reversible behavior and subtle microenvironment variation, present significant hurdles in probe chemistry for tracking protein clustering dynamics. Herein, we report a bilateral&#8208;tailored chemigenetic probe, in which an &#8220;amphiphilic&#8221; aggregate&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) QMSO3Cl is covalently conjugated to a protein tag that is genetically fused to protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI). Prior to target POI, the &#8220;amphiphilic&#8221; AIE&#8208;active QMSO3Cl achieves a completely dark state in both aqueous biological environment and lipophilic organelles, thereby ensuring an ultra&#8208;low intrinsic background interference. Upon reaching POI, the combination of synthetic molecule and genetically encoded protein allows for protein clustering&#8208;dependent ultra&#8208;sensitive response, with a substantial lighting&#8208;up fluorescence (67.5&#8208;fold) as protein transitions from disassembling to clustering state. Such ultra&#8208;high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enables to monitor the dynamic and fate of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) clustering/disassembling under both acute and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in living cells. For the first time, we have demonstrated the use of chemigenetic probe to reveal therapy&#8208;induced ER stress and screen drugs in a three&#8208;dimensional scenario: microviscosity change, clustering dynamic, and cluster morphology. This chemigenetic probe design strategy would greatly facilitate the advancement of mapping protein dynamics in cell homeostasis and medicine research.

         <title>The Role of Open&#8208;Shell Organic Radical in Enhancing Anti&#8208;Tumor Photocatalysis Reaction of NIR Light&#8208;Activated Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated open&#8208;shell photosensitizer shows exceptional type&#8208;I photodynamic activity. As the unpaired electrons in this open&#8208;shell photosensitizer are delocalized and generate additional electronic energy levels, photo&#8208;induced charge transfer is promoted to facilitate type&#8208;I photodynamic reaction. This finding inspires new strategies for developing high&#8208;performance photosensitizers adapted to treating deeper lesions.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell radical materials, which are characterized by unpaired electrons, have led to revolutionary breakthroughs in material science due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, the involvement of organic radicals in photodynamic therapy (PDT) has rarely been reported or discussed. This work studies two photosensitizer analogs. 4AM&#8208;OS with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation exhibits open&#8208;shell radical characters and enhanced type&#8208;I photodynamic activity compared with closed&#8208;shell 2AM&#8208;CS. 4AM&#8208;OS displays the thermally accessible triplet&#8208;state character, resulting in more unpaired electrons delocalized along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone at higher temperatures. Accordingly, the temperature&#8208;dependent photodynamic activity of 4AM&#8208;OS confirms its association with the open&#8208;shell electronic structure. As the unpaired electrons in open&#8208;shell 4AM&#8208;OS are more delocalized and generate additional electronic energy states, photo&#8208;induced charge transfer is promoted to facilitate type&#8208;I photodynamic reactions. This observation addresses the challenge associated with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, such as 4AM&#8208;OS, which often demonstrate low efficacy in PDT due to the limited energy provided by NIR light despite its superior tissue penetration depth. Overall, clarifying the beneficial role of organic radicals in photodynamic reactions will bring revolutionary breakthroughs to developing high&#8208;performance NIR photosensitizers and promoting the efficacy of PDT for deep&#8208;seated lesions.

         <title>Upcycling Polynorbornene Derivatives into Chemically Recyclable Multiblock Linear and Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for upcycling crosslinked pDCPD and linear polynorbornene derivatives into recyclable multiblock crosslinked and linear polymers is reported. This work is accomplished through polymer deconstruction into distinct oligomeric buildings blocks and their repolymerization in different feed ratios. The obtained materials show highly tunable mechanical properties.







Abstract
Synthetic polymers have found widespread use, but their ineffective end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment is causing a significant environmental and human health crisis. Here, we demonstrate the upcycling of polynorbornene derivatives (pNBEs) through their deconstruction into distinct oligomeric buildings blocks that can be repolymerized into chemically recyclable pNBEs&#8208;like multiblock polymers via dehydrogenative polymerization. The resulting materials exhibit diverse mechanical properties, while integrating high melting temperatures (Tm as high as 133&#8201;&#176;C). Notably, this method could also enable the selective deconstruction of permanently cross&#8208;linked polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets into telechelic&#8208;OH functionalized oligomers, overcoming the significant challenges posed by their robust network structure in recycling and degradation. The resulting pDCPD oligomers can subsequently be repolymerized with macrodiols to create multiblock thermosets with tunable mechanical properties, including Young's modulus and tensile elongation. After use, upcycled plastics could be effectively deconstructed back to the oligomers for recovery and repolymerization. Overall, this work establishes an approach that can be utilized to upcycle pNBEs into previously inaccessible multiblock thermosets and thermoplastics with full recyclability, and may be generalizable to a range of polymers to shift their end&#8208;of&#8208;life waste disposal toward sustainable recovery and reuse.

         <title>Manipulating Charge Distribution at Organic&#8208;inorganic Interface via Optimizing Substituents for Sustainable Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces constructed by CoS and substituent&#8208;modified phthalocyanine nanosheets (CoPc&#8208;g) can precisely regulate spatial electric field intensity by controlling charge transfer, thus optimizing the electronic structure of interfacial dual active sites. As a result, CoPc&#8208;CH3/CoS with the strongest space charge region possesses the best performance and stability.







Abstract
The space charge effect induced by high&#8208;quality heterojunctions is essential for efficient electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we delicately manipulate intermolecular charge transfer by modifying substituents (&#8722;g=&#8208;CH3, &#8208;H, &#8208;NO2) with various electron donating/withdrawing capabilities in CoPc&#8208;g/CoS organic&#8211;inorganic heterostructures. CoPc&#8208;CH3, as a typical electron donor, transfers more electrons to CoS due to the presence of &#8208;CH3, forming the strongest space electric field and thus regulating the dual active sites at the interface. Furthermore, oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates preferentially adsorb on the positively charged CoPc&#8208;CH3 side, and the rapid accumulation of electrons on the CoS side decelerates catalyst dissolution at the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential, ensuring the stable OER process under the optimized adsorbate evolution mechanism. As a result, CoPc&#8208;CH3/CoS catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential and remains stable for 150&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The method provides a novel strategy for accurately regulating the space electric field of heterojunctions.

         <title>Optimized Directed Evolution of&#160;E. coli&#160;leucyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase adds many Noncanonical Amino Acids into the Eukaryotic Genetic Code Including Ornithine and N&#1013;&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;Methyllysine</title>

The pyrrolysyl pair has dominated noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporation in eukaryotes, but additional engineerable pairs are needed to further expand this toolbox. Although E. coli leucyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS) is a promising candidate, engineering its substrate specificity has been much less successful. Here, we optimized a yeast&#8208;based directed evolution system to rapidly engineer EcLeuRS to charge diverse ncAAs in mammalian cells.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in eukaryotes has predominantly relied on the pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. However, access to additional easily engineered pairs is crucial for expanding the structural diversity of the ncAA toolbox in eukaryotes. The Escherichia coli&#8208;derived leucyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS)/tRNA pair presents a particularly promising alternative. This pair has been engineered to charge a small yet structurally diverse group of ncAAs in eukaryotic cells. However, expanding the substrate scope of EcLeuRS has been difficult due to the suboptimal yeast&#8208;based directed evolution platform used for its engineering. In this study, we address this limitation by optimizing the yeast&#8208;based directed evolution platform for efficient selection of ncAA&#8208;selective EcLeuRS mutants. Using the optimized selection system, we demonstrate rapid isolation of many novel EcLeuRS mutants capable of incorporating various ncAAs in mammalian cells, including ornithine and N&#1013;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;methyllysine, a recently discovered post&#8208;translational modification in mammalian cells.

         <title>Strategic Nitrogen Site Alignment in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Performance in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodide Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing covalent organic frameworks with a continuous and uniform distribution of nitrogen active sites along the 1D pore walls enables effective anchoring of iodine species and facilitates rapid chemical reaction kinetics. This design significantly enhances the framework&#8216;s potential as a cathode host material for aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, thereby improving the batteries&#8242; overall performance.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are gaining attention as next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical capacity, enhanced safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges such as slow reaction kinetics and the persistent polyiodide shuttle effect. To address these limitations, we developed a novel class of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring electron&#8208;rich nitrogen sites with varied density and distribution (N1&#8208;N4) along the pore walls. These nitrogen sites enhance iodine species confinement and mass transport. Our experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the continuous and optimized distribution of nitrogen sites within the COF structure significantly reduces internal resistance and boosts redox activity. Moreover, the N4&#8208;COF demonstrates superior performance compared to other porous materials, due to its high density and strategic alignment of active sites. The I2@N4&#8208;COF cathode achieves a remarkable specific capacity of 348&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C, almost 1.8 times greater than that of the I2@N1&#8208;COF, while also maintaining excellent cycling stability. This integration of a porous framework with aligned nitrogen sites in the N4&#8208;COF structure not only enhances iodine redox behavior but also offers a promising design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance AZIB electrodes.

         <title>Revealing the CO Tolerance Mechanism in Acidic Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions on Platinum&#8208;Based Catalyst Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed schematic of attenuating CO adsorption on the basis of oxidizing CO to enhance CO tolerance at platinum&#8208;based catalysts under acidic HOR can be outlined by in situ Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
The presence of trace CO impurity gas in hydrogen fuel can rapidly deactivate platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts due to poisoning effects, yet the precise CO tolerance mechanism remains debated. Our designed Au@PtX bifunctional core&#8211;shell nanocatalysts exhibit excellent performance of CO tolerance in acidic solution during HOR and possess exceptional Raman spectroscopy enhancement. Through capturing and analyzing in situ Raman spectroscopy evidences on *OH, metal&#8208;O species and *CO evolution under 0.3&#8197;V, we confirm that oxygen&#8208;containing species on PtRu and PtSn catalysts promote the oxidation and desorption of *CO. While Ru enhances *CO adsorption on Pt, the primary CO tolerance performance of PtRu arises from *CO oxidation via a bifunctional pathway. Additionally, electronic structure of Sn reduces *CO adsorption on Pt sites, complementing the bifunctional mechanism to further enhance the CO tolerance performance of PtSn. These discoveries significantly deepen our understanding of the anti&#8208;poisoning mechanism of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the HOR process and offer valuable insights for rational catalyst design.

         <title>Harnessing Adsorbate&#8208;Adsorbate Interaction to Activate C&#8722;N Bond for Exceptional Photoelectrochemical Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

This work represents an outstanding photoelectrochemical urea oxidation performance on n&#8208;Si photoanodes, providing a quantitative understanding of adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction for urea oxidation on semiconductor surfaces at a molecular level for the first time.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) urea oxidation reaction (UOR) presents a promising half&#8208;reaction for green hydrogen production, but the stable resonance structure of the urea molecule results in sluggish kinetics for breaking the C&#8722;N bond. Herein, we realize the record PEC UOR performance on a NiO&#8208;modified n&#8208;Si photoanode (NiO@Ni/n&#8208;Si) by harnessing the adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction. We quantificationally unveil a dependence of the UOR activation barrier on the coverage of photogenerated surface high&#8208;valent Ni&#8208;oxo species (NiIV=O) by employing operando PEC spectroscopic measurements and theoretical simulations. The strong attraction between NiIV=O and adsorbed urea facilitates their N&#8722;O coupling while weakening the C&#8722;N bonding within urea, manifesting as the decreased UOR activation energy from 0.74 to 0.41&#8197;eV when the surface coverage of NiIV=O is enhanced from zero to full, corresponding to more than two orders of magnitude enhancement for the UOR rate. Furthermore, an industrial&#8208;grade photocurrent density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at a potential as low as 1.08 VRHE by stimulating the NiIV=O accumulation under 10 Suns, which is 300&#8197;mV lower than the potential required for most reported electrochemical counterparts. This work opens new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance PEC urea oxidation via adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3 have been accomplished, in which 1.5&#8197;g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps. The intramolecular geminal bis(silyl) Prins cyclization was employed to establish the complete cis&#8208;Z selectivity on the B&#8208;ring. The syntheses consist of 20&#8211;22 steps in the longest linear sequence and 33&#8211;35 total steps, with overall yields ranging from 3.3&#8201;% to 4.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Bryostatins are a family of marine natural products that have garnered significant interests, as evidenced by over 40 clinical trials. However, their extremely low natural abundance has severely limited further research. Despite significant efforts, which have led to the total synthesis of seven bryostatin members by eight independent research groups, these complex molecules present persistent challenges for stereocontrolled, large&#8208;scale, and especially divergent synthesis. Here, we report the divergent total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3. Notably, 1.5&#8197;g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps. Key transformations include Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling to rapidly assemble the northern fragment, the flow chemistry&#8208;assisted visible light&#8208;induced alkyl radical conjugate addition to convergently construct the southern fragment, and an intramolecular geminal bis(silyl) Prins cyclization to establish the cis&#8208;Z selectivity on the B&#8208;ring. The syntheses consist of 20&#8211;22 steps in the longest linear sequence and 33&#8211;35 total steps, with overall yields ranging from 3.3&#8201;% to 4.5&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;Total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have been accomplished, in which 1.5&#8197;g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryostatins are a family of marine natural products that have garnered significant interests, as evidenced by over 40 clinical trials. However, their extremely low natural abundance has severely limited further research. Despite significant efforts, which have led to the total synthesis of seven bryostatin members by eight independent research groups, these complex molecules present persistent challenges for stereocontrolled, large-scale, and especially divergent synthesis. Here, we report the divergent total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Notably, 1.5&#8197;g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps.

An adaptive microporous material with appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials shows excellent trace C2H2 and CO2 trapping capability at 0.01&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K with high C2H2/C2H4 and top&#8208;level CO2/C2H4 selectivity simultaneously, which can realize one&#8208;step record&#8208;high acquisition of C2H4 from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixture under various conditions.







Abstract
One&#8208;step adsorptive purification of ethylene (C2H4) from ternary mixture comprising of acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is a great challenge in the chemical industry. Herein, a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (FJI&#8208;H38) has been reported, which possesses high&#8208;density electronegative O/N binding sites and appropriate pore size. Notably, at 0.01&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K FJI&#8208;H38 shows excellent trapping capability for C2H2 (1.64&#8197;mmol/g) and CO2 (2.33&#8197;mmol/g), while the uptake of C2H4 is only 0.41&#8197;mmol/g, which endows FJI&#8208;H38 high C2H2/C2H4 and top&#8208;level CO2/C2H4 selectivity simultaneously. Polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&#8805;99.95&#8201;%) with record&#8208;high productivity can be successfully obtained from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixture in one step under various conditions. Even at 318&#8197;K, the separation performance has no obvious decrease. Such excellent separation performance is due to the adaptive recognition of C2H2 and CO2 by FJI&#8208;H38 through the synergistic effect of appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials, where C2H2 and CO2 can be stabilized by the O/N and aromatic ring sites.

         <title>A Needle in a Haystack: Transient Porosity in a Closed Pore Square Lattice Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

Porosity &#8220;without pores&#8221;! We report a transiently porous coordination network that undergoes phase transformations between distinct closed pore phases in response to desolvation, humidity, or exposure to CO2 and C2H2 gases. Investigating its guest transport mechanism, we uncover a crystal engineering strategy with potential to enable the design of transient porosity in similar compounds.







Abstract
Guest transport through discrete voids (closed pores) in crystalline solids is poorly understood. Herein, we report the gas sorption properties of a nonporous coordination network, {[Co(bib)2Cl2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH}n (sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945;), featuring square lattice (sql) topology and the bent linker 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene (bib). The as&#8208;synthesized sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; has 11.3&#8201;% (313&#8197;&#197;3) of its unit cell volume in closed pores occupied by methanol (MeOH). Upon desolvation and air exposure, sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; underwent a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) phase transformation to sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946;&#8242;, wherein MeOH was replaced by water. Activation (vacuum or N2 flow) resulted in dehydration and retention of the closed pores, affording sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946; with 7.7&#8201;% (194&#8197;&#197;3) guest&#8208;accessible space. sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946; was found to preferentially adsorb C2H2 (at 265&#8197;K) over CO2 (at 195&#8197;K) through gate&#8208;opening mechanisms, at gate&#8208;opening pressures of 59.8 and 27.7&#8197;kPa, respectively, while other C2 gases were excluded. PXRD was used to monitor transformations between the three phases of sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl, while in situ DSC, in situ SCXRD under CO2 pressure, and computational studies provided insight into the guest transport mechanism, which we attribute to the angular, flexible nature of the bib ligand. Further, the preferential adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 and other C2 gases suggests that transiently porous sorbents might have utility in separations.

         <title>Tailored Polymer&#8208;Inorganic Bilayer SEI with Proton Holder Feature for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer/P&#8722;F SEI with proton holder feature is designed to stabilize Zn anode at high current densities and areal capacities. The inner ZnF2 has high stiffness and strength, effectively suppressing Zn dendrites. The outer polyaniline (PANI) regulates current distribution across the Zn surface and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Meanwhile, the =N&#8722; group in PANI serves as a reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER.







Abstract
Conventional solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries mainly acts as a physical barrier to prevent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while such SEI is prone to structural deterioration stemming from uneven Zn deposition at high current densities. Herein, we propose an in situ structural design of polymer&#8208;inorganic bilayer SEI with a proton holder feature by aniline&#8208;modulated electrolytes. The Zn(OTF)2 exhibits a lower LUMO energy level in comparison to aniline, resulting in the formation of a bilayer structure characterized by an inner ZnF2 layer and an outer polyaniline (PANI) layer. The ZnF2 with high stiffness and strength effectively suppresses Zn dendrites. Meanwhile, the PANI regulates the current distribution, minimizing the concentration gradient, and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Furthermore, the =N&#8722; in PANI is capable of reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER. With this bilayer SEI, the Zn anode achieves an impressive cycle life of 126&#8197;h under 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 &amp; 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (depth of discharge, DOD=70.8&#8201;%), solving the bottleneck of single&#8208;layer inorganic SEI that could not be cycled under these conditions. The Zn&#8201;||&#8201;NaVO pouch battery with bilayer SEI exhibits a high capacity of 1.2&#8197;Ah and a cycle life of 350&#8197;h with 78&#8201;% capacity retention. At &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, the same battery delivers a capacity of 335&#8197;mAh and a cycle life of 507&#8197;h with 72&#8201;% capacity retention, attributed to the modulation mechanism of the hydrogen bonding in the electrolyte. Our findings offer profound insights into the design of SEI with tailored structure and functionality, paving the way for the next generation of advanced high&#8208;performance batteries.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) in aqueous Zn-ion batteries mainly acts as a physical barrier to prevent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while such SEI is prone to structural deterioration stemming from uneven Zn deposition at high current densities. Herein, we propose an in situ structural design of polymer-inorganic bilayer SEI with a proton holder feature by aniline-modulated electrolytes. The Zn(OTF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a lower LUMO energy level in comparison to aniline, resulting in the formation of a bilayer structure characterized by an inner ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer and an outer polyaniline (PANI) layer. The ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with high stiffness and strength effectively suppresses Zn dendrites. Meanwhile, the PANI regulates the current distribution, minimizing the concentration gradient, and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Furthermore, the =N&#8722; in PANI is capable of reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER. With this bilayer SEI, the Zn anode achieves an impressive cycle life of 126&#8197;h under 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;amp; 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (depth of discharge, DOD=70.8&#8201;%), solving the bottleneck of single-layer inorganic SEI that could not be cycled under these conditions. The Zn&#8201;||&#8201;NaVO pouch battery with bilayer SEI exhibits a high capacity of 1.2&#8197;Ah and a cycle life of 350&#8197;h with 78&#8201;% capacity retention. At &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, the same battery delivers a capacity of 335&#8197;mAh and a cycle life of 507&#8197;h with 72&#8201;% capacity retention, attributed to the modulation mechanism of the hydrogen bonding in the electrolyte. Our findings offer profound insights into the design of SEI with tailored structure and functionality, paving the way for the next generation of advanced high-performance batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Asymmetric Coordination to Correlate with Oxygen Reduction Activity in Fe&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based Fe single&#8208;atom sites with quantified asymmetry coordination configurations are investigated to make up the structure&#8211;activity relationship study challenge for atom&#8208;level catalysts. The obtained volcano plots and experimental results verify that FeN4&#8208;SeC2 with a moderate asymmetry degree exhibits the best ORR activity, which refines and broadens the understanding of oxygen electrochemistry.







Abstract
Precisely manipulating asymmetric coordination configurations and examining electronic effects enable to tunethe intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the lackof a definite relationship between coordination asymmetry and catalytic activity makes the rational design of SACs ambiguous. Here, we propose a concept of &#8220;asymmetry degree&#8221; to quantify asymmetric coordination configurations and assess the effectiveness of active moieties in Fe&#8208;based SACs. A theoretical framework is established, elucidating the volcanic relationship between asymmetry degree and ORR activity by constructing a series of Fe&#8208;based SAC models doped with non&#8208;metal atoms (B, P, S, Se, and Te) in the first or second coordination sphere, which aligns with Sabatier principle. The predicted ORR activity of Fe asymmetric active moieties is then experimentally validated using asymmetry degree. The combined computational and experimental results suggest that single&#8208;atom moiety with a moderate asymmetry degree exhibits optimal intrinsic ORR activity, because breaking the square&#8208;planar symmetry of FeN4 can alter the electronic population of the Fe 3d&#8208;orbital, thereby optimizing the adsorption&#8208;desorption strength of intermediates and thus enhancing the intrinsic ORR activity. This fundamental understanding of catalytic activity from geometric and electronic aspects offers a rational guidance to design high&#8208;performance SACs with asymmetric configurations.

         <title>Ultrafast Water Purification by Template&#8208;Free Nanoconfined Catalysts Derived from Municipal Sludge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free approach transforms municipal sludge into high&#8208;performance nanoconfined catalysts by leveraging selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion to manipulate micro&#8208;mesoporous structures. Atomically dispersed Fe centers are confined, resulting in a shift of reaction mechanism and achieving a impressive 261&#8208;fold increase in catalytic pollutant degradation. This scalable method not only tackles waste management but also offers a sustainable route for manufacturing advanced catalysts, contributing to water purification and global waste upcycling efforts.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement at the interface of heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysts offers promising avenues for advancing oxidation processes in water purification. Herein, we introduce a template&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing nanoconfined catalysts from municipal sludge (S&#8208;NCCs), specifically engineered to optimize reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and utilization for rapid pollutant degradation. Using selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion, we create an architecture that confines atomically dispersed Fe centers within a micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon matrix in situ. This method maximizes the utilization of silicon and aluminum content from sludge, prevents metal agglomeration, and precisely regulates the chemical environment of Fe active sites. As a result, the S&#8208;NCCs promote a transition from nonradical to hybrid radical/nonradical reaction mechanisms, significantly enhancing ROS efficiency, stability, and pollutant degradation rates. These catalysts demonstrate exceptional pollutant removal performance, achieving a 261&#8208;fold increase in degradation efficiency for compounds such as phenol and sulfamethoxazole compared to unconfined analogs, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fenton&#8208;like systems. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of nanoconfined catalysis in environmental applications, providing an effective and scalable solution for sustainable water purification.

         <title>Exploiting Lattice Carbon&#8208;Induced Modulation Effect in Nickel towards Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the content of lattice carbon (LC), the electronic structure and adsorption properties of nickel are changed, and the volcanic relationship between the lattice carbon content and the alkaline HOR activity is revealed.







Abstract
Doping with non&#8208;metallic heteroatom is an effective approach to tailor the electronic structure of Ni for enhancing its alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalytic performance. However, the modulation of HOR activity of Ni by lattice carbon (LC) atoms has rarely been reported, especially to reveal the rule between the doping effect and activity caused by the content of LC atoms. Here, hydrogen is proposed as a scavenger for LC atoms in the pyrolytic reduction process to finely control the content of LC atoms in Ni. With the removal of LC atoms in Ni lattice, the electronic structure changes from Ni3C&#8208;like electronic structure to quasi&#8208;Ni structure. Furthermore, a volcanic relationship between the LC content and HOR activity of Ni is established for the first time. The Cless&#8208;Ni (LC0.44&#8208;Ni) with optimized LC content shows the best activity owing to the weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and optimal hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE). This work provides an inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts by tailoring the electronic structure of the metal via LC atoms doping.

         <title>Comprehensive Passivation of Surface and Bulk Defects in Perovskite for High Efficiency Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive strategy combining &#8220;wet film treatment&#8221; and &#8220;dry film treatment&#8221; was proposed to passivate surface and bulk defects of CsPbI3 films. The high diffusivity of choline in the intermediate phase film made the LD perovskite permeate through the grain boundaries of the bulk film. Benefiting from this strategy, the assembled carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cell (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, which is a new record efficiency for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have the advantages of high stability and low cost, but their mean efficiency has become an obstacle to commercialization. Defects, which are widely distributed on the surface and bulk of films, are an important factor in C&#8208;PSCs for low efficiency. The conventional post&#8208;treatment method through forming a low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskite layer usually fails in manipulating the bulk defects. Herein, we propose a strategy of combining wet film (uncrystallized) treatment with dry film treatment to in situ form LD perovskite throughout the grain boundaries inside of the film and on the surface of the film, thereby simultaneously passivating the bulk and surface defects in the CsPbI3 film. As a result, the photoluminescence lifetime is significantly improved from 22.5&#8197;ns to 92.1&#8197;ns. The assembled CsPbI3 C&#8208;PSCs based on the above strategy deliver a champion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, which is a new record efficiency for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Tuned Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Synergistic Covalent Adaptable Networks: Towards Recycled Elastomers with Excellent Creep&#8208;Resistant Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

We develop a novel approach to enhance polyurethane&#8208;urea elastomer performance by manipulating the stereochemistry of rigid diamine chain extenders. The trans configuration (R,R or S,S) of 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane imparts superior creep resistance, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. The elastomers are recyclable via urea bond exchange and retain performance post&#8208;recycling, demonstrating potential for high&#8208;performance, sustainable applications in aerospace and flexible materials.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) offer innovative solutions for the reprocessing and recycling of thermoset polymers. However, achieving a balance between easy reprocessing and creep resistance remains a challenge. This study focuses on designing and synthesizing polyurethane (PU) materials with tailored properties by manipulating the stereochemistry of diamine chain extenders. By employing cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;configurations of diamine extenders, we developed a series of PU materials with varying mechanical properties and creep resistance. The trans&#8208;configured materials (R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU or S,S&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited superior creep resistance and mechanical strength due to dense hydrogen bonding networks. The cis&#8208;configured materials (Cis&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited enhanced processability and elasticity. Under 0.1&#8197;MPa stress, R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU showed a mere 3.5&#8201;% strain change at 170&#8201;&#176;C over 60&#8197;minutes, highlighting its superior creep resistance. Both configurations can be recycled via urea bond exchange reactions using hot pressing or solvothermal methods. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the (R,R&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 and (S,S&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 segments form six hydrogen bonds with shorter bond lengths, leading to stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Conversely, the (Cis&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 segment forms four hydrogen bonds with longer bond lengths, resulting in weaker interactions. This work highlights the critical role of stereochemistry in designing high&#8208;performance, recyclable polymer materials with tailored properties.

         <title>Tiny&#8208;Ligand Solvation Electrolyte Enabled Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a guideline to fill this performance gap for designing tiny&#8208;ligand solvation electrolytes (TLSE) by using cosolvents with sterically hindered functional groups. The large&#8208;sized functional groups in the secondary solvation sheath weaken its solvation ability of oxygen atoms with Li+, thereby promoting H2O molecules to participate in the first Li+ solvation shell to form a fast ion&#8208;conduction tiny&#8208;ligand solvation.







Abstract
The H&#8208;bond network among H2O molecules enables ultrafast diffusion of H+ and OH&#8722; via a hopping mechanism, making aqueous batteries attractive competitors for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging energy storages. Ideal aqueous electrolyte for the widely used lithium&#8208;ion batteries is expected to have the wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5&#8197;volts), fast charging (&#8804;15&#8197;minutes) without gas evolution, and low cost. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) associated with narrow voltage window of water (1.23&#8197;V) limits their practical applications. Herein, we built a new guideline for designing tiny&#8208;ligand electrolytes by utilizing sterically hindered groups with low binding energy. Cosolvent tetraethyl orthocarbonate (TEOC), with large&#8208;sized ethoxy groups and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;captured ability, forces free H2O and anion TFSI&#8722; into the Li+ first solvation shell. Hence, inhibition of HER takes place by means of immobilized H2O activity and formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks &#8212;C&#8722;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H between TEOC and H2O. This unique structure with ultra&#8208;small sheath volume thereby facilitates the formation of LiF&#8208;rich SEI and fast ion&#8208;conduction. The lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in TEOC/H2O electrolyte exhibits wide electrochemical window of 5.7&#8197;V, enabling LiMn2O4/Li4Ti5O12 pouch cells to achieve 1200 cycles under rapid 10&#8197;C rate. This engineering of tiny&#8208;ligand solvation opens new pathways for developing advanced electrolyte that balance performance with sustainability.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers Incorporating Shape&#8208;Persistent Cyclobenzoin Macrocycles for Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic porous organic polymer has been synthesized for the efficient separation of organic solvents. The resulting polymer exhibits high uptake capacities for small solvents, correlating with their kinetic diameters, and effectively differentiates between xylene isomers. These findings highlight the potential of porous organic polymers in advanced solvent separation technologies.







Abstract
The recovery and separation of organic solvents is highly important for the chemical industry and environmental protection. In this context, porous organic polymers (POPs) have significant potential owing to the possibility of integrating shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units with high guest selectivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a macrocyclic porous organic polymer (np&#8208;POP) and the corresponding model compound by reacting the cyclotetrabenzil naphthalene octaketone macrocycle with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene and 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene, respectively, under solvothermal conditions. Co&#8208;crystallization of the macrocycle and the model compound with various solvent molecules revealed their size&#8208;selective inclusion within the macrocycle. Building on this finding, the np&#8208;POP with a hierarchical pore structure and a surface area of 579&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 showed solvent uptake strongly correlated with their kinetic diameters. Solvents with kinetic diameters below 0.6&#8197;nm &#8211; such as acetonitrile and dichloromethane &#8211; showed high uptake capacities exceeding 7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Xylene separation tests revealed a high overall uptake (~34&#8197;wt&#8201;%), with o&#8208;xylene displaying a significantly lower uptake (~10&#8197;wt&#8201;% less than other isomers), demonstrating the possibility of size and shape selective separation of organic solvents.

The tunable organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d electron conjugation of quinonized superlattice, inducing more dxy orbitals occupancy, more polarons near Fermi level, the downshift of O p band center, and reinforced Mn&#8722;O &#960;&#8208;type orbitals hybrid, which successively contributes to the significant improvement of electrochemical activity, diffusion kinetics of Zn2+ and structure stability.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with two&#8208;electron transfer harvest high energy density, high working voltage, inherent safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Zn2+ as the dominant charge carriers suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the strong Zn2+&#8722;MnO2 coulombic interaction, which is also the origin of pestilent MnO2 lattice deformation and performance degradation. Current studies particularly involve H+ insertion&#8208;dominating chemistry, where the long&#8208;term cycle stability remains challenging due to the accumulative Zn2+ insertion and structural collapse. Herein, a simultaneously enhanced and stabilized Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry is proposed by the quinone&#8208;hybridized MnO2 superlattice, a first&#8208;of&#8208;this&#8208;kind structure with a distinctive organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d conjugation, which enables a tunable interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization. Theoretical and experimental results substantiate that the interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization triggers the enhancement of polarons occupancy near Fermi level, the downward shift of O p&#8208;band center, the elevated Mn t2g occupation and thus improved [MnO6] stability upon unprecedentedly high Zn2+ contribution. The notable d&#8208;&#960; hybridization endows MnO2 superlattice an ultrahigh specific capacity (435.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) with substantially enhanced rate performance. Our findings enlighten a new paradigm in the adjustment of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry towards high&#8208;performance rechargeable aqueous batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Zn-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with two-electron transfer harvest high energy density, high working voltage, inherent safety, and cost-effectiveness. Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as the dominant charge carriers suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the strong Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coulombic interaction, which is also the origin of pestilent MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice deformation and performance degradation. Current studies particularly involve H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion-dominating chemistry, where the long-term cycle stability remains challenging due to the accumulative Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion and structural collapse. Herein, a simultaneously enhanced and stabilized Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-insertion chemistry is proposed by the quinone-hybridized MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; superlattice, a first-of-this-kind structure with a distinctive organic&#8211;inorganic-extended p-&#960;-d conjugation, which enables a tunable interlayer d-&#960; hybridization. Theoretical and experimental results substantiate that the interlayer d-&#960; hybridization triggers the enhancement of polarons occupancy near Fermi level, the downward shift of O p-band center, the elevated Mn t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; occupation and thus improved [MnO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] stability upon unprecedentedly high Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; contribution. The notable d-&#960; hybridization endows MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; superlattice an ultrahigh specific capacity (435.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), state-of-the-art cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with substantially enhanced rate performance. Our findings enlighten a new paradigm in the adjustment of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-insertion chemistry towards high-performance rechargeable aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Facet Engineering of Mesoporous CuS Cascade Nanoreactors Enhances Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Coupling of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4</title>

Hollow mesoporous CuS nanoreactors with anisotropic (100)&#8208;(110) crystal&#8208;facets have been successfully synthesized via an interfacial&#8208;confined ion dynamic migration&#8208;rearrangement strategy. The cascade nanoreactors with spatially separated Au&#8208;(110) and Co&#8208;(100) sites are constructed by utilizing the directional transport of carriers along the (100)&#8208;(110) crystal&#8208;facets, which facilitates the conversion of CO2 to C2H4.







Abstract
Crystal&#8208;facet heterojunction engineering of mesoporous nanoreactors with highly redox&#8208;active represents an efficacious strategy for the transformation of CO2 into valuable C2 products (e.g., C2H4). Herein, hollow mesoporous cube&#8208;like CuS nanoreactors (~860&#8197;nm) with controlled anisotropic crystal&#8208;facets are prepared through an interfacial&#8208;confined ion dynamic migration&#8208;rearrangement strategy. The regulation of the S2&#8722; ion concentration facilitates the modulation of the highly active (110) to (100) crystal&#8208;facet ratios from 0.119 to 0.288, and induces the formation of anisotropic crystal&#8208;facet heterojunctions. The controllable crystal&#8208;facet heterojunctions trigger the directional charge carrier migration, and are accompanied with the formation of tandem S&#8208;defect sites (Cu0&#8208;S1@S3). Both of them promote the efficient electron&#8208;hole pair dissociation and attain asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling. The hollow mesoporous CuS nanoreactors with optimized crystal&#8208;facet ratio of 0.224 (HMe&#8208;CuS&#8208;3) deliver a high selectivity of 72.7&#8201;% for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to acetylene (C2H2). Further constructed Au&#8208;(110) and Co3O4&#8208;(100) spatially separated cascade nanoreactors (SS&#8208;Au@Co3O4&#8208;CuS) achieve CO2&#8208;C2H4 photoreduction, in which the Co&#8208;sites enhance H2O dissociation to provide protons and the protonation of *CO to *COH. The *COH is further captured by Au&#8208;sites to accomplish the asymmetric *CO&#8208;*COH coupling and subsequent protonation, ensuring a high C2H4 generation rate of 4.11&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h with a selectivity as high as 90.6&#8201;%.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction of An Integrated CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 Electrode Enabling Efficient Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water or Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface reconstruction of the integrated CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 electrode leads to the formation of Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8, which has significantly low activation barrier for water dissociation and accelerates the catalytic reaction for the hydrogen evolution. It requires only 57.8 and 195.8&#8197;mV of overpotentials to achieve &#8722;100 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and also provides the stable operation at industrial level current densities in alkaline water or seawater.







Abstract
To accelerate the water dissociation in the Volmer step and alleviate the destruction of bubbles to the physical structure of catalysts during the alkaline hydrogen evolution, an integrated electrode of cobalt oxide and cobalt&#8208;molybdenum oxide grown on Ni foam, named CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8, is designed. This integrated electrode enhances the catalyst&#8208;substrate interaction confirmed by a micro&#8208;indentation tester, and thus hinders the destruction of the physical structure of catalysts caused by bubbles. Electrochemical testing shows the occurrence of a surface reconstruction of the integrated electrode, and CoO is transformed into Co(OH)2, denoted as Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8. Theoretical calculations determine that Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 has significantly low activation barrier for water dissociation and presents easy hydroxide desorption, which accelerate the catalytic reaction. Electrochemical experiments show that Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 exhibits outstanding activity, reaching current density values of &#8722;100 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with overpotentials only 57.8 and 195.8&#8197;mV, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent stability at &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 200&#8197;h. Combined with the previously reported anode, the two&#8208;electrode system also provides the stable operation from 100 to 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 600&#8197;h in alkaline solution, and over 200&#8197;h at 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater.

A refined site&#8208;specific anisotropic assembly and etching co&#8208;mediation approach was fabricated to create a series of hierarchical MOF nanohybrids and single&#8208;crystal MOFs. This approach yields ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids with diverse topologies, alongside derived single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles exhibiting intricate morphologies such as hexapods, nested nanocages, and octopods.







Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse geometries has captivated considerable interest due to their manifestation of novel and extraordinary properties. While much progress has been made in shaping regular polyhedral single&#8208;crystal MOFs, the creation of more complex, topologically intricate nanostructures remains a largely unexplored frontier. Here, we present a refined site&#8208;specific anisotropic assembly and etching co&#8208;mediation approach to fabricate a series of hierarchical MOF nanohybrids and single&#8208;crystal MOFs. This approach yields ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids with diverse topologies, alongside derived single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles exhibiting intricate morphologies such as hexapods, nested nanocages, and octopods. Our method involves the selective growth of six mSiO2 nanoplates on the {100} facets of ZIF&#8208;8 nanocubes, forming the cubic&#8208;shaped ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids, with the concurrent etching of the {110} facets of initial ZIF&#8208;8 nanocubes. By fine&#8208;tuning this balance between the growth and etching, we achieved precise morphological control, transforming cubic nanohybrids into intricate hexapods nanohybrids. Additionally, secondary epitaxial growth of homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;MOFs on these hybrids led to ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2&amp;MOF composites with six mSiO2 inlays. Finally, selective alkaline etching of the mSiO2 compartments result in single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles with unprecedented and sophisticated morphologies, such as hexapods, nested nanocages, octopods. This work advances the field of MOF nanostructure design, opening new avenues for the development of sophisticated, multifunctional materials.

Finally, selective alkaline etching of the mSiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compartments result in single-crystal MOF nanoparticles with unprecedented and sophisticated morphologies, such as hexapods, nested nanocages, octopods. This work advances the field of MOF nanostructure design, opening new avenues for the development of sophisticated, multifunctional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Active Site Covalent Organic Framework Anode Enables Stable Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual active site covalent organic framework (TABQ&#8208;COF) was introduced as an anode for aqueous proton batteries (APBs). Benefiting from the extended large conjugated structure and high active site density, the TABQ&#8208;COF electrode features high capacity of 401&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability. When coupling with MnO2 cathode, the APB shows high energy density of 218&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 100&#8201;% over 10000 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries (APBs) have attracted increasing interest owing to their potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage with extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, there are limited anode materials and it remains a great challenge to effectively balance capacity and cycling performance. Here, we report a covalent organic framework containing C=O and C=N dual active sites (TABQ&#8208;COF) as a high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;cycle anode for proton batteries. The proton storage ability of the dual active sites and the up to nine proton redox chemistry mechanisms for each repetitive unit have been demonstrated by experiments and density functional theory calculations. The insoluble TABQ&#8208;COF electrode displayed a remarkably high specific capacity of 401&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, outstanding cycling stability (100&#8201;% capacity retention after 7500 cycles) and high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). When coupling with a MnO2 cathode, the constructed TABQ&#8208;COF//MnO2 battery achieves a reversible capacity of 247&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a remarkable capacity retention of 100&#8201;% over 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the TABQ&#8208;COF//MnO2 battery can operate well and shows high capacity and cycle stability in a frozen electrolyte at &#8722;40&#176;C, implying great potential for energy storage at extreme temperatures.

         <title>Dendritic Platinum Nanoparticles Shielded by Pt&#8208;S PEGylation as Intracellular Reactors for Bioorthogonal Uncaging Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal platinum chemistry! Dendritic Pt nanoparticles shielded by Pt&#8722;S PEGylation demonstrated high biocompatibility and the capacity to mediate uncaging reactions in cancer cells, enabling the in situ release of anticancer drugs in 2D and 3D culture, and in vivo.







Abstract
Beyond their classical role as cytotoxics, Platinum (Pt) coordination complexes recently joined the selected group of transition metals capable of performing bioorthogonal reactions in living environments. To minimize their reactivity towards nucleophiles, which limit their catalytic performance, we investigated the use of Pt(0) with different forms, sizes and surface functionalization. We report herein the development of PEGylated Pt nanodendrites with the capacity to activate prodyes and prodrugs in cell culture and in vivo. Their dendritic morphology together with their surface shielding through Pt&#8722;S&#8208;bonded PEGylation synergistically contributed to create catalytic nanoreactors compatible with the highly&#8208;crowded and reductive environment of the cell cytoplasm, thereby facilitating in situ bioorthogonal drug uncaging in cancer cells in 2D and 3D culture, including in microfluidic systems, and xenografted in zebrafish.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Induced Electron Localization Promotes D2O Dissociation and Nitrile Adsorption for Deuterated Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;coordinated Cu catalyst is designed to enable the electrosynthesis of the precursor of Melatonin&#8208;d4, 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine&#8208;d4, with a 68&#8201;% yield (FE) at a low overpotential, which is 4 times greater than that of highly coordinated Cu. The enrichment of electrons and enhanced local electric field decrease the energy of D2O dissociation and change the adsorption configuration of nitriles from a semibridge model to a flat model, thus facilitating the reaction dynamics.







Abstract
Electrochemical reductive deuteration of nitriles is a promising strategy for synthesizing deuterated amines with D2O as the deuterated source. However, this reaction suffers from high overpotentials owing to the sluggish D2O dissociation kinetics and high thermodynamic stability of the C&#8801;N triple bond. Here, low&#8208;coordinated copper (LC&#8722;Cu) is designed to decrease the overpotential for the electrosynthesis of the precursor of Melatonin&#8208;d4, 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine&#8208;d4, by 100&#8197;mV with a 68&#8201;% yield (Faradaic efficiency), which is 4 times greater than that of high&#8208;coordinated copper (HC&#8722;Cu). The low coordinated sites induced an enrichment of electrons to concentrate K+ ions hydrated deuterium water (K&#8901;D2O) and decrease the energy of the Volmer step via the polarization effect, leading to a continuous supplementation of *D for the reductive deuteration of nitriles. Moreover, the enhanced local electric field changes the adsorption configuration of nitriles from a semibridge model to a flat model, leading to faster reduction kinetics of nitriles with a high reaction rate at lower potentials. High deuterium incorporation, a wide substrate scope, and easy gram&#8208;scale synthesis over LC&#8722;Cu at 300&#8197;mA rationalize the design concept. Furthermore, the enhanced antitumor and antioxidation effects of Melatonin&#8208;d4 highlight the great promise of deuterated drugs.

         <title>Modulating Perovskite Surface Energetics Through Tuneable Ferrocene Interlayers for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional ferrocene (Fc)&#8208;based interlayers have been developed to exhibit adjustable passivating and electrochemical characteristics within inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The key role played by the highest occupied molecular orbital energies (EHOMO) of the Fc compounds relative to the perovskite valence band maximum (EVBM) is revealed, and this relationship is pivotal in controlling band bending and optimizing charge extraction.







Abstract
Achieving rational control over chemical and energetic properties at the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface is crucial for realizing highly efficient and stable next&#8208;generation inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this, we developed multifunctional ferrocene (Fc)&#8208;based interlayers engineered to exhibit adjustable passivating and electrochemical characteristics. These interlayers are designed to reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination, and to modulate the work function (WF) and uniformity of the perovskite surface, thereby enhancing device performance. The key role played by the highest occupied molecular orbital energies (EHOMO) of the Fc compounds relative to the perovskite valance band maximum (EVBM) is revealed. This relationship is pivotal in controlling band bending and optimizing charge extraction. Notably, the conformationally flexible and more easily oxidized ferrocenyl&#8208;bis&#8208;furyl&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (2) is found to more effectively bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ surface sites and modulate interfacial energetics, resulting in inverted PSCs achieving champion efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;%. These cells also displayed excellent stability, retaining &gt;92&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 1,000&#8197;h of maximum power point operation at 65&#8201;&#176;C. By correlating the broadly tunable Fc&#8208;EHOMO with a decreased and homogenized perovskite surface WF, our work advances our understanding of Fc&#8208;based interlayers and opens new pathways for their application in high&#8208;efficiency solar technologies.

&lt;sub&gt;VBM&lt;/sub&gt;) is revealed. This relationship is pivotal in controlling band bending and optimizing charge extraction. Notably, the conformationally flexible and more easily oxidized ferrocenyl-bis-furyl-2-carboxylate (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) is found to more effectively bind with undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; surface sites and modulate interfacial energetics, resulting in inverted PSCs achieving champion efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;%. These cells also displayed excellent stability, retaining &amp;gt;92&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 1,000&#8197;h of maximum power point operation at 65&#8201;&#176;C. By correlating the broadly tunable Fc-&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;HOMO&lt;/sub&gt; with a decreased and homogenized perovskite surface WF, our work advances our understanding of Fc-based interlayers and opens new pathways for their application in high-efficiency solar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Layered Germanium Iodide Perovskite Ferroelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel series of 2D layered germanium iodide perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors was firstly developed through the approach of reduced lattice dimensionality. Such ferroelectrics manifest both large in&#8208;plane polarization over ~10.0&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 and highly anisotropic photoelectronic features, serving as a great platform for integrating ferroelectric order and photoelectronic features within the 2D lattice.







Abstract
The discovery of ferroelectricity in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors has opened a new and exciting chapter in next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics due to their lattice&#8208;dimensionality&#8208;induced unique behaviors and fascinating functionalities brought by spontaneous polarization. The emerging layered halide perovskites with 2D lattices provide a great platform for generating reduced symmetry and low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectricity. Herein, inspired by the approach of reduced lattice dimensionality, a series of 2D layered germanium iodide perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors A2CsGe2I7 [where A=PA (propylammonium), BA (butylammonium) and AA (amylammonium)] was firstly developed, which demonstrates remarkable semiconducting features including narrow direct band gap (~1.8&#8197;eV) and high conductivity over 32.23&#8197;nS/cm. Emphatically, these layered germanium iodide perovskites manifest large in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization over ~10.0&#8197;&#956;C/cm2, mainly attributed to the large off&#8208;centering ion displacement induced by stereo&#8208;active lone&#8208;pairs of Ge2+. More specifically, in contrast to three&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric CsGeI3, the representative 2D layered BA2CsGe2I7 manifests a superior polarization&#8208;sensitive bulk photovoltaic effect with a polarization ratio of 1.68 and high short circuit current density up to 81.25&#8197;&#956;A/cm2, which is superior to those of reported layered halide perovskite ferroelectrics. This work provides an exciting pathway for the development of 2D ferroelectric semiconductors as well as sheds light on their further applications in photoelectronic fields.

         <title>Developing Orthogonal Fluorescent RNAs for Photoactive Dual&#8208;Color Imaging of RNAs in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent RNA, mSquash/DFHBFPD, was developed using a SELEX&#8208;independent approach, enabling orthogonal RNA imaging alongside Broccoli/DFHBI&#8208;1T in live cells. Building on this, we engineered photoactivatable fluorescent RNAs with wavelength&#8208;specific activation, offering precise spatiotemporal control and advancing dual&#8208;color RNA imaging in live cells.







Abstract
Fluorogenic RNA aptamers have revolutionized the visualization of RNAs within complex cellular processes. A representative category of them employs the derivatives of green fluorescent protein chromophore, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzlidene imidazolinone (HBI), as chromophores. However, the structural homogeneity of their chromophoric backbones causes severe cross&#8208;reactivity with other homologous chromophores. This limitation impairs their multiplexing capabilities, which are essential for the simultaneous visualization of multiple RNA species in live cells. Herein, we rationally designed a series of red&#8208;shifted chromophores and employed SELEX&#8208;independent engineering to develop a novel fluorogenic RNA aptamer, mSquash. mSquash displays specific and intense fluorescence upon binding with our red&#8208;shifted chromophore DFHBFPD (Ex/Em=501/624&#8197;nm). The mSquash/DFHBFPD allows orthogonal imaging of selected RNA targets alongside the established Broccoli/DFHBI&#8208;1T (Ex/Em=472/501&#8197;nm), facilitating multiplexed live cell imaging of various targets. Moreover, we expanded the application of fluorescent RNA to photoactive imaging by constructing two genetically encoded photoactivatable fluorescent RNAs for the first time. This innovative approach allows photoactivatable control of fluorescent RNAs via specific light wavelengths (365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm), enabling spatiotemporal dual&#8208;color imaging of RNAs in live cells. Our findings represent a significant advancement in fluorescent RNA&#8208;based orthogonal imaging and spatiotemporal analysis of RNAs.

         <title>Distinct Valence States of the [4Fe4S] Cluster Revealed in the Hydrogenase CrHydA1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the apo&#8208;form of FeFe&#8208;hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii two different paramagnetic states arise from a single iron&#8208;sulfur cluster. EPR experiments found them to interconvert based on redox&#8208;potentials and pH&#8208;levels. Computational methods attribute this to secondary&#8208;sphere residues adopting distinct conformations around the cluster.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters play a crucial role in electron transfer for many essential enzymes, including [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This study focuses on the [4Fe4S] cluster ([4Fe]H) of the minimal [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1) and employs advanced spectroscopy, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and QM/MM calculations. We provide insights into the complex electronic structure of [4Fe]H and its role in the catalytic reaction of CrHydA1, serving as paradigm for understanding [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. We identified at least two distinct species within the apo&#8208;form of CrHydA1, designated 4Fe&#8722;R and 4Fe&#8722;A, with unique redox potentials and pH sensitivities. Our findings revealed that these species arise from a complex interplay of structural heterogeneity and valence isomer rearrangements, influenced by second&#8208;sphere residues. We propose that the interconversion between 4Fe&#8722;R and 4Fe&#8722;A could provide control over electron transfer in the absence of accessory FeS clusters typically found in other [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The insights gained from this study not only enhance our understanding of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases but also provide a crucial foundation for future investigations into analysis of other FeS clusters across diverse biological systems.

         <title>COF&#8208;Assisted Construction of Steric Mass&#8208;Charge Channels to Boost Activity for High&#8208;Performance Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reduce the mass transport resistance ascribed to the stacking issues when assembling catalysts into membrane electrode assembly of fuel cells, the steric mass&#8208;charge channels are constructed by implanting porous and rigid sulfonated covalent organic frameworks into the catalytic layer, stimulating the catalytic activity and boosting the device performance for electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional lamellar materials disperse platinum sites and minimize noble&#8208;metal usage for fuel cells, while mass transport resistance at the stacked layers spurs device failure with a significant performance decline in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Herein, we implant porous and rigid sulfonated covalent organic frameworks (COF) into the graphene&#8208;based catalytic layer for the construction of steric mass&#8208;charge channels, which highly facilitates the activity of oxygen reduction reactions in both the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements and MEA device tests. Specifically, the normalized mass activity is remarkably boosted by 3.7&#8197;times to 1.56&#8197;A&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 after additions of suitable COF modifications in the RDE tests. Especially, an excellent maximum power density of 1.015&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is realized on the MEA in H2/Air condition, representing a 22&#8201;% improvement through such constructions of steric mass&#8208;charge channels. Meanwhile, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of fuel cells demonstrates only 0.8&#8201;% reductions after 10,000 cycles of stability tests. We further extended such methodology of constructing mass&#8208;charge channels to granular PtCo and commercial Pt/C catalysts, which demonstrates a significant impetus for stimulating the catalytic activity in fuel cells.

Especially, an excellent maximum power density of 1.015&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is realized on the MEA in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Air condition, representing a 22&#8201;% improvement through such constructions of steric mass-charge channels. Meanwhile, the open-circuit voltage of fuel cells demonstrates only 0.8&#8201;% reductions after 10,000 cycles of stability tests. We further extended such methodology of constructing mass-charge channels to granular PtCo and commercial Pt/C catalysts, which demonstrates a significant impetus for stimulating the catalytic activity in fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interstitial Doping in Ultrafine Nanocrystals for Efficient and Durable Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy is proposed for preparing heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon. The interstitial C and N atoms regulate the electronic structure of metal sites to promote the adsorption/dissociation process of HER intermediates, and accelerate the formation of high OER activity hydroxyl oxides on the surface.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre&#8208;deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9&#8197;nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization. The unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterojunction interface enhances electrocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the electronic regulation of metal sites by interstitial C and N atoms not only optimizes the adsorption&#8208;dissociation process in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also accelerates the surface reconstruction of hydroxyl oxides to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared coating achieved overpotentials of only 62&#8197;mV and 237&#8197;mV for the HER and OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolytes, and exhibited excellent OWS performance and long&#8208;term stability at high current densities. This work presents a new perspective for synthesizing TMISS nanocrystals and promotes their application in bifunctional electrocatalysts.

         <title>Lowering Linker Symmetry to Access Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Inverse Alkane/Alkene Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the linker desymmetrization and conformation engineering approach, a tritopic carboxylate linker with reduced symmetry and flexible triangular geometry was designed to construct three Zr&#8208;based MOFs, in which the resulting MOFs are potential adsorbents for relatively energy efficient inverse alkane/alkene separations.







Abstract
Enriching the structural diversity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great importance in developing functional porous materials with specific properties. New MOF structures can be accessed through the rational design of organic linkers with diverse geometric conformations, and their structural complexity can be enhanced by choosing linkers with reduced symmetry. Herein, a series of Zr&#8208;based MOFs with unprecedented topologies were developed through a linker desymmetrization and conformation engineering approach. A tritopic carboxylate linker with reduced symmetry and flexible triangular geometry was designed to construct three Zr&#8208;based MOFs (denoted as NU&#8208;57, NU&#8208;58, and NU&#8208;59) by modulating synthetic conditions. Notably, the conformational flexibility and reduced symmetry of the linker generated two unprecedented topologies in NU&#8208;58 and NU&#8208;59. Furthermore, solvent removal in NU&#8208;58 via thermal activation process produced missing linker defects. Finally, the adsorption behavior of these MOFs toward alkanes and alkenes was studied to gain insights into their structure&#8211;property relationships, which demonstrated that NU&#8208;57 and NU&#8208;58 exhibit unusual reverse selectivity for alkanes in alkane/alkene separations. Overall, this work highlights the rational design of linkers using a desymmetrization strategy as a powerful method to enrich the structural diversity of MOFs and to access novel MOFs with unique properties.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Regulation toward Zn Ions and Zn Substrate for All&#8208;Climate Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have first performed the structurally strategic deployment of atomically precise architectures by ligand engineering regulation which select zinc ion trapping ligands and zinc substrate binding ligands. The successful structural design of OZSBPC explores a novel well&#8208;defined structural design concept as one criterion for artificial interphase materials as well as reveals the structure&#8211;activity relationship.







Abstract
The regulation of artificial interphase for advanced Zn anode is an effective solution to achieve superior electrochemical performance for aqueous batteries. However, the deployment of atomically precise architectures and ligand engineering to achieve functionalization&#8208;oriented regulatory screening is lacking, which is hindered by higher requirements for synthetic chemistry and structural chemistry. Herein, we have first performed ligand engineering which selected zinc ion trapping ligands (&#8722;CH3) based on the coordination effect, and zinc substrate binding ligands (&#8722;N=N&#8722;C6H5) based on the electrostatic interaction. Correspondingly, octa nuclear Zn(II)&#8208;Siloxane&#8208;PhPz/BiPhPz/TriPhPz Cluster (OZSPC/OZSBPC/OZSTPC) are accurately synthesized, and OZSBPC is verified to serve as the most suitable artificial interphase via balancing the interactions with both Zn2+ and Zn substrate (&#8220;Zn&#8722;Zn effect&#8221;). Consequently, at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, the assembled OZSBPC&#8208;Zn symmetric cells run for 3000&#8197;h and the assembled full cells with OZSBPC&#8208;Zn anode could be stable for 10,000&#8197;cycles. The pouch cells using OZSBPC&#8208;Zn anode deliver a reversible capacity of ~1.2 Ah and the energy density of 41&#8197;Wh kgtotal&#8722;1 with excellent cycling performance. The successful structural design of OZSBPC explores a novel well&#8208;defined structural design concept as one criterion for artificial interface as well as motivates batteries systems to meet the requirements of industrialization.

         <title>Carving Metal&#8211;Organic&#8211;Framework Glass Based Solid&#8211;State Electrolyte Via a Top&#8211;Down Strategy for Lithium&#8211;Metal Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a top&#8208;down strategy to carve MOF glass&#8208;based polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs) with different pore structures. The carved MOF glass&#8208;based PSEs retains safety while also possessing fast ions transport performance. The introduced dispersed macropores can act like bridges, connecting nearby transport units to accelerate ion transport and provides rich transport path for ions transfer. Taking advantage of the cross&#8208;linked ion&#8208;conductive paths constructed by hierarchical pore structure, a high ionic conductivity of 1.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 was achieved for the porous MOF glass &#8208;PSEs.







Abstract
Traditional polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs) suffer from low ions conductivity, poor kinetics and safety concerns. Here, we present a novel porous MOF glass gelled polymer electrolyte (PMG&#8208;GPE) prepared via a top&#8208;down strategy, which features a unique three&#8208;dimensional interconnected graded&#8208;aperture structure for efficient ions transport. Comprehensive analyses, including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS), Solid&#8208;state 7Li magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS&#8197;NMR), Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and electrochemical tests, quantify the pore structures, revealing their relationship with ions conductivity that increases and then decreases as macropore proportion rises. The introduced dispersed macropores (17&#8201;% fraction) can serve as bridges, connecting adjacent transport units to accelerate ions transport. Taking advantage of the cross&#8208;linked ion&#8208;conductive paths constructed by hierarchical pore structures, the PMG&#8208;GPE achieves a high ions conductivity of 1.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Additionally, the robust mechanical properties of PMG&#8208;GPE effectively suppress dendrite growth and penetration, outperforming crystal MOF&#8208;based electrolytes. The prepared Li symmetric batteries with PMG&#8208;GPE demonstrate a high critical current density of 5.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (two times higher than crystal MOF&#8208;electrolytes) and stable cycling for over 6000&#8197;hours without short circuits. Furthermore, a Li/PMG&#8208;GPE/LFP half&#8208;cell exhibits exceptional capacity retention of 83.12&#8201;% after 1400 cycles. These findings highlight the potential of structural design in advancing PSE performance, offering a promising pathway for the commercialization of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

Comprehensive analyses, including time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), Solid-state &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS&#8197;NMR), Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and electrochemical tests, quantify the pore structures, revealing their relationship with ions conductivity that increases and then decreases as macropore proportion rises. The introduced dispersed macropores (17&#8201;% fraction) can serve as bridges, connecting adjacent transport units to accelerate ions transport. Taking advantage of the cross-linked ion-conductive paths constructed by hierarchical pore structures, the PMG-GPE achieves a high ions conductivity of 1.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the robust mechanical properties of PMG-GPE effectively suppress dendrite growth and penetration, outperforming crystal MOF-based electrolytes. The prepared Li symmetric batteries with PMG-GPE demonstrate a high critical current density of 5.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (two times higher than crystal MOF-electrolytes) and stable cycling for over 6000&#8197;hours without short circuits. Furthermore, a Li/PMG-GPE/LFP half-cell exhibits exceptional capacity retention of 83.12&#8201;% after 1400 cycles. These findings highlight the potential of structural design in advancing PSE performance, offering a promising pathway for the commercialization of high-performance solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Easily Water&#8208;Synthesisable Iron&#8208;Chloranilate Frameworks as High Energy and High&#8208;Power Cathodes for Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;chloranilate frameworks can be easily synthesised in aqueous solution. Lattice and coordination water removal under mild heating leads to a 2D honeycomb neutral framework, without counterions or solvent molecules, that displays high energy density as a cathode for sustainable lithium, sodium and potassium ion rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Achieving high battery performance from low&#8208;cost, easily synthesisable electrode materials is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) combining inexpensive transition metals and organic ligands are promising candidates for high&#8208;capacity cathodes. Iron&#8208;chloranilate&#8208;water frameworks are herein reported to be produced in aqueous media under mild conditions. Removal of reticular water from known [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O yields a new supramolecular metal&#8211;organic framework (SMOF), [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]. Removing coordination water, a new 2D honeycomb&#8208;like MOF forms, Fe2(CAN)3, stable without counterions and solvent. This MOF adopts the unusual ABC layer&#8208;stacking, as determined using a combination of ab initio random structure searching, electron diffraction, and Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data. Magnetometry, Mossbauer and Raman spectroscopy confirm that all three [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)x]&#8901;yH2O phases contain HS&#8208;Fe3+ and CAN2&#8722;, with magnetic ordering temperatures increasing (5&#8594;20&#8197;K) as the Fe&#8722;CAN connectivity increases. The SMOF and MOF show reversible (de)insertion of &gt;4Li+/f.u. at average 2,59&#8197;V and 2,76&#8197;V vs Li+/Li, respectively. [Fe2(CAN)3] achieves 146&#8197;mAh/g at 1&#8197;C, thus specific energy (563&#8197;Wh/kg) and power (446&#8197;W/kg) in Li half&#8208;cells competitive with conventional LiFePO4 (~580&#8197;Wh/kg and ~450&#8197;W/kg). Beyond Li, [Fe2(CAN)3] delivers 394&#8197;Wh/kg and 421&#8197;Wh/kg, for Na and K half&#8208;cells respectively, becoming a competitive cathode for sustainable batteries.

         <title>Spontaneous Hydrogen Production Coupled with Glucose Valorization through Modulating Au&#8208;Pt Coordination on Ultrathin Au3Pt Twin Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous hydrogen production coupled with selective glucose upgradation is achieved on ultrathin Au/Pt twin nanowires with tuned Au&#8722;Pt coordination. A low onset potential of ~0.07 VRHE for glucose oxidation is realized on Au3Pt twin nanowires with low loading through facilitated desorption of (C=O) intermediates via a &#8216;Pt&#8208;to&#8208;Au site transfer&#8217; path. An output voltage of 0.24&#8197;V is achieved on the cell with a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Organics electrooxidation coupled hydrogen production has attracted increasing attention due to the low operation voltage. Nevertheless, the spontaneous production of hydrogen coupled with organics valorization remains challenging. Herein, we develop ultrathin Au/Pt twin nanowire (NW) catalysts for both electrochemical glucose oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction towards a spontaneous hydrogen production system. The more Pt&#8722;Au coordination and the localized tensile strain generated on twin boundaries of Au3Pt NWs facilitate the selective glucose electro&#8208;oxidation to gluconic acid (GNA) compared to Pt NWs (a low onset potential of 0.07 VRHE and selectivity &gt;90&#8201;%). In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that Au3Pt NWs could reduce the energy barriers for GNA generation and alleviate the poisoning of Pt sites via a &#8242;Pt&#8208;to&#8208;Au site transfer&#8242; mechanism, which facilitates the desorption of strongly absorbed gluconolactone. Therefore, the asymmetric cell equipped with Au3Pt NWs catalysts realizes the spontaneous hydrogen production and glucose valorization with a peak power of 50&#8197;mW, which outputs the voltage of 0.24&#8197;V at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers for hydrogen production. The production of 1&#8197;kg H2 of the device is accompanied with $64.2 valorization of the anode product ($1200 ton&#8722;1 for GNA), and 5.36&#8197;kW h of generated electricity.

         <title>Super Strong Bonding at the Interface between ETL and Perovskite for Robust Flexible Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskites have great potential in flexible optoelectronic devices. A multifunctional organic salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (TPH), is applied to enhance the interface between the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer through two&#8208;site bonding, and accelerates the nucleation rate of perovskite. The flexible perovskite solar cells retained 92.3&#8201;% of the original efficiency after bending 25,000 cycles.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated great potential for flexible optoelectronic devices due to their superior optoelectronic properties and structural flexibility. However, mechanical deformation&#8208;induced cracks at the buried interface and delamination from the substrate severely constrain the optoelectronic performance and device lifespan. Here, we design a two&#8208;site bonding strategy aiming to reinforce the mechanical stability of the SnO2/perovskite interface and perovskite layer using a multifunctional organic salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (TPH). This approach significantly enhances the bonding at the buried interface between the electron transport layer and perovskite layer, which is demonstrated by TPH&#8208;modified SnO2/perovskite interface remaining intact after 10,000 bending cycles. Meanwhile, TPH mitigates void formation, enhances perovskite crystallinity at the buried interface, and inhibits ion migration inside the devices. Furthermore, incorporating TPH in perovskite bulk decreases the nucleation activation energy and accelerates nucleation, leading to high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Consequently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.64&#8201;% and 23.61&#8201;% are achieved for target flexible and rigid perovskite solar cells, respectively. The target flexible device retained 92.3&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 25,000 bending cycles. This approach provides a robust solution for enhancing the mechanical durability of flexible perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Superconjugated Anthraquinone Carbonyl&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Material for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthraquinone carbonyl&#8208;containing COF has been designed, synthesized and used as anode material for aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries. It is found that the anthraquinone carbonyls within the COF have a superconjugated structure, which enables them to form hydrogen bonds with NH4+ ions and act as active sites for NH4+ ion storage. In contrast, another class of carbonyls present in the same COF is prone to enol&#8208;keto tautomerism, which hinders hydrogen bond formation and is therefore not conducive to NH4+ ion storage.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently been emerged as promising anode candidates for aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AAIBs), but suitable COFs need to be developed and the energy storage mechanisms need to be further investigated. Here we report an anthraquinone carbonyl&#8208;containing COF as anode for AAIBs, which exhibits a high specific capacity of 141&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and good cycling stability with 90&#8201;% retention after 8000 cycles at 6&#8197;A g&#8722;1. We find that the anthraquinone carbonyls (denoted as C=O1) with superconjugated structure in the COF can form hydrogen bonds with NH4+ ions, thus serving as optimal sites and providing the major contribution to NH4+ ion storage, whereas another type of carbonyls (denoted as C=O2) in the same COF suffers from enol&#8208;keto tautomerism, which prevents the formation of hydrogen bonds and is therefore unfavourable for NH4+ ion storage. This is further verified by the theoretical calculations where the hydrogen bonding rate of C=O1 groups is much faster than that of C=O2. This work not only provides insights into understanding the mechanism of NH4+ ion storage, but also offers new ideas for the design of advanced COF&#8208;based materials for AAIBs.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Six&#8208;Membered Cyclic Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;Bromanes and &#955;3&#8208;Chloranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of six&#8208;membered hypervalent bromine(III) and chlorine(III) compounds through their diazonium salts is demonstrated. High yielding chemo&#8208; and regioselective O&#8208; and S&#8208;arylations are possible at ambient temperature, which can also be utilized for intermolecular or intramolecular biaryl synthesis by modifying the reaction conditions.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable advancements in hypervalent iodine chemistry, exploration of bromine and chlorine analogues remains in its infancy due to their difficult synthesis. Herein, we introduce six&#8208;membered cyclic &#955;3&#8208;bromanes and &#955;3&#8208;chloranes. Through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses and conformational studies, we delineate the crucial bonding patterns pivotal for the thermodynamic stability of these compounds. Notably, these investigations reveal pronounced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking phenomena within the crystal lattice of hypercoordinated bromine(III) and chlorine(III) species. Their reactivity profile is explored as they are radical precursors or electrophilic reagents in metal&#8208;free intermolecular biaryl couplings, O&#8208; and S&#8208;arylations, and Cu(I)&#8208;promoted intramolecular biaryl couplings which is complementary to the known reactivity of five&#8208;membered bromanes and chloranes. Mechanistic insights are provided, elucidating the pathways governing their reactivity and underscoring the potential in organic synthesis.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Triazolate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Diluted CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NICS&#8208;24, a novel Zn(II)&#8208;based diaminotriazolate oxalate MOF, exhibits significant improvements in CO2 adsorption at low concentrations compared to compositionally related CALF&#8208;20. In humid conditions, competitive adsorption of water and CO2 occurs, facilitated by hydrogen bonding interactions between the framework and guest molecules, as well as between the guest molecules themselves.







Abstract
Efficient CO2 capture at concentrations between 400&#8211;2000&#8197;ppm is essential for maintaining air quality in a habitable environment and advancing carbon capture technologies. This study introduces NICS&#8208;24 (National Institute of Chemistry Structures No. 24), a Zn&#8208;oxalate 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate framework with two distinct square&#8208;shaped channels, designed to enhance CO2 capture at indoor&#8208;relevant concentrations. NICS&#8208;24 exhibits a CO2 uptake of 0.7&#8197;mmol/g at 2&#8197;mbar and 25&#8201;&#176;C, significantly outperforming the compositionally related Zn&#8208;oxalate 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate &#8211; CALF&#8208;20 (0.17&#8197;mmol/g). Improved performance is attributed to amino&#8208;functions that enhance CO2 binding and enable superior selectivity over N2 and O2, achieving 8&#8208;fold and 30&#8208;fold improvements, respectively, in simulated CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 atmospheric ratios. In humid environments, NICS&#8208;24 retained structural integrity but exhibited an 85&#8201;% reduction in CO2 capacity due to competitive water adsorption. Breakthrough sorption experiments, atomistic NMR analysis, and DFT calculations revealed that water preferentially adsorbs over CO2 due to strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the framework. Gained understanding of the interaction between CO2 and H2O within the MOF framework could guide the modification via rational design with improved performance under real&#8208;world conditions.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Enabled Resistance to Water Matrix Components for Selective Degradation of Micropollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an ultraviolet/chlorine/graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;wrapped defective TiO2 system that creates a nanoconfined space on the TiO2 surface within GO, enabling the selective degradation of micropollutants by excluding natural organic matter and anions. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 promoted electron separation and oxygen adsorption, increasing hydroxyl radical concentrations 4.9 times within the nanoconfined space compared to the bulk solution.







Abstract
Despite recent substantial advances in water treatment, the ability to selectively degrade trace micropollutants in real waters with complex matrix components remains a grand challenge. Here we report rational crafting of graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;wrapped defective TiO2 composite catalysts that creates nanoscopic confinement over the TiO2 surface within GO, thereby enabling the selective degradation of micropollutants through effectively excluding natural organic matter (NOM) and anions from the nanoconfined catalytic sites. In contrast to unconfined counterparts, the nanoconfined composite catalysts retain high degradation efficiency when exposed to various concentrations of NOM and anions, even in real water samples. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 promote electron separation and oxygen adsorption, leading to a 4.9&#8208;fold increase in hydroxyl radical concentration within the nanoconfined space compared to the bulk solution. In situ X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy unveil the nanoconfined catalytic sites on the TiO2 surface, where micropollutants smaller than the pores of GO are effectively degraded, while NOM with a larger size is excluded by GO. Furthermore, the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts is well controlled due to the exclusion of NOM. This work provides a simple yet viable strategy for designing 2D material&#8208;wrapped catalysts to selectively degrade target micropollutants in complex real waters.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Aptamer Chimeras for Enhanced Autophagic Degradation of Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent aptamer chimeras (CApTEC) engineered with sulfonyl fluoride groups and an LC3 ligand has been developed for the targeted degradation of membrane proteins via the autophagy&#8208;lysosomal pathway. CApTECs form covalent bonds with target proteins, resulting in enhanced and prolonged protein degradation compared to the non&#8208;covalent designs, highlighting their potential for designing safe and effective therapeutics.







Abstract
Targeted degradation of membrane proteins represents an attractive strategy for eliminating pathogenesis&#8208;related proteins. Aptamer&#8208;based chimeras hold great promise as membrane protein degraders, however, their degradation efficacy is often hindered by the limited structural stability and the risk of off&#8208;target effects due to the non&#8208;covalent interaction with target proteins. We here report the first design of a covalent aptamer&#8208;based autophagosome&#8208;tethering chimera (CApTEC) for the enhanced autophagic degradation of cell&#8208;surface proteins, including transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and nucleolin (NCL). This strategy relies on the site&#8208;specific incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups onto aptamers to enable the cross&#8208;linking with target proteins, coupled with the conjugation of an LC3 ligand to hijack the autophagy&#8208;lysosomal pathway for targeted protein degradation. The chemically engineered CApTECs exhibit enhanced on&#8208;target retention and improved structural stability. Our results also demonstrate that CApTECs achieve remarkably enhanced and prolonged degradation of membrane proteins compared to the non&#8208;covalent designs. Furthermore, the CApTEC targeting TfR1 is combined with 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) for synergistic tumor therapy in a mouse model, leading to substantial suppression of tumor growth. Our strategy may provide deep insights into the LC3&#8208;mdiated autophagic degradation, affording a modular and effective strategy for membrane protein degradation and precise therapeutic applications.

         <title>Passivating Lattice Oxygen in ZnO Nanocrystals to Reduce its Interactions with the Key Intermediates for a Selective Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron has been successfully developed for selectively photocatalytic conversion of methane to methanol under mild conditions. The incorporation of Fe effectively lowered the center of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of the lattice oxygen within the nanocrystals, significantly attenuating the interaction between lattice oxygen and *CH3 intermediate.







Abstract
An inevitable overoxidation process is considered as one of the most challenging problems in the direct conversion of methane (CH4) to methanol (CH3OH), which is limited by the uncontrollable cracking of key intermediates. Herein, we have successfully constructed a photocatalyst, the Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron (Fe/ZnOHP), for the highly selective photoconversion of CH4 to CH3OH under mild conditions. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the introduction of Fe was able to decrease the energy level of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of lattice oxygen in ZnO nanocrystals. This passivation effect greatly weakened the interaction between *CH3 and lattice oxygen, thus facilitating the conversion of *CH3O to *CH3 intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *CH3O. As a result, Fe/ZnOHP exhibited excellent CH3OH generation rate (ca. 1009&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (ca. 96&#8201;%) in the photocatalytic conversion of CH4 at room temperature and low pressure.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Carbon Perovskite Solar Cells via Cathode Interface Engineering by using CuPc Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

This study introduces Cu(II) phthalocyanine as an effective hole&#8208;transporting material induces a structural transformation from monoclinic to a tetragonal phase, facilitating the passivation of the Perovskite surface in conjunction with carbon electrodes. These findings mark a substantial advancement in developing commercially competitive C&#8208;PSCs, successfully combining high power conversion efficiency and stability.







Abstract
Carbon perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) represent a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology that addresses the long&#8208;term operating stability needed to compete with commercial Si solar cells. However, the poor interface contacts between the carbon electrode and the perovskite result in a gap between C&#8208;PSC&#8242;s performances and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs based on metallic back electrodes. In this work, Cu (II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) was rediscovered as an effective hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) to be coupled with carbon electrodes. In particular, based on computational studies and VASP calculations, it is found that the tetragonal structure of CuPc could efficiently coordinated to perovskite (P) layer via N and Cu atoms to Pb and I atoms, respectively. By systematically optimizing the concentration of the CuPc HTL solution, and screening the coupling of CuPc HTL with two types of carbon electrodes, based on carbon black:graphite (C&#8208;G) mixture and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), respectively, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.4&#8201;% (the mean PCE value of 18.57 %) has been achieved. In addition, our cells exhibit satisfactory stability under thermal aging at 85&#176;C, showing less than 20% PCE loss after more than 200 hours. Furthermore, they maintain excellent shelf&#8208;life stability, with only 1.3% PCE loss over 20 days under ambient conditions (ISOS&#8208;D1). These findings represent a significant step forward in developing commercially competitive C&#8208;PSCs, as they combine both high PCE and stability.

         <title>A Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy to Simultaneously Boost the Site Density and Turnover Frequency of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treating a Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with NH4I vapor via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process leads to the simultaneous improvements in the turnover frequency via the I&#8208;doping induced electronic structure tuning and site density via the etching of carbon substrate by the in&#8197;situ generated NH3, resulting in superior oxygen reduction activity in both acidic and alkaline media.







Abstract
Site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) are the two fundamental kinetic descriptors that determine the oxygen reduction activity of iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) catalysts that represent the most promising alternatives to precious and scarce platinum. However, it remains a grand challenge to simultaneously optimize these two parameters in a single Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst. Here we show that treating a typical Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with ammonium iodine (NH4I) vapor via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process not only increases the surface area and porosity of the catalyst (and thus enhanced exposure of active sites) via the etching effect of the in&#8197;situ released NH3, but also regulates the electronic structure of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C moieties by the iodine dopants incorporated into the carbon matrix. As a result, the NH4I&#8208;treated Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst possesses both high values in the SD of 2.15&#215;1019 sites g&#8722;1 (&#215;2 enhancement compared to the untreated counterpart) and TOF of 3.71 electrons site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (&#215;3 enhancement) that correspond to a high mass activity of 12.78 A g&#8722;1, as determined by in&#8197;situ nitrite stripping technique. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits an excellent oxygen reduction activity in base with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.924&#8201;V and acceptable activity in acid with E1/2 =0.795&#8201;V, and superior power density of 249.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a zinc&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of Nanoscale Metal Borides for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borides based on alkaline earth to rare&#8208;earth metals can be synthesized using the flash Joule heating technique within 60&#8197;seconds. The ultrafast synthesis methods confer exceptional physicochemical properties upon these materials, thereby enabling diverse application potentials across various fields.







Abstract
Nanoscale metal borides, with exceptional physicochemical properties, have been attracted widespread attention. However, traditional synthesis methods of metal borides often lead to surface coking and large particle sizes. Herein, we have employed a flash Joule heating (FJH) technique to enable the ultrafast synthesis of metal boride nanomaterials. The synthesized materials encompass a wide range of diverse categories, including alkaline&#8208;earth metal borides (CaB6), transition metal borides (TiB2, VB2, CrB2, MoB, MoB2, MnB2, MnB4, FeB, CoB, NiB), noble&#8208;metal borides (RuB2, RuB1.1), and rare&#8208;earth metal borides (LaB6, CeB6). As an example, the RuB2 demonstrates highly desirable electrocatalytic performance for all&#8208;pH hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Especially, under the acidic condition, it exhibits an overpotential as low as 15&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8197;cm&#8722;2, with a nearly 100&#8201;% faradic efficiency. Additionally, in&#8197;situ Raman spectra confirm that both Ru and B sites serve as active sites for the HER. Moreover, the stability of RuB2 can be further enhanced by optimizing the microenvironments of the anolyte composition (H+, K+). More importantly, the experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the co&#8208;existence of H+ and K+ localized around the RuB2 plays a crucial role in further enhancing the stability.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Solid Additive Enables Eco&#8208;friendly All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency and Excellent Stability</title>

Green solvent&#8208;processed all&#8208;polymer solar cells utilizing the dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additive have achieved a record efficiency of 19.19&#8201;%.







Abstract
The optimization of morphology in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) often relies on the use of solvent additives. However, their tendency to remain trapped in the device due to high boiling points leads to performance degradation over time. In this study, we introduce a novel approach involving the design and synthesis of one dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additive featuring mono&#8208;brominated&#8208;asymmetric dithienothiophene (SL&#8208;1). Leveraging the synergistic effects of asymmetric substitution and core structures, fine&#8208;tuning the molecule dipole moment enhancing solid additive interactions with host materials, thereby regulating polymer aggregation and influencing blend morphology during device fabrication. This results in highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and a favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within all&#8208;polymer active layer. Our work achieved a record efficiency of 19.19&#8201;% in eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs, significantly outperforming SL&#8208;0 (18.37&#8201;%) and SL&#8208;2 (16.60&#8201;%), both featuring an asymmetric core. Furthermore, SL&#8208;1&#8208;treated all&#8208;PSCs retain over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2140&#8197;hours of operation, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime reaching 12400&#8197;hours. This represents a significant improvement in stability compared to devices treated with solvent additive (1&#8208;CN), which typically exhibits a T90 lifetime of 700&#8197;hours. Our findings underscore the efficacy of utilizing dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additives as a straightforward and viable strategy for optimizing all&#8208;polymer morphology. SL&#8208;1 represents a promising advancement towards eco&#8208;friendly fabrication and application of high&#8208;efficiency and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The optimization of morphology in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) often relies on the use of solvent additives. However, their tendency to remain trapped in the device due to high boiling points leads to performance degradation over time. In this study, we introduce a novel approach involving the design and synthesis of one dual-asymmetric solid additive featuring mono-brominated-asymmetric dithienothiophene (SL-1). Leveraging the synergistic effects of asymmetric substitution and core structures, fine-tuning the molecule dipole moment enhancing solid additive interactions with host materials, thereby regulating polymer aggregation and influencing blend morphology during device fabrication. This results in highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and a favorable phase-separated morphology within all-polymer active layer. Our work achieved a record efficiency of 19.19&#8201;% in eco-friendly all-PSCs, significantly outperforming SL-0 (18.37&#8201;%) and SL-2 (16.60&#8201;%), both featuring an asymmetric core. Furthermore, SL-1-treated all-PSCs retain over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2140&#8197;hours of operation, with an extrapolated &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Proximal Oblique&#8208;Packing of Heptamethine Cyanines through Spiro&#8208;Connection Boosts Triplet State Generation in Near&#8208;Infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped packing) of heptamethine cyanine dimer can induce multi&#8208;channel ultrafast triplet state generation with the rate constants up to ~1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, leading a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9&#8201;% upon excitation at 750&#8197;nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1&#8201;%).







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triplet dyes are the cornerstones of cutting&#8208;edge biomedical and material applications. The difficulty in rational development of triplet dyes increases exponentially as the absorption wavelength shifts deeper into the NIR range. Although classical H&#8208;/J&#8208;typed packing of NIR dyes has the potential to enhance intersystem crossing (ISC) compared with that in single&#8208;chromophore dyes, the triplet state quantum yields remain limited in such strategy. Herein, proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped) heptamethine cyanines (SZ780) through spiro&#8208;connection were achieved. Multi&#8208;channel ultrafast ISC were direct observed in SZ780 and a record high ISC rate constant (up to ~1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) is registered among all the reported NIR triplet dyes. SZ780 exhibits a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9&#8201;% upon excitation at 750&#8197;nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1&#8201;%) and nearly threefold increase compared to that of the H&#8208;packed dimer (SC780) (6.7&#8201;%). Moreover, SZ780 efficiently generates singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, inducing cancer cell apoptosis in vivo. These findings demonstrate that constructing V&#8208;aggregated dyes system by spiro&#8208;connection offers a powerful approach for the design of high&#8208;performance NIR triplet sensitizers.

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Methane to Ethane and Propane Using Cobalt&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Activated GaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type GaN nanowires with trace metallic cobalt clusters significantly boost the photocatalytic nonoxidative coupling of methane into ethane and propane with exceptional activity, selectivity and stability, which results from the critical methane activation and C&#8722;C coupling on Co clusters, accelerated by ultrafast photogenerated charge transfer from p&#8208;GaN, with GaN support enhancing methane activation and anti&#8208;overoxidation.







Abstract
The photocatalytic nonoxidative coupling of methane (PNOCM) offers a promising route to synthesize valuable C2+ hydrocarbons while minimizing side reactions. Oxide&#8208;based photocatalysts have been predominant in this field, but suffering from limited conversion rates, selectivity, and durability due to poor C&#8722;C coupling as well as overoxidation of CH4 by lattice oxygen. Here, we introduce an advancement in PNOCM for methane conversion into ethane and propane using GaN, one of the most produced semiconductors, together with trace amounts of metallic cobalt clusters (0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The photocatalytic system exhibits outstanding stability, maintaining performance over 110&#8197;hours, achieving conversion rates of approximately 192.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethane and ~17.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for propane, with virtually no coke byproducts detected, representing the highest activity and stability ever reported to our knowledge. This high activity is attributed to the critical methane activation and C&#8722;C coupling on Co cluster, which can be greatly accelerated via the ultrafast photogenerated charge transfer from p&#8208;GaN to Co cluster. Additionally, the GaN support further synergistically enhances methane activation by in situ generating N&#8722;H and O&#8722;H species under reaction, as well as provides a vital anti&#8208;overoxidation effect to CH4 for high selectivity and stability.

This high activity is attributed to the critical methane activation and C&#8722;C coupling on Co cluster, which can be greatly accelerated via the ultrafast photogenerated charge transfer from p-GaN to Co cluster. Additionally, the GaN support further synergistically enhances methane activation by in situ generating N&#8722;H and O&#8722;H species under reaction, as well as provides a vital anti-overoxidation effect to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for high selectivity and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;tandem Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia on Ultrathin&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Assembled Iron&#8208;Nickel Alloy Nanoflowers</title>

Electrochemical synthesis of an ultrathin&#8208;sheet&#8208;like nanoflower Fe&#8722;Ni (Fe80Ni20) alloy on a carbon cloth and electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 through an in&#8208;tandem mechanism.







Abstract
The development of alternative routes for ammonia (NH3) synthesis with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) is crucial for energy conservation and to achieve zero carbon emissions. Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to NH3 (e&#8208;NO3RRA) is a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive, fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven Haber&#8211;Bosch process. The implementation of this innovative NH3 synthesis technique requires an efficient electrocatalyst and in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of e&#8208;NO3RRA. In this study, we developed an ultrathin sheet (&#956;m) iron&#8211;nickel nanoflower alloy through electrodeposition and used it for e&#8208;NO3RRA under alkaline conditions. The prepared Fe&#8722;Ni alloy exhibited an FE of 97.28&#177;1.36&#8201;% at &#8722;238&#8197;mVRHE and an NH3 yield rate up to 3999.1&#177;242.59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experimental electrolysis, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations showed that the adsorption and reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; occurred on the Fe surface, whereas subsequent hydrogenation of NO2&#8722; to NH3 occurred preferentially on the Ni surface. The catalysts exhibited comparable FE for at least 10 cycles, with a long&#8208;term stability of 216&#8197;h. Electron paramagnetic resonance results confirmed that adsorbed hydrogen was consumed during e&#8208;NO3RRA. This work introduces a sustainable, robust, and efficient Fe&#8722;Ni alloy electrocatalyst, offering an environmentally friendly approach for synthesizing NH3 from NO3&#8722;&#8208;contaminated water.

         <title>Transient Allosteric Regulation of Catalysis by Effector Switching in a Pt2L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of alkynoic tosylamides by cage C is moderated by its guest effector. Dissipative acid/anhydride switching is initiated by carbodiimide addition. &#8216;Medium binding&#8217; guest fumaronitrile displaces weakly binding anhydride upon DIC addition, which is replaced by acid upon anhydride hydrolysis, thus modulating substrate cyclization under temporal control.







Abstract
The complexity of allosteric enzymatic regulation continues to inspire synthetic chemists seeking to emulate interconnected biological systems. In this work, a Pt2L4 cage capable of catalyzing the cyclization reaction of an alkynoic tosyl amide is orthogonally coupled to a diacid&#8208;catalyzed carbodiimide&#8208;hydration cycle. This new Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction is demonstrated to exhibit electronic regulation by inclusion of different guest effectors. The orthogonal diacid&#8208;catalyzed carbodiimide hydration cycle produces transiently diverse guests that influence the rate of the Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction to different extents. Further complexity can be introduced to the system through displacing the transiently&#8208;formed, weakly bound anhydride guest with the stronger binding fumaronitrile, affecting the catalytic rate to a larger extent for the duration of the orthogonal reaction cycle. The modulation of a Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction can thus be regulated transiently over the course of the reaction&#8212; either up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulating the turnover frequency (TOF)&#8212;via coupling with a temporally controllable orthogonal process. This study demonstrates that principles of allosteric enzymatic regulation can also be applied to simple artificial systems.

         <title>Pi&#8208;Stacking Geometry Directed Supramolecular Secondary Building Units Shaping Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks for Intensive NH3 Adsorption</title>

         <dc:description>
Parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8208;stacking of conjugated building blocks stabilizes supramolecular secondary building units (SSBUs) containing multiple NH4+ nodes, enabling the construction of robust porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks bearing Br&#248;nsted acid sites for intensive NH3 adsorption with an ultrahigh capacity.







Abstract
Exploiting supramolecular secondary building units (SSBUs) for developing porous crystalline materials represents an exciting breakthrough that extends the boundaries of reticular chemistry. However, shaping polynuclear clusters sustained by non&#8208;covalent interactions for the assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks remains a critical challenge. This study presents a novel strategy to stabilize SSBUs by tuning the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometry of conjugated building blocks, facilitating the creation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with tailored architectures for demanding gas separation. Specifically, parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stackings of aromatic heterocycles bearing carboxyls promote the formation of SSBUs bridged by ammonium cations [NH4+]8[COO&#8722;]8 (SSBU&#8208;4), enabling the assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with permanent porosity and structural diversity influenced by the solvent effect. Comparatively, the non&#8208;heterocyclic building units exhibit geometrically&#8208; or energetically&#8208;unfavorable &#960; stackings, resulting in fragile frameworks that collapse after removing disordered guests. Significantly, the heterocycle conjugated frameworks contain abundant open Br&#248;nsted acid N&#8722;H sites within pore channels, demonstrating remarkable NH3 adsorption ability among diverse industrial gases with a high capacity (275.7&#8197;mL/g, at 273&#8197;K, 100&#8197;kPa) as compared to reported porous molecular crystals.

         <title>Tunable Catalytic Vertex Wall Chemistry in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a tunable catalytic vertex&#8208;wall chemistry by incorporating diverse triazine and thiophene units, enabling the precise modulation of COF catalytic performance. This catalytic vertex&#8208;wall strategy facilitates the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic states, thereby enhancing intermediate adsorption characteristics and accelerating oxygen reduction reaction activity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) because of their unique structural properties and notable stability. To enhance both catalytic activity and selectivity, a variety of linkers and linkages have been investigated in efforts to precisely engineer COFs. However, the impact of vertex structures within COFs on ORR catalysis remains largely underexplored. Here, to modulate COF catalytic performance, we introduce tunable catalytic vertex wall chemistry by introducing diverse triazine and thiophene units. The catalytic vertex wall approach allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic surface states, leading to improved intermediate adsorption characteristics and accelerated ORR activity. Remarkably, the engineered COF achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V, surpassing COFs modified by linker or linkage strategies. Theoretical calculations suggest that this enhanced activity arises from the strong binding affinity of OOH* intermediates to carbon atoms adjacent to the thiophene vertex, facilitating OOH* reduction to a O2 molecule, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the ORR. These findings reveal the pivotal role of vertex wall engineering in conjugated COF frameworks, and offer critical insights to advance COFs design toward superior ORR performance.

The catalytic vertex wall approach allows the fine-tuning of electronic surface states, leading to improved intermediate adsorption characteristics and accelerated ORR activity. Remarkably, the engineered COF achieved a half-wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V, surpassing COFs modified by linker or linkage strategies. Theoretical calculations suggest that this enhanced activity arises from the strong binding affinity of OOH* intermediates to carbon atoms adjacent to the thiophene vertex, facilitating OOH* reduction to a O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, which is the rate-limiting step of the ORR. These findings reveal the pivotal role of vertex wall engineering in conjugated COF frameworks, and offer critical insights to advance COFs design toward superior ORR performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monomer Design Enables Mechanistic Mapping of Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Aromatic Thionolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BINOL&#8208;derived thionolactone exhibits exceptional anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerizability, which helps unravel the mechanistic imbalance between initiation and propagation, leading to first facile preparation of well&#8208;defined aromatic polythioesters. This approach also allows monomer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer atropisomerism transfer to create optically active polymeric materials with designed topology.







Abstract
Degradable chalcogenide polyesters, e.g., polythioesters (PTEs), typically exhibit improved thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of thionolactones, an intrinsically promising yet underexplored approach to accessing PTEs, however, is still limited by: intolerance of metal catalysts, inadequate control over chain growth, and the absence of aromatic system. Monomer design&#8208;boosted mechanistic studies may address the above challenges. Here, we present a new and highly reactive thionolactone synthesized from 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL). Our investigations into polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics have underscored the importance of rapid initiation, eventually leading to the discovery of tetrabutylammonium 2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;thiocarboxylate as a distinctive initiator that enables genuinely controlled and living polymerization of thionolactones. Ultimately, the atropisomerism inherent in BINOL has resulted in the creation of axially chiral PTE materials with tailored molecular weights, enantiomeric compositions, and topologies.

         <title>Disturbance&#8208;Triggered Instant Crystallization Activating Bioinspired Emissive Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Pennatula phosphorea, a new class of smart luminescence gels is constructed by integrating hydrophilic polymeric networks, metastable supersaturated salt and aggregated fluorophores in one system. Upon external disturbance such as gentle touch, the composite gels demonstrate Pennatula phosphorea&#8208;like emission including intense fluorescence and long&#8208;lived afterglow resulting from their instant soft&#8208;rigid state transition.







Abstract
Many marine organisms feature sensitive sensory&#8208;perceptual systems to sense the surrounding environment and respond to disturbance with intense bioluminescence. However, it remains a great challenge to develop artificial materials that can sense external disturbance and simultaneously activate intense luminescence, although such materials are attractive for visual sensing and intelligent displays. Herein, we present a new class of bioinspired smart gels constructed by integrating hydrophilic polymeric networks, metastable supersaturated salt and fluorophores containing heterogenic atoms. Upon external disturbance, the composite gels undergo an instant and reversible soft&#8208;rigid state transition, simultaneously turning on intense fluorescence and activating ultralong afterglow emission with a maximum lifetime of 877.15&#8197;ms. The experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the disturbance&#8208;induced luminescence mainly results from the geometrical confinement of aggregated fluorophores and enhanced molecular interactions to immensely suppress the non&#8208;radiative dissipation. Given their versatile and sensitive disturbance&#8208;responsiveness, dynamic interactive painting and 3D smart optical displays are demonstrated. This study paves a new avenue to achieve disturbance&#8208;sensing soft materials and promotes the development of smart visual sensors and interactive optical displays.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;CO2 Battery at Elevated Temperatures: Advances with Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne and Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with high stability at elevated temperatures were assembled using fluorine&#8208;graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvent. At temperature of 80&#8201;&#176;C, the batteries could operate at high current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1 and stably run for 240 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1, the corresponding pouch cell showed high energy density of 536&#8197;Wh&#8901;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries demonstrate promising prospects in terms of high&#8208;density energy storage and efficient CO2 fixation. However, their practical application is impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics and leakage of volatile and flammable organic electrolytes, especially for high temperature application scenarios, leading to large polarization and limited cycling stability. Herein, we fabricate a highly rechargeable and stable Li&#8208;CO2 battery with high temperature adaptability by employing fluorine&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvents. The employed FGDY, which possesses homogeneous sp&#8208;hybridized carbon, high specific surface area, and uniform pores, significantly enhances the battery reaction kinetics. Consequently, the fabricated Li&#8208;CO2 batteries operate consistently at a large current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C while showcasing high discharge capacity of 29050&#8197;mAh&#8901;g&#8722;1 along with excellent cycling stability. As proof of concept, Li&#8208;CO2 pouch cells achieve a high energy density of 536&#8197;Wh&#8901;kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of the device, and show outstanding cycling stability at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This study underscores the effectiveness of graphdiyne&#8208;derived carbon catalysts in achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Highly Tension&#8208;Strained Copper Concentrates Diluted Cations for Selective Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly tension&#8208;strained copper creates an electron&#8208;rich surface that concentrates diluted cations, which enables highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion under pH&#8197;1 electrolyte with 1&#8197;M potassium ions, showing 44.3&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward C2H4 over 100&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cell voltage of 3.1 volts in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane electrolyser.







Abstract
Electrolysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) in acid offers a promising route to overcome CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, but requires concentrated alkali cations (typical &#8805;3&#8197;M) to mitigate the trade&#8208;off between low pH and high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate, causing salt precipitation. Here we report a strategy to resolve this problem by introducing tensile strain in a copper (Cu) catalyst, which can selectively reduce CO2 to valuable multicarbon products, particularly ethylene, in a pH&#8197;1 electrolyte with 1&#8197;M potassium ions. We find that the tension&#8208;strained Cu creates an electron&#8208;rich surface that concentrates diluted potassium ions, contributing to CO2 activation and HER suppression. With this catalyst, we show constant ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 44.3&#8201;% over 100&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cell voltage of 3.1 volts in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane electrolyser. Moreover, selective electrosynthesis of ethylene oxide using the as&#8208;produced ethylene was demonstrated in an integrated system.

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;enhanced Ion Recognition of Triazine Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;resolution Li+/Mg2+ Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking biological ion channels constructed negative electrical energy Well in the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane and precisely modulated the pore environment, which endowed the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane with excellent ion recognition capability. This property enabled the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane to exhibit high&#8208;precision Li+/Mg2+ separation performance, realizing the efficient extraction of lithium resources.







Abstract
The precise and rapid extraction of lithium from salt&#8208;lake brines is critical to meeting the global demand for lithium resources. However, it remains a major challenge to design ion&#8208;transport membranes with accurate recognition and fast transport path for the target ion. Here, we report a triazine covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with high resolution for Li+ and Mg2+ that enables fast Li+ transport while almost completely inhibiting Mg2+ permeation. The remarkably high rejection of Mg2+ by the COF membrane is achieved via imposed ion dehydration and the construction of the energy well. The proper hydrophilic environment of the COF channel promotes the dissociation of Li+ from the negatively charged functional groups, allowing Li+ for hopping transport supported by the sulfonate side&#8208;chains to shorten the diffusion path of Li+. Under high&#8208;salinity electrodialysis conditions, the COF membrane demonstrates robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance (No Mg2+ were detected in the collected solution), achieving efficient lithium recovery and high product purity (Li2CO3: 99.3&#8201;%). This membrane design strategy enables high energy efficiency and powerful lithium extraction in the electrodialysis lithium extraction process, and can be generalized to other energy and separation related membranes.

         <title>W&#8208;Mediated Electron Accumulation in Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W Motifs Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn and W were co&#8208;doped to establish a W&#8208;mediated electron accumulation strategy. The incorporation of highly electronegative W facilitates the efficient capture of electrons released by sacrificial Zn during the OER process. These electrons are subsequently directed to the Ru site, forming a stable Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W motif and significantly enhancing the anti&#8208;overoxidation performance of the Ru active site







Abstract
The development of efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is crucial for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology, especially in the pursuit of non&#8208;iridium alternatives. Herein, we report a Zn, W co&#8208;doped Ru3Zn0.85W0.15Ox (RZW) ternary oxide catalyst that exhibits a low overpotential of 200&#8197;mV and remarkable stability for over 4000&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4. The incorporation of highly electronegative W facilitates the efficient capture of electrons released from the sacrificial Zn species during OER, and subsequently mediated to Ru sites. The observed enhancement in electron density within the stable Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W motifs substantially improves the anti&#8208;overoxidation properties of the Ru active sites. Our findings highlight the importance of strategic metal doping in modulating the electronic structure of OER catalysts during operation, thereby facilitating the development of practical and long&#8208;lasting water electrolysis technologies.

         <title>Saturated F2&#8208;Rings from Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating fluorine into aliphatic rings induces significant changes in molecular conformation, acidity/basicity, and lipophilicity. A general method has been developed to transform exocyclic alkenes into saturated F2&#8208;rings. This reaction utilizes the reagent C6F5I(OAc)2, enabling the straightforward synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated macrocyclic, fused, spiro, bridged, and natural product&#8208;derived structures. The practicality of this protocol is demonstrated through several decagram&#8208;scale syntheses.

         <title>Breaking Anionic Solvation Barrier for Safe and Durable Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries Under Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through breaking the anion solvation barrier, a weakly solvating fluorinated electrolyte with intrinsic nonflammability is designed for advanced potassium&#8208;ion batteries with simultaneously enhanced safety and durability under ultrahigh&#8208;voltage operation. As proof of concept, a representative KVPO4F cathode sustains 1600 cycles with 84.4&#8201;% of capacity retention under a cutoff voltage of 4.95&#8197;V due to synergistic interfacial modulation.







Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) with cost competitiveness represent a viable route towards high energy battery systems. Nevertheless, rapid capacity decay with poor Coulombic efficiencies remains intractable, mainly attributed to interfacial instability from aggressive potassium metal anodes and cathodes. Additionally, high reactivity of K metal and flammable electrolytes pose severe safety hazards. Herein, a weakly solvating fluorinated electrolyte with intrinsically nonflammable feature is successfully developed to enable an ultrahigh&#8208;voltage (up to 5.5&#8197;V) operation. Through breaking the anionic solvation barrier, synergistic interfacial modulation can be achieved by the formation of robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces on both the cathode and anode. As proof of concept, a representative KVPO4F cathode can sustain 1600 cycles with 84.4&#8201;% of capacity retention at a high cutoff voltage of 4.95&#8197;V. Meanwhile, K plating/stripping process in our designed electrolyte also demonstrates optimized electrochemical reversibility and stability with effectively inhibited potassium dendrites. These findings underscore the critical impact of anion&#8208;dominated solvation configuration on synergistic interfacial modulation and electrochemical properties. This work provides new insights into rational design of ultrahigh&#8208;voltage and safe electrolyte for advanced PIBs.

A highly solvating electrolyte strategy using hexamethylphosphoramide is proposed to elucidate the dissociation&#8211;precipitation chemistry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and its correlation to the dynamic evolution of cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI), which leads to effective regulation of the LiPSs solvation to initiate a radical&#8208;assisted conversion pathway, control of three&#8208;dimensional Li2S electrodeposition to boost sulfur utilization, and formation of a stable CEI to enhance reversibility.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries has been regarded as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries is still hindered by the unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase and the early passivation of charge product (Li2S), leading to poor cycling stability and low S utilization. Herein, we propose an electrolyte engineering strategy using highly solvating hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) as a co&#8208;solvent to elucidate the dissociation&#8211;precipitation chemistry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The multimode optical spectroscopies confirm that this electrolyte engineering is able to effectively regulate the solvation of LiPSs to initiate a radical&#8208;assisted conversion pathway and control three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Li2S electrodeposition to boost sulfur utilization. More importantly, the dynamic evolution of cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase, featuring with S&#8208;/P&#8208;containing species, is also assessed by both distribution of relaxation times technology and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which can suppress the passivation of Li2S to enhance conversion reversibility. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a Li&#8722;S cell with high S loading mass of 7.75&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 demonstrates an extremely high area capacity of 7.86&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 1.30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, representing a significant advancement in promoting the development of practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Aminopeptidase N&#8208;Activated Self&#8208;immolative Hydrogen Sulfide Donor for Inflammatory Response&#8208;Specific Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor AlaCOS could undergo a self&#8208;immolative process once activated by aminopeptidase N, an inflammatory biomarker, to generate H2S via carbonyl sulfide (COS), showing potent capacity to reduce cellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response. By reprogramming macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, this compound could accelerate wound healing significantly.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays crucial inflammatory modulating roles, representing a promising candidate for anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies. However, current H2S delivery approaches lack sufficient specificity against inflammatory response. Herein, regarding the overexpressed aminopeptidase N (APN) at the inflammation sites, an APN&#8208;activated self&#8208;immolative carbonyl sulfide (COS)/H2S donor (AlaCOS) was developed for inflammatory response&#8208;specific H2S delivery. The compound showed sustained H2S generation upon APN activation in the presence of carbonic anhydrase (CA), and the responsiveness could be well regulated by modulating the amino acid sequence. Due to the inflammatory response&#8208;specific sustained H2S delivery, AlaCOS provided potent anti&#8208;inflammatory capability, which was further validated by RNA sequencing. In vivo experiments on a full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wound murine model also showed the strong promoting effect on wound healing, mainly due to the regulation of the inflammatory response by AlaCOS. By introducing a caged coumarin fluorophore to the molecular architecture, self&#8208;reporting fluorescence could be generated accompanied with APN&#8208;mediated COS/H2S release, which achieved the visualization of H2S delivery in vitro and in vivo. This work not only offers a useful tool for studying the bioactivity of H2S on inflammation, but also provides new insights for developing novel therapies to cope with inflammation&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Amorphization Stabilizes Te&#8208;Based Aqueous Batteries via Confining Free Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapped with the sluggish reduction kinetics, the easy dissolution of Te4+ species, and a controversial energy storage mechanism, achieving complete and stable hypervalent Te0/Te4+ electrochemistry in an aqueous environment is challenging. Herein, an amorphization strategy is introduced to stabilize aqueous TeO2/Te electrochemistry via confining free water, triggering impressive Te redox utilization, high&#8208;rate performance, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Tellurium (Te), with its rich valence states (&#8722;2 to +6), could endow aqueous batteries with potentially high specific capacity. However, achieving complete and stable hypervalent Te0/Te4+ electrochemistry in an aqueous environment poses significant challenges, owing to the sluggish reduction kinetics, easy dissolution of Te4+ species, and a controversial energy storage mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a crystallographic regulation strategy for robust aqueous Te redox electrochemistry. With strong hydrogen bonding, NH4Ac confines free water, prompting the amorphization of TeO2 (a&#8208;TeO2). In&#8197;situ synchrotron characterization, spectroscopy analysis, electrochemical evaluation, and theoretical calculations reveal a specific 4&#8201;e&#8722; solid&#8208;solid transition pathway (Te to a&#8208;TeO2) with accelerated diffusion and charge transfer kinetics, attributed to a closer unoccupied electron orbital to the Fermi level and a reduced water desorption energy barrier in a&#8208;TeO2. Impressively, the a&#8208;TeO2/Te redox exhibits a high reversible capacity of 834&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (99% of Te redox utilization), superior rate performance (644&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and an ultralong lifespan (over 3000 cycles). These findings prove a new tactic to advance aqueous Te redox electrochemistry toward high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

         <title>Regulating Water Molecules via Bioinspired Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired covalent organic framework membrane enables highly reversible Zn metal anode: Drawing inspiration from biological transmembrane transport mechanism, a covalent organic framework membrane is developed to tailor active water molecules at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The derived Zn anode achieves improved transport kinetics, oriented Zn deposition, and enhanced cyclic lifespan.







Abstract
The Zn metal anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) faces daunting challenges including undesired water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and sluggish ion migration kinetics. Herein, we develop three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with bioinspired ion channels toward stabilized Zn anodes. These COFs, featured by zincophilic pyridine&#8208;N sites, enable effective regulation of water molecules at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Systematic experimental analysis and theoretical simulations reveal the optimized COF&#8208;320N membrane functions as ion pumps, accordingly facilitating Zn2+ transport and inhibiting direct contact between Zn anode and free water molecules. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired strategy achieves improved Zn2+ transference number (0.61), rapid de&#8208;solvation kinetics, and suppressed hydrogen evolution. The assembled Zn||MnO2 pouch cell integrated with COF&#8208;320N membrane exhibits favorable electrochemical performances. Such a bioinspired concept for optimizing Zn anodes opens new pathways in developing advanced energy storage devices.

         <title>Liquid Crystal&#8208;Engineered Polydimethylsiloxane: Enhancing Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity through High Grafting Density of Mesogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel strategy to enhance the intrinsic thermal conductivity of liquid crystal polydimethylsiloxane by achieving high grafting density of mesogens, resulting in the high intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) of 0.56&#8197;W/(m&#8901;K), showing a 180&#8201;% improvement over ordinary polydimethylsiloxane while maintaining excellent electrical and thermal properties.







Abstract
The increasing power and integration of electronic devices have intensified serious heat accumulation, driving the demand for higher intrinsic thermal conductivity in thermal interface materials, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Grafting mesogens onto PDMS can enhance its intrinsic thermal conductivity. However, the high stability of the PDMS chain limits the grafting density of mesogens, restricting the improvement in thermal conductivity. This work proposes a new strategy to efficiently introduce mesogens onto PDMS through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of liquid crystal cyclosiloxane and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, enhancing the grafting density. The relationship between the grafting density and intrinsic thermal conductivity of liquid crystal polydimethylsiloxane (LC&#8208;PDMS) is investigated by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. Based on the simulation results, LC&#8208;PDMS with enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity is synthesized. When the grafting density of mesogens reaches 77.4&#8201;%, its intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) increases to 0.56&#8197;W/(m&#8901;K), showing a 180.0&#8201;% improvement over ordinary PDMS (0.20&#8197;W/(m&#8901;K)). The LC&#8208;PDMS also exhibits the low dielectric constant (&#1013;, 2.69), low dielectric loss tangent (tan&#948;, 0.0027), high insulation performance (volume resistivity, 3.51&#215;1013&#8197;&#937;&#8901;cm), excellent thermal stability (heat resistance index, 217.8&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 137.4&#176;), fulfilling the comprehensive requirements of advanced thermal interface materials.

This work proposes a new strategy to efficiently introduce mesogens onto PDMS through ring-opening copolymerization of liquid crystal cyclosiloxane and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, enhancing the grafting density. The relationship between the grafting density and intrinsic thermal conductivity of liquid crystal polydimethylsiloxane (LC-PDMS) is investigated by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. Based on the simulation results, LC-PDMS with enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity is synthesized.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: A Metastable State Facilitates Low Temperature CO Oxidation over Pt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable surface states play a crucial yet poorly understood role in catalysis. However, they are difficult to isolate and even harder to identify. In their Communication (e202423880), Christian Reece et al. successfully isolate and identify a highly active metastable surface state over Pt nanoparticles, which forms after CO desorbs from well&#8208;coordinated Pt sites. The cover image is a stylised representation of how this state emerges following CO desorption.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Molecular Design for Dual Circularity: Polyester with Complementary Mechanical and Chemical Recyclability under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual circularity concept to prevent plastic waste accumulation is presented by Yue Han and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202421431). The concept is exemplified for triarylmethane&#8208;containing polyesters and their facile closed&#8208;loop recyclability via complementary mechanical and chemical routes. For the polymers with dual circularity, it is recommended to proceed with mechanical recycling when we can, and switch to chemical recycling when we must.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction to ammonia occurs with exceptional performance on ultrathin&#8208;sheet&#8208;assembled Fe80Ni20 nanoflowers, as described by Jason Lam et al. in their Research Article (e202500167). Mechanistic studies revealed that NO3&lt;M&#8208;&gt; preferentially adsorbs and is reduced to NO2&lt;M&#8208;&gt; on the Fe surface. Subsequently, NO2&lt;M&#8208;&gt; is efficiently hydrogenated to NH3 on the Ni surface. This in&#8208;tandem mechanism between Fe and Ni significantly enhances the electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&lt;M&#8208;&gt; to NH3.

In their Research Article (e202419905), Andrey S. Klymchenko et&#8197;al. introduce a dynamic artificial receptor for neurotransmitter dopamine that synergically combines molecular recognition with dynamic imine bond formation of a fluorescent dye inside a lipid nanoreactor, triggering its emission color change. This nanoprobe enables dopamine detection with remarkable selectivity without interference of competing biogenic amines and biological fluids, such as blood serum, plasma, urine and cell lysate.

A nacre&#8208;inspired composite membrane with &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure is reported by J&#252;rgen Caro, Heqing Jiang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202416919). Dominant &#8220;brick&#8221; microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework nanoparticles allow fast H2 transport, while the &#8220;mortar&#8221; coordination polymer interlayer combined with an adhesive interface reduces the intercrystalline transport and provides a highly H2 selective transport pathway, resulting in an exceptional H2/CO2 separation performance.

         <title>Towards Surface&#8208;Enhanced Homogeneous Catalysis: Tailoring the Enrichment of Metal Complexes at Ionic Liquid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article reviews strategies to deliberately anchor metal complexes at the liquid/vacuum&#8197;(gas) interface of ionic liquids in a buoy&#8208;like fashion; this surface enrichment is achieved by targeted functionalization of the catalytic complexes with surface&#8208;active ligands and the appropriate choice of the ionic liquid.







Abstract
When talking about homogeneous catalyst systems, it has long been assumed that the system at hand consists of a transition metal complex in solution with the liquid interface representing the composition of the bulk solution. Now, in light of considerable developments in the study of metal complexes dissolved in ionic liquids with their negligible vapor pressures, more detailed studies of the composition at the liquid/gas interface became possible. These investigations revealed pronounced surface enrichment and segregation effects of high relevance for practical applications. This article reviews recent advancements in tailoring the interfacial composition of ionic liquid&#8208;based catalytic systems. A particular focus is dedicated to surface enrichment phenomena, and a variety of parameters are presented for deliberate control of the local concentration of the complexes at the surface, that is, the nature of the ligands, the bulk concentration, the temperature, and the nature of the IL solvent. As experimental methods, angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and vacuum&#8208;based pendant&#8208;drop surface tension measurements were applied. The reviewed results are intended to provide the basis for the advancement of catalytic systems with high surface areas, such as in supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis, where the interface design is directly interconnected with catalytic performance.

         <title>From Autonomous Chemical Micro&#8208;/Nanomotors to Rationally Engineered Bio&#8208;Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses diverse chemical reactions that propel out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium micro&#8208;/nanomotors, emphasizing the emerging implications of their products on biological systems. The key applications discussed include neural modulation, ROS regulation, synergistic tumor therapy, antibacterial strategies, and tissue regeneration. This review suggests that these advancements represent a significant shift towards active therapies that transcend conventional approaches.







Abstract
Developing micro&#8208;/nanomotors that convert a chemical energy input into a local gradient field and motion is an appealing but challenging task that holds particular promise for the intersection of materials and nanoengineering. Over the past two decades, remarkable advancements have refined these out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium chemically powered micro&#8208;/nanomotors, enabling them to orchestrate in situ chemical transformations that dynamically change local environments. The ionic products, radicals, gases, and electric fields from these active materials reshape the microenvironment, paving the way for ecofriendly disease interventions. This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions that propel these energy&#8208;consuming micro&#8208;/nanomotors and elucidates the emerging implications of their products on biological systems. Particular emphasis has been placed on their potential for neural modulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, synergistic tumor therapy, antibacterial strategies, and tissue regeneration. Collectively, these sketches provide a landscape of therapeutic modalities, heralding a new era of biomedicine. By harnessing the in situ product field of this active matter, we envision a paradigm shift toward active therapies that transcend conventional approaches, promising breakthroughs in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

Composite membranes with nacre&#8208;like &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure were developed. Dominant &#8220;brick&#8221; microporous ZIF&#8208;8 allows fast H2 transport, while &#8220;mortar&#8221; Zn&#8208;polyethyleneimine coordination polymer interlayer combined with adhesive interface reduces intercrystalline transport and provides highly H2 selective transport pathway, resulting in a record&#8208;high H2 permeability along with an excellent H2/CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with high stability and porosity is a promising candidate for hydrogen separation membranes. However, most ZIF&#8208;8 polycrystalline membranes exhibit low H2/CO2 (kinetic diameters of 2.9/3.3&#8197;&#197;) mixed gas selectivity, due to the intercrystalline defects and the unprecise molecular sieving originated from framework flexibility of ZIF&#8208;8 structure with a theoretical aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197;. Here, inspired by nacre's &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure, we develop mixed matrix type composite membranes in which dominant crystalline ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (bricks) are interconnected by ultrathin zinc coordination polymer interlayers (mortar) via self&#8208;assembling. Driven by coordination bonds between Zn2+ from precursor colloid and branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a zinc coordination polymer network is formed to connect ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles through interactions between Zn2+ of coordination polymer and surface terminal groups on ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles, thus eliminating intercrystalline void defects and providing a highly selective H2 transport pathway. Meanwhile, the micropores and large cavities in ZIF&#8208;8 allow fast H2 transport. Benefitting from both highly selective pathway and fast H2 transport through porous ZIF&#8208;8, the optimized ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;PEI membrane exhibits a record&#8208;high H2 permeability of ~1.78&#215;105 Barrer with a high mixed gas H2/CO2 selectivity of 176, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. This bioinspired multifunctional membrane expands the scope of molecular sieving membrane.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation to Ethylene with High Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;doped copper catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH), achieving an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at &#8722;0.62&#8197;V vs. RHE, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Zinc doping significantly promotes acetylene adsorption and activation, accelerates reaction kinetics, and effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and over&#8208;hydrogenation, offering a highly efficient strategy for sustainable ethylene production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) provides a petroleum&#8208;independent strategy for ethylene production. However, the challenges of high overpotentials and strong hydrogen evolution competition reaction over conventional electrocatalysts at industrial current densities result in substantial energy consumption, limiting the practical application of EASH technology. Herein, zinc&#8208;doped copper catalysts are designed and prepared via a facile impregnation and electroreduction relay method. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;2.7Zn catalyst exhibits an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% and a reaction potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing the previously reported electrocatalysts. The combined results of experimental tests and theoretical calculations demonstrate zinc doping significantly enhances acetylene adsorption and accelerates reaction kinetics, leading to a notable decrease in overpotential. Furthermore, the increased *H&#8208;*H binding energy barrier and the improved ethylene desorption on Cu&#8208;2.7Zn effectively suppress hydrogen evolution and acetylene over&#8208;hydrogenation, contributing to the enhancement of ethylene Faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Pyridoxal&#8208;Inspired Photo&#8208;Decarboxylase Catalysis: Photochemical Decarboxylation of Unprotected Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the decarboxylation (deCO2) of unprotected amino acids inspired by pyridoxal&#8208;dependent decarboxylases is described. Catalytic condensation of amino acids onto a pyridoxal&#8208;mimicking organocatalyst enables hyperconjugation&#8208;enabled photoexcitation can occur, which in combination with a thiol hydrogen atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) co&#8208;catalyst facilitates a net biomimetic transformation via non&#8208;natural photo&#8208;decarboxylase catalysis.







Abstract
A photochemical organocatalytic method for the protodecarboxylation of unprotected amino acids is reported. Inspired by pyridoxal 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent decarboxylase enzymes, the catalytic activation of amino acid substrates by 3&#8208;hydroxyisonicotinaldehyde enables a photochemical decarboxylation event, which can be leveraged in combination with a thiol co&#8208;catalyst. The necessary and sufficient structural features of the pyridoxal&#8208;like framework for photoactivity are determined using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy. A broad scope of unprotected amino acids can be decarboxylated in this system, with selectivity between multiple carboxylates realized on the possible basis of hyperconjugation. The ability to engage simple amino acids in decarboxylative functionalization at ambient conditions using a pyridoxal&#8208;mimicking organocatalyst enables new possibilities for the translation of biogenic amino acids into medicinally valuable amines.

         <title>Metabolism&#8208;inspired chemical reaction networks for chemically driven dissipative oligoesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Behind the seemingly simple process of dissipative oligoesterification is a complex network of chemical reactions.&#160;Within this network, oligoesters undergo parasitic exchanges, consuming one another to sustain the system's dynamic state&#8212;an emergent behavior reminiscent of the self&#8208;sustaining processes observed in natural metabolism.







Abstract
Metabolism is a complex network of chemical reactions in which transient biomolecules are continuously produced and degraded. Mimicking this dynamic process in synthetic systems poses a considerable challenge, as it requires designs that enable the exchange of energy and matter among transient molecules. In this study, we explored a chemically driven oligoesterification process operating within a highly intricate reaction network and constructed a dynamic library of transient oligoesters. Our kinetic analysis uncovered an intriguing phenomenon: oligoesters undergo parasitic exchanges, consuming one another to sustain the system's dynamics before reaching thermodynamic equilibrium. This discovery opens new opportunities for designing synthetic systems that replicate the complexity and self&#8208;sustaining behavior of metabolic processes.

         <title>Selective and Efficient Upcycling of Polyesters from Waste Plastic Blends Enabled by a Rationally Designed Manganese Pincer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient hydrogenative upcycling of polyesters was developed enabled by rationally designed PNNH&#8208;pincer manganese catalysts, which not only allow the upcycling of single&#8208;component polyester, but also enable the selective hydrogenolysis of polyester from waste plastic blends or contaminants into highly valuable oxygenated products under very mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies supported that the high efficiency of this protocol is attributed to the improved stability and reactivity of the catalyst with the extended &#960;&#8208;system and the N&#8722;H moiety on the side arm.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new class of earth&#8208;abundant pincer manganese catalysts that not only enable the efficient conversion of single&#8208;component post&#8208;consumer polyesters with a turnover number (TON) of up to 5300, but more importantly, allow the selective upcycling of polyesters from waste plastic blends (e.g., nylon, PA; polyethylene, PE; polyurethane, PU; polyvinyl chloride, PVC; cotton) or contaminants such as pigment, aluminum, or glass into highly valuable oxygenated products under mild conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations revealed that the exceptional efficiency of this protocol is due to the use of rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based PNNH&#8208;type Mn complexes with an extended &#960;&#8208;system and an N&#8722;H moiety on the side arm to simultaneously enhance the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. In addition, the incorporation of dual metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) relay catalysis more effectively facilitates the key steps of this transformation, including H2 activation and hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted hydride transfer.

         <title>A Metastable State Facilitates Low Temperature CO Oxidation over Pt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining transient pressure pulse experiments with Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy a high&#8208;activity metastable state was identified on Pt nanoparticles, characterised by its ability to oxidise CO* to CO2 at room temperature. Access to this state requires a mild thermal treatment in the presence of adsorbed CO*. We hypothesise that this state is highly localised to the surface of the nanoparticle, and we find that it collapses upon elevated thermal treatments, or upon adsorption of CO at low temperature.







Abstract
The dynamic response of heterogeneous catalytic materials to their environment opens a wide variety of possible surface states which may have increased catalytic activity. In this work, we find that it is possible to generate a surface state with increased catalytic activity over metallic 2&#8197;nm Pt nanoparticles by performing a thermal treatment of the CO*&#8208;covered Pt catalyst. This state is characterised by its ability to oxidise CO to CO2 at room temperature. By combining pressure pulse experiments with in situ spectroscopy we correlate the formation of this high&#8208;activity state with the desorption of weakly bound CO* molecules from well&#8208;coordinated Pt sites. This high&#8208;activity state is metastable, degrading after elevated thermal treatments or upon readsorption of CO at room temperature. We conclude that this metastable state is highly localised to the surface of the nanoparticle, however its exact atomic structure remains open to speculation.

         <title>Anode Engineering with pH&#8208;Neutral Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Enabling Over 19% Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel p&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE)&#8208;based HTL with an optimized molecular design was developed, featuring an enhanced planar conformation and reduced density of states (DOS), which realized efficient charge transport. With POM4 doping, the constructed OSCs achieved a high PCE of 19.16%. This work demonstrates CPE&#8208;based HTLs as promising acid&#8208;free HTL alternatives for high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.








Abstract
The lack of effective hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) materials has become a significant bottleneck in the advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, to obtain sufficient doping properties, most HTLs have to be used by mixing with substantial amounts of acid, which causes serious corrosion problems. Herein, by optimizing molecular conformation, we designed and synthesized two conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) that exhibited superior hole&#8208;transporting capability without involving acid addition. The PEP&#8208;BT features a planar conjugated backbone constructed from the nonfused segment, which leads to an enhanced doping effect and highly ordered molecular arrangement. and reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking from 4.13 to 3.85&#160;&#197;. These contributed to the outstanding hole collection performance of polyoxometalate&#8208;doped PEP&#8208;BT:POM4 while maintaining a neutral pH. The binary OSC showed a photovoltaic efficiency of 19.16%, illustrating an unprecedented example that a CPE&#8208;based HTL can provide a photovoltaic efficiency exceeding 19% in OSCs. Moreover, as another evidence of high&#8208;performance HTL, the organic light&#8208;emitting diode incorporating PEP&#8208;BT:POM4 exhibited a superior luminous efficiency to the reference device, along with a decrease of 0.4&#160;V for turn&#8208;on voltage. The results from this work demonstrate the great potential of CPEs as HTL materials.

         <title>Anchor Peptide&#8208;Based Immobilization Strategy Promote the Applications of Pickering Emulsion System in Natural Products Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designs an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy to expand the application of Pickering emulsion to glycosyltransferases (GTs) for the first time, addressing low conversion challenge in aqueous solutions. The glycosylation Pickering emulsion achieved more than 90% conversion of natural product glycosides with high recyclability, offering a practical approach to broaden the applications of natural enzymes in Pickering emulsion.








Abstract
Pickering emulsion systems serve&#160;as an advanced platform for efficient fine chemical production in biphasic enzymatic catalysis, though their applications are currently limited to a few commercial enzyme classes. Herein, we designed an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy for Pickering emulsions to achieve efficient glycosylation of natural products by glycosyltransferases (GTs). Firstly, through enzyme mining, natural GTs were utilized to synthesize pharmaceutically important acacetin glucoside and galactoside. However, the best&#8208;performing enzymes, BacGT and BarGT&#8208;3, still showed low conversions for acacetin glucoside (&lt;40%) and galactoside (&lt;10%). Then, Spy chemistry was employed to cyclize these two GTs (Spy_BacGT and Spy_BarGT&#8208;3) for improved robustness, and a Pickering emulsion was formed with the free two Spy_GTs, using 20% 2&#8208;hexanone and 1% mesoporous silica nanoparticles (carriers of mesoporous, CM), achieving 70% and 66% conversions of acacetin glucoside and galactoside, respectively. Further immobilization of the cyclized GTs onto CM via the anchor peptide liquid chromatography peak I (LCI) (Spy_BacGT/BarGT&#8208;3_LCI@CM) further enabled the system to reach more than 90% conversions of acacetin glycosides, retaining 90% conversions after 6&#8211;8 cycles. Moreover, this strategy was applied to GTs exhibiting substrate selectivity, achieving efficient nonselective catalysis. This study provides a simple and efficient immobilization strategy to broaden the applications of the Pickering emulsion system in enzymatic glycosylation.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Sensitized Activated Formation of Lophyl Radicals by Heptamethine Cyanines Enables Dry Film Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;intensity NIR radiation around 800&#160;nm enables the manufacture of dry film resists (DFRs) using a combination of hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazole (HABI) and N&#8208;phenyl imino acetic acid. The mechanism is based on activated electron transfer processes supported by the respective product analysis.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensitized generation of lophyl radicals (L&#183;) by heptamethine cyanine led to initiation of radical photopolymerization of multifunctional acrylates when different hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazoles (HABIs) and N&#8208;phenylglycine (NPG) operated as coinitiator. The latter functioned as donor. For a deeper understanding, heptamethine cyanines were used following a photoinduced electron transfer (PET). HABI derivatives with electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents demonstrated that those with electron acceptors resulted in a higher photopolymerization efficiency of multifunctional acrylates. Tri&#8208;(propylene glycol) diacrylate (TPGDA) and tri&#8208;methylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) served as the monomers. Sensitizers (Sens) exposed with a high intense NIR&#8208;light source at 808 nm exhibiting a positive charge in the cyanine pattern significantly operate more efficiently for radical photopolymerization than a Sens without a positive charge. Differences in efficiency of PET can give an explanation for these differences. The heat generated by the cyanine's internal conversion from S1 to S0 additionally influenced the endothermic reaction between L&#183; and NPG. These systems worked in practical applications for dry film photoresists (DFRs), reported here for the first time.

         <title>Cathodic Hydroxide Ions Induce Tetrose Formation During Glycolaldehyde Electroreduction to Alcohols: A Potential CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Carbohydrate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 gas can potentially alleviate climate change by hampering the atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. The production of carbohydrates from CO2 reduction will have promising applications for the manufacturing of valuable, multi&#8208;carbon compounds that are traditionally produced from the petrochemical or agricultural industries. In this work, we analysed the copper&#8208;catalysed electrochemical reduction of glycolaldehyde, a commonly observed trace CO2RR product that has been previously proposed as an intermediate for alcohol formation. We determine that glycolaldehyde is not the main intermediate on polycrystalline copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts that selectively produce ethanol. In an unbuffered electrolyte, the cathodic hydroxide ions produced induce the coupling of glycolaldehyde to tetroses in the solution phase, yielding a maximum glycolaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;sugar conversion of 46.8% under ambient conditions. Using in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS coupled with DFT calculations, we show that glycolaldehyde reduction to alcohols proceeds via adsorption of its enol tautomer, &#951;2(C,C)&#8208;CHOH=CHOH. Our findings not only shed light onto the C2 alcohol formation pathways during CO2RR, but also imply that a CO2 electrolyser can potentially produce C4&#160;carbohydrates via CO2 reduction to glycolaldehyde followed by C&#8211;C coupling in the solution phase, with only a high local pH needed to drive the tetrose formation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibacterial Siderophores of Pandoraea Pathogens and their Impact on the Diseased Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria of the genus Pandoraea, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse Pandoraea species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (pan) that codes for a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics&#8208;guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the pan gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome. Bioassays and mass spectrometry imaging showed that pandorabactins have antibacterial activities against various lung pathogens (Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas) through depleting iron in the competitors. Taken together, these findings offer first insight into niche factors of Pandoraea and indicate that pandorabactins shape the diseased lung microbiota through the competition for iron.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic-resistant bacteria of the genus Pandoraea, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse Pandoraea species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (pan) that codes for a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics-guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the pan gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Celluxanthenes, Antibacterial Arylpolyene Alkaloids from Diverse Cellulose&#8208;Degrading Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellulose degradation by anaerobic bacteria plays an eminent role in the global carbon cycle and is a critical step in biofuel production. The anaerobe thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) is particularly efficient at breaking down biomass and produces a 'yellow affinity substance' (YAS), a pigment that has been implicated in signaling and conferring a higher affinity of the cellulosome to YAS&#8208;loaded cellulose. However, despite its importance, the nature and biosynthetic origin of YAS have remained elusive. Here we show by isolation and structure elucidation that YAS is a complex of unusual arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes). Stable isotope labeling experiments reveal all biosynthetic building blocks for celluxanthene assembly. Through a targeted gene deletion, we identify the celluxanthene (cex) biosynthesis gene cluster and propose a biosynthetic model in which an arylpolyene generated by an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) undergoes a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion with a tryptophan&#8208;derived ketoacid to form a tetronate. Genome mining and metabolic profiling revealed that diverse cellulolytic anaerobes harbor cex gene loci and produce celluxanthene congeners. Celluxanthenes show antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This study work solves the long&#8208;standing enigma surrounding the nature of YAS, establishes bioengineering approaches, and helps elucidating the biological roles of these intricate pigments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the activation of nitrogen and its reduction to ammonia, transition metals are crucial in biological as well as industrial processes. So far, only a few binary transition metal compounds with nitrogen dimer anions are known, while a ternary compound has remained undiscovered as yet. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first ternary transition metal compound, namely BeW10N14(N2), which exhibits dinitrogen anions. It was synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from W2Be4N5. The crystal structure, elucidated with synchrotron radiation, unites WN7 capped trigonal prisms with intriguing BeN6 octahedra and (N2)&#8208;anions. Elastic and electronic properties of the title compound were corroborated by DFT calculations, revealing simultaneous ultra&#8208;incompressible and metallic behavior. The synthesis and investigation of the first ternary transition metal nitride with dinitrogen units opens the door to a new field of research on nitride and pernitride chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Photochemical Generation of a Short&#8208;Lived, Twisted Cycloheptenone Isomer: Catalytic Formation, Detection, and Consecutive Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid undergoes a photochemical isomerization from its cis&#8208; to its trans&#8208;form either upon direct irradiation (&#955; = 366 nm) or in the presence of a triplet sensitizer (&#955; = 459 nm). The intermediate chiral trans&#8208;isomer was detected by step&#8208;scan FTIR displaying a lifetime of 107 ms (r.t., CH2Cl2). Ensuing Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the trans&#8208;isomer occurred smoothly and produced chiral trans&#8208;fused cycloaddition products (14 examples, 24&#8208;98% yield). Benzylation led to esters which were separated by chiral HPLC and which were employed to evaluate a possible enantio&#173;selective reaction course. It was discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid with a pendant sensitizing group induces a notable enantiose&#173;lectivity in the photoisomerization step. The planar chirality of the trans&#8208;cycloheptene translates into point chirality in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (seven examples, up to 38% ee). Computational studies suggest that the chiral conformation of the cis&#8208;isomer adopted within the assembly to the chiral phosphoric acid induces the enantioselec&#173;tivity in a one&#8208;bond flip towards the trans&#8208;isomer. Trajectory surface hopping simulations showed exemplarily how a chiral trans&#8208;cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone is formed from a chiral cis&#8208;conformer. For the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, a weak ground state selectivity was found to attenuate the enantioselectivity achieved in the photochemical step.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding the Chemical Language of Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides from the Untapped Archaea Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical communication is crucial in ecosystems with complex microbial communities. However, the difficulties inherent to the cultivation of archaea have led to a limited understanding of their chemical language, especially regarding the structure diversity and function of secondary metabolites (SMs). Our in&#8208;depth exploration into the biosynthetic potential of archaea has unveiled the previously unexplored biosynthetic capabilities and chemical diversity of archaeal ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Through the first application of heterologous expression in archaeal SM discovery, we have identified twenty&#8208;four lanthipeptides, including a distinctive type featuring diamino&#8208;dicarboxylic termini. It highlights the uniqueness of archaeal biosynthetic pathways and significantly expands the chemical landscape of archaeal SMs. Additionally, archaeal lanthipeptides demonstrate antagonistic activity against haloarchaea, mediating the unique biotic interaction in the halophilic niche. They showcase a new ecological role of RiPPs in enhancing the host's motility by inducing the rod&#8208;shaped cell morphology and upregulating the archaellin gene expression, facilitating the archaeal interaction with abiotic environments. These discoveries broaden our understanding of archaeal chemical language and provide promising prospects for future exploration of SM&#8208;mediated interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Molecular Diffusion in Core&#8208;Shell Zeolite Imidazolate Framework Composites Realizes Efficient Kinetic Separation of Xylene Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell construction strategy enables precise heterogeneous diffusion control, facilitating the kinetic separation of xylene isomers. The distinctive heterogeneous pore channels in the core&#8211;shell ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite allow the shell layer to effectively exclude larger isomers while selectively screening PX. Simultaneously, the inner core provides rapid diffusion kinetics for PX, ensuring efficient separation.







Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers is a critical and energy&#8208;intensive process in the petrochemical industry, primarily due to their closely similar molecular structures and boiling points. In this work, we report the synthesis and application of a novel core&#8211;shell zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) composite, ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67, designed to significantly enhance the kinetic separation of xylene isomers through a synergistic &#8220;shell&#8208;gated diffusion and core&#8208;facilitated transport&#8221; strategy. The external ZIF&#8208;67 shell selectively restricts the diffusion of larger isomers (MX and OX), while the internal ZIF&#8208;65 core accelerates the diffusion of PX, thereby amplifying the diffusion differences among the isomers. This architecture yields remarkable improvements in both selectivity and diffusion rates, as demonstrated by vapor&#8208;phase adsorption studies and molecular dynamics simulations. The ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite exhibits up to 12.5 times higher PX/OX selectivity in liquid&#8208;phase adsorption and 3.4 times higher dynamic selectivity in fixed&#8208;column breakthrough experiments compared to the individual ZIF components. Theoretical simulations further corroborate the heterogeneous diffusion control mechanism, revealing the time&#8208;dependent diffusion regulation within the core&#8211;shell architecture. This work underscores the great potential of core&#8211;shell MOF composites in optimizing molecular sieving processes for industrially significant separations and highlights a new route for enhancing kinetic separation efficiency in complex multicomponent systems.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Boosts Circularly Polarized Radioluminescence in Chiral Mn(II) Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a pair of Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers, R/S&#8208;1, were designed, exhibiting intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (gPL &gt;&#160;3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3) and strong scintillation (light yields &gt;&#160;70&#160;000 photons/MeV). Their circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL) properties were evaluated using our home&#8208;built setup. By incorporating hydrogen bonds, another pair, R/S&#8208;2, achieved a nearly seven&#8208;fold increase in gPL and a nearly fifteen&#8208;fold enhancement in gRL. This study provides a new strategy for advancing chiral scintillators.








Abstract
Chiral scintillators combining scintillation and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) present a novel avenue for controlling light propagation and reducing optical crosstalk in conventional scintillators. However, quantitative evaluation of circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL) and strategies for enhancing performance under X&#8208;ray excitation remain underexplored. Herein, we conducted the designed synthesis of Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers, (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;(N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine)2MnBr4&#183;2Br&#8722; (R/S&#8208;1), which exhibit intense CPL with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of 94.4% (R&#8208;1) and 94.1% (S&#8208;1) and PL dissymmetry factors (gPL) of &#8722;3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 (R&#8208;1) and&#160;+&#160;3.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 (S&#8208;1). They demonstrate strong scintillation performance with record&#8208;breaking light yields of 70&#160;061 and 68&#160;514 photons/MeV in chiral scintillators. We pioneered quantitative evaluation of the CPRL of R/S&#8208;1, achieving radioluminescence (RL) dissymmetry factors (gRL) of &#8722;2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and&#160;+&#160;2.55&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. By incorporating hydrogen bonds into the structures through rational ligand design to facilitate chiral transfer, Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;(N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine)MnBr4 (R/S&#8208;2) achieve the gPL values of &#8722;2.56&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and&#160;+&#160;2.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 with nearly seven times higher than those of R/S&#8208;1. More inspiringly, the gRL value of R&#8208;2 increased to &#8722;2.96&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 with a 15 times increase relative to R&#8208;1, representing the highest CPRL in lead&#8208;free chiral scintillators. This work not only manifests a new design strategy for advancing chiral scintillators but also establishes a standard approach for evaluating CPRL properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Computational Screening of Small Molecular Crystals for Sustainable Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a high&#8208;throughput computational screening of organic molecular crystals for piezoelectric applications. Using DFT calculations, the study identifies key organic materials with significant piezoelectric responses and introduces CrystalDFT, a comprehensive database for scalable analysis, providing a data&#8208;driven foundation for future material discovery in organic piezoelectrics. These sustainable materials can be used for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting applications.








Abstract
Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next&#8208;generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor&#8208;made solid&#8208;state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles and techniques such as cocrystallization, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterized by methods such as X&#8208;ray diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here, we present our database of small molecular crystals and their density functional theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring (unpoled) longitudinal piezoelectric response (d11/d22/d33). This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.

         <title>Propylene&#8208;Bridged Associative Bis(bipyridinium) Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Lifetime Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present two propylene&#8208;bridged bis(bipyridinium) compounds, M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV, as anolytes for aqueous organic redox flow batteries. These compounds undergo intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, resulting in Gibbs free energy change of less than &#8722;100&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, which mitigates degradation by forming Gibbs free energy wells. TMAP&#8208;bisV exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 66.5 Ah L&#8722;1 and demonstrates negligible capacity fade in a 1.5&#160;M e&#8722; cell. 








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) represent a potent technology in low&#8208;cost storage and grid&#8208;scale adoption of renewable electricity, whereas bipyridinium derivatives, the most extensively adopted anolyte, undergo diverse side reactions causing severe loss of battery lifetime. Here, we propose a strategy to promote the formation of intramolecular radical &#960; dimers of reduced bipyridinium electrolytes and stabilize the radical intermediates during charge and discharge, resulting in significant improvements in battery lifetime. Density functional theory calculations reveal that proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrolytes, M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV, demonstrate Gibbs free energy change of &#8722;101.49&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 and &#8722;103.90&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the formation of radical &#960; dimers, as opposed to the less favored &#8722;14.36&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for methyl viologen. Electron paramagnetic resonance and UV&#8211;vis spectra studies confirmed the significantly facilitated intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV radicals. This translates to a more than one order of magnitude improvement in electrolyte stability for M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV in flow cells. Specifically, TMAP&#8208;bisV possesses a theoretical capacity of 66.5 Ah L&#8722;1 and exhibits negligible capacity fade at 1.5&#160;M e&#8722;, which represents a new record in this area. We believe the concept may open a promising avenue toward the design of capacity&#8208;dense and super&#8208;stable AORFB electrolytes.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Fluoride Dual&#8208;atom Synergistic Regulated Interface Coating Enables Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8722;fluoride dual&#8208;atom&#8208;regulated solid electrolyte interphase coating on Zn anodes (ZnBOF/Zn) is presented, which introduces a unique synergy between B&#8208;compound protective layers and zincophilic F atoms. This dual regulation not only ensures preferential Zn deposition along the (002) plane, thereby mitigating dendrite growth, but also suppresses side reactions and accelerates Zn2+ desolvation for enhanced electrochemical stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries provide promising opportunities for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries. Nevertheless, Zn anode encounters severe challenges, such as Zn dendrite formation, surface corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a strategy to spontaneously construct a boron&#8722;fluoride dual&#8208;atom regulated SEI (ZnBOF), which involves the formation of a B&#8208;compound coating through an etching process followed by an in situ F substitution during the initial electrochemical cycling. The ZnBOF/Zn anode benefits preferential deposition of Zn2+ along the (002) plane without Zn dendrite, and the side reactions including by&#8208;product and HER are dramatically suppressed. A combination of characterization methods, such as X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, shows that the B&#8208;containing passivation layer facilitates the transport of Zn2+ and mitigates water&#8208;related side reactions, and the F atoms serve as zincophilic sites that enhance the transfer kinetics of Zn2+. As expected, the well&#8208;designed ZnBOF/Zn anode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping for 5000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The assembled ZnBOF/Zn||MnO2 batteries show impressive cycling stability, remaining 96.2% of the initial capacity (234.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) after 1700 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Therefore, this work reveals a dual&#8208;atom synergistic regulated strategy to fabricate a robust SEI for Zn anode, which contributes to the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A boron&#8722;fluoride dual-atom-regulated solid electrolyte interphase coating on Zn anodes (ZnBOF/Zn) is presented, which introduces a unique synergy between B-compound protective layers and zincophilic F atoms. This dual regulation not only ensures preferential Zn deposition along the (002) plane, thereby mitigating dendrite growth, but also suppresses side reactions and accelerates Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation for enhanced electrochemical stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-based batteries provide promising opportunities for next-generation rechargeable batteries. Nevertheless, Zn anode encounters severe challenges, such as Zn dendrite formation, surface corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a strategy to spontaneously construct a boron&#8722;fluoride dual-atom regulated SEI (ZnBOF), which involves the formation of a B-compound coating through an etching process followed by an in situ F substitution during the initial electrochemical cycling. The ZnBOF/Zn anode benefits preferential deposition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; along the (002) plane without Zn dendrite, and the side reactions including by-product and HER are dramatically suppressed. A combination of characterization methods, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, shows that the B-containing passivation layer facilitates the transport of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and mitigates water-related side reactions, and the F atoms serve as zincophilic sites that enhance the transfer kinetics of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. As expected, the well-designed ZnBOF/Zn anode exhibits ultra-stable Zn plating/stripping for 5000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Therefore, this work reveals a dual-atom synergistic regulated strategy to fabricate a robust SEI for Zn anode, which contributes to the development of aqueous zinc-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simple &#8220;Directional Trimming&#8221; Strategy Engineered Platinum Atomic Clusters with Controllable Coordination Numbers for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the gardeners trimming branches and theoretical guidance, a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy is proposed and applied to obtain a series of atomic clusters catalysts with wide range of Cl coordination number (CN). Particularly, Pt/CB&#8208;90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). Additionally, the strategy helps us to establish the inverted volcano relationship between the CN and catalytic activity. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.








Abstract
The coordination number (CN) in atomic cluster (AC) catalysts endows their catalytic performance with flexible tunability. However, the quantitative relationship between the CN and catalytic activity of atomic cluster catalysts remains ambiguity. Herein, inspired by the gardeners trimming plants branches to obtain ornamental value shape, we propose a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy to obtain a series of AC catalysts with wide range of Cl CN and establish an inverted volcano curve to explain the effect of CN on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, Pt/CB&#8208;90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). This proposed synthesis strategy fully utilizes the precursor atoms and is widely applicable. The reaction liquid can be reused up to 20 times to obtain 1130&#160;mg catalysts without introducing any other chemicals. Additionally, theoretical calculations highlight the appropriate Cl CN benefits the HER on Pt2 ACs. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Reveals Human Off&#8208;Targets of Fluoroquinolone Induced Mitochondrial Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic overview of the adverse effects of Ciprofloxacin related to mitochondrial toxicity. AIFM1 plays a role in the MIA40&#8208;mediated import into the IMS and oxidative folding of nuclear&#8208;encoded proteins, including ETC complexes I and IV subunits. Ciprofloxacin disrupts the IMS import machinery, impairing ETC function. Dysfunction, especially of complex I, leads to a reduction in the NAD+/NADH ratio. This alteration in redox homeostasis, coupled with a shortage of NAD+, a crucial cofactor for the TCA cycle, can trigger metabolic reprogramming involving IDH2.







Abstract
Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are an important class of potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. However, their general use is more and more limited by adverse side effects. While general mechanisms for the fluoroquinolone&#8208;associated disability (FQAD) have been identified, the underlying molecular targets of toxicity remain elusive. In this study, focusing on the most commonly prescribed FQs Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, whole proteome analyses revealed prominent mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells, specifically of the complexes I and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC). Furthermore, global untargeted chemo&#8208;proteomic methodologies such as photo&#8208;affinity profiling with FQ&#8208;derived probes, as well as derivatization&#8208;free thermal proteome profiling, were applied to elucidate human protein off&#8208;targets of FQs in living cells. Accordingly, the interactions of FQs with mitochondrial AIFM1 and IDH2 have been identified and biochemically validated for their contribution to mitochondrial dysfunction. Of note, the FQ induced ETC dysfunction via AIFM1 activates the reverse carboxylation pathway of IDH2 for rescue, however, its simultaneous inhibition further enhances mitochondrial toxicity. This off&#8208;target discovery study provides unique insights into FQ toxicity enabling the utilization of identified molecular principles for the design of a safer FQ generation.

         <title>A Crystalline Polymer Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered crystalline polymer (PTABQ) was designed as a cathode for SOBs. Benefiting from the crystalline structure with one&#8208;dimensional O&#8208;channels and highly conjugated backbone, PTABQ features high electronic conductivity and fast ion diffusion ability. The as&#8208;prepared PTABQ cathode displays a discharge capacity of 380 mAh g&#8722;1 and nearly 90% capacity retention after ultra&#8208;long 2800 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;organic batteries (SOBs) are widely recognized as a rising star in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology because of their abundant resources, high energy density, and environmental friendliness. However, the poor cyclability and rate performance due to high solubility and poor conductivity with organic electrode materials limit their practical applications. Here, we constructed a new crystalline polymer, poly(tetraaminobenzoquione) (PTABQ), featuring a layered structure with a conjugated backbone and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Benefiting from the crystalline structure with one&#8208;dimensional O&#8208;channels and highly conjugated backbone, PTABQ shows high electronic conductivity (10&#8722;7 S cm&#8722;1) and fast ion diffusion ability (&#8764;10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1). PTABQ displays a discharge capacity of 380 mAh g&#8722;1 with an average voltage of 2.0&#160;V and nearly 90% capacity retention after ultra&#8208;long 2800 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1 (&#8764;8 C), which is superior to the reported organic cathode materials. It also exhibits an impressive rate performance of 290 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 A g&#8722;1 (&#8764;20 C). Our work highlights the importance of constructing the crystal structure for effective utilization of active sites and fast ion diffusion, which sheds light on the development of an efficient and sustainable energy storage system.

         <title>Mannich&#8208;Type Polymers: A Versatile Platform for Water&#8208;Degradable, Malleable, and Environmentally Responsive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address critical environmental challenges caused by current recycling strategies of polymer wastes, our work presents water&#8208;degradable, malleable, environmentally responsive, and low&#8208;cost polymer networks synthesized via a Mannich&#8208;type reaction, offering a novel, scalable, and sustainable pathway for the next&#8208;generation polymers. 








Abstract
Polymer waste poses a significant environmental challenge, with current recycling strategies often hindered by inefficient waste collection systems, high production costs, and limited material recyclability. While extensive efforts have been directed toward upcycling or degrading commercial polymers, as well as developing sustainable alternatives, many approaches remain constrained by their reliance on harsh conditions, specialized catalysts, or complex processing methods. In this study, we present a novel strategy to address the challenges by developing mechanically robust polymer networks that are readily degradable in water within 30 days. Our approach leverages a guanidine&#8208;based Mannich&#8208;type reaction utilizing three low&#8208;cost starting materials&#8212;guanidine hydrochloride, aldehyde, and diamine&#8212;under mild conditions. Unlike traditional thermosets, which are often difficult to recycle, our polymer networks exhibit exceptional processability, enabling the fabrication of various forms, and demonstrate responsiveness to moisture. These properties, coupled with degradability, make them viable candidates for diverse applications. By introducing a scalable and sustainable pathway for designing next&#8208;generation recyclable polymers, our work advances the field of dynamic covalent chemistry and presents a novel class of sustainable polymer networks with significant potential for reducing environmental impact.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer waste poses a significant environmental challenge, with current recycling strategies often hindered by inefficient waste collection systems, high production costs, and limited material recyclability. While extensive efforts have been directed toward upcycling or degrading commercial polymers, as well as developing sustainable alternatives, many approaches remain constrained by their reliance on harsh conditions, specialized catalysts, or complex processing methods. In this study, we present a novel strategy to address the challenges by developing mechanically robust polymer networks that are readily degradable in water within 30 days. Our approach leverages a guanidine-based Mannich-type reaction utilizing three low-cost starting materials&#8212;guanidine hydrochloride, aldehyde, and diamine&#8212;under mild conditions. Unlike traditional thermosets, which are often difficult to recycle, our polymer networks exhibit exceptional processability, enabling the fabrication of various forms, and demonstrate responsiveness to moisture. These properties, coupled with degradability, make them viable candidates for diverse applications. By introducing a scalable and sustainable pathway for designing next-generation recyclable polymers, our work advances the field of dynamic covalent chemistry and presents a novel class of sustainable polymer networks with significant potential for reducing environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Cause of Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Formation: Disparities in Metal Nanoparticle Anchoring Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt atoms strongly prefer to anchor to oxygen vacancies (Ov) rather than hydroxyl sites on the anatase TiO2 support. Instead, Pd atoms lack this preference for Ov and occupy more hydroxyl sites. Ultimately, the high concentration of residual Ov on the support causes Pd NPs to be in a more severe encapsulation state in the high&#8208;temperature hydrogen environment.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) can be normally induced by the surface free energy differences between metal nanoparticles and supports. To gain deeper insights into the effect of SMSI on heterogeneous catalysis, we use prototype Pt, Pd/TiO2(anatase) systems to demonstrate different reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction activity changes, especially with increasing the metal nanoparticle (NP) loading. Our experiments show that the conventional surface&#8208;free&#8208;energy change law regarding the incremental NP size is no longer applicable to these systems due to the overlook of the change of support properties owing to the disparities of the metal anchoring mechanisms. Both experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Pt atoms strongly favor anchoring on the oxygen vacancies (Ov) over the OH&#8208;sites on the anatase TiO2 support. In contrast, Pd atoms lack such Ov&#8208;site preference compared to Pt atoms, thereby leaving higher content of Ov on the support than the Pt counterpart. Moreover, high density of residual Ov on the support can cause the Pd NPs to be in higher degree of contact with the support, either in NP&#8208;encapsulation state (experiment) or NP&#8208;spreading state (simulation). The enhanced CO2 conversion of Pt/TiO2A is attributed to the synergistic effect of Ov and hydrogen spillover from Pt sites.

         <title>Selective Hydrogenolysis of Biomass&#8208;Derived Aromatic Alcohols over 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene by a Reversible Redox&#8208;Relay Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;Mo2COx with strong CH2&#8722;OH affinity and H2 activation ability shows a selective hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural to 5&#8208;methyl furfural at a mild reaction temperature. The catalyst shows a great catalytic stability and broad universality for various furfuryl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and hydroxycyclopentenone substrates.







Abstract
Selective CH2&#8722;OH hydrogenolysis of biomass&#8208;derived aromatic alcohols to produce methyl aromatics is crucial for synthesizing sustainable fuels and chemicals; yet traditional metal&#8211;acid bifunctional catalysis possesses significant challenges owing to its complex reaction network. Herein, a 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene was fabricated, demonstrating an efficient hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural into 5&#8208;methyl furfural, achieving an impressive yield (99.5&#8201;%) at the mild reaction temperature of 90&#8201;&#176;C. Catalytic mechanism investigations reveal that 2D&#8208;Mo2COx facilitate the activation and cleavage of the CH2&#8722;OH bond through a redox mechanism, driven by the strong CH2&#8722;OH affinity of the Mo&#8211;Mo metallic plane. In the absence of H2, hydrogen from O&#8722;H group is the source for methyl formation from CH2&#8722;OH. Under a H2 atmosphere, H2 is activated to remove residual oxygen species, boosting selective hydrogenolysis while suppressing furan and CH=O hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited broad universality for synthesizing methyl aromatics from various furfuryl alcohols, benzyl alcohols, and hydroxycyclopentenones. This study presents a novel redox&#8208;relay mechanism in advanced MXene catalysis, offering a straightforward hydrogenolysis pathway for challenging substrates.

         <title>Mechanism Switch Between Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover and Radical Buffering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical buffering scenario, which features the reversible radical dissociation from alkyl chromium(III) followed by the metal&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;coupled (MCC) radical addition to form the C&#9472;C bond, is established for Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl alkylation. This new radical bonding model provides an orthogonal avenue to radical&#8208;polar crossover for the design of radical coupling reactions.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) is a classic concept that bridges one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron chemistry. It has been widely used in Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl addition reactions to clarify the formation of alkyl chromium(III) intermediate and subsequent carbonyl insertion. Herein, we proposed an orthogonal bonding model, the radical buffering scenario, for Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl alkylation. This radical bonding model features the radical dissociation from the alkyl chromium(III) complex followed by the Cr(II)&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;coupled radical addition to form the C&#9472;C bond. The mechanism switch between the radical and polar bonding models is affected by the radical stability, radical nucleophilicity, radical size, and the presence of an &#945;&#8208;heteroatom or &#945;&#8211;&#960; bond. The collaborative computational and experimental studies have verified the reliability of the radical mechanism. More importantly, we demonstrated that this radical buffering scenario possesses a different stereoselectivity control model from that in the RPC scenario. A general enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity control model derived from the multiple ligand&#8208;radical interactions is thus established for CrCl2/bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric radical addition.

         <title>Chiral Zinc Sulfide Nanoparticles Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species for Remodeling Intestinal Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gut microbiota dysbiosis are crucial factors that exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To address this, we successfully synthesized zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) with a particle size of approximately 500 nm and a maximum g&#8208;factor of 0.07, utilizing l&#8208;/d&#8208;cysteine as chiral ligands. In vitro experiments revealed that these chiral ZnS NPs could enter macrophages through the CD44 and clathrin pathways, which enhanced the ability to scavenge ROS, in turn significantly inhibited the NF&#8208;&#954;B and NLRP3 signaling pathways, thereby reducing the secretion of TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;6, and IL&#8208;1&#946;, while upregulating IL&#8208;10. In vivo experimental data showed that l&#8208;ZnS NPs outperformed 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, significantly improving body weight, reducing the IBD activity index, and attenuating tissue damage, concurrently, l&#8208;ZnS NPs exhibited a marked prophylactic effect. The benchmark studies verified that l&#8208;ZnS NPs increased the abundance of the beneficial Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 by 10.55&#8208;fold and decreased harmful Enterobacter by 2914.00&#8208;fold, thereby reshaping the intestinal microecological balance. Pharmacokinetic and biosafety assessments confirmed the safety of l&#8208;ZnS NPs. Our findings indicate that chiral ZnS NPs hold great potential as nanodrugs for the treatment and prevention of IBD, providing an important foundation for the development of IBD therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Z&#8208;selective Styrene Synthesis via Dual Cobalt and Photocatalysis through Coupling of Unactivated Alkyl Iodides with Terminal Arylalkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient Z&#8208;selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroalkylation of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides has been achieved, providing a straightforward and modular route to access 1,2&#8208;disubstituted Z&#8208;styrenes. This reaction operates under mild conditions without requiring over&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metal terminal reductants. Excellent Z/E ratios and good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. One potential utility of this reaction is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of several syn homoallylic alcohols in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step sequence. Control experiments strongly support that the halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) process is the key to generating carbon radicals. DFT studies suggest that the catalytic system involves Co(II)/Co(III) cycle and the steric repulsion between the Co(II) catalyst and the alkenyl radical in radical capture by Co(II) is the dominant factor controlling the Z/E selectivity. This approach represents the first example of merging photo&#8208;XAT with cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An efficient Z-selective cobalt-catalyzed reductive hydroalkylation of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides has been achieved, providing a straightforward and modular route to access 1,2-disubstituted Z-styrenes. This reaction operates under mild conditions without requiring over-stoichiometric amounts of metal terminal reductants. Excellent Z/E ratios and good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds with remarkable functional-group compatibility.

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Anthraquinones via J&#8208;Type Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence materials based on cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;chiral luminophores are highly desirable; however, their performance is often hindered by weak exciton&#8208;chirality coupling between the luminophore and its adjacent stereocenters. Here we introduce J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization as an effective strategy to address this challenge. By attaching amide groups to point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, the formation of directional hydrogen bonds facilitates efficient chirality transfer from peripheral stereocenters to anthraquinones, resulting in supramolecular polymers with amplified chiroptical asymmetry. More importantly, the incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces torsional angle of the anthraquinone core compared to the non&#8208;acetylene control compound (1.81&#8304; vs. 33.4&#8304;), promoting J&#8208;aggregation and increasing emission intensity. This structural optimization enables the supramolecular polymers to achieve a circularly polarized luminescence brightness of 13.8 M&#8315;&#185;cm&#8315;&#185;, marking a significant advancement in point&#8208;chiral luminophore systems. Furthermore, the integration of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into these supramolecular polymers allows for the fabrication of color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized electroluminescent devices. Overall, J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization represents a promising approach for developing high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials by simultaneously optimizing emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Biocatalysis to Generate Hydrogen Sulfide and Promote Endogenous Antioxidant Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting cellular protective responses during oxidative stress conditions through the generation of antioxidant persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we report a bioinspired glycoconjugate, a candidate for tandem biocatalysis and generates persulfide/ H2S in response to oxidative stress. The glycoconjugate is cleaved by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, an enzyme that is expressed during oxidative stress; the product of this reaction is a substrate for 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme that is involved in persulfide/ H2S biosynthesis. The catalytic systems are orthogonal to one another, and the glycoconjugate is efficiently cleaved by these enzymes to generate the potent antioxidant glutathione persulfide as well as H2S. We demonstrate the efficacy of this conjugate in mitigating inflammation in the brain in an animal model. Together, using rationally designed substrates and fully catalytic steps, we leverage tandem biocatalysis to direct the generation of persulfide/ H2S, and promote cells&#8217; own antioxidant response.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bond Based Efficient Solid&#8208;State Organic Emitters Enabled by a Synergistic Anion and Mechanical Bond Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional fluorophores often face aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), limiting their efficacy in high&#8208;concentration applications. We demonstrate that a combined effect of anion and mechanical bond can significantly increase fluorescence intensity, up to 14&#8208;fold and a quantum yield of 97.0%. A large number of crystal analysis reveal that this enhancement is primarily driven by non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonds, which stabilizes the structure and restricts molecular motion. The versatility of this synergistic effect opens new avenues for applications, including circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) facilitated by chiral anions, and the development of a novel fluorescence switchable rotaxane shuttle that operates without charge transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces DNA Condensation in Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the conventional ways to eradicate tumor cells is to utilize chemotherapy agents, e.g., cisplatin, to induce DNA damage. However, DNA damage repair mechanisms can significantly limit the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. These mechanisms enable tumor cells to repair the DNA damage caused by the drug, leading to resistance. Cisplatin and similar drugs bind to specific DNA sites without significantly altering their conformation. As a result, DNA repair enzymes can still attach to and repair the damaged DNA. To address this issue, we designed four Ru(II) complexes (RuC3, RuC6, RuC9, and RuC12) with high positive charges of +8 valence and regulated their nuclear accumulation levels by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. RuC9 exhibits the highest nucleus accumulation level. DNA conformation was significantly altered by inducing DNA condensation through indiscriminately neutralizing the negative charge of the DNA backbone. This significant change prevents DNA&#8208;related enzymes from binding to DNA, ultimately leading to the efficient eradication of various tumor cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that kills tumor cells and overcomes cisplatin resistance through inducing DNA condensation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Borate Esterification for Evolved Supramolecular Chirality and Chiral Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological chemical reactions in confined environments offer unique opportunities for constructing dynamically tunable crystalline materials and architecturally defined polymers. However, their potential within functional supramolecular systems and chiral materials remains largely untapped. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a borate esterification reaction to achieve dynamic modulation of supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties under aggregation conditions. Pyrene&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives, following functionalization with phenylboronic acid groups, co&#8208;assemble with catechol&#8208;functionalized pyrene derivatives. This co&#8208;assembly undergoes spontaneous and highly efficient borate esterification under ambient conditions, inducing nanoscale morphological evolution and an inversion of supramolecular chirality. Both experimental results and DFT&#8208;based computations reveal that the supramolecular chirality inversion is primarily driven by a transition from &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking to CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between pyrene moieties. This co&#8208;assembly&#8208;borate esterification process represents a powerful integration of non&#8208;covalent assembly and covalent chemistry, providing a versatile platform for the design of soft materials and chiral functional systems. Moreover, the introduction of alizarin derivatives containing catechol motifs enables the transfer of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), resulting in tunable emission shifts from blue and cyan to red. This work broadens the functional scope of chiral luminescent materials and opens new avenues for their application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach to investigate glycolysis by&#160; &#179;&#185;P CEST applied to&#160; substrates at their endogenous concentration. The method relies on the assessment of the Saturation Transfer (ST) observed on the &#179;&#185;P signals of inorganic phosphate (Pi) or phosphocreatine (PCr) following the selective irradiation of phosphate groups of endogenous molecules exchanging with ATP, Pi, and indirectly with PCr in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The concentrations of these substrates&#160; fall below the threshold for direct detection. &#179;&#185;P CEST technique amplifies their responses, making them detectable via the ST effect to the &#179;&#185;P resonance of the selected reference signal. The method was validated in vitro on mouse breast adenocarcinoma cell pellets (TS/A), where the intracellular Pi signal was monitored to assess the ST effect associated with the saturation of phosphoester&#8208;containing molecules. The use of a glycolysis inhibitor and different experimental temperatures (37&#176;C or 4&#176;C) provided insights supporting the rationale behind the method. A comparison of &#179;&#185;P Z&#8208;spectra was carried out on murine breast cancer cell lines with different degrees of aggressiveness, showing the ability to assess metabolic differences. Finally, in vivo experiments on mice models of mammary adenocarcinoma demonstrated that &#179;&#185;P CEST can differentiate tumor and healthy tissue based on their metabolic characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminomethyl Phosphonic Acid as Highly Effective Multifunctional Additive for Modification of Electron Transport Layer and Perovskite in Photovoltaic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The passivation of detrimental perovskite&#8208;based defects is critically acknowledged for fabricating highly effective perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The presence of a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL) is also considered a pivotal factor for effective charge extraction and transport dynamics. Herein, a simple small organic molecule, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the SnO2 ETL. The defects in the SnO2 ETL are effectively suppressed by passivating the oxygen vacancies upon the SnO2 surface. Simultaneously, the carrier mobility and crystallinity of SnO2 are enhanced, and the upward&#8208;regulated conduction band minimum (CBM) is beneficial for constructing a favourable energy level alignment with the perovskite layer. Notably, the introduced residuals on the SnO2 surface can function as crystalline seeds for growth of large perovskite grains, which can passivate the defects in the perovskite bulk phase, boundaries, as well as the SnO2/perovskite interface. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the AMPA&#8208;modified PSCs is enhanced from 19.91% to 24.22%. Most importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs with AMPA maintained 94.9% of the initial PCE during 720 h of storage at a relative humidity of 10%, attributed to the improved hydrophobicity of both the SnO2 and perovskite layers after AMPA modification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Within the family of halide solid electrolytes (SEs), Li2ZrCl6 demonstrates high oxidative stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and mechanical deformability, positioning it as a promising candidate for SEs. However, the application of Li2ZrCl6 as a SEs was hindered by its low ionic conductivity at room temperature. Current strategies to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6 primarily are focused on single cation or anion sublattice&#8208;engineering, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Here, we propose a novel cation and anion&#8208;sublattice&#8208;engineering strategy, termed CASE, to increase the amorphous content and thus enhance ionic conductivity. The incorporation of Cu2+ and O2&#8208; induces distinctive structural modifications within Li2ZrCl6. This structure corroborated through analytic data of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the neutron diffraction, and ab initio molecular dynamics. Consequently, the amorphous Li2.1Zr0.95Cu0.05Cl4.4O0.8 achieves an enhanced ionic conductivity of 2.05 mS cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C. Furthermore, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries utilizing the amorphous Li2.1Zr0.95Cu0.05Cl4.4O0.8 as an electrolyte and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 as a cathode exhibit a superior long&#8208;term cycling stability retaining 90.3% of capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C under room temperature, which are much higher than those of Zr&#8208;based halide electrolytes in publications. Such a result might stimulate the development of more amorphous structures with high ionic conductivity in the CASE strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photoconversion of a Discrete Mixed Iodine(I) System to a 1D Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex (2), containing three distinct iodine(I) moieties ([N&#8213;I&#8213;N]+, O&#8213;I&#8213;N, and [O&#8213;I&#8213;O]&#8208;) within the same structure was synthesised with 4&#8208;styrylpyridine (4&#8208;stypy) and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalate as the stabilising Lewis bases. This complex was observed to be in equilibrium with its respective bis(OIN) complex (1a), with isolated samples of 2 also being found to convert to 1a in solution. Upon UV irradiation of 2, a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] cycloaddition reaction was observed, converting the discrete salt 2 to the 1D polymer 5. Complex 5 retained all the iodine(I) moieties from prior to photoconversion, and represents the first example of non&#8208;destructive photoconversion of a halogen(I) complex. To facilitate comparisons to 2 and 5, several additional closely&#8208;related iodine(I) complexes were synthesised, with the iodine(I) complexes characterised by NMR (1H, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC) and SCXRD, as well as by Raman and IR spectroscopy for 2, 5, and their close structural analogue 1a.</dc:description>

In this study, we designed double boron&#8211;oxygen&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (dBON&#8208;PAHs) with rigid planar structures and developed a novel UV emitter, BO&#8208;N, featuring hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) properties. BO&#8208;N exhibited UV emission in toluene solution and 1,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene (mCP) film, with photoluminescence (PL) peaks of 391 and 400 nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of 15 and 34 nm, respectively. The device doped with 5 wt% BO&#8208;N achieved a narrowband UV emission with an FWHM of 37 nm, an electroluminescence peak (&#955;EL) of 399 nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.166, 0.030). Moreover, the device attained a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 18.6% among reported HLCT&#8208;based UV OLEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.05.

         <title>Bright and Versatile Azetidinecarboxamide&#8208;Based Fluorophore&#8208;Ligand Conjugates for High&#8208;Resolution Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophore&#8208;ligand conjugates play a pivotal role in cellular imaging, providing high target specificity. However, simultaneously achieving conjugates with high brightness and ligand&#8208;targeting diversity presents significant challenges. Traditional strategies often require complex, multi&#8208;step modifications for fluorophore enhancement and ligand conjugation. Here, we present an azetidinecarboxamide strategy that addresses these challenges by integrating brightness enhancement and ligand conjugation capabilities within a single molecular framework. The azetidinecarboxamide core suppresses twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), thereby enhancing fluorescence quantum yield. Its carbonyl group provides a versatile site for conjugating a wide range of targeting ligands, enabling the rapid development of diverse and tunable fluorophore&#8208;ligand conjugates. This streamlined approach reduces synthetic complexity, accelerates probe development, and is compatible with a wide variety of fluorophores, such as coumarin, naphthalimide, NBD, rhodol, rhodamine, and silicon&#8208;rhodamine, facilitating the creation of high&#8208;performance, multifunctional probes for advanced cellular imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Optimized Reconstruction of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Introduces Cation Vacancies for Selective Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway represents a green production process that has gained increasing importance. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of efficacious catalysts to attain high activity under industrial current density. In this study, we present a strategy for cation vacancy generation through metal&#8208;organic frameworks self&#8208;optimized reconfiguration for the efficient electrosynthesis of H2O2 under industrial current densities in solid&#8208;electrolyte cell.&#160; The ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo electrocatalyst exhibits significant H2O2 selectivity of 97.8%, and the H2O2 productivity is up to 24.53 mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a direct and continuous output of ~3.36 wt% H2O2 aqueous solutions under industrial current density (400 mA cm&#8722;2). Impressively, the ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 220 h and can output H2O2 aqueous solution with a concentration of ~8.03 wt% in the pilot experiment. Theoretical calculations confirm that the introduction of modest cation vacancies optimizes the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate and reduces both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers, thus balancing the selectivity of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction. This work provides valuable insights into the rapid, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of H2O2 and the rational design of highly active catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of a Heterometallic [Cu2PdL4]2+ Hybrid Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods of assembling low&#8208;symmetry heterometallic cage architectures are limited to stepwise construction and combinations of inert and labile metal ions, affording complex, anisotropic cage structures by sacrificing synthetic ease. Herein, a heterometallic [Cu2PdL4]2+ lantern&#8208;type cage has been assembled in a single self&#8208;assembly step through the use of a heteroditopic ligand with two different metal&#8208;binding groups. The resultant cage complex is a fusion of two common lantern&#8208;type cage motifs &#8211; carboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic Cu4L4 cages and pyridyl&#8208;based Pd2L4 coordination cages. Evidence for heterometallic cage formation in solution was provided by 1H and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) data, while circular dichroism (CD) spectra confirmed the helical nature of the assembly. The heterometallic cage was then exploited in binding heterotopic guests. It is envisioned that the simple design strategy presented herein will ease the assembly of other structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry cage architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Strategy Yields Dopant&#8208;Free Small Molecule Hole Transport Materials for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with 20.58% Efficiency and Outstanding Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic perovskites are known for their excellent photothermal stability; however, the photothermal stability of all&#8208;inorganic n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is compromised due to ion diffusion and free radical&#8208;induced degradation caused by the use of doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport materials (HTMs). In this study, two isomeric D&#8208;A&#8208;D type small molecules, namely HBT and HiBT, were developed and used as dopant&#8208;free HTMs, using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole or benzo[d][1,2,3]thiadiazole as acceptor moieties. The HiBT molecule, with its symmetry&#8208;breaking features, exhibits a large dipole moment, enhanced coordination&#8208;active sites, and a well&#8208;aligned energy level structure, all of which contribute to passivating perovskite surface defects and improving free charge separation. As a result, inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with HiBT HTM achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.58%, the highest reported for dopant&#8208;free HTM&#8208;based inorganic PSCs. Moreover, the enhanced hydrophobic properties of HiBT molecules, coupled with their ability to passivate perovskite surface defects, contribute to significantly improved device stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Autonomous Mannosylated Nanomotors for Dynamic Cancer Cell Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An attractive strategy in cancer cell therapy is to employ motile nanoparticles that can actively search for their target. Herein, we introduce mannosylated compartmentalized cross&#8208;linked enzyme&#8208;driven nanomotors (c&#8208;CLEnM), which exhibit specific and efficient targeting of Hep G2 cells through elevated autonomous motion. In this design, we constructed biodegradable bowl&#8208;shaped stomatocytes encapsulating the enzymes glucose oxidase and catalase within their nanocavity. A subsequent enzyme crosslinking reaction was performed to guarantee their stability. Furthermore, the c&#8208;CLEnM were surface modified with a mannose&#8208;functional glycopolymer, enabling binding with receptors expressed on Hep G2 cells. Interestingly, the targeting ligands on the nanomotors not only improved their specificity towards cancer cells but also enhanced motility. Compared to the non&#8208;mannosylated nanomotors, mannosylated c&#8208;CLEnM exhibited enhanced motion and higher targeting efficiency to cells in glucose&#8208;containing ionic environments. The unexpected acceleration in speed resulted from the surface modification of these nanomotors with a glycopolymer layer, which increased the zeta potential and created a shielding effect that mitigated the influence of the surrounding ions. This nanomotor design highlights the synergistic effect of functional glycopolymer&#8208;modification on cellular uptake, adding an additional level of control to nanomotors for application in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Chemistry Development for Sodium&#8208;Based Batteries: A Blueprint from Lithium or a Step Towards Originality?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, electrolyte design for sodium&#8208;based batteries is largely inherited from their lithium&#8208;based counterparts, which often present critical challenges that hinder forging new perspectives and thus further improvements. This work delves into the key properties of representative sodium and lithium&#8208;based electrolytes, encompassing prevailing salt anions. It aims to evaluate the impact of cation chemistry, including their nature and the degree of interactions with counter anions, thereby bridging the gap in effectively transferring the know&#8208;how accumulated in lithium batteries to sodium&#8208;based batteries. The results demonstrate that the unique impact of salt anions on the properties of metal&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is tightly correlated with the nature of metal cations. By synchronizing the anionic structures with the critical feature of sodium cations, the solvating dynamics and transport properties, chemical stability, aluminum corrosion behavior, and other key properties of the electrolytes could be finely tuned to fit the specific requirements of advanced sodium&#8208;based batteries. This work gives an in&#8208;depth insight into the chemical and physical features of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, with a potential avenue to accelerate the deployment of high&#8208;performance sodium batteries and simultaneously inspire and guide the design of other electrolytes for emerging mono&#8208; and multi&#8208;valent cations&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Ligand Design and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Isoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of rac&#8208;&#223;&#8208;Butyrolactone&#160;using Salan and Salalen Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report the influence of the ligand framework on the isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;butyrolactone using highly active in situ generated salan [ONNO]H2 and salalen [ONNO]H rare&#8208;earth metal complexes. The stereochemistry was found to be highly dependent on the ortho&#8208;substituents, enabling the synthesis of either isotactic poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) (up to Pm = 0.92) or syndiotactic PHB (up to Pr = 0.91). To obtain further information on the mechanism of the isoselective ROP, which exhibits an enantiomorphic site control, the new hybrid Y[ONNO]H(N(SiHMe2)2)(THF) complex was isolated and characterized via NMR, DFT and mass&#8208;spectrometry experiments. The impact of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) was demonstrated by the addition of NCI inhibitors. Kinetic studies revealed a secondary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.14, indicating that the pre&#8208;coordination of the monomer plays a significant role in the mechanism. These findings provide a foundation for the future design of catalysts for isoselective ROP.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Peptide Nanotubes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;conjugated peptides are attractive building blocks for the construction of new nanomaterials. However, the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of these materials remains a major limitation to their wider utilization. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fine&#8208;tune the assembly of water&#8208;soluble hydrophilic polymer&#8208;conjugated cyclic peptides by incorporating a defined, short hydrocarbon linker between the polymer and peptide. This addition creates a well&#8208;defined hydrophobic &#8216;inner shell&#8217; that suppresses water from disrupting the organized peptide hydrogen bond network. Our approach is demonstrated using a series of cyclic peptide&#8208;linker&#8208;PDMA conjugates which were evaluated by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation, small angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations were also used to show how the polymer and the peptide stacks interact and illustrate the impact of this hydrophobic inner shell approach. This strategy provides a modular approach to fine control the nanotube self&#8208;assembling behavior. We expect that this technique will improve the versatility of peptide nanotubes for the engineering of advanced nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Robust Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries show great promise for energy storage, but are plagued by poor cycling stability, which can be attributed to unfavorable electrode/electrolyte interphases for both anode and cathode. Here we design and achieve the anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters in electrolyte by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases simultaneously for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;SPAN batteries. The optimal electrolyte endows Li plating/stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47% at 1 mA cm&#8211;2 in Li||Cu cells. The Li&#8211;SPAN batteries show excellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 94.21% after 1215 cycles. Moreover, the assembled pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery under limited electrolyte condition (2.40 g Ah&#8211;1) achieves a capacity of 3.75 Ah, corresponding to a high energy density of 180 Wh kg&#8211;1 based on the total mass of the battery. This work provides a good electrolyte design principle to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases for batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing molecular recognition for small molecule&#8208;mediated, reversible photochemical control over mRNA translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical probes that control the function of complex RNA molecules offer unique opportunities to interrogate biological systems. In this study, we demonstrate that a small molecule ligand selectively recognizes and undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamers. This effect is selective and dependent on both the chemical structure and RNA sequence/structure. A homogeneously modified, caged mRNA construct containing a PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or wild type p53 coding sequence displayed repressed translation in vitro or in cells until irradiated with 302 nm light, resulting in cleavage of the photocage and restoration of translation. This method demonstrates for the first time that aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition of a small molecule ligand can be used to precisely and photochemically activate the translation of a complex mRNA in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Chromophores of Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert low&#8208;concentration CO2 into the value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is particularly interesting yet remains highly challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized three metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) through the Schiff&#8208;base condensation reactions between trinuclear copper complex and different BDP&#8208;based chromophores (BDP = 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8208;. As a result, MCOF&#8208;ANT containing anthracene (ANT) group achieves the highest HCOO&#8208; production rate of 1658 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (HCOO&#8208; selectivity, ~100%) in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers under a laboratory light source, which is 7.2 and 2.1 times higher than those of MCOF&#8208;Ph and MCOF&#8208;Nap with phenyl (Ph) and naphthalene (Nap) groups, respectively. Furthermore, MCOF&#8208;ANT also exhibits an excellent photocatalytic activity for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8208; under natural sunlight, with a HCOO&#8208; production rate of 1239 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (HCOO&#8208; selectivity, ~100%). Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the presence of ANT in MCOF&#8208;ANT is favorable to the visible&#8208;light harvesting and charge separation, as well as the formation of *OCO intermediate, which clearly accounts for its superior catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Potassium Tetraiodatoiodate(III) Iodate(V): A Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Exceptional Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Full&#8208;Wavelength Phase Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonlinear optical materials with large nonlinear optical susceptibilities, wide transmission ranges, and comprehensive full&#8208;wavelength phase matching capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized a novel potassium tetraiodatoiodate(III) iodate(V) via an in situ reduction and complexation reaction. The resulting compound, K2[IIII(IVO3)4]IVO3, exhibits exceptional second harmonic generation responses (21.6KH2PO4 at 1064 nm, 1.0KTiOPO4 at 2050 nm), a wide transparency range from the visible to the mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths (0.37&#8211;6.05 &#956;m and 7.03&#8211;13.40&#160;&#956;m), and a high birefringence (0.358 at 543 nm) to achieve full&#8208;wavelength phase matching. These properties are primarily ascribed to the synergistic substantial hyperpolarizability and polarizability anisotropy exhibited by the [IIII(IVO3)4]&#8722; complex ions, which comprise square&#8208;planar coordinated trivalent iodine and optimally arranged iodate ligands. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of nonmetallic cation centered coordination entities in influencing linear and nonlinear optical properties, a discovery that has significant implications for the development of innovative inorganic functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the chirality of Metallo&#8208;cages by Manipulating the Stereochemistry of the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control over the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages by maniplating the stereochemistry of metal centers is important in many practical applications, but is extremely challenging. In this study, two isostructural metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra (1&#8208;ZnII12L18 and 2&#8208;CdII12L18) have been assembled using ligand L1 and two kinds of metal ions (ZnII and CdII) with similar coordination lability. The chiral&#8208;induction by the same guests (D&#8208;/L&#8208;camphorsulfonate, D&#8208;/L&#8208;SCS) results in a completely opposing stereochemical output of 1 and 2: D&#8208;SCS induced host&#8208;guest complex of [D&#8208;SCS&#8834;&#916;12&#8208;1] and [D&#8208;SCS&#8834;&#923;12&#8208;2], respectively, with reverse handedness. The distinct stereochemical configuration of metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra can be manipulated by participant metal ions that exhibit similar dynamics. Furthermore, a subtle variation of the ligand peripheral substituent group facilitates spontaneous resolution of metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra 3&#8208;ZnII12L28 from a racemic mixture as (R24, &#923;12)&#8208;3/(S24, &#916;12)&#8208;3 enantiopure entities. The dynamic stereochemistry of MII12L8 cuboctahedra described in this work allows a chiral manipulation based on the nature of metal centers and ligands, enabling the design and control of the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Removing &#945;&#8208;H in Carboxylate&#8208;based Electrolytes for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although carboxylate esters greatly improve the cold weather performance of graphite&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries utilized in arctic expeditions, the underlying cause of the incompatibility between carboxylates and lithium (Li) anodes has not been sufficiently explained, resulting in the greatly restricted usage of carboxylate in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we reveal the serious parasitic reactions between carboxylate &#945;&#8208;H atoms and Li metal are the culprits that render carboxylate&#8208;based ineffectiveness for LMBs. By replacing all &#945;&#8208;H atoms with fluorine atoms and methyl groups, we successfully construct inert carboxylates and find the ions/molecules distribution in electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) can be manipulated at a molecular&#8208;level. The unique structure ensuring more anions are positioned closer to the Li surface in the EDL of the inert carboxylate&#8208;based electrolyte, the morphology of the deposited Li is significantly regulated and the chemical corrosion gets effectively inhibited. As a consequence of remarkable extending lifespan of carboxylate&#8208;based LMBs with routine salt concentration and few additives. More generally, using carboxylates lacking &#945;&#8208;H atoms offers a realistic approach to increase the variety of solvents that can be used in LMBs electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens Enable Optical Logic Gates toward Lighting, Scintillators and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pressure&#8208;induced emission luminogens (PIEgens) opened the door to highly emissive materials. However, the high&#8208;pressure phase with excellent optoelectrical properties is difficult to be stabilized at ambient conditions, seriously limiting the practical applications. Here, we firstly lighted up non&#8208;emissive zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halide (C25H22P)2SnCl6 via pressure engineering, ultimately yielding the bright emission. Note that the quenched (C25H22P)2SnCl6 after pressure treatment of 20.0 GPa exhibited the very bright blue&#8208;white emission. This irreversible photoluminescence (PL) transition was associated with the irreversible amorphization by increasing the potential barrier of phase transition through the steric hindrance effect. The increased distortion of inorganic octahedra and the enhanced hydrogen bond interaction within the amorphous (C25H22P)2SnCl6 after pressure treatment were responsible for the bright emission. Thus pressure&#8208;triggered PL turn&#8208;on behavior can serve as a robust optical switchable logic gate from the initially dark state &#8220;0&#8221; to the bright state &#8220;1&#8221;. Furthermore, the pressure&#8208;treated (C25H22P)2SnCl6 exhibited an unexpected excitation&#8208;dependent emission. The unique characteristic of &#8220;PIE&#8221; with different colors can be decoded the Morse code encrypted with the pressure&#8208;treated (C25H22P)2SnCl6 and different excitations. The quenched (C25H22P)2SnCl6&#8208;based phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs), X&#8208;ray dose rate detection and centimeter&#8208;level patterns highlighted great potentials in lighting, display, scintillators, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Atom Migration Dominates Anomalous Reversible Oxidation of Ru Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation is a ubiquitous reaction in nature. For most metals (especially metal nanoparticles), they will be completely oxidized under suitable conditions, except ruthenium (Ru). In this work, in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy (in&#8208;situ TEM) and ex&#8208;situ spectroscopy were employed to investigate the oxidation process of Ru nanosheets. &#160;Ex&#8208;situ spectroscopic analysis demonstrates the incomplete oxidation of Ru nanosheets to RuO&#8322;, while the in&#8208;situ TEM observations uncover an anomalous reverse phase transformation from the oxidized to metallic phase during oxidation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the oxygen atom migration dominates the reversible oxidation process, strikingly distinct from the unidirectional oxidation pathways in conventional metallic systems. The as&#8208;generated abundant Ru&#8208;RuO2 heterointerfaces formed through reversible oxidation provide a wealth of active sites for electrochemical alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the study not only lays a foundation for the understanding complex dynamic oxidation processes, but also offers new insights into for the design of nanocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Hydroarylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes for the Synthesis of the ArCF2&#8208; Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The incorporation of fluorine and fluorinated functional groups into organic molecules alters their physicochemical properties, thereby facilitating the advancement of novel therapeutics, agricultural chemicals, biological probes, and materials. Nevertheless, there remains a deficiency of methodologies for the catalytic synthesis of certain significant fluorine&#8208;containing groups, such as ArCF2&#8208;, under mild conditions utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals. Herein, we report a method for the regioselective hydroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under mild conditions with the aid of Ni&#8208;H intermediate catalysis, which is capable of efficiently synthesizing compounds containing the ArCF2&#8208; structural motifs and possesses good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Cold&#8208;Optimized Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Enhanced Stability at &#8208;5&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have been extensively studied under room and ultralow temperature conditions. However, mechanism studies at intermediate temperature ranges remain limited. In this work, we investigate the electrochemical performance of an AZIB using a commonly employed 3 M ZnSO4 electrolyte across the intermediate temperature range of 25 to &#8208;15 &#176;C. Notably, we find that the battery with a double hydroxide cathode exhibits optimized performance at &#8208;5 &#176;C, demonstrating significantly enhanced cycling stability compared to 25 &#176;C. Mechanistic studies reveal that unfavorable H+&#8208;associated reactions at both the cathode and anode are effectively alleviated at &#8208;5 &#176;C, contributing to improved cycling stability. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses show that changes in the electrolyte environment at &#8208;5 &#176;C&#8212;such as reduced electrochemical activity of H2O, increased H&#8208;bond strength, and decreased total number of H bonds&#8212;impede H+ diffusion through the H&#8208;bond network via the Grotthuss mechanism. These effects collectively suppress harmful H+&#8208;associated reactions, allowing Zn2+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion to dominate the charge storage process. This work provides valuable insights into the enhanced performance of AZIBs at sub&#8208;low temperatures and presents opportunities for extending battery operation in near&#8208;freezing environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Self&#8208;Fenton&#160;Reaction Mediated by Silver Single Atom&#160;and Cluster&#160;Photocatalysts for Highly Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen toward Efficient Organic Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The persistent organic pollutants in wastewater have caused the heavy threat to ecosystems and humans, but selective removal of these pollutants still faces challenges due to low efficiency, extra addition of oxidation agents and many highly toxic intermediate products. Herein, we report an efficient fast kinetic conversion via a photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like system of *OOH intermediate&#8208;involved oxidation pathway with high selection generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from the novel in&#8208;situ H2O2 heterolytic activation route for the first time. The single&#8208;atom and cluster doped zinc oxide (AgSA&#8208;AgC/ZnO) was successfully synthesized to achieve the 100 % degradation yield and 80 % total of carbon (TOC) of the p&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP) as the typical pollutant under solar&#8208;light irradiation and exhibit long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;design photo&#8208;Filter reactor for 4&#8208;CP degradation. It was attributed to the accelerated cycles from Aghigh&#948;+ site to Aglow&#948;+ site in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis achieving the rapid selection conversion from the H2O2 heterolytic cleavage to ~100 % 1O2 via the intermediate *OOH at the Ag SA sites for ring&#8208;opening reaction and reactive H* at the Ag clusters sites for dechlorination reaction, respectively. This discovery gives the deep understanding of the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction through in&#8208;situ cycles of variable metals for the organic contaminants treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Annulated Radical Cations with a C4E2&#8208;Core (E = P, As, Sb): Stable Pnictogen Analogs of Elusive Aryl Radical Anions of Birch Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The benzene radical anion (C6H6)&#9679;&#8211;, possessing a 7&#960;&#8208;electron count, is a crucial intermediate in the Birch reduction and has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Herein, we report the tricyclic pnictogen radical cations [(ADC)E]2[B], [2&#8208;E][B] (ADC = PhC{N(Dipp)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; E = P, As, Sb; [B] = [B1] = B(C6F5)4 or [B2] = {3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}) featuring a central 7&#960;&#8208;electron planar C4E2 ring embedded between two 1,3&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks, as crystalline solids. [2&#8208;E][B] are prepared by one&#8208;electron (1e) oxidations of the corresponding base&#8208;stabilized cyclic pnictinidene compounds [(ADC)E]2 (1&#8208;E). Calculated spin densities (for E = P 76%, As 80%, Sb 88%) and EPR measurements suggest that [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+ are pnictogen&#8208;centered radicals and stabilized by the delocalization of the unpaired electron over the C4E2 ring. The EPR spectra of [2&#8208;E][B] exhibit characteristic signals for S = &#189; systems with clear hyperfine coupling constants for the two similar P, As or Sb nuclei. Further 1e&#8208;oxidations of [2&#8208;E][B] result in the dicationic 6&#960;&#8208;electron C4E2&#8208;species [(ADC)E]2[B]2 [3&#8208;E][B]2, which readily undergo comproportionations with 1&#8208;E to afford [2&#8208;E][B]. The radical reactivity of [2&#8208;E][B2] is shown with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) and diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) in yielding compounds [(ADC)2E{E(TEMPO)}][B2] (4&#8208;E) (E = P, Sb) and [(ADC)2P{P(SePh)}][B2] (5&#8208;P), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Growth of Oligophenylene&#8208;Structures on Graphene for Facile Secondary functionalization.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of graphene derivatives is a common approach to tune material properties for use in various applications. Due to the low reactivity of the unsaturated carbon lattice of graphene, not only are few chemical approaches suitable for successful functionalization, such as those involving highly reactive in situ formed radical species or nitrene and carbene compounds, but also the degree of functionalization is usually limited, modifying only a few percent of the carbon atoms. Typically, uncontrolled side reactions such as homocoupling and oligomerization of newly introduced functional groups can occur instead of direct coupling to the carbon lattice. We want to turn this unwanted side reaction into an advantage and use intentionally formed covalent dendrimeric oligophenylene structures for secondary functionalization. We show that these oligomeric structures can be grown to specific thicknesses and used for further functionalization with bromomethyl groups at high density on the surface. This functionalization opens further avenues for subsequent nucleophilic substitution, as exemplified by the introduction of versatile azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The results presented here are not only applicable to large oligophenylene structures, but also demonstrate that, in principle, single aryl moieties on graphene of any size and density can be successfully functionalized.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable Three&#8208;coordinate Base&#8208;Stabilized Alumylene: A Precursor of Persistent Acceptor&#8208;Free Monomeric Aluminum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An isolable monomeric alumylene stabilized by two donating ligands (phosphine and&#160;NHC) has been synthesized. Experimental and theoretical analysis confirms that the&#160;NHC ligand in the Al(I)&#8208;complex is labile and reversibly dissociates from the AlI center&#160;above &#8208;20 &#176;C. Of particular interest, despite being thermodynamically stabilized by the&#160;two ligands, alumylene complex exhibits a high reactivity with a considerably higher&#160;nucleophilicity compared to the mono&#8208;ligated complex. It is interesting to note that the&#160;Al(I)&#8208;complex reacts immediately with N2O at &#8208;90 &#176;C, allowing the synthesis of bisligated aluminum oxide, which is stable up to &#8208;70 &#176;C.</dc:description>
