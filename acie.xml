         <title>Selective Electrooxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohols to Aldehydes in a Neutral Medium: Promoted Water Dissociation over a Nickel&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biomass&#8208;derived alcohol oxidation reaction (BDAOR) holds great promise for sustainable production of chemicals.&#160;However, selective electrooxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds is still challenging.&#160;Herein, we report the electrocatalytic BDAORs to selectively produce aldehydes using single&#8208;atom ruthenium on nickel oxide (Ru  1  &#8208;NiO) as a catalyst in the neutral medium. For electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), Ru  1  &#8208;NiO exhibits a low potential of 1.283 V at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , and an optimal 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) selectivity of 90%. Experimental studies reveal that the neutral electrolyte plays a critical role in achieving a high aldehyde selectivity, and the single&#8208;atom Ru boosts HMF oxidation in the neutral medium by promoting water dissociation to afford OH*.&#160;Furthermore, Ru  1  &#8208;NiO can be extended to selective electrooxidation of a series of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols to corresponding aldehydes, which are conventionally difficult to obtain in the alkaline medium.</dc:description>

         <title>A "Self&#8208;Checking" pH/Viscosity&#8208;Activatable NIR&#8208;II Molecule for Real&#8208;Time Evaluation of Photothermal Therapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, for acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy (PTT), followed by viscosity based therapeutic efficacy evaluation by itself in two independent channels, denoted as &#8220;self&#8208;checking&#8221; strategy. In acidic TME, LET&#8208;1052 was protonated and turned on NIR&#8208;II absorption for PTT under 1064 nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, PTT induced cellular death increases intracellular viscosity, which inhibited the intramolecular rotation of LET&#8208;1052, resulting in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;I fluorescence for real&#8208;time evaluation of PTT efficacy. After PTT of tumor&#8208;bearing mice for different periods of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, NIR&#8208;I fluorescence in the tumor region showed positive correlation with tumor growth inhibition rate, demonstrating reliable and prompt prediction of PTT efficacy. The strategy may be expanded for instant evaluation of other therapeutic modalities for personalized medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Metal Organic Layer Composites for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid the poor conductivity of most pristine metal&#8211;organic frameworks, a free&#8208;standing metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) was exploited to construct diverse composites by a facile post&#8208;synthetic strategy. The structural superiority of the MOLs composites contributes to the excellent and durable performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into formate.







Abstract
2D metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) based composites have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their high structural flexibility and fully exposed active sites. Herein, a freestanding metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with a 2D kgd (kagome dual) lattice was constructed with abundant surface oxygenate groups serving as anchoring sites to immobilize diverse guests. Taking Bi as an example, tetragonal Bi2O3 nanowires can be uniformly grown on MOLs after solvothermal treatment, the structural evolution of which was followed by ex&#8197;situ electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Bi2O3/MOL exhibits excellent CO2 electroreduction activity towards formate reaching a specific current of 2.3&#8197;A&#8201;mgBi&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiencies of over 85&#8201;% with a wide potential range from &#8722;0.87 to &#8722;1.17&#8197;V, far surpassing Bi2O3/UiO (a 3D Zr6&#8208;oxo based MOF) and Bi2O3/AB (Acetylene Black). Such a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy can be flexibly extended to develop versatile MOL composites, highlighting the superiority of optimizing MOL&#8208;based composites for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of Molecular Cascade Reactions by a Reconfigurable DNA Origami Domino Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal control of molecular cascade reactions has been demonstrated by a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA). It provided a complex dynamic model system for mimicking the natural processes and introduced the fundamental concepts to the field of systems chemistry.







Abstract
Inspired by efficient biomolecular reactions in the cell, versatile DNA nanostructures have been explored for manipulating the spatial position and regulating reactions at the molecular level. Spatially controlled arrangement of molecules on the artificial scaffolds generally leads to enhanced reaction activities. Especially, the rich toolset of dynamic DNA nanostructures provides a potential route towards more sophisticated and vigorous regulation of molecular reactions. Herein, a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA) as a dynamic scaffold was adopted in this work for temporal&#8208;controlled and switchable molecular cascade reactions. Dynamic regulation of the assembly of G&#8208;quadruplex, hybridization of parallel&#8208;stranded duplex and assembly of binary DNAzyme were demonstrated. Molecular cascade reactions on the triggered reconfiguration of DODAs were realized, resulting in more complex, dynamic, and switchable control over the reactions.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Chemistry Enabled High&#8208;Performance Iodide&#8208;Ion Conversion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inter&#8208;halogen strategy for non&#8208;negative halogen fixation to fully activate and stabilize the unrealized I0/I+ redox via electrolyte modification, leading to two&#8208;electron redox chemistry has been demonstrated. An unprecedented high voltage plateau, capacity, and energy density were obtained with our strategy, which may also particularly advance iodine redox chemistry.







Abstract
A single&#8208;electron transfer mode coupled with the shuttle behavior of organic iodine batteries results in insufficient capacity, a low redox potential, and poor cycle durability. Sluggish kinetics are well known in conventional lithium&#8211;iodine (Li&#8722;I) batteries, inferior to other conversion congeners. Herein, we demonstrate new two&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I&#8722;/I+ with inter&#8208;halogen cooperation based on a developed haloid cathode. The new iodide&#8208;ion conversion battery exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;art capacity of 408&#8197;mAh&#8201;gI&#8722;1 with fast redox kinetics and superior cycle stability. Equipped with a newly emerged 3.42&#8197;V discharge voltage plateau, a recorded high energy density of 1324&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgI&#8722;1 is achieved. Such robust redox chemistry is temperature&#8208;insensitive and operates efficiently at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. With systematic theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, the formation of Cl&#8722;I+ species and their functions are clarified.

Equipped with a newly emerged 3.42&#8197;V discharge voltage plateau, a recorded high energy density of 1324&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved. Such robust redox chemistry is temperature-insensitive and operates efficiently at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. With systematic theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, the formation of Cl&#8722;I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species and their functions are clarified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissymmetric Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: Secondary Structure Elucidation and Dynamic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D helix adopted by a non&#8208;symmetric substituted poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated, and its ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanospheres or fiber&#8208;like structures under the right conditions is also demonstrated. Moreover, by conformational changes in the pendant group it is possible to produce a helix inversion in the PDPA and create a circular polarized luminescence (CPL) switch.







Abstract
The secondary structure of a dissymmetric and chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated by combining the data from NMR experiments (regioregular head to tail structure), Raman and IR studies (E configuration of the polyene double bonds), and high&#8208;resolution AFM images (helical pitch, packing angle and orientation of the external helix). As a result, an E&#8208;transoidal polyene backbone describing three coaxial helices is obtained. Theoretical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies of the structure show a good correspondence between experimental and theoretical data and allow one to decipher that the first Cotton band is generated by the poly(diphenylacetylene) core and not only by the polyene backbone. The dynamic behavior of poly&#8208;(S)&#8208;2 is also demonstrated by a helix inversion effect produced by conformational changes at the pendant groups when annealed in solvents with different donor abilities. This phenomenon is accompanied by an inversion of the circular polarized luminescence of the PDPA (CPL switch).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Band&#8208;Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Bi3+/Te4+ Emitters in Perovskite&#8208;Derivative Cs2SnCl6 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doping was developed to achieve dual&#8208;band&#8208;tunable white&#8208;light emission in perovskite&#8208;derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals with a quantum yield of up to 68.3&#8201;%. Solid evidence including the transition in photoluminescence lifetime from milliseconds at 10&#8197;K to microseconds at 300&#8197;K was provided to unravel the photoluminescence originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Bi3+/Te4+.







Abstract
Luminescent metal halides have attracted considerable attention in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting because of their superior optical properties and easy solution processibility. Herein, we report a new class of highly efficient and dual&#8208;band&#8208;tunable white&#8208;light emitters based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doped perovskite derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals. Owing to the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling and efficient energy transfer from Bi3+ to Te4+, the microcrystals exhibited broad dual&#8208;band white&#8208;light emission originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Bi3+ and Te4+, with good stability and a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of up to 68.3&#8201;%. Specifically, a remarkable transition in Bi3+&#8208;PL lifetime from milliseconds at 10&#8197;K to microseconds at 300&#8197;K was observed, as solid evidence for the isolated Bi3+ emission. These findings provide not only new insights into the excited&#8208;state dynamics of Bi3+ and Te4+ in Cs2SnCl6, but also a general approach to achieve single&#8208;composition white&#8208;light emitters based on lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal ion co&#8208;doping.

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Assisted Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones using Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones via visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis is achieved in the presence of HFIP solvent. Trapping of photo&#8208;catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to acrylamide derivatives furnishes an essential class of difluoromethyl&#8208;containing oxindole scaffolds. A high level of DFT calculations strongly supports our proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.







Abstract
A visible light photoredox catalytic method for the selective cleavage of single strong C&#8722;F bond in trifluoromethyl ketones is reported. Single electron reduction of trifluoromethyl ketones generates difluoromethyl radicals which can be engaged in intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation with N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmethacrylamides to furnish fluorine&#8208;containing oxindole derivatives in good yields. The reaction shows excellent chemoselectivity with good functional group tolerance under mild conditions. 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a solvent plays a critical role for the selective single C&#8722;F bond cleavage. High&#8208;level DFT calculations are depicted to shed light on the mechanism.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Color Fluorescent Probe Allows Simultaneous Imaging of Main and Papain&#8208;like Proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;Infected Cells for Accurate Detection and Rapid Inhibitor Screening</title>

         <dc:description>
The simultaneous visualization of crucial proteases within SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected cells can be a significant benefit for the accurate detection of virus and rapid screening of inhibitors as well as for understanding the viral lifecycle. The catalytic efficiency, intracellular enzyme activity, and distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease and papain&#8208;like protease have now been exploited using peptide&#8208;based dual&#8208;color FRET probes and their inhibitors.







Abstract
The main protease (Mpro) and papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) play critical roles in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication and are promising targets for antiviral inhibitors. The simultaneous visualization of Mpro and PLpro is extremely valuable for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and rapid inhibitor screening. However, such a crucial investigation has remained challenging because of the lack of suitable probes. We have now developed a dual&#8208;color probe (3MBP5) for the simultaneous detection of Mpro and PLpro by fluorescence (or F&#246;rster) resonance energy transfer (FRET). This probe produces fluorescence from both the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores that are cleaved by Mpro and PLpro. 3MBP5&#8208;activatable specificity was demonstrated with recombinant proteins, inhibitors, plasmid&#8208;transfected HEK 293T cells, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected TMPRSS2&#8208;Vero cells. Results from the dual&#8208;color probe first verified the simultaneous detection and intracellular distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro and PLpro. This is a powerful tool for the simultaneous detection of different proteases with value for the rapid screening of inhibitors.

         <title>Isospecific (Co)polymerization of Unmasked Polar Styrenes by Neutral Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes by neutral racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal catalysts affords perfect isotactic functional polystyrenes. Furthermore, the copolymerization of styrene with para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrene produces gradient and random copolymer, respectively. The poison effect of the polar group on the catalysts is dramatically reduced by fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment around the active species.







Abstract
Syndioselective polymerization of unprotected polar styrenes has achieved great success via specially designed catalysts and the establishment of &#8220;self&#8208;assisted&#8221; theory. In contrast, isospecific polymerization of polar styrenes has remained less explored. Herein, we present new racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal complexes and their high activity and perfect isoselectivity (mmmm&gt;99&#8201;%) for the polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes without any activators. Moreover, the copolymerizations of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrenes with styrene give gradient and random copolymers, respectively. The insertion rate of polar monomers could be readily tuned in the range of 0&#8211;100&#8197;mol&#8201;% by changing their loading ratios. The resultant isotactic polar polystyrenes are quantitatively transformed into hydroxyl or methylsulfonyl polystyrenes with high Tgs. DFT calculations reveal the isospecific mechanism.

         <title>Crosslinked Polypeptide Films via RAFT&#8208;Mediated Continuous Assembly of Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research into polypeptide films extends beyond polypeptide characterization into their fabrication. Herein, we report the novel fabrication of chemically crosslinked polypeptide films using reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Secondary structure analysis reveals unusually high random coil formation and such films further demonstrate biodegradability useful for tissue engineering and drug delivery.







Abstract
Polypeptide coatings are a cornerstone in the field of surface modification due to their widespread biological potential. As their properties are dictated by their structural features, subsequent control thereof using unique fabrication strategies is important. Herein, we report a facile method of precisely creating densely crosslinked polypeptide films with unusually high random coil content through continuous assembly polymerization via reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (CAP&#8208;RAFT). CAP&#8208;RAFT was fundamentally investigated using methacrylated poly&#8208;l&#8208;lysine (PLLMA) and methacrylated poly&#8208;l&#8208;glutamic acid (PLGMA). Careful technique refinement resulted in films up to 36.1&#177;1.1&#8197;nm thick which could be increased to 94.9&#177;8.2&#8197;nm after using this strategy multiple times. PLLMA and PLGMA films were found to have 30&#8211;50&#8201;% random coil conformations. Degradation by enzymes present during wound healing reveals potential for applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.

         <title>A General Access Route to High&#8208;Nuclearity, Metal&#8208;Functionalized Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>

Controlled thermal treatment of the common decavanadate cluster in the solid state yields a universal precursor for the synthesis of large, metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadates, as demonstrated for three examples.







Abstract
Molecular metal oxides are key materials in diverse fields like energy storage and conversion, molecular magnetism and as model systems for solid&#8208;state metal oxides. To improve their performance and increase the variety of accessible motifs, new synthetic approaches are necessary. Herein, we report a universal, new precursor to access different metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadate (POV) clusters. The precursor is synthesized by a novel solid&#8208;state thermal treatment procedure. Solution&#8208;phase test reactions at room temperature and pressure show that reaction of the precursor with various metal nitrate salts gives access to a range of metal&#8208;functionalized POVs. The first nitrate&#8208;templated molecular calcium vanadate cluster is reported. We show that this precursor could open new access routes to POV components for molecular magnetism, energy technologies or catalysis.

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Activatable DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Enables Co&#8208;Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNAzyme for Combined Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By programming multi&#8208;functional sequences in one ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chain and using it as the scaffold, we developed a lysosomal proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem, which overcomes the countervailing effect of Mn2+ on Cas9 and DNAzyme, and thus achieves efficient co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNAzyme for combined gene therapy of breast cancer.







Abstract
CRISPR/Cas9 is emerging as a platform for gene therapeutics, and the treatment efficiency is expected to be enhanced by combination with other therapeutic agents. Herein, we report a proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem that enables co&#8208;delivery of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme for the combined gene therapy of cancer. Ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chains, which contained the recognition sequences of sgRNA in Cas9/sgRNA, DNAzyme sequence and HhaI enzyme cleavage site, were synthesized as the scaffold of the nanosystem. The DNAzyme cofactor Mn2+ was used to compress DNA chains to form nanoparticles and acid&#8208;degradable polymer&#8208;coated HhaI enzymes were assembled on the surface of nanoparticles. In response to protons in lysosome, the polymer coating was decomposed and HhaI enzyme was consequently exposed to recognize and cut off the cleavage sites, thus triggering the release of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme to regulate gene expressions to achieve a high therapeutic efficacy of breast cancer.

         <title>Carbonylative Polymerization of Epoxides Mediated by Tri&#8208;metallic Complexes: A Dual Catalysis Strategy for Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual catalysis strategy via carboxylate species featuring weak nucleophilicity and basicity is used for the direct carbonylative polymerization of various epoxides for the production of original advanced polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with high molecular weight and tunable functionalization. This study represents a rare example of PHAs synthesis using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.







Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a unique class of commercially manufactured biodegradable polyesters with properties suitable for partially substituting petroleum&#8208;based plastics. However, high costs and low volumes of production have restricted their application as commodity materials. In this study, tri&#8208;metallic complexes were developed for carbonylative polymerization via a dual catalysis strategy, and 17 products of novel PHAs with up to 38.2&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1 Mn values were discovered. The polymerization proceeds in a sequential fashion, which entails the carbonylative ring expansion of epoxide to &#946;&#8208;lactone and its subsequent ring&#8208;opening polymerization that occurs selectively at the O&#8208;alkyl bond via carboxylate species. The wide availability and structural diversity of epoxide monomers provide PHAs with various structures, excellent functionalities, and tunable properties. This study represents a rare example of the preparation of PHAs using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.

In this study, tri-metallic complexes were developed for carbonylative polymerization via a dual catalysis strategy, and 17 products of novel PHAs with up to 38.2&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; values were discovered. The polymerization proceeds in a sequential fashion, which entails the carbonylative ring expansion of epoxide to &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-lactone and its subsequent ring-opening polymerization that occurs selectively at the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl bond via carboxylate species. The wide availability and structural diversity of epoxide monomers provide PHAs with various structures, excellent functionalities, and tunable properties. This study represents a rare example of the preparation of PHAs using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Fluoromethyl Couplings of Alkynes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and BrCF2H or ICH2F in the presence of zinc is described. This process is based on a nickel&#8208;mediated radical addition/fluoromethyl coupling domino strategy and provides selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H&#8208; and CH2F&#8208;substituted alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We describe here a Ni&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and fluoromethyl halides (BrCF2H and ICH2F) in the presence of zinc, enabling the facile and selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Notably, merging intramolecular radical cyclization with fluoromethyl coupling enables the expedient constructions of CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated lactones and lactams with high efficiency and selectivity. Mechanistic studies disclose that this catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical addition to an alkyne followed by selective coupling with the fluoromethyl unit.

         <title>Upgrading Carbonate Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;stable Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiNO3 is reported to dissolve at concentrations up to 0.7&#8197;M in ethylene carbonate (EC) without need for additives. We show further that various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes can be upgraded with LiNO3 to yield practical batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a widely used salt&#8208;additive that markedly improves the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at a Li metal anode but is generally regarded as incompatible with alkyl carbonates. Here we find that contrary to common wisdom, cyclic carbonate solvents such as ethylene carbonate can dissolve up to 0.7&#8197;M LiNO3 without any additives, largely improving the anode reversibility. We demonstrate the significance of our findings by upgrading various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes with LiNO3, which provides large improvements in batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes. Capacity retentions of 90.5&#8201;% after 600 cycles and 92.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles are reported for LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.5&#8197;C) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.2&#8197;C), respectively. 1&#8197;Ah pouch cells (&#8776;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) retain more than 87.9&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work illustrates that reforming traditional carbonate electrolytes provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach towards practical LMBs.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Step Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Switching in BiOIO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching has been achieved in polar BiOIO3, by using an in situ high&#8208;pressure polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurement system. The step&#8208;wise suppression of the lone&#8208;pair electrons on I5+ cations has been demonstrated to be responsible for the switching phenomenon in BiOIO3, and materials with multi&#8208;stabilities are crucial to next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.







Abstract
Materials with multi&#8208;stabilities controllable by external stimuli have potential for high&#8208;capacity information storage and switch devices. Herein, we report the observation of pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching in polar BiOIO3 for the first time. Structure analyses reveal two pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions in BiOIO3 from the ambient noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;high) to an intermediate noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;intermediate) and then to a centrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;off). The three&#8208;state SHG switching was inspected by in&#8197;situ high&#8208;pressure powder SHG and polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurements. Local structure analyses based on the in&#8197;situ Raman spectra and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal that the SHG switching is caused by the step&#8208;wise suppression of lone&#8208;pair electrons on the [IO3]&#8722; units. The dramatic evolution of the functional units under compression also leads to subtle changes of the optical absorption edge of BiOIO3. Materials with switchable multi&#8208;stabilities provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;art platform for next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.

         <title>A Topologically Engineered Gold Island for Programmed In Vivo Stem Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated processing chain of therapeutic cells based on topologically engineered ligands, nuclease&#8208;mimic artificial enzyme and tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field is constructed. The integration of multiple functional components guides stem cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation detachment, in&#8197;situ magnetic labeling and retention at the implantation site, thus allowing programmed stem cell manipulation in vivo over prolonged time.







Abstract
Even a well&#8208;designed system can only control stem cell adhesion, release, and differentiation, while other cell manipulations such as in&#8197;situ labeling and retention in target tissues, are difficult to achieve in the same system. Herein, native ligand cluster&#8208;mimicking islands, composed of topologically engineered ligand, anchoring point AuNP, nuclease mimetics CeIV complexes and magnetic core Fe3O4, are designed to facilitate comprehensive cell manipulations in a programmable manner. Three islands with different amounts of AuNPs are constructed, which means tunable interligand spacing within a cluster. These nanostructures are chemically coupled to a substrate using DNA tethers. Under a tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field, this integrated system promotes stem cell adhesion, proliferation, mechanosensing, differentiation, detachment, in&#8197;situ effective magnetic labeling and retention both in vitro and in vivo, offering fascinating opportunities for a biomimetic matrix in regenerative medicine.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for In&#8197;Vivo Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ratiometric fluorescent hydrogen probe was developed for the first time by a catalytic hydrogenation strategy, enabling efficient detection of hydrogen molecules in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro with high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, in favor of uncovering and understanding underlying biological behaviors and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules.







Abstract
To reveal the biomedical effects and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules urgently needs hydrogen molecular imaging probes as an imperative tool, but the development of these probes is extremely challenging. A catalytic hydrogenation strategy is proposed to design and synthesize a ratiometric fluorescent probe by encapsulating Pd nanoparticles and conjugating azido&#8208;/coumarin&#8208;modified fluorophore into mesoporous silica nanoparticles, realizing in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo fluorescence imaging of hydrogen molecules. The developed hydrogen probe exhibits high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, enabling rapid and real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen molecules both in cells and in the body of animal and plant. By application of the developed fluorescent probe, we have directly observed the super&#8208;high transmembrane and ultrafast transport abilities of hydrogen molecules in cells, animals and plants, and discovered in&#8197;vivo high diffusion of hydrogen molecules.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Access to Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Imidazol(in)ium Salts</title>

         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts in one step via cascade reactions of easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles was developed. Feasibility of the new imidazol(in)ium salts for direct metallation to give M/NHC complexes (M=Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au) was demonstrated.







Abstract
Imidazolium salts have ubiquitous applications in energy research, catalysis, materials and medicinal sciences. Here, we report a new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts from easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes in one step. The strategy relies on a discovered family of unprecedented nucleophilic addition/cyclization reactions with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles. To probe general areas of application, synthesized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors were feasible for direct metallation to give functionalized M/carbene complexes (M=Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au), which were isolated in individual form. The utility of the chloromethyl function for the postmodification of the synthesized salts and Pd/carbene complexes was demonstrated. The obtained complexes and imidazolium salts demonstrated good activities in Pd&#8208; or Ni&#8208;catalyzed model cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8722;H activation reactions.

         <title>Programmable Transient Supramolecular Chiral G&#8208;quadruplex Hydrogels by a Chemically Fueled Non&#8208;equilibrium Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temporal and spatial control of natural systems has aroused great interest for the creation of synthetic mimics. Herein, a dynamic boronic ester based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy has enabled the creation of programmable and transient supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with tunable lifetimes from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability, and self&#8208;healing properties.







Abstract
The temporal and spatial control of natural systems has aroused great interest for the creation of synthetic mimics. By using boronic ester based dynamic covalent chemistry and coupling it with an internal pH feedback system, we have developed a new chemically fueled reaction network for non&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with programmable lifetimes from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. The system can be controlled by the kinetically controlled in&#8197;situ formation and dissociation of dynamic boronic ester bonds between the cis&#8208;diol of guanosine (G) and 5&#8208;fluorobenzoxaborole (B) in the presence of chemical fuels (KOH and 1,3&#8208;propanesultone), thereby leading to a precipitate&#8208;solution&#8208;gel&#8208;precipitate cycle under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach showed the underlying mechanism of the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly involves aggregation and disaggregation of right&#8208;handed helical G&#8208;quadruplex superstructures. The proposed dynamic boronic ester&#8208;based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy offers a new option to design next&#8208;generation adaptive and interactive smart materials.

         <title>Efficient Polyester Hydrogenolytic Deconstruction via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1&#8197;atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics.







Abstract
Using a mechanism&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free tandem catalytic approach, commodity polyester plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are rapidly and selectively deconstructed by combining the two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C, under 1&#8197;atm H2, affording terephthalic acid (or naphthalene dicarboxylic acid for PEN) and ethane (or butane for PBT) in essentially quantitative yield. This process is effective for both laboratory grade and waste plastics, and comingled polypropylene remains unchanged. Combined experimental and DFT mechanistic analyses indicate that Hf(OTf)4 catalyzes a mildly exergonic retro&#8208;hydroalkoxylation reaction in which an alkoxy C&#8722;O bond is first cleaved, yielding a carboxylic acid and alkene, and this process is closely coupled to an exergonic olefin hydrogenation step, driving the overall reaction forward.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Shape&#8208;Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Boronic Ester Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) exhibiting mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable properties were synthesized by introducing dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer networks. This research shines new light onto the development of dynamic covalent polymers for emerging applications in areas of bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optics and smart soft robotics.







Abstract
Endowing a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE) exhibiting a helicoidal nanostructure with dynamically tailorable functionalities is of paramount significance for its emerging applications in diverse fields such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. Here, a mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable CLCE is judiciously designed and synthesized through integrating dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer network. The circularly polarized reflection of CLCEs can be reversibly and dynamically tuned across the entire visible spectrum by mechanical stretching. Thanks to the introduction of dynamic boronic ester bonds, the CLCEs were found to show robust reprogrammable and self&#8208;healing capabilities. The research disclosed herein can provide new insights into the development of 4D (color and 3D shape) programmable photonic actuators towards bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optical systems, and next&#8208;generation intelligent machines.

         <title>Surface Engineering Assisted Size and Structure Modulation of Gold Nanoclusters by Ionic Liquid Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid cations are deployed to regulate the size and structure of AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. Upon mild reduction, such AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes can be easily converted into desired AuI&#8208;thiolate protecting motifs, selectively producing atomically precise gold nanoclusters with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry.







Abstract
Surface modification induced core size/structure change is a recent discovery in inorganic nanoparticles research, and has rarely been revealed at the molecular level. Here, we exemplify with atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) that proper surface modification can selectively stabilize the desired Au0 core, conducive to the formation of size/structure&#8208;controlled Au NCs. Leveraging &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, ionic liquid (IL) cations are bonded to AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. The hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic interactions between IL cations subsequently provide a good mechanism to prolong the size of the AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes, selectively producing small&#8208;sized Au NCs upon reduction. Through combined control over the structure and concentration of IL cations, pH and solvent polarity, we are able to produce atomically precise Au NCs with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry. This work also provides a facile means to integrate/synergize the materials functionalities of Au NCs and ILs, increasing their acceptance in diverse fields.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Featured Supramolecular Tubisomes for Imaging&#8208;Guided Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured cylindrical polymeric nanoparticles (tubisomes) are obtained from the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic cyclic peptide polymer conjugate. Intriguingly, encapsulation of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) can inactivate the fluorescence of both tubisome and DOX due to the energy transfer relay (ETR). The release of DOX can interrupt the ETR effect and light up the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ visualization of drug release.







Abstract
Polymeric cylinders, a fascinating type of nanostructures with high surface area, internal volume and rigidity, have been exploited as novel drug delivery vehicles over the past decade. However, it's still an open challenge to afford cylindrical nanostructures using polymeric building blocks via traditional self&#8208;assembly processes. Herein, we report a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy of preparing cylindrical aggregates (tubisomes) from an amphiphilic supramolecular bottlebrush polymer in which a cyclic peptide nanotube is employed as the noncovalent backbone. Additionally, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect was introduced into the tubisomes to endow them with excellent fluorescent properties. Intriguingly, by encapsulating with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), both the fluorescence of tubisome and DOX can be quenched due to the energy transfer relay (ETR) effect. The release of DOX can induce the interruption of the ETR effect and recover the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ imaging of drug release. The AIE&#8208;featured supramolecular tubisomes reported here provide an alternative approach for fabricating cylindrical polymeric nanostructures and holds great potential for imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery.

         <title>Tuning Exciton Coupling of Merocyanine Nucleoside Dimers by RNA, DNA and GNA Double Helix Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>

The barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) is reported as a nucleobase surrogate that forms hydrogen&#8208;bonded base pairs, and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked dimer aggregates, with orientation&#8208; and conformation&#8208;sensitive exciton coupling strength.







Abstract
Exciton coupling between two or more chromophores in a specific environment is a key mechanism associated with color tuning and modulation of absorption energies. This concept is well exemplified by natural photosynthetic proteins, and can also be achieved in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures. Here we report the coupling of barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) nucleoside analogues and show that exciton coupling can be tuned by the double helix conformation. BAM is a nucleobase mimic that was incorporated in the phosphodiester backbone of RNA, DNA and GNA oligonucleotides. Duplexes with different backbone constitutions and geometries afforded different mutual dye arrangements, leading to distinct optical signatures due to competing modes of chromophore organization via electrostatic, dipolar, &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The realized supramolecular motifs include hydrogen&#8208;bonded BAM&#8211;adenine base pairs and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked BAM dimer aggregates with distinct absorption, CD and fluorescence properties.

         <title>Unraveling the Function of Metal&#8211;Amorphous Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphization of the support for single&#8208;atoms catalysts (SACs) is another efficient but unknown strategy in improving the catalytic properties through adjusting the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI). This work showcases a model ruthenium SAC and expounds on how the flexibly amorphous configuration of the support matrix functions unexpectedly in intensifying the MSI and further accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics of SACs.







Abstract
Amorphization of the support in single&#8208;atom catalysts is a less researched concept for promoting catalytic kinetics through modulating the metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI). We modeled single&#8208;atom ruthenium (RuSAs) supported on amorphous cobalt/nickel (oxy)hydroxide (Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi) to explore the favorable MSI between RuSAs and the amorphous skeleton for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Differing from the usual crystal counterpart (Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi), the electrons on RuSAs are facilitated to exchange among local configurations (Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Co/Ni) of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi since the flexibly amorphous configuration induces the possible d&#8211;d electron transfer and medium&#8208;to&#8208;long range p&#8211;&#960; orbital coupling, further intensifying the MSI. This embodies Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi with enhanced water dissociation, alleviated oxophilicity, and rapid hydrogen migration, which results in superior durability and HER activity of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi, wherein only 15&#8197;mV can deliver 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, significantly lower than the 58&#8197;mV required by Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi.

         <title>Suppressing Creep and Promoting Fast Reprocessing of Vitrimers with Reversibly Trapped Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscous deformation in elastomeric vitrimers is suppressed by temporarily trapping a reactive side chain in the polymer backbone. Upon heating, the network defect is recovered allowing for fast exchange. This offers a versatile strategy to simultaneously achieve fast reprocessing, while maintaining the strong dimensional stability of vitrimers.







Abstract
We report a straightforward chemical strategy to tackle current challenges of irreversible deformation in low Tg vitrimers at operating temperature. In particular, vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers were prepared where reactive free amines, necessary for material flow, were temporarily shielded inside the network backbone, by adding a small amount of dibasic ester to the curing mixture. The amines could be released as reactive chain ends from the resulting dicarboxamide bonds via thermally reversible cyclisation to an imide moiety. Indeed, (re)generation of the required nucleophilic amines as network defects ensured reprocessing and rapid material flow at higher temperature, where exchange dynamics are (re)activated. As a result, VU vitrimers were obtained with limited creep at service temperature, yet with good reprocessability at elevated temperatures. Thus, by exerting strong control on the molecular level over the availability of exchangeable functional groups, a remarkable improvement of VU properties was obtained.

     alt="Suppressing Creep and Promoting Fast Reprocessing of Vitrimers with Reversibly Trapped Amines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viscous deformation in elastomeric vitrimers is suppressed by temporarily trapping a reactive side chain in the polymer backbone. Upon heating, the network defect is recovered allowing for fast exchange. This offers a versatile strategy to simultaneously achieve fast reprocessing, while maintaining the strong dimensional stability of vitrimers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a straightforward chemical strategy to tackle current challenges of irreversible deformation in low &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; vitrimers at operating temperature. In particular, vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers were prepared where reactive free amines, necessary for material flow, were temporarily shielded inside the network backbone, by adding a small amount of dibasic ester to the curing mixture. The amines could be released as reactive chain ends from the resulting dicarboxamide bonds via thermally reversible cyclisation to an imide moiety. Indeed, (re)generation of the required nucleophilic amines as network defects ensured reprocessing and rapid material flow at higher temperature, where exchange dynamics are (re)activated. As a result, VU vitrimers were obtained with limited creep at service temperature, yet with good reprocessability at elevated temperatures. Thus, by exerting strong control on the molecular level over the availability of exchangeable functional groups, a remarkable improvement of VU properties was obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Module&#8208;Patterned Polymerization towards Crystalline 2D sp2&#8208;Carbon Covalent Organic Framework Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new topology diagram was developed for the efficient and designed synthesis of 2D polymers and open frameworks, which led to the creation of novel 2D sp2&#8208;carbon materials via a C=C bond&#8208;formation reaction. The sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and exhibit two&#8208;photon up&#8208;conversion luminescence, create novel 2D semiconductors with low band gaps yet tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretical maxima.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress over the past decade, most polycondensation systems even upon a small structural variation of the building units eventually result in amorphous polymers other than the desired crystalline covalent organic frameworks. This synthetic dilemma is a central and challenging issue of the field. Here we report a novel approach based on module&#8208;patterned polymerization to enable efficient and designed synthesis of crystalline porous polymeric frameworks. This strategy features a wide applicability to allow the use of various knots of different structures, enables polycondensation with diverse linkers, and develops a diversity of novel crystalline 2D polymers and frameworks, as demonstrated by using the C=C bond&#8208;formation polycondensation reaction. The new sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and enable up&#8208;conversion luminescence, offer low band gap semiconductors with tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretically predicted maxima.

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of Stereo&#8208; and Sequence&#8208;Defined Polymers via Acid&#8208;Orthogonal Deprotection Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection reactions which proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability is reported. This chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers.







Abstract
Absolute control over polymer stereo&#8208; and sequence structure is highly challenging in polymer chemistry. Here, an acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection strategy is proposed for the iterative synthesis of a family of unimolecular polymers starting with enantiopure serines, featuring precise sequence, stereoconfiguration and side&#8208;chain functionalities that cannot be achieved using traditional polymerization techniques. Acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotections proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability. Under p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid, acidolysis of tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl can proceed exclusively, while low&#8208;dosage trifluoroacetic acid and low temperature only trigger the selective and quantitative cleavage of trityl. The pioneering use of this acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers, thus imparting their unique properties beyond natural biopolymers.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products on a Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Based Cu0&#8211;CuI Tandem Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst was constructed for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Cu nanoparticles (NPs) derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces and CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces show a tandem effect during the CO2RR process. A high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved on this tandem catalyst.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 on a polymer&#8208;modified Cu&#8208;based catalyst has shown high multi&#8208;electron reduction (&gt;2&#8201;e&#8722;) selectivity, however, most of the corresponding current densities are still too small to support industrial applications. In this work, we designed a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst for the production of C2+ products with both high reaction rate and high selectivity. Remarkably, a high C2+ faradaic efficiency (FE
) of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu0&#8208;PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces are vital for such reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C2+ selectivity, whereas CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces exhibit high activity for C&#8722;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Furthermore, the presence of the PIL layer promotes the C2+ selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Conversion of Epoxides into Thiiranes: Mechanism, Stereochemical Model, and New Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations have clarified the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of the chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed thionation of epoxides with thiolactam by kinetic resolution. Bulky ortho groups are important to restrict the position of the epoxide group in the key transition states of the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, while increasing the size of the para&#8208;substituents also increases the enantioselectivity significantly.







Abstract
Computations and experiments leading to new chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) for epoxide thionations are reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of such CPA&#8208;catalyzed epoxide thionations. The calculated mechanistic information was used to design new efficient CPAs that were tested experimentally and found to be highly effective. Bulky ortho&#8208;substituents on the 3,3&#8242;&#8208;aryl groups of the CPA are important to restrict the position of the epoxide in the key transition states for the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. Larger para&#8208;substituents significantly improve the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Switchable Zwitterionic Peptide for Rapid Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid colorimetric detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease using a zwitterionic peptide and gold colloids is reported. The sensor showed good performance in exhaled breath condensate with a limit of detection in the low nanomolar range. This technology can be integrated into regular face coverings for COVID&#8208;detection.







Abstract
The transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 coronavirus has led to the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Nucleic acid testing while specific has limitations for mass surveillance. One alternative is the main protease (Mpro) due to its functional importance in mediating the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a combination of modular substrate and gold colloids to detect Mpro via visual readout. The strategy involves zwitterionic peptide that carries opposite charges at the C&#8208;/N&#8208;terminus to exploit the specific recognition by Mpro. Autolytic cleavage releases a positively charged moiety that assembles the nanoparticles with rapid color changes (t&lt;10&#8197;min). We determine a limit of detection for Mpro in breath condensate matrices &lt;10&#8197;nM. We further assayed ten COVID&#8208;negative subjects and found no false&#8208;positive result. In the light of simplicity, our test for viral protease is not limited to an equipped laboratory, but also is amenable to integrating as portable point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices including those on face&#8208;coverings.

         <title>Nitrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis by Metallonitrene C&#8722;H Insertion: Photocatalytic Amidation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nitrogen atom transfer into aldehyde C&#8722;H bonds is reported. A palladium(II) metallonitrene species with nitrogen&#8208;centered biradical character was identified as the key intermediate and was photocrystallographically, magnetically and computationally characterized. The nucleophilic metallonitrene C&#8722;H insertion step results in inverted selectivity for the net nitrene transfer catalysis.







Abstract
C&#8722;H amination and amidation by catalytic nitrene transfer are well&#8208;established and typically proceed via electrophilic attack of nitrenoid intermediates. In contrast, the insertion of (formal) terminal nitride ligands into C&#8722;H bonds is much less developed and catalytic nitrogen atom transfer remains unknown. We here report the synthesis of a formal terminal nitride complex of palladium. Photocrystallographic, magnetic, and computational characterization support the assignment as an authentic metallonitrene (Pd&#8722;N) with a diradical nitrogen ligand that is singly bonded to PdII. Despite the subvalent nitrene character, selective C&#8722;H insertion with aldehydes follows nucleophilic selectivity. Transamidation of the benzamide product is enabled by reaction with N3SiMe3. Based on these results, a photocatalytic protocol for aldehyde C&#8722;H trimethylsilylamidation was developed that exhibits inverted, nucleophilic selectivity as compared to typical nitrene transfer catalysis. This first example of catalytic C&#8722;H nitrogen atom transfer offers facile access to primary amides after deprotection.

         <title>Back Cover: Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 9/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt corrole with an appended crown ether unit displays significantly boosted electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity in the presence of water as reported by Rui Cao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202114310). The crown ether unit is able to grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions. The established water network can play critical roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to improved electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, which mimics water&#8208;network&#8208;assisted proton transfer as found in metalloproteins.

Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach with two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1&#8197;atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics, as reported by Yosi Kratish and Tobin&#8197;J. Marks in their Research Article (e202112576).

         <title>Development of Chiral Ligands for the Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Silylation and Borylation of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview presents an overview of the recent progress in the design of chiral ligands and substrates for the enantioselective borylation and silylation of C&#8722;H bonds, as well as the salient mechanistic features and reaction scope, thereby revealing the limitations and challenges in this area and inspiring continued development of this synthetic method.







Abstract
Enantioselective reactions that install functional groups at the positions of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds can be envisioned to produce intermediates for the synthesis of the active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals directly from simple feedstocks. Among these C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions, those that form carbon&#8211;silicon (C&#8722;Si) and carbon&#8211;boron (C&#8722;B) bonds have been pursued because the products of these reactions can be converted to those containing a wide range of functional groups and because compounds containing silicon and boron possess unique properties that can be valuable for medicinal and materials chemistry. Although the silylation and borylation of C&#8722;H bonds have undergone extensive development during the past two decades, enantioselective versions of these reactions were not known until a few years ago. In this Minireview, we present the rapid development of enantioselective silylation and borylation of C&#8722;H bonds, with an emphasis on the design and development of the types of chiral ligands needed to achieve these reactions and an intention to inspire an expansion of these types of transformations.

         <title>Application of Perovskite Quantum Dots as an Absorber in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) display the quantum confinement effect yet maintain the characteristics of bulk materials. In this Review the advantages and disadvantages of perovskite QDs and significant strategies (exchange chemistry, passivation engineering, and structure engineering) for the advancement of perovskite solar cells with perovskite QDs as an absorber are discussed.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) preserve the attractive properties of perovskite bulk materials and present additional advantages, owing to their quantum confinement effect, leading to their suitability as an absorber in perovskite solar cells. In this Review, the issues and advantages of perovskite QDs are analyzed in the context of purification, device fabrication with perovskite QDs, light absorption, charge transport, and stability. In addition, promising strategies to enhance perovskite QDs and QD&#8208;based solar cells are elucidated based on exchange chemistry (ion and ligand exchange), passivation engineering (ion and ligand passivation), and structure engineering (conventional/inverted, planar/mesoscopic and dimensionally graded structures). These discussions will give a clue to the further development of perovskite QDs and thus the advancement of QD&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>Synthesis and Processing of Nanomaterials Mediated by Living Organisms</title>

Green living nanofactories: Nanomaterials (NMs) and nanocomposites are typically prepared by procedures that are incompatible with green chemistry and sustainability principles. But some living entities, from single cells to higher organisms, are able to synthesize and process NMs very efficiently under milder conditions. In this Minireview, the advances and prospects of this growing trend are discussed and summarized.







Abstract
Nanomaterials offer exciting properties and functionalities. However, their production and processing frequently involve complex methods, cumbersome equipment, harsh conditions, and hazardous media. The capability of organisms to accomplish this using mild conditions offers a sustainable, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly alternative. Different nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, silica nanostructures, and nanocellulose are being synthesized increasingly through living entities. In addition, the bionanofabrication potential enables also the in situ processing of nanomaterials inside biomatrices with unprecedented outcomes. In this Minireview we present a critical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vision of current nanofabrication approaches mediated by living entities (ranging from unicellular to higher organisms), in order to expand this knowledge and scrutinize future prospects. An efficient interfacial interaction at the nanoscale by green means is within reach through this approach.

         <title>Sensitive Quantification of MicroRNA in Blood through Multi&#8208;amplification Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA&#8208;Strand&#8208;Displacement Paper&#8208;Spray Mass Spectrometry (TSD&#8208;PS MS)</title>

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;amplification paper&#8208;spray mass spectrometry (PS MS) platform has been designed for quantifying miRNA in blood. A toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction and UV light have been employed to amplify the signal and ensure the sensitivity of the detection. More importantly, the paper spray method can efficiently filter out interference signals from the blood. The platform showed high sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability in a prototypical detection of the cancer biomarker miRNA&#8208;141.







Abstract
Accurate quantification of disease&#8208;signature microRNAs (miRNAs) in biomedical samples is in high demand for clinical diagnosis but still challenging because of the low abundance of miRNAs and complicating interferences in the milieus. Here, we report a multi&#8208;amplification strategy based on paper&#8208;spray mass spectrometry (PS MS) for the analysis of miRNAs in blood. A toehold&#8208;mediated DNA&#8208;strand&#8208;displacement reaction (TSD) is employed to amplify the signal chain and to ensure the specificity. The signal chain is then cleaved by UV light to release signal molecules for detection. Moreover, the paper spray method can efficiently filter out interfering substances in the blood and further enhance the sensitivity of detection. This concept is successfully demonstrated in the prototypical detection of the cancer biomarker miRNA&#8208;141 in blood and serum. The proposed TSD&#8208;PS MS approach provides an efficient method for the sensitive detection of oligonucleotides at low concentration in complicated milieus.

         <title>Triplet Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of Guest Molecules through Induced Fit in a Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of dynamic nuclear polarization of guest molecules in a porous host material at around room temperature is reported. The induced fit of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) for guest molecules suppresses the nuclear spin relaxation and allows the polarization transfer to target guest molecules.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization utilizing photoexcited triplet electrons (triplet&#8208;DNP) has great potential for room&#8208;temperature hyperpolarization of nuclear spins. However, the polarization transfer to molecules of interest remains a challenge due to the fast spin relaxation and weak interaction with target molecules at room temperature in conventional host materials. Here, we demonstrate the first example of DNP of guest molecules in a porous material at around room temperature by utilizing the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;type structural transformation of a crystalline yet flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In contrast to the usual hosts, 1H spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time becomes longer by accommodating a pharmaceutical model target 5&#8208;fluorouracil as the flexible MOF changes its structure upon guest accommodation to maximize the host&#8211;guest interactions. Combined with triplet&#8208;DNP and cross&#8208;polarization (CP), this system realizes an enhanced 19F&#8197;NMR signal of guest target molecules.

         <title>Sn7Br10S2: The First Ternary Halogen&#8208;Rich Chalcohalide Exhibiting a Chiral Structure and Pronounced Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ternary halogen&#8208;rich nonlinear optical chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2 exhibits a strong phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.5 &#215; AGS@2.1&#8197;&#956;m) and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (6.3 &#215; AGS). This work provides a competitive candidate with good performance, facile synthesis and simple chemical composition for infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) applications, and also introduces a facile strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance NLO materials via a symmetry break.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are significant in laser technology for civil and military uses. Here, we report the synthesis, structural chemistry and NLO properties of a halogen&#8208;rich chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2. Its noncentrosymmetric (NCS, P63) structure can be considered as partially aliovalent anion substitution of SnBr2 (P63/m) induced centrosymmetric (CS) to NCS structural transformation. The 3D &#8734;[Sn(1)6Sn(2)6Br6X6]6&#8722; (X=Br/S) channel framework consists of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 trigonal pyramids. It exhibits excellent NLO performance, including a strong phase&#8208;matchable NLO response of 1.5 &#215; AgGaS2and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 6.3 &#215; AgGaS2.Investigation of the structure&#8211;NLO performance relationship confirms that the effective arrangement of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 units predominantly contributes to the large SHG response. These results indicate Sn7Br10S2 is a potential IR NLO candidate and provides a new feasible system for promising NLO materials.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Additions of Enol Silanes to In Situ Generated Cyclic, Aliphatic N&#8208;Acyliminium Ions</title>

         <dc:description>
Saturated nitrogen heterocycles are essential pharmacophores in drugs and natural products, and general methods for their enantioselective synthesis are still highly sought after. A new direct approach utilizing hemiaminal methyl ethers as N&#8208;acyliminium precursors for the enantioselective preparation of cyclic, aliphatic and 2&#8208;subsituted pyrrolidines, piperidines and azepanes has been achieved.







Abstract
Strong and confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalysts enable highly enantioselective substitutions of cyclic, aliphatic hemiaminal ethers with enol silanes. 2&#8208;Substituted pyrrolidines, piperidines, and azepanes are obtained with high enantioselectivities, and the method displays a broad tolerance of various enol silane nucleophiles. Several natural products can be accessed using this methodology. Mechanistic studies support the intermediacy of non&#8208;stabilized, cyclic N&#8208;(exo&#8208;acyl)iminium ions, paired with the confined chiral counteranion. Computational studies suggest transition states that explain the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Porous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Networks with Hydrogel&#8208;Like Actuation and Reconfigurable Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous liquid&#8208;crystalline network can swell in water for actuation through both water absorption and order&#8211;disorder phase transition, and be loaded with functional fillers to display reconfigurable functions.







Abstract
A porous liquid&#8208;crystalline network (LCN), prepared by using a template method, was found to exhibit peculiar actuation functions. The creation of porosity makes the initially hydrophobic LCN behave like a hydrogel, capable of absorbing a large volume of water (up to ten times the sample size of LCN). When the amount of absorbed water is relatively small (about 100&#8201;% swelling ratio), the porous LCN displays anisotropic swelling in water and, in the same time, the retained uniaxial alignment of mesogens ensures a thermally induced shape change associated with a LC&#8208;isotropic phase transition. Combining the characteristic actuation mechanisms of LCN (order&#8211;disorder transition of mesogens) and hydrogel (water absorption), such porous LCNs can be explored for versatile stimuli&#8208;triggered shape transformations. Moreover, the porosity enables loading/removal/reloading of functional fillers such as ionic liquids, photothermal dyes and fluorophores, which imparts the porous LCN actuator with reconfigurable functions such as ionic conductivity, light&#8208;driven locomotion, and emissive color.

&lt;p&gt;A porous liquid-crystalline network can swell in water for actuation through both water absorption and order&#8211;disorder phase transition, and be loaded with functional fillers to display reconfigurable functions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A porous liquid-crystalline network (LCN), prepared by using a template method, was found to exhibit peculiar actuation functions. The creation of porosity makes the initially hydrophobic LCN behave like a hydrogel, capable of absorbing a large volume of water (up to ten times the sample size of LCN). When the amount of absorbed water is relatively small (about 100&#8201;% swelling ratio), the porous LCN displays anisotropic swelling in water and, in the same time, the retained uniaxial alignment of mesogens ensures a thermally induced shape change associated with a LC-isotropic phase transition. Combining the characteristic actuation mechanisms of LCN (order&#8211;disorder transition of mesogens) and hydrogel (water absorption), such porous LCNs can be explored for versatile stimuli-triggered shape transformations. Moreover, the porosity enables loading/removal/reloading of functional fillers such as ionic liquids, photothermal dyes and fluorophores, which imparts the porous LCN actuator with reconfigurable functions such as ionic conductivity, light-driven locomotion, and emissive color.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transforming Rhodamine Dyes for (d)STORM Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy via 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Imidazolium Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium markedly improves the photoswitching behavior and overall performance of (direct) stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ((d)STORM). Excellent super&#8208;resolution microscopy images are thus obtained under green excitation.







Abstract
We introduce a strategy to optimize the photoswitching behavior of rhodamines for (d)STORM super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium, the resultant dyes are markedly sensitized toward photoswitching, and exhibit outstanding (d)STORM performance with fast on&#8208;off switching, long&#8208;lasting blinking, and bright single&#8208;molecule emission. We thus attain excellent (d)STORM images under green excitation that are on par with the &#8220;ideal&#8221; red&#8208;excited dyes, including for difficult structures such as the mammalian actin cytoskeleton, and demonstrate high&#8208;quality two&#8208;color three&#8208;dimensional (d)STORM.

&#8220;Dynamic&#8221; helical metal&#8208;based polymers can offer adaptability and functionality, but such systems remain unexplored. The titled polymers display mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for &#946;&#8208;(L and D)&#8208;arabinopyranosyl sidechains (signifying helical coiling with preferred, opposite screw sense); the responsiveness and dynamic nature of the folded conformations are evident, and developments toward helicity&#8208;governed activity are described.







Abstract
The study of metallopolymers with controllable helical sense remains in its infancy. We report arabinose&#8208;functionalized (Zn&#8208;salphen)&#8208;based conjugated polymers that display mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism spectra for L&#8208; and D&#8208;sugar sidechains respectively, signifying ordered (helical) coiling of the polymer backbone with opposite screw&#8208;sense preferences. The observation of different spectroscopic behavior and Cotton effects for a variety of solvents (in a reversible manner) and temperatures, ascribed to changes in the extent of intrachain (Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(salphen) and &#960;&#8208;stacking) interactions between Zn&#8208;salphen moieties, thus indicate the flexible, responsive and dynamic nature of the folded helical conformation in these systems. An application study signifying that activity can be governed by the structure and helical sense of the polymer is described.

         <title>Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt corrole with an appended crown ether unit was designed and synthesized to model water&#8208;network&#8208;assisted proton transfer as found in metalloproteins. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that the crown ether unit of this cobalt corrole can grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions and the established water network plays vital roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to significantly boosted electrocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Proton transfer is vital for many biological and chemical reactions. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded water&#8208;containing networks are often found in enzymes to assist proton transfer, but similar strategy has been rarely presented by synthetic catalysts. We herein report the Co corrole 1 with an appended crown ether unit and its boosted activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Crystallographic and 1H&#8197;NMR studies proved that the crown ether of 1 can grab water via hydrogen bonds. By using protic acids as proton sources, the HER activity of 1 was largely boosted with added water, while the activity of crown&#8208;ether&#8208;free analogues showed very small enhancement. Inhibition studies by adding 1)&#8197;external 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether to extract water molecules and 2)&#8197;potassium ion or N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;n&#8208;butylamine to block the crown ether of 1 further confirmed its critical role in assisting proton transfer via grabbed water molecules. This work presents a synthetic example to boost HER through water&#8208;containing networks.

         <title>A Persistent Phosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Thioketyl Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable thioketyl radical anion formed by reduction of a phosphanylthioketone with alkali metals is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the products were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radicals is mainly localized at the thiocarbonyl C&#8722;S unit.







Abstract
Alkali metal salts, M+[Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(=S)&#8722;P(iPr)2S].&#8722; (M=Na, K; 2_M; Ter=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)phenyl) containing a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable thioketyl radical anion were obtained by reduction of the thioketone precursor, Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(=S)&#8722;P(iPr)2S (1), with alkali metals (Na, K). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray studies as well as EPR spectroscopy revealed the unequivocal existence of a thioketyl radical anion in the solid state and in solution, respectively. The computed Mulliken spin density within 2_M is mainly located at the sulfur (49&#8201;%) and the carbonyl carbon (33&#8201;%) atoms. Upon adding [2.2.2]&#8208;cryptand to the radical species 2_K to minimize the interionic interaction, an activation reaction was observed, yielding a potassium salt with a phosphanyl thioether based anion, [K(crypt)]+[Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(&#8722;S&#8208;iPr)&#8722;P(iPr)2S]&#8722; (3) as the product of an intermolecular shift of an iPr group from a second anion. The products were fully characterized and application of the radical anion as a reducing agent was demonstrated.

         <title>Optical Control of Mitosis with a Photoswitchable Eg5 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical control of a mitotic kinesin, Eg5, was achieved through an azobenzene analog of EMD&#8208;534085. Under UV light conditions, HeLa cells undergo mitotic arrest, as evidenced by the formation of a monopolar spindle.







Abstract
Eg5 is a kinesin motor protein that is responsible for bipolar spindle formation and plays a crucial role during mitosis. Loss of Eg5 function leads to the formation of monopolar spindles, followed by mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell death. Several cell&#8208;permeable small molecules have been reported to inhibit Eg5 and some have been evaluated as anticancer agents. We now describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of photoswitchable variants with five different pharmacophores. Our lead compound Azo&#8208;EMD is a cell permeable azobenzene that inhibits Eg5 more potently in its light&#8208;induced cis form. This activity decreased the velocity of Eg5 in single&#8208;molecule assays, promoted formation of monopolar spindles, and led to mitotic arrest in a light dependent way.

         <title>H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;Type Global Aromaticity in a 3D Fully Conjugated Molecular Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;type global aromaticity was observed in a 3D fully conjugated molecular cage at different oxidation states. The dication 12+ has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and is 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D H&#252;ckel aromatic; the tetracation 14+ has a triplet ground state and is also 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D Baird aromatic.







Abstract
Global aromaticity in 3D &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular cages remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a fully conjugated molecular cage (1) containing two bridged triphenylamine units and three quinoidal bithiophene arms. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, NMR/ESR measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: 1) its dication (12+) has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and is 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D H&#252;ckel aromatic; 2) its tetracation (14+) has a triplet ground state and is also 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D Baird aromatic; and 3) its hexacation (16+) has a closed&#8208;shell nature and shows local aromaticity. The study demonstrated a close relationship between 2D H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity and 3D global &#960;&#8208;aromaticity.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Functionalizations of Polyfluorinated Aliphatic Amides and Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic approach to selective functionalization of the strong C&#8722;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides is reported, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs through hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenylation. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of perfluoalkyl units has huge potential towards accessing functionalized organofluorinated compounds, but remains challenging due to the high C&#8722;F bond strength and inherent selectivity challenges. We report a new catalytic approach to the selective functionalization of strong C&#8722;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides. This simple reaction proceeds in mild and operational fashion with divergent conversions, including hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenylation, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.

         <dc:description>
Chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium salts were used as new phase&#8208;transfer organocatalysts for asymmetric alkylation to construct 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine motifs containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon centers in high yields with excellent cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the possible reaction mechanism and the origins of the exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Novel asymmetric mono&#8208; and dialkylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;substituted 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines catalyzed by new chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium organocatalysts have been developed, resulting in a range of enantioenriched 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine derivatives containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters. The reactions feature high yields (up to 98%), and excellent cis&#8208;diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and they provide a new asymmetric synthetic approach to important functionalized 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine skeletons. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed based on both control experiments and extensive DFT calculations.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Chirality Drives Separation by Differential Ion Mobility Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionization of N&#8208;protonated Verapamil by electrospray ionization (ESI) yields two peaks when measured by differential mobility spectrometry (DMS). This strange behaviour is caused by protonation&#8208;induced chirality, whereby protonation of Verapamil's tertiary amino moiety during ESI generates diastereomers that can be resolved in the gas phase.







Abstract
Upon development of a workflow to analyze (&#177;)&#8208;Verapamil and its metabolites using differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), we noticed that the ionogram of protonated Verapamil consisted of two peaks. This was inconsistent with its metabolites, as each exhibited only a single peak in the respective ionograms. The unique behaviour of Verapamil was attributed to protonation at its tertiary amino moiety, which generated a stereogenic quaternary amine. The introduction of additional chirality upon N&#8208;protonation of Verapamil renders four possible stereochemical configurations for the protonated ion: (R,R), (S,S), (R,S), or (S,R). The (R,R)/(S,S) and (R,S)/(S,R) enantiomeric pairs are diastereomeric and thus exhibit unique conformations that are resolvable by linear and differential ion mobility techniques. Protonation&#8208;induced chirality appears to be a general phenomenon, as N&#8208;protonation of 12 additional chiral amines generated diastereomers that were readily resolved by DMS.

The introduction of additional chirality upon N-protonation of Verapamil renders four possible stereochemical configurations for the protonated ion: (&lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;), (&lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;), (&lt;i&gt;R,S&lt;/i&gt;), or (&lt;i&gt;S,R&lt;/i&gt;). The (&lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;)/(&lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;R,S&lt;/i&gt;)/(&lt;i&gt;S,R&lt;/i&gt;) enantiomeric pairs are diastereomeric and thus exhibit unique conformations that are resolvable by linear and differential ion mobility techniques. Protonation-induced chirality appears to be a general phenomenon, as &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-protonation of 12 additional chiral amines generated diastereomers that were readily resolved by DMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Dependent Isomer Convergence of a Permanently Fluxional Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages bearing shape&#8208;shifting bullvalene ligands are prepared. The enormous potential complexity is limited by geometric constraints in solution, which converge to a single isomer in the solid state. Through detailed experimental and computational analysis, we map the fluxional nature of these systems.







Abstract
A fluxional bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, based on the archetypal shape&#8208;shifting molecule bullvalene, self&#8208;assembles with M2+ (M=Pd2+ or Pt2+) to produce a highly complex ensemble of permanently fluxional coordination cages. Metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly selects for an M2L4 architecture while maintaining shape&#8208;shifting ligand complexity. A second level of simplification is achieved with guest&#8208;exchange; the binding of halides within the M2L4 cage mixture results in a convergence to a cage species with all four ligands present as the &#8220;B isomer&#8221;. Within this confine, the reaction graph of the bullvalene is greatly restricted, but gives rise to a mixture of 38 possible diastereoisomers in rapid exchange. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a preference for an achiral form consisting of both ligand enantiomers. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we elucidate the restricted isomerisation pathway of the permanently fluxional M2L4 assembly.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Prediction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Guest Accessibility from Linker and Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a machine&#8208;learning tool that predicts the porosity of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials based solely on chemical properties of their constituents: the metal and the inorganic linker. Our method leverages data available for thousands of synthesised MOF in prediction of properties of interest in potential synthetic targets without requiring knowledge of their structure but only requiring the knowledge of their constituents.







Abstract
The choice of metal and linker together define the structure and therefore the guest accessibility of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), but the large number of possible metal&#8208;linker combinations makes the selection of components for synthesis challenging. We predict the guest accessibility of a MOF with 80.5&#8201;% certainty based solely on the identity of these two components as chosen by the experimentalist, by decomposing reported experimental three&#8208;dimensional MOF structures in the Cambridge Structural Database into metal and linker and then learning the connection between the components&#8217; chemistry and the MOF porosity. Pore dimensions of the guest&#8208;accessible space are classified into four ranges with three sequential models. Both the dataset and the predictive models are available to download and offer simple guidance in prioritization of the choice of the components for exploratory MOF synthesis for separation and catalysis based on guest accessibility considerations.

         <title>Fluorinated Sulfinates as Source of Alkyl Radicals in the Photo&#8208;Enantiocontrolled &#946;&#8208;Functionalization of Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented use of gem&#8208;difluoro sulfinates in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis for the construction of new C&#8722;C bonds in a chiral fashion is presented. This was tackled by rerouting the chemical pathway of alkyl sulfonyl radicals from traditional sulfonylation to alkylation performance. The efficacy of these sulfinates for assisting SO2 extrusion is shown by allowing the installation of CF2&#8208;bearing scaffolds, a modern task in the pharmaceutical arena.







Abstract
The generation of sulfonyl radicals has long been known as a flexible strategy in a wide range of different sulfonylative transformations. Meanwhile their use in alkylation processes has been somehow limited due to their inherent difficulty in evolving to less&#8208;stable radicals after sulfur dioxide extrusion. Herein we report a convenient strategy that involves gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfinates as an &#8220;upgrading&#8208;mask&#8221;, allowing these precursors to decompose into their corresponding alkyl radicals. The electron&#8211;donor character of sulfinates in the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex with transient iminium ions is displayed, achieving the first example of a stereocontrolled light&#8208;driven insertion of gem&#8208;difluoro derivatives into unsaturated aldehydes. This methodology is compatible with flow conditions, maintaining identical levels of enantiocontrol.

         <title>Mechanochemical Grignard Reactions with Gaseous CO2 and Sodium Methyl Carbonate**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grignard&#8208;type reactions have been performed in ball mills providing carboxylic acids from organobromides with gaseous CO2 or sodium methyl carbonate (SMC) as C1&#8208;synthon. The transformations are solvent&#8208;free and occur in the presence of LiOH under liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) conditions with 2&#8197;equivalents of 2&#8208;MeTHF as ethereal additive.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step protocol for the preparation of Grignard reagents from organobromides in a ball mill and their subsequent reactions with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) or sodium methyl carbonate providing aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids in up to 82&#8201;% yield is reported. Noteworthy are the short reaction times and the significantly reduced solvent amounts [2.0&#8197;equiv. for liquid assisted grinding (LAG) conditions]. Unexpectedly, aryl bromides with methoxy substituents lead to symmetric ketones as major products.

         <title>A Moisture&#8208;assisted Rechargeable Mg&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies are required to address the energy crisis and CO  2  emission. Among various metal&#8208;CO  2  batteries that utilize CO  2  and offer high energy density, rechargeable Mg&#8208;CO  2  batteries based on earth&#8208;abundant and safe magnesium (Mg) metal have been limited due to the lack of compatible electrolyte, operation atmosphere, and ambiguous reaction mechanism. Herein, the first rechargeable nonaqueous Mg&#8208;CO  2  battery is proposed, which can cycle for more than 250 h under the humid environment and maintain the discharge voltage over 1 V at 200 mA g  &#8208;1  . Combining with the experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the electrochemical reaction mechanism is revealed to be 2Mg + 3CO  2  + 6H  2  O &#8596; 2MgCO  3  &#183;3H  2  O + C. It is anticipated that the feasibility of rechargeable Mg&#8208;CO  2  batteries would stimulate the development of other multivalent metal&#8208;CO  2  batteries and extend CO  2  fixation and utilization for carbon neutrality.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Systematic Understanding of the Influence of Temperature on Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated probing of temperature effects on glycosyl donor activation helped to unravel the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship. Temperature adjustments halved the amount of building block required for a model glycan synthesis.







Abstract
Glycosidic bond formation is a continual challenge for practitioners. Aiming to enhance the reproducibility and efficiency of oligosaccharide synthesis, we studied the relationship between glycosyl donor activation and reaction temperature. A novel semi&#8208;automated assay revealed diverse responses of members of a panel of thioglycosides to activation at various temperatures. The patterns of protecting groups and the thiol aglycon combine to cause remarkable differences in temperature sensitivity among glycosyl donor building blocks. We introduce the concept of donor activation temperature to capture experimental insights, reasoning that glycosylations performed below this reference temperature evade deleterious side reactions. Activation temperatures enable a simplified temperature treatment and facilitate optimization of glycosyl donor usage. Isothermal glycosylation below the activation temperature halved the equivalents of building block required in comparison to the standard &#8220;ramp&#8221; regime used in solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis to&#8208;date.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Macrocycle Conformer Ensembles and 13C&#8208;NMR Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum mechanical investigation of hydrocarbon macrocycle ensembles in solution by comparison of experimental and computed 13C&#8208;NMR spectra. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory allows the deduction of contributing molecular conformations.







Abstract
NMR as a routine analytical method provides important three&#8208;dimensional structure information of compounds in solution. Here we apply the recently released CRENSO computational workflow for the automated generation of conformer ensembles to the quantum mechanical calculation of 13C&#8208;NMR spectra of a series of flexible cycloalkanes up to C20H40. We evaluate the computed chemical shifts in comparison with corresponding experimental data in chloroform. It is shown that accurate and properly averaged theoretical NMR data can be obtained in about a day of computation time on a standard workstation computer. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables one to deduce preferred conformations of large, non&#8208;rigid macrocycles under ambient conditions from our automated procedure.

         <title>The Stannum&#8208;Ene Reactions of Benzyne and Cyclohexyne with Superb Chemoselectivity for Cyclohexyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stannum&#8208;ene reactions of both benzyne and cyclohexyne were realized, which is particularly suitable for cyclohexyne with a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity. Our DFT calculations via distortion/interaction analysis revealed that both stannum and hydrogen ene reactions with cyclohexyne have later transition states due to their higher distortion energies in transition states than those in benzyne reactions, which lead to enhanced Pauli repulsion as the decisive factor in interaction energy accompanied with enlarged energy gap between two types of ene reactions. Therefore, excellent chemoselectivity was disclosed in the cyclohexyne ene rea ction.</dc:description>

         <title>DREAMTIME NMR Spectroscopy: Targeted Multi&#8208;compound Selection with Improved Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NMR/MRI are critical tools for studying molecular structure and interactions but suffer from relatively low sensitivity and spectral overlap. Here, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) approach, termed DREAMTIME, is introduced that provides &#8220;a molecular window&#8221; inside complex systems, capable of showing only what the user desires, with complete molecular specificity. The user chooses a list of molecules of interest, and the approach detects only those targets while all other molecules are invisible. The approach is demonstrated in whole human blood/urine, small living aquatic organisms in 1D/2D NMR and MRI. Finally, as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, once overlap is removed via DREAMTIME, a novel &#8220;multi&#8208;focusing&#8221; approach can be used to increase sensitivity. In human blood and urine, sensitivity increases of 7&#8208;12 fold over standard  1  H NMR are observed. Applicable even to unknowns, DREAMTIME has widespread application, from monitoring product formation in organic chemistry to monitoring/identifying suites of molecular targets in complex media or in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Short Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Actinobolin: Simple Entry to Complex Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors of Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a concise synthesis of the naturally occurring protein synthesis inhibitor (+)&#8208;actinobolin (  1  ). The densely functionalized and stereochemically complex molecular structure of  1  was assembled from (&#8208;)&#8208;quinic acid, L&#8208;threonine, and L&#8208;alanine as the principal components. Our route is based around a convergent strategy that features conjugate addition of an &#945;&#8208;amino radical in the key fragment&#8208;coupling step. The dramatically simplified synthesis of (+)&#8208;actinobolin proceeding in 9 steps with 18% overall yield has practical implications for analog preparation, as demonstrated herein.</dc:description>

The dramatically simplified synthesis of (+)-actinobolin proceeding in 9 steps with 18% overall yield has practical implications for analog preparation, as demonstrated herein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Stereochemical Confirmation, and Derivatization of a Clerodane Diterpene That Sensitizes Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to &#946;&#8208;Lactam Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades, antibiotic resistance has grown to a point where orthogonal approaches to combating infections caused by resistant bacteria are needed. One such approach is the development of non&#8208;microbicidal small molecules that potentiate the activity of conventional antibiotics, termed adjuvants. We previously established that the diterpene natural product 12(S),16&#949;&#8208;Dihydroxycleroda&#8208;3,13&#8208;dien&#8208;15,16&#8208;olide, which we refer to as (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112 for short, synergizes with oxacillin against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). To further explore this activity, (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112 was synthesized and the structure confirmed through X&#8208;ray analysis. Preliminary structure&#8208;activity relationship studies following the synthesis of several analogues identified key structural elements responsible for activity and indicate that scaffold simplification is possible. A preliminary mode of action study suggests mecA plays a role in the adjuvant activity of (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptoid&#8208;Directed Formation of Five&#8208;Fold Twinned Au Nanostars through Particle Attachment and Facet Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While bio&#8208;inspired synthesis offers great potential for controlling nucleation and growth of inorganic particles, precisely tuning biomolecule&#8208;particle interactions is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we used variations in peptoid sequence to manipulate peptoid&#8208;Au interaction, leading to synthesis of concave five&#8208;fold twinned, five&#8208;pointed Au nanostars  via  a process of repeated particle attachment and facet stabilization.  Ex situ  and liquid&#8208;phase TEM observations show that a balance between particle attachment biased to occur near the star points, preferential growth along the [100] direction, and stabilization of (111) facets is critical to forming star&#8208;shaped particles. Molecular simulations predict that interaction strengths between peptoids and distinct Au facets differ significantly and thus can alter attachment kinetics and surface energies to form the stars. This work provides new insights into how sequence&#8208;defined ligands affect particle growth to regulate crystal morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>The Protein&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Generated Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the chemical synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers, we demonstrated for the first time, the protein&#8208;target mediated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;generated aptamers (EGAs). We prepared pre&#8208;polymerisation mixtures containing different ratios of nucleotides, an initiator sequence and protein template and incubated each mixture with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Upon purification and rebinding of the EGAs against the target, we observed an enhancement in binding of templated&#8208;EGAs against the target compared to a non&#8208;templated control. These results demonstrate the presence of two primary mechanisms for the formation of EGAs, namely, the binding of random sequences to the target as observed in systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and the dynamic competition between TdT enzyme and the target protein for binding of EGAs during synthesis. The latter mechanism serves to increase the stringency of EGA&#8208;based screening and represents a new way to develop aptamers that relies on rational design.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Spectral Dependence: A General Strategy for Developing Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Ultra&#8208;Fluorogenic Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal fluorogenic dyes are indispensable tools in wash&#8208;free bioimaging of specific biological targets. However, the fluorogenicity of existing tetrazine&#8208;based bioorthogonal probes deteriorates as the emission wavelength shifts towards the NIR window, greatly limiting their applications in live cells and tissues. Herein, we reported a generalizable molecular design strategy to construct far&#8208;red and NIR fluorogenic dyes via a simple substitution at the  meso  &#8208;positions of various fluorophores. Our probes demonstrate significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios (10  2  &#8211;10  3  &#8208;fold) in the range 586&#8211;806 nm. These results will greatly expand the applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in NIR bioimaging and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Single&#8208;Atom Coating Strategy Based on Tannic Acid Chemistry for Multifunctional Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tannic acid coating method, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic single&#8208;atom coatings (SACs) (e.&#8201;g., Co, Fe, Mn, Co&#8722;Mn, Fe&#8722;Mn) can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon cloth, SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm).







Abstract
Here, we report a universal single&#8208;atom coating (SAC) strategy by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of tannic acid (TA). TA units not only self&#8208;assemble into a cross&#8208;linked porous polyphenolic framework, but also can grip on different substates via multiple binding modes. Benefiting from the diverse chelating ability of TA, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic SACs can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon, SiO2, TiO2, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm). By contrast, uniform SAC cannot be achieved using common approaches such as pyrolysis of metal&#8211;dopamine complexes or metal&#8211;organic frameworks. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, two Co SACs immobilized on graphene and TiO2 were prepared. The former one shows six&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C toward oxygen reduction. The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owing to the high activity of the single atoms and the formation of the single&#8208;atom coating&#8211;TiO2 heterojunction.

         <title>Operando Imaging of Chemical Activity on Gold Plates with Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship is of crucial importance to the evaluation and the rational design of novel catalysts. Herein, single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is employed for super&#8208;resolution mapping of the chemical activity and kinetic analysis of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;based reactions on single gold plates, which enables spatiotemporal characterizations down to the single&#8208;reaction level.







Abstract
Classical electrochemical characterization tools cannot avoid averaging between the active reaction sites and their support, thus obscuring their intrinsic roles. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemical techniques are thus in high demand. Here, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of Ru(bpy)32+ based reactions on Au plates using single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy. By converting electrochemical signals into optical signals, we manage to achieve the ultimate sensitivity of single&#8208;entity chemistry, that is directly resolving the single photons from individual electrochemical reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship is of crucial importance to the evaluation and the rational design of novel catalysts. Herein, single-molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is employed for super-resolution mapping of the chemical activity and kinetic analysis of Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based reactions on single gold plates, which enables spatiotemporal characterizations down to the single-reaction level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical electrochemical characterization tools cannot avoid averaging between the active reaction sites and their support, thus obscuring their intrinsic roles. Single-molecule electrochemical techniques are thus in high demand. Here, we demonstrate super-resolution imaging of Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; based reactions on Au plates using single-molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy. By converting electrochemical signals into optical signals, we manage to achieve the ultimate sensitivity of single-entity chemistry, that is directly resolving the single photons from individual electrochemical reactions. High spatial resolution, up to 37&#8197;nm, further enables mapping Au chemical activity and the reaction kinetics. The spatiotemporally resolved dynamic structure&#8211;activity relationship on Au plates shows that the restructuring of catalysts plays an important role in determining the reactivity. Our approach may lead to gaining new insights towards evaluating and designing electrocatalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dibenzodiazapyracylenes: Doubly N&#8208;Doped Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Molecules That Exhibit High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitrogen&#8208;doped CP&#8208;PAH, dibenzodiazapyracylene, was successfully synthesized and characterized. The aromatic and antiaromatic resonance hybrid characters have been verified by comparing their 1H&#8197;NMR spectra to those of reference molecules. Their condensed packing structures in the solid state allowed for the effective hole transporting.







Abstract
Pyracylene is a unique cyclopenta&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) that exhibits dual aromatic characteristics. Herein we report the synthesis of doubly N&#8208;doped benzannulated pyracylenes, namely dibenzodiazapyracylenes, by oxidative N&#8722;N linking reaction of [2.2](2,5)pyrrolophane&#8208;type precursors. Dibenzodiazapyracylenes displayed well&#8208;ordered &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular packing in the solid state, which were feasible for effective hole&#8208;transporting along the stacking direction. High carrier mobility was estimated by microwave conductivity measurements as compared to dibenzoullazine. The high HOMO level of dibenzodiazapyracylene was verified by electrochemistry and its persistent radical cation species has been detected.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Aldehydes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization Followed by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of dialdehydes led to structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes in good yields, with high enantioselectivity enabled by unprecedented NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes followed by kinetic resolution. This protocol, which features mild reaction conditions and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance, provides modular access to value&#8208;added axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.







Abstract
Axially chiral aldehydes have received increasing attention in enantioselective catalysis. However, only very few catalytic methods have been developed to construct structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes. We herein describe an NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of biaryl dialdehydes as a general and practical strategy for the construction of axially chiral aldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that coupling proceeds through a novel combination of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes and kinetic resolution. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization and provides a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.

         <title>A Descriptor for Accurate Predictions of Host Molecules Enabling Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Guest Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor &#916;E was developed based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism, allowing the accurate predictions of organic host&#8211;guest phosphorescent systems.







Abstract
Although doping can induce room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom free organic systems, it is often challenging to match the host and guest components to achieve efficient intersystem crossing for activating RTP. In this work, we developed a simple descriptor &#916;E to predict host molecules for matching the guest RTP emitters, based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism. This descriptor successfully predicted five commercially available host components to pair with naphthalimide (NA) and naphtho[2,3&#8208;c]furan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione (2,3&#8208;NA) emitters with a high accuracy of 83&#8201;%. The yielded pairs exhibited bright yellow and green RTP with the quantum efficiency up to 0.4 and lifetime up to 1.67&#8197;s, respectively. Using these RTP pairs, we successfully achieved multi&#8208;layer message encryption. The &#916;E descriptor could provide an efficient way for developing doping&#8208;induced RTP materials.

         <title>Reversible Three&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching of an Organic Molecule in the Solid State via &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; Optical Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and programmable triple fluorescence switching in the solid state was demonstrated through an alternative &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; optical manipulation strategy employing a spiropyran&#8208;functionalized distyrylanthracene derivative. The unique switching ability enabled innovative multicolor, tunable, switching cell imaging and two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging in a single&#8208;molecule system.







Abstract
In photoswitches that undergo fluorescence switching upon ultraviolet irradiation, photoluminescence and photoisomerization often occur simultaneously, leading to unstable fluorescence properties. Here, we successfully demonstrated reversible solid&#8208;state triple fluorescence switching through &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; multiphoton manipulation. A novel fluorescence photoswitch, BOSA&#8208;SP, achieved green, yellow, and red fluorescence under excitation by pump light and isomerization induced by trigger light. The energy ranges of photoexcitation and photoisomerization did not overlap, enabling appropriate selection of the multiphoton light for &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; photoswitching, respectively. Additionally, the large free volume of the spiropyran (SP) moiety in the solid state promoted reversible photoisomerization. Switching between &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; light is useful for three&#8208;color tunable switching cell imaging, which can be exploited in programmable fluorescence switching. Furthermore, we exploited reversible dual&#8208;fluorescence switching in a single molecular system to successfully achieve two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Acylation of Amides and Cascade Cyclization via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides was developed, and also combined with a cascade cyclization. Over 120 functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic investigations shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under environmentally benign catalytic conditions remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an organocatalytic remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides and cascade cyclization through a radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene as the catalyst. Notably, a diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates, including simple linear aliphatic carbamates and ortho&#8208;alkyl benzamides, can be successfully applied to this organocatalytic system. With the established protocol, over 120 examples of functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were easily synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. The robustness and generality of the organocatalytic strategy were further highlighted by the successful acylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules. Then, the asymmetric control of the radical reaction was attempted and proven feasible by using a newly designed chiral thiazolium catalyst, and moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at the current stage. Preliminary mechanistic investigations including several control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;An N-heterocyclic carbene catalyzed remote C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H acylation of amides was developed, and also combined with a cascade cyclization. Over 120 functionalized &#948;-amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic investigations shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct functionalization of inert C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds under environmentally benign catalytic conditions remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an organocatalytic remote C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H acylation of amides and cascade cyclization through a radical-mediated 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer mechanism using N-heterocyclic carbene as the catalyst. Notably, a diversity of nitrogen-containing substrates, including simple linear aliphatic carbamates and &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl benzamides, can be successfully applied to this organocatalytic system. With the established protocol, over 120 examples of functionalized &#948;-amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were easily synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. The robustness and generality of the organocatalytic strategy were further highlighted by the successful acylation of unactivated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds and late-stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules. Then, the asymmetric control of the radical reaction was attempted and proven feasible by using a newly designed chiral thiazolium catalyst, and moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at the current stage. Preliminary mechanistic investigations including several control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Exposure of the Intrinsic Magnetic Surface of BaTiO3 to Give Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;dimensional defect structure of BaTiO3 with exposed intrinsic face of (1
0) has been prepared using supercritical CO2. It displays room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism as demonstrated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Preparation of low&#8208;dimensional ferromagnetic nanomaterials and investigation of their magnetic origin is critical to the exploration of novel materials with various applications such as data storage. Herein, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) BaTiO3 was successfully stripped to a low&#8208;dimensional structure by treating the materials with supercritical CO2 (SC CO2). Under different CO2 pressures, SC CO2 selectively cleaves the covalent bonds of the bulk BaTiO3, leading to the exposure of various surfaces. After SC CO2 treatments, the BaTiO3 exhibits room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism, which is significantly stronger than conventional treatments. According to the experimental and theoretical investigations, the enhanced ferromagnetic property is attributed to the exposure of the intrinsic surfaces of BaTiO3.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold can be dissolved in a sustainable manner with common household chemicals: iodine solution in ethanol, resembling diluted iodine tincture, green oxidant hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, a compound used in medicinal applications. Catalytic reactions and green solvents are the basis for sustainable development and recycling of precious metals like gold.







Abstract
Gold is a scarce element in the Earth's crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco&#8208;social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I2 oxidizes Au0 and forms a [AuII2]&#8722; species, which undergoes subsequent ligand&#8208;exchange reactions and forms a stable bis&#8208;ligand AuI complex. H2O2 oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I2 returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open a new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with the utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Tuned Molecular Packing Allows Concurrently Boosted Photoacoustic Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process to enhance the NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of an organic semiconducting nanoparticle concurrently by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times, respectively, is described by tuning the molecular packing in the aggregated state of NPs, which provides a new strategy to develop multi&#8208;modal phototheranostic materials for more capable clinical applications.







Abstract
It is generally considered that photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) cannot be enhanced concurrently, as they are dependent on competitive photophysical processes at the single&#8208;molecule level. Herein, we reveal that BDTR9&#8208;OC8 and BDTR9&#8208;C8, which have identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones but are substituted by side chains of different rigidity, show distinct phototheranostic properties in the aggregated state. The NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of BDTR9&#8208;C8 nanoparticles are enhanced by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times compared with BDTR9&#8208;OC8 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations and GIWAXS analysis revealed that BDTR9&#8208;C8 with rigid side chains shows a relative amorphous condensed state, which will benefit the efficient transportation of photo&#8208;generated excitons and phonons, subsequently enhancing the FLI and PAI signals. Besides, both nanoparticles exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency due to their strong light&#8208;harvesting capability and are considered effective photothermal therapy materials. This work provides an illuminating strategy for material design in the future.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Recording of Fermentation and Lipid Metabolism Processes in Live Microalgae Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of solid&#8208;state MAS NMR on live microalgae for monitoring of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamics changes is demonstrated. Conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids is observed, accompanied with rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. It is concluded that high cell densities, creating dark, anoxia conditions, induce lipid catabolism and cell death resulting in breakdown of cell and organelle membranes.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time recording of processes in living cells has been limited to detection of small cellular components such as soluble proteins and metabolites. Here we report a multiphase NMR approach using magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR to synchronously follow microbial processes of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamic changes in live microalgae cells. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii green algae were highly concentrated, introducing dark fermentation and anoxia conditions. Single&#8208;pulse NMR experiments were applied to obtain temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic profiles of the formed fermentation products. Through dynamics&#8208;based spectral editing NMR, simultaneous conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids was observed and rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. This suggests that lipolysis under dark and anoxia conditions finally results in the breakdown of cell and organelle membranes, which could be beneficial for recovery of intracellular microbial useful products.

         <title>Highly Efficient Asymmetric Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with EQE of 32.8&#8201;% and Extremely Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using asymmetrically peripheral protection as a design motif, two high efficiency and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials were designed and synthesized. The corresponding device exhibits pure green emission with a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 32.8&#8201;% and relatively low efficiency roll&#8208;off without utilizing any sensitizer.







Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters show great potentials for high color purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the simultaneous realization of high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel asymmetric MR&#8208;TADF emitter (2Cz&#8208;PTZ&#8208;BN) is designed that fully inherits the high PLQY and large kRISC values of the properly selected parent molecules. The resonating extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton with peripheral protection can achieve a high PLQY of 96&#8201;% and a fast kRISC of above 1.0&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and boost the performance of corresponding pure green devices with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.8&#8201;% without utilizing any sensitizing hosts. Remarkably, the device sufficiently maintains a high EQE exceeding 23&#8201;% at a high luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the highest value for reported green MR&#8208;TADF materials at the same luminescence.

&lt;p&gt;Using asymmetrically peripheral protection as a design motif, two high efficiency and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials were designed and synthesized. The corresponding device exhibits pure green emission with a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 32.8&#8201;% and relatively low efficiency roll-off without utilizing any sensitizer.

         <title>Photoswitchable Molecular Communication between Programmable DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Membraneless Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable bi&#8208;directional trafficking of biomolecules between programmable DNA&#8208;based artificial membraneless organelles in a cell&#8208;like microcompartment has been achieved to imitate intracellular communication towards construction of advanced functional artificial cells.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal organization of distinct biological processes in cytomimetic compartments is a crucial step towards engineering functional artificial cells. Mimicking controlled bi&#8208;directional molecular communication inside artificial cells remains a considerable challenge. Here we present photoswitchable molecular transport between programmable membraneless organelle&#8208;like DNA coacervates in a synthetic microcompartment. We use droplet microfluidics to fabricate membraneless non&#8208;fusing DNA coacervates by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet, and employ the interior DNA coacervates as artificial organelles to imitate intracellular communication via photo&#8208;regulated uni&#8208; and bi&#8208;directional transfer of biomolecules. Our results highlight a promising new route to assembly of multicompartment artificial cells with functional networks.

         <title>Millisecond&#8208;Range Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging Enabled through Ultralong Aqueous Phosphorescence Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes.







Abstract
Probes featuring room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising tools for time&#8208;resolved imaging. It is worth noting that the time scale of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging generally ranges around the microsecond level, because of the short&#8208;lived emission. Herein, the first example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through a kind of ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes (i.e., cyclo&#8208;(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;AspD&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Cys)&#8208;conjugated zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres), with a RTP emission lasting for &#8776;5&#8197;s and a lifetime as long as 743.7&#8197;ms. We demonstrate that live cells and deep tumor tissue in mice can be specifically targeted through immune&#8208;phosphorescence imaging, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) value of &#8776;69 for in vitro imaging, and &#8776;627 for in vivo imaging, respectively. We further show that, compared to that of fluorescence imaging, the SBR enhancement of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved in vivo bioimaging is up to 105&#8197;times.

         <title>An Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System with Controllable Efficiency Enabled by an Annulene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Fluid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An annulene&#8208;based discotic liquid crystal (LC) material to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform is developed. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of the LC molecule with variable molecular order, the efficiency of the light&#8208;harvesting system can be controlled at different temperatures when Nile red is introduced as an acceptor. This system exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio.







Abstract
The development of controllable artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems based on liquid crystal (LC) materials, i.e., anisotropic fluids, remains a challenge. Herein, an annulene&#8208;based discotic LC compound 6 with a saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene core has been synthesized to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform. The LC material shows a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which can act as a suitable light&#8208;harvesting donor. By loading Nile red (NiR) as an acceptor, an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system is achieved. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of 6 with variable molecular order, the efficiency of such 6&#8208;NiR system can be controlled by temperature. This light&#8208;harvesting system works sensitively at a high donor/acceptor ratio as 1000&#8201;:&#8201;1, and exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio. This thermochromic artificial light&#8208;harvesting LC system could find potential applications in smart devices employing soft materials.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecule Based High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Organic Material for Efficient Water Purification and Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An umbrella&#8208;like donor&#8208;acceptor system (GDPA&#8208;QCN) based on a bulky dendritic donor (umbrella head) and a liner heterocyclic acceptor (umbrella handle) has been developed. GDPA&#8208;QCN shows strong sunlight absorption and efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion properties in the solid state and was employed to fabricate a high&#8208;performance water purification and electricity generation system.







Abstract
In this contribution, a unique donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal material, namely GDPA&#8208;QCN, is presented. Bulky dendritic triphenylamine (GDPA) was grafted onto quinoxaline&#8208;6,7&#8208;dicarbonitrile (QCN) with a phenyl ring as a bridge to form an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; architecture. Benefited from the particular molecular structure, in solid state, GDPA&#8208;QCN molecules adopted a loose packing mode due to the steric effect of &#8220;umbrella head&#8221; dendritic triphenylamine and flexible molecular structure feature, which allows efficient intramolecular motions and consequently elevates energy dissipation by taking the pathway of thermal deactivation within broad absorption range. The GDPA&#8208;QCN solid has high solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with an absorption range from 300 to 1100&#8197;nm, which can promote superior water purification and electricity generation performance.

         <title>Homogeneously Large Polarons in Aromatic Passivators Improves Charge Transport between Perovskite Grains for &gt;24&#8201;% Efficiency in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport behavior of two amine Cu porphyrin supramolecules with different stacking interactions in perovskite grain boundaries was investigated in detail. Results prove that the construction of homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in aromatic passivators is a key factor for the charge transport between perovskite grains. This work also affords a new strategy to design new optoelectronic materials with improved charge mobilities.







Abstract
Aromatic passivators, such as porphyrin, with large &#960;&#8208;backbones have attracted considerable attention to boost the charge carrier in polycrystalline perovskite films, thus enabling the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often self&#8208;assemble into supramolecules that probably influence the charge&#8208;transfer process in the perovskite grain boundary. Here, by doping a monoamine Cu porphyrin into perovskite films, two porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled supramolecules were successfully prepared between perovskite grains. Crystal structures and theoretical analyses reveal the presence of a stronger interaction between the amine units and the central Cu ions of neighbouring porphyrins in one of the supramolecules. This has a modified effect on the dipole direction of the porphyrins to be quantized as homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in a periodic lattice. The porphyrin supramolecules can stabilize perovskite grain boundaries to greatly improve the stability of PSCs, while the HLPs&#8208;featured supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grains to remarkably increase the cell performance to as high as 24.2&#8201;%. This work proves that the modulation of the intermolecular interaction of aromatic passivators to yield HLPs is crucial for the cascaded acceleration of charge transport between perovskite grains.

&lt;p&gt;Aromatic passivators, such as porphyrin, with large &#960;-backbones have attracted considerable attention to boost the charge carrier in polycrystalline perovskite films, thus enabling the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often self-assemble into supramolecules that probably influence the charge-transfer process in the perovskite grain boundary. Here, by doping a monoamine Cu porphyrin into perovskite films, two porphyrin-based self-assembled supramolecules were successfully prepared between perovskite grains. Crystal structures and theoretical analyses reveal the presence of a stronger interaction between the amine units and the central Cu ions of neighbouring porphyrins in one of the supramolecules.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Heteroaromatics with Prolonged Homogeneous Hexatomic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red multi&#8208;resonance emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yields and narrowband emission were demonstrated by introducing homogeneous hexatomic rings into nitrogen&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting devices afforded state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with external quantum efficiency up to 18.2&#8201;% and superior operation stability.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic heteroaromatics have exhibited fascinating multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics for efficient narrowband emission, but strategies to bathochromic shift their emissions while maintaining the narrow bandwidths remain exclusive. Here, homogeneous hexatomic rings are introduced into nitrogen&#8208;embedded MR skeletons to prolong the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length for low&#8208;energy electronic transitions while retaining the non&#8208;bonding character of the remaining parts. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitters exhibit near unity photoluminescence quantum yields with peaks at 598&#8197;nm and 620&#8197;nm and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximums of 28&#8197;nm and 31&#8197;nm, respectively. Optimal organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit a high external quantum efficiency of 18.2&#8201;%, negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, and ultra&#8208;long lifetime with negligible degradation at an initial luminance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 after 94&#8197;hours.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field via Variable Oxygen Affinity for Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;support interaction between Pt and CoOx creates a strong built&#8208;in electric field across the interface and modulates the charge distribution. This electric field subtly optimizes both the hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy, boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral media.







Abstract
Work function strongly impacts the surficial charge distribution, especially for metal&#8208;support electrocatalysts when a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is constructed. Therefore, studying the correlation between work function and BEF is crucial for understanding the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Herein, we present a Pt@CoOx electrocatalyst with a large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) and strong BEF, which shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in a neutral medium with a 4.5&#8208;fold mass activity higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the interfacial charge redistribution induced by the strong BEF, thus subtly optimizing hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy. This work not only provides fresh insights into the neutral hydrogen evolution mechanism but also proposes new design principles toward efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in a neutral medium.

         <title>Control of Hot Carrier Relaxation in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Using Damping Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model for the damping of the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling in all&#8208;inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) was proposed by considering the mechanical resistance of the ligands. Correspondingly the hot carrier cooling process was slowed down by 3&#8208;fold in CsPbBr3 PeNCs by tuning the rigidity of the layer of organic capping ligands.







Abstract
In photon&#8208;conversion processes, rapid cooling of photo&#8208;induced hot carriers is a dominant energy loss channel. We herein report a 3&#8208;fold reduced hot carrier cooling rate in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals capped with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane shell in comparison to single alkyl&#8208;chain oleylamine ligands. Relaxation of hot charge carriers depends on the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling (CPC) process as an important channel to dissipate energies in nanostructured perovskite materials. The CPC strengths in the two samples were measured through cryogenic photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements. The effect of organic ligands on the CPC in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is elucidated based on a damped oscillation model. This supplements the conventional polaron&#8208;based CPC model, by involving a damping effect on the CPC from the resistance of the ligands against nanocrystal lattice vibrations. The model also accounts for the observed linear temperature&#8208;dependence of the CPC strength. Our work enables predictions about the effect of the ligands on the performance of perovskite nanocrystals in future applications.

         <title>Synergistic Hydrocobaltation and Borylcobaltation Enable Regioselective Migratory Triborylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed triborylation of unactivated alkenes is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from Co(acac)2 and xantphos. Mechanistic studies reveal that this triborylation reaction proceeds through three interdependent catalytic cycles.







Abstract
The structural diversity of sp3&#8208;triorganometallic reagents enhances their potentiality in the modular construction of molecular complexity in chemical synthesis. Despite significant achievements on the preparation of sp3 1,1,1&#8208; and 1,1,2&#8208;triorganometallic B,B,B&#8208;reagents, catalytic approaches that enable the installation of multiple boryl groups at skipped carbons of unactivated alkenes still remain elusive. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective triborylation reaction of unactivated alkenes to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes. This triborylation protocol provides a general platform for regioselective trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes, and its utility is highlighted by the synthesis of various value&#8208;added chemicals from readily accessible unactivated alkenes. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and evaluation of potential reactive intermediates, provide insight into the experimentally observed chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

         <title>Origin of High Diastereoselectivity in Reactions of Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereoselective reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates have been systematically investigated. Diastereoselectivity was found to be general for &#1013;&#8208;lactams, &#1013;&#8208;lactones, and cycloheptanones with various substituent patterns. Computational investigations provided insight into the origin of the diastereoselectivity. A model for predicting the stereochemistry of seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolate alkylations is proposed.







Abstract
Unlike many reactions of their six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring counterparts, the reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates are highly diastereoselective. Diastereoselectivity was observed for a range of substrates, including lactam, lactone, and cyclic ketone derivatives. The stereoselectivity arises from torsional and steric interactions that develop when electrophiles approach the diastereotopic &#960;&#8208;faces of the enolates, which are distinguished by subtle differences in the orientation of nearby atoms of the ring.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Stiffening of Hydrogel Networks with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's So Clearly Visible: Hydrogels can be formed by exclusively visible&#8208;light irradiation with two colours of light, with each colour allowing mechanical stiffening of the gel independent of the order in which each colour is applied. Driven by mild [2+2] cycloadditions with halochromic properties, the photoreactivity of the reactions in water can be controlled by a photoacid generator.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce the wavelength&#8208;orthogonal crosslinking of hydrogel networks using two red&#8208;shifted chromophores, i.e. acrylpyerene (AP, &#955;activation=410&#8211;490&#8197;nm) and styrylpyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazine (SPP, &#955;activation=400&#8211;550&#8197;nm), able to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition in the visible&#8208;light regime. The photoreactivity of the SPP moiety is pH&#8208;dependent, whereby an acidic environment inhibits the cycloaddition. By employing a spiropyran&#8208;based photoacid generator with suitable absorption wavelength, we are able to restrict the activation wavelength of the SPP moiety to the green light region (&#955;activation=520&#8211;550&#8197;nm), enabling wavelength&#8208;orthogonal activation of the AP group. Our wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photochemical system was successfully applied in the design of hydrogels whose stiffness can be tuned independently by either green or blue light.

         <title>Triphase Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Silver&#8208;Decorated Titanium Oxide at a Gas&#8208;Water Boundary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive process to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals. But this reaction is often restricted by the poor mass transfer of CO2 in the liquid phase. Here, we developed a triphase photocatalytic CO2RR system by supporting Ag&#8208;decorated TiO2 nanoparticles at a gas&#8208;water boundary with hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic abrupt interfacial wettability. Such a triphase system allows the rapid delivery of gas&#8208;phase CO2 to the surface of photocatalysts while maintaining an efficient water supply and uncovered active sites. Ag&#8208;TiO2 supported at the gas&#8208;water boundary showed a CO2 reduction rate of 305.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, without hole scavengers, approximately 8 times higher than the nanoparticles dispersed in the liquid phase. Even using diluted CO2 (10%) as the reactant, the CO2RR activity was superior to most reported Ag&#8208;TiO2 based photocatalysts using pure CO2. The findings provide a general strategy to promote the interfacial CO2 mass transfer to improve photoactivity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Acridinium Salts by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Cyclization of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Iminiums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinone methides are fundamental intermediates for a wide range of reactions in which catalyst stereocontrol is often achieved by hydrogen bonding. Herein, we describe the feasibility of an intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts 6&#960; electrocyclization through  ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums stereocontrolled by a contact ion pair. A disulfonimide catalyst activates racemic trichloroacetimidate substrates and imparts stereocontrol in the cyclization step, providing a new avenue for selective  ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminium functionalization. A highly stereospecific oxidation readily transforms the enantioenriched acridanes into rotationally restricted acridiniums. Upon ion exchange, the method selectively affords atropisomeric acridinium tetrafluoroborate salts in high yields and an enantioenrichment of up to 93:7 e.r. We envision that ion&#8208;pairing catalysis over  ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums enables the selective synthesis of a diversity of heterocycles and aniline derivatives with distinct stereogenic units.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Alterbrassicicene D (  1  ) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (  2  ) were synthesised  via  a two&#8208;phase approach featuring concise construction of the 5&#8208;8&#8208;5 tricyclic intermediate and a tandem base&#8208;mediated epoxide opening&#8211;transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade to forge the complex skeleton of  2  . The route is scalable and we generated 15 g of the tricyclic intermediate in 8 steps from (  R  )&#8208;limonene and 720 mg of the penultimate bioactive intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of  2  and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC&#8208;1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour&#8208;initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic study of an archetypical barbaralone, conclusively revealing the valence tautomerism phenomena for this bistable molecular system. The two distinct 1&#8208; and 5&#8208;substituted valence tautomers have been isolated in a supersonic expansion for the first time and successfully characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy. This work provides irrefutable experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement in barbaralones and highlights the use of rotational spectroscopy to analyze shape&#8208;shifting mixtures. Moreover, this observation opens the window toward the characterization of new fluxional systems in the isolation conditions of the gas phase and should serve as a reference point in the general understanding of valence tautomerism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The chiral  N&#8208;  substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol motif is found in many natural and synthetic bioactive compounds. In this study, enzymatic asymmetric reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;hydroxymethyl ketones with enantiocomplementary IREDs enabled the synthesis of chiral  N  &#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent  ee  values (91&#8211;99%) in moderate to high yields (41&#8211;84%). Furthermore, a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step enzymatic process involving benzaldehyde lyase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxymethylation of aldehydes and subsequent asymmetric reductive amination was developed, offering an environmentally friendly and economical way to produce of  N&#8208;  substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from readily available simple aldehydes and amines. This methodology was then applied to rapidly access a key synthetic intermediate of anti&#8208;malaria and cytotoxic tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Lithography in Single&#8208;Component Organic Enantiomorphic Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ferroelectrics are flexible, lightweight, and bio&#8208;friendly, promising for bio&#8208;harmonized electronic devices, while their ferroelectric lithography remains relatively unexplored. Here, by introducing the homochirality and ZE photoisomerization, we obtained a pair of organic enantiomorphic ferroelectrics, di(benzylamino)&#8208;substituted derivative of muconic acids, the first ferroelectrics in muconic family. Their ferroelectric and chiral features were confirmed by the polarization&#8722;electric field hysteresis loops and circular dichroism spectra, respectively. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements demonstrate that desired domain structure can be precisely achieved by applying a local electric field on a predefined pattern in their thin films. Moreover, thermogravimetric analyses reveal that their ferroelectricity can persist up to above 550 K. The precise pattern lithography and excellent thermal stability make them competitive candidates for ferroelectric lithography.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Elastomers from Stereochemistry&#8208;Directed Hydrogen Bonding in Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The remarkable elasticity and tensile strength found in natural elastomers are challenging to mimic. Synthetic elastomers typically feature covalently crosslinked networks (rubbers), but this hinders their reprocessability. Physical crosslinking via hydrogen bonding or ordered crystallite domains can afford reprocessable elastomers, but often at the cost of performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of ultra&#8208;tough, reprocessable elastomers based on linear alternating polymers. The incorporation of a rigid isohexide adjacent to urethane moieties affords elastomers with exceptional strain hardening, strain rate dependent behavior, and high optical clarity. Distinct differences were observed between isomannide and isosorbide&#8208;based elastomers where the latter displays superior tensile strength and strain recovery. These phenomena are attributed to the regiochemical irregularities in the polymers arising from their distinct stereochemistry and respective inter&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Covalent Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation of H  2  O  2  from water and air via a photosynthetic approach is ideal for efficient small&#8208;scale production. However, the poor activity and selectivity of the 2e  &#8208;  water oxidation reaction (WOR) greatly restricts the efficiency of photocatalytic H  2  O  2  production. Herein we have prepared a bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (denoted as COF&#8208;TfpBpy) for H  2  O  2  production in simple water and air mixture. The solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency at 298K and 333K is 0.57% and 1.08% respectively, which is higher than the current reported highest value. The photocatalytic H  2  O  2  solution is sufficient to degrade pollutants. Mechanism study revealed that the excellent photocatalytic activity is due to the protonation of bipyridine monomer which is promoted the rate&#8208;determining step (2e  &#8208;  WOR), and then enhances the yeager&#8208;type oxygen adsorption to accelerate 2e  &#8208;  one&#8208;step oxygen reduction. This work represents the very first COF for hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis from water and air. It paves the way for wastewater treatment using photocatalytic H  2  O  2  solution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The physical characteristics of supramolecular assemblies&#160;composed of small building blocks are dictated by molecular packing patterns in the solid&#8208;state. Yet, the structure&#8208;property correlation is still not fully understood. Herein, we report the unexpected cofacial to herringbone stacking transformation of a small aromatic bipyridine through co&#8208;assembly with acetylated glutamic acid. The unique solid&#8208;state structural transformation results in enhanced physical properties of the supramolecular organizations. The co&#8208;assembly methodology was further expanded to obtain diverse molecular packings by different bipyridine and acetylated amino acid derivatives. This study presents a feasible co&#8208;assembly approach to achieve the solid&#8208;state stacking transformation of supramolecular organization and opens up new opportunities to further explore the relationship between molecular arrangement and properties of supramolecular assemblies by crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Elastic Organic Crystals that Respond to Aerial Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lightweight, mechanically reinforced, hygroresponsive organic crystalline hybrid materials has been synthesized by a universally applicable approach. The crystals are robust, durable, and moisture&#8208;absorbing, and show a highly linear deformation over a wide range of relative humidity. Such precise spatiotemporal control over the light output in response to air humidity allows the materials to be used as optical waveguides.







Abstract
Reshaping of elongated organic crystals that can be used as semiconductors, waveguides or soft robotic grippers by application of force or light is now a commonplace, however mechanical response of organic crystals to changes in humidity has not been accomplished yet. Here, we report a universal approach to instigating a humidity response into elastically bendable organic crystals that elicits controllable deformation with linear response to aerial humidity while retaining their physical integrity entirely intact. Hygroresponsive bilayer elements are designed by mechanically coupling a humidity&#8208;responsive polymer with elastic molecular crystals that have been mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating. As an illustration of the application of these cladded crystalline actuators, they are tested as active optical transducers of visible light where the position of light output can be precisely controlled by variations in aerial humidity. Within a broader context, the approach described here provides access to a vast range of mechanically robust, lightweight hybrid hygroresponsive crystalline materials.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of lightweight, mechanically reinforced, hygroresponsive organic crystalline hybrid materials has been synthesized by a universally applicable approach. The crystals are robust, durable, and moisture-absorbing, and show a highly linear deformation over a wide range of relative humidity. Such precise spatiotemporal control over the light output in response to air humidity allows the materials to be used as optical waveguides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reshaping of elongated organic crystals that can be used as semiconductors, waveguides or soft robotic grippers by application of force or light is now a commonplace, however mechanical response of organic crystals to changes in humidity has not been accomplished yet. Here, we report a universal approach to instigating a humidity response into elastically bendable organic crystals that elicits controllable deformation with linear response to aerial humidity while retaining their physical integrity entirely intact. Hygroresponsive bilayer elements are designed by mechanically coupling a humidity-responsive polymer with elastic molecular crystals that have been mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating. As an illustration of the application of these cladded crystalline actuators, they are tested as active optical transducers of visible light where the position of light output can be precisely controlled by variations in aerial humidity. Within a broader context, the approach described here provides access to a vast range of mechanically robust, lightweight hybrid hygroresponsive crystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks self&#8208;assembled from metal&#8211;nucleobase complexes and hexafluoro anions are reported by Wei Zhou, Zongbi&#8197;B. Bao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117609). Amino&#8208;rich ligands provided multiple H&#8208;bonding sites to stabilize the frameworks. In the confined channels, the electron&#8208;rich anions combined with the electron&#8208;deficient purine rings generate a micro&#8208;electric field to polarize and lock Xe atoms, thus achieving highly efficient Xe/Kr separation under ambient conditions.

         <title>Alkylgold(III) Complexes Undergo Unprecedented Photo&#8208;Induced &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination and Reduction for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporally controllable activation of prodrugs within tumors is highly desirable for cancer therapy to minimize toxic side effects. Herein we report that stable alkylgold(III) complexes can undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, releasing alkyl ligands and forming gold(III)&#8208;hydride intermediates that could be quickly converted into bioactive [Au(III)&#8208;S] adducts; meanwhile, the remaining alkylgold(III) complexes can photo&#8208;catalytically reduce [Au(III)&#8208;S] into more bioactive Au(I) species. Such photo&#8208;reactivities make it possible to functionalize gold complexes on the auxiliary alkyl ligands without attenuating the metal&#8208;biomacromolecule interactions. As a result, the gold(III) complexes containing glucose&#8208;functionalized alkyl ligands displayed efficient and tumor&#8208;selective uptake; notably, after one&#8208; or two&#8208;photon activation, the complexes displayed high TrxR inhibition, potent cytotoxicity, and strong antiangiogenesis and antitumor activities in vivo.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a [20]cyclophenacene&#8208;type&#160;cyclophenylene&#8211;naphthylene&#160;(CPN) belt&#160;and the enantioselective synthesis of chiral&#8208;type CPN belts (up to &gt;99%&#160;ee) by the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of naphthalene&#8208;embedded cyclic polyynes. The synthesis of a depth expanded CPN belt was also attempted, while the final intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition did not proceed. Theoretical calculations clarified that the reactivity depends on the stability of the transition state in the initial oxidative cycloaddition step arising from the molecular strain. The cylindrical structures of these CPN belts were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. The &#960;&#8208;extension by the introduction of naphthalenes in the chiral&#8208;type CPN belts amplified their anisotropy dissymmetry factors of&#160;electronic circular dichroism&#160;and circularly polarized luminescence, compared with the corresponding zigzag&#8208;type chiral cyclophenylene belts.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of Secondary and Tertiary Fluorides from &#946;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine is a critical element for the design of bioactive compounds, driving advances in selective and sustainable fluorination. However, stereogenic tertiary fluorides pose a synthetic challenge and are thus present in only a few approved drugs (fluticasone, solithromycin, and sofosbuvir). The aldol reaction of fluorinated donors provides an atom&#8208;economical approach to asymmetric C&#8208;F motifs via C&#8208;C bond formation. We report that the type II pyruvate aldolase HpcH and engineered variants perform addition of &#223;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids (including fluoropyruvate, &#223;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketobutyrate, and &#223;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketovalerate) to diverse aldehydes. The reactivity of HpcH towards these fluoro&#8208;donors grants access to enantiopure secondary or tertiary fluorides. In addition to representing the first synthesis of tertiary fluorides via biocatalytic carboligation, the afforded products could improve the diversity of fluorinated building blocks and enable the synthesis of fluorinated drug analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Cell Imaging of Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;driven Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a photodynamic therapy driven by electrochemiluminescence (ECL). The luminescence generated by Ru(bpy)32+ and co&#8208;reactant tripropylamine (TPA) pair acts as both optical readout for ECL imaging, and light source for the excitation of photosensitizer to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) system. The ECL&#8208;driven PDT (ECL&#8208;PDT) relies on the effective energy transfer from ECL emission to photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), which sensitizes the surrounding O2 into ROS. The dynamic process of gradual morphological changes, the variation of cell&#8208;matrix adhesions, as well as the increase of cell membrane permeability in the process of ECL&#8208;PDT were monitored under ECL microscopy (ECLM) with good spatiotemporal resolution. Combining real&#8208;time imaging with ECL&#8208;PDT, this new strategy provides not only new insights into dynamic cellular processes, but also promising potential of ECL in clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes via Catalytic Rhodium to Gold(III) Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic method to synthesize a broad array of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported here. An unprecedented Rh&#8208;to&#8208;Au(III) transmetalation allows the facile transfer of (C^N) ligands between these two metals in a redox&#8208;neutral process. The reaction employs commercially available precursors and proceeds under mild and environmentally benign conditions. Both experimental and computational studies support a multistep transmetalation from rhodium to gold as underlying mechanism for these transformations. This process involves first, a rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor to form the monocyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) species.</dc:description>

The iron guanidine catalyst shows extraordinary copolymerization activities towards lactide, glycolide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone, as reported by Sonja Herres&#8208;Pawlis, Moshe Kol et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112853). Depending on the reaction temperature and the mode of monomer addition, it either forms up to pentablock copolymers in a highly defined way or promotes transesterifications to such a high degree that random copolymers are produced. Therefore it is a rare example of a catalyst mastering both microstructures: ordered and chaotic.

         <dc:description>The potassium aluminyl [K{Al(NONDipp)}]2  ([NONDipp]2&#8211; = [O{SiMe2NDipp}2]2&#8211;, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) activates ethene towards carbonylation with CO under mild conditions. An isolated bis&#8208;aluminacyclopropane compound reacted with CO via carbonylation of an Al&#8211;C bond, followed by an intramolecular hydrogen shift to form K2[Al(NONDipp)(&#956;&#8208;CH2CH=CO&#8208;1&#954;2C1,3&#8208;2&#954;O)Al(NONDipp)Et]. Restricting the chemistry to a mono&#8208;aluminium system allowed isolation of [Al(NONDipp)(CH2CH2CO&#8208;&#954;2C1,3)]&#8211;, which undergoes thermal isomerisation to form the [Al(NONDipp)(CH2CH=CHO&#8208;&#954;2C,O)]&#8211; anion.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Reveals Molecular Species in Carbon Nanodot Samples Disclosing Flaws</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanodots are currently one of the hot topics in the nanomaterials world, due to their accessible synthesis and promising features. However, the purification of these materials is still a critical aspect, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of unreacted species or small organic molecules formed during solvothermal treatments can affect the properties of the synthesized nanomaterials. To illustrate the extreme importance of this issue, we present two case studies in which insufficient purification results in misleading conclusions regarding the chiral and fluorescent properties of the investigated materials. Key to identify molecular species is the use of nuclear magnetic resonance, which proves to be an effective tool. Our work highlights the need to include nuclear magnetic resonance as a standard characterization technique for carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, to minimize the risk of observing properties that arise from molecular species, rather than the target carbon nanodots.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugate&#8208;Driven Electron Density Delocalization of Piperidine Nitroxyl Radical for Stable Aqueous Zinc Hybrid Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable and soluble redox&#8208;active nitroxyl radicals are highly desired for high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life aqueous zinc hybrid flow batteries (AZHFBs). Here we report a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8221; conjugated imidazolium and &#8220;p&#8208;&#960;&#8221; conjugated acetylamino co&#8208;functionalized 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (MIAcNH&#8208;TEMPO) as stable catholyte for AZHFBs. The incorporation of double&#8208;conjugate substituents could delocalize electron density of N&#8208;O head and thus remarkably stabilize the radical and oxoammonium forms of TEMPO, avoiding the side reaction of ring&#8208;opening. Consequently, the applied MIAcNH&#8208;TEMPO/Zn AZHFB demonstrates the hardly time&#8208;dependent stability with a constant capacity retention of 99.95%/day over 16.7 days at high concentration catholyte of 1.5 M and high current density of 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  . This proposed molecular engineering strategy on electron density regulation of redox&#8208;active structures displays an attractive efficacy and thus represents a remarkable advance in high&#8208;performance AZHFBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Chemically Responsive Switchable Gas Valves with Protonation&#8208;Induced Liquid Gating Self&#8208;Adaptive Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide (CO2  ) capture and storage technologies are promising to limit  CO2  emission  from anthropogenic activities, to achieve carbon neutrality goals. CO2  capture requires to separate CO2  from other gases, and therefore a gas flow system that exhibits discernible gating behaviors for CO2  would provide the usefulness. Here we propose a  self&#8208;adaptive CO2  gas valve  composed of chemically responsive liquid gating systems. The transmembrane critical pressures of the liquid gate vary upon the presence of CO2  , due to the superamphiphiles assembled by Poly(propylene glycol) bis(2&#8208;aminopropyl ether) and oleic acid in  gating liquid  s that protonated specifically by  CO2  . It is shown that the valve can perform self&#8208;adaptive regulation for specific gases and different CO2  concentrations. This protonation&#8208;induced liquid gating mechanism will open a potential platform for the application of  CO2  separators, detectors, sensors and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Microscopic Mechanism of the Heat&#8208;Induced Blueshift in Phosphors and A Logarithmic Energy Dependence on the Nearest Dopant&#8208;Vacancy Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heat induced blueshift (HIB) observed in many luminescent materials is a puzzling phenomenon that remains unexplained for decades. By using the high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations and energy screening technique, we generated a number of model structures for five phosphors, RbLi[Li  3  SiO  4  ]  2  :Eu  2+  , Na[Li  3  SiO  4  ]:Eu  2+  , K[Li  3  SiO  4  ]:Eu  2+  , Sr[LiAl  3  N  4  ]:Eu  2+  , and Ca[LiAl  3  N  4  ]:Eu  2+  . Our analyses suggest, to a first approximation, a logarithmic energy dependence on the nearest distance between the dopant and the metal&#8208;cation vacancy. By identifying the 5d&#8594;4f transition energies from the electronic structures calculated from the screened model structures, we show that the vibration of the Eu  2+  ion lying in an asymmetric and anharmonic potential well couples with the electronic states, leading to their HIB phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical defect&#8208;driven response on graphene&#8208;based chemiresistors for sub&#8208;ppm ammonia detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas sensors are essential in several fields and, in general, features such as high sensitivity, quick response, and fast recovery are required, along with low power consumption and low cost. Graphene is considered a promising material for gas sensing applications, its functionalization often being a requisite. In the present study, we developed competitive and promising gas sensors for ammonia detection. Interestingly, we present an easy and efficient method to functionalize graphene by using diazonium chemistry with different functional groups. Moreover, we prove the superior sensing capability of our covalently modified graphene layers. These experimental data have been consistently interpreted by theoretical calculations, which reveal a defect&#8208;driven sensor&#8217;s response to ammonia. These results open the possibility of a comprehensive design and use of these graphene&#8208;based sensors in real applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Auto&#8208;Tandem Palladium Catalysis for 2,4&#8208;Dienyl Carbonates: Ligand&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new asymmetric auto&#8208;tandem catalysis processes, especially in a divergent manner, is highly attractive but extremely challenging. Presented herein is a palladium catalyzed auto&#8208;tandem reaction between 2,4&#8208;dienyl carbonates and o&#8208;TsNH arylimines or trifluoroacetophenones that proceeded through a consecutive N&#8208;allylation, vinylogous addition, &#960;&#8208;&#963;&#8208;&#960; isomerization, and another N&#8208;allylation sequence. Importantly, switchable diastereo&#8208;divergent synthesis could be achieved by tuning the chiral bisphosphine ligands, and a broad spectrum of fused tetrahydro&#8208;quinoline architectures was constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. Even regiodivergent azetidine or chemodivergent &#946;&#8208;H elimination derivatives, with fair enantioselectivity, could be effectively accessed via ligand&#8208;control, further showing the versatility of the current auto&#8208;tandem catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A platform for stop flow gradient generation to investigate chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of artificial microswimmers to respond to external stimuli and the mechanistical details of their origins belong to the most disputed challenges in interdisciplinary science. Therein, the creation of chemical gradients is technically challenging, because
they quickly level out due to diffusion. Inspired by pivotal stopped ow experiments in chemical kinetics, we show that microfluidics gradient generation combined with a pressure feedback loop for precisely controlling the stop of the flows, can enable us to study
mechanistical details of chemotaxis of artificial Janus micromotors, based on a catalytic reaction. We find that these copper Janus
particles display a chemotactic motion along the concentration gradient in both, positive and negative direction and we demonstrate
the mechanical reaction of the particles to unbalanced drag forces, explaining this behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Durable Intraoperative Near&#8208;infrared Imaging of Ovarian Cancer Using Ultrabright Squaraine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The residual tumor after surgery is the most significant prognostic factor of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery is actively utilized for tumor localization and complete resection during surgery. However, currently available contrast&#8208;enhancing agents display low on&#8208;target binding, unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, thus not ideal for clinical use. Here we report ultrabright and stable squaraine fluorophores with optimal pharmacokinetics by introducing an asymmetric molecular conformation and surface charges for rapid transporter&#8208;mediated cellular uptake. Among the tested, OCTL14 shows low serum binding and rapid distribution into cancer tissue  via  organic cation transporters (OCTs). Additionally, the charged squaraine fluorophores are retained in lysosomes, providing durable intraoperative imaging in a preclinical murine model of ovarian cancer up to 24 h post&#8208;injection. OCTL14 represents a significant departure from the current bioconjugation approach of using a non&#8208;targeted fluorophore and would provide surgeons with an indispensable tool to achieve optimal resection.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Controlled Polymerization of Bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;Caprolactone toward Fully Recyclable Polyesters and Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end&#8208;of&#8208;use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time&#8208;consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide (l&#8208;LA) affords well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochromism of Nanographenes in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographene (NG) is a potential candidate for organic EC materials because of its large&#160;p&#160;conjugated system, chemical stability, absorption band covering the visible region, and tunable optical properties by postsynthetic modification. We show that NGs carrying redox active triphenylamine (TPA) units covalently linked to the NG edge function as EC materials in the NIR region. The hybrid materials can be obtained by the installation of TPA units onto the NG edge and display changes in the absorption spectrum in the NIR region extending to a wavelength of over 2000 nm upon one&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction at low potentials (&lt; 1.1 V). Time&#8208;dependent unrestricted density functional theory calculation of a model NG at the UB3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d,p) level of theory suggests that a narrow energy gap between the basal plane and the oxidized TPA unit is responsible for the observed EC function in the NIR region.</dc:description>

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles&#160;as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide&#160;Production via Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of nitrous oxide, N2O,&#160;via&#160;NH3&#160;oxidation is not in practical scale due to the lack of a suitable catalyst. Instead, it is produced&#160;via&#160;thermal decomposition of NH4NO3, rendering N2O too costly and limiting its prospective uses. Herein, we report CeO2&#8209;supported Au nanoparticles (2&#8209;3&#160;nm) as a highly selective catalyst for low&#8209;temperature NH3&#160;oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher space&#8209;time yield than the state&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;art Mn&#8209;Bi/&#945;&#8209;Al2O3&#160;and remarkable stability over 70&#160;h on stream. The reaction proceeds&#160;via&#160;a Mars&#8209;Van Krevelen mechanism, with the density of interfacial Au&#948;+&#160;species and the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2&#160;identified as the key performance descriptors. The latter could be enhanced by cobalt doping, improving the catalytic activity and setting a new benchmark for N2O productivity. These findings establish NH3&#160;oxidation as an efficient process for N2O manufacture and facilitate its broader utilization as a green and selective oxidant.</dc:description>

The latter could be enhanced by cobalt doping, improving the catalytic activity and setting a new benchmark for N2O productivity. These findings establish NH3&#160;oxidation as an efficient process for N2O manufacture and facilitate its broader utilization as a green and selective oxidant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

X&#8208;ray absorption/photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculation results   indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bonding can facilitate the distorted coordinated structure of Ni site with short nickel&#8208;oxygen bond and low coordination number, and can promote the redistribution of Ni/Fe charge density   to efficiently regulate the adsorption behavior of key intermediates with near&#8208;optimal d&#8208;band center.  Here the Fe&#8208;doped&#8208;(Ni&#8208;MOFs)/FeOOH with interfacial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bonding shows superior catalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of 210 mV at 15 mA cm&#8208;2  and excellent stability with ~3% attenuation after 120 h cycle test.

         <title>Predicting solubility of ion pairs in aqueous inorganic chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs), ranging in size from several to 100&#8217;s of &#229;ngstr&#246;ms, represent building blocks of inorganic materials. Elucidating their complex solubility behavior with alkali countercations can inform and model natural and synthetic processes in aqueous media. In the study of POMs ([Nb  24  O  72  H  9  ]  15&#8722;  , Nb  24  ) we discovered an unusual solubility trend (termed anomalous solubility) of alkali&#8208;POMs, in which Nb  24  is most soluble with the smallest (Li  +  ) and largests (Rb/Cs  +  ) alkalis, and least soluble with Na/K  +  . Via computation, we define a descriptor (&#963;&#8208;profile) and use an artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately predict all three described alkali&#8208;anion solubility trends: amphoteric, normal (Li  +  &gt; Na  +  &gt; K  +  &gt; Rb  +  &gt; Cs  +  ), and anomalous (Cs  +  &gt;Rb  +  &gt;K  +  &gt;Na  +  &gt;Li  +  ). Testing predicted amphoteric solubility along with X&#8208;ray scattering and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies affirmed the accuracy of the desciptor, provided solution&#8208;phase snapshots of alkali&#8208;POM interactions, yielded a new POM formulated [Ti  6  Nb  14  O  54  ]  14&#8208;  , and provided guidlines to exploit alkali&#8208;POM interactions for new POMs discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Azacorannulenophane Enabled by Strain&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a cyclophane bearing a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl was synthesized via sequential 1,3&#8208;dipolar cy&#8208;cloaddition and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The key to the successful synthesis is the strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of a polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide to the  K  &#8208;region of [7](2,7)pyrenophane. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane exhibits intriguing structural and physical properties, including unique variation of bowl depth, extraordinarily high&#8208;field chemical shifts in its  1  H NMR spectrum, a decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and a red shift in the absorption/emission spectrum, when compared to those of the parent azacorannulene. These characteristics are derived from both the &#960;&#8208;extension to the polycyclic aromatic system in the cyclophane structure and the increased curvature enforced by the seven&#8208;carbon aliphatic chain.</dc:description>

The heart&#8208;like units and crown&#8208;like tetramer found in both compounds indicate unprecedented assembly levels, leading to an atypical geometry characteristic compared to the giant clusters directly assembled by regular units. These two clusters not only significantly increase the size of Ln&#8208;Co clusters but also exhibit the enhanced magnetic entropy change at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. This work provided an effective way to fabricate cluster compounds with giant size and geometry complexity simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>From Structural Design to Functional Construction: Amine Molecules in High&#8208;Performance FA&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based perovskites have been considered as one of the most promising light&#8208;absorbing perovskite materials owing to their narrower bandgap and better thermal stability compared to the conventional methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Constant improvement by using various additives stimulates the potential application of these perovskites. As the typical additives, amine molecules with different structures have been widely used in FA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells and decent performances have been achieved. Thus, a systematical review focusing on structural regulation and functional construction of amines in FA&#8208;based perovskites is of significance. Herein, we analyze the construction mechanism of different structural amines on the functional perovskite crystals. The influences of amine molecules on the specific perovskite properties including defect condition, charge transfer, and moisture resistance are evaluated. Finally, we summarize the design rules of amine molecules for the application in high&#8208;performance FA&#8208;based perovskite and propose directions for the future development of additive molecules.</dc:description>

Genetic encoded cyanopyridylalanines are presented as convenient and highly selective reactive groups for in vivo functionalization, cyclization and stapling of polypeptides. The non&#8208;toxic compounds can be genetically incorporated into proteins with high yields and their biocompatible reaction with amino&#8208;thiol moieties proceeds under physiological conditions to near completion without requiring a catalyst.







Abstract
Cyanopyridylalanines are non&#8208;canonical amino acids that react with aminothiol compounds under physiological conditions in a biocompatible manner without requiring added catalyst. Here we present newly developed aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for genetic encoding of meta&#8208; and para&#8208;cyanopyridylalanine to enable the site&#8208;specific attachment of a wide range of different functionalities. The outstanding utility of the cyanopyridine moiety is demonstrated by examples of i) post&#8208;translational functionalization of proteins, ii)&#8197;in&#8208;cell macrocyclization of peptides and proteins, and iii)&#8197;protein stapling. The biocompatible nature of the protein ligation chemistry enabled by the cyanopyridylalanine amino acid opens a new path to specific in vivo protein modifications in complex biological environments.

         <title>Intercalation&#8208;Activated Layered MoO3 Nanobelts as Biodegradable Nanozymes for Tumor&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous intercalation is proposed here as a promising strategy to activate the enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of layered MoO3 nanobelts for the generation of reactive oxygen species including &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; in a tumor microenvironment, making it an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy.







Abstract
The existence of natural van der Waals gaps in layered materials allows them to be easily intercalated with varying guest species, offering an appealing strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties and application performance. Herein, we report the activation of layered MoO3 nanobelts via aqueous intercalation as an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy. The long MoO3 nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na+ and H2O to obtain the short Na+/H2O co&#8208;intercalated MoO3&#8722;x (NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x) nanobelts. In contrast to the inert MoO3 nanobelts, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Thus, after bovine serum albumin modification, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts can efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro and eliminate tumors in vivo facilitating with 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.

Ca&#8208;ion battery: Ascribed to the improved anion intercalation performance in the graphite cathode and reversible Ca2+ insertion in the organic anode, by combining a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated Ca&#8208;ion electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results for Ca&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Due to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage applications. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated electrolyte with a calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)2) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion of Ca2+ in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (Ca&#8208;DIB) exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results known for CIBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultra&#8208;microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with controlled open coplanar carboxyl oxygen atoms within the pores have been constructed through an adaptable binary solvent synthetic strategy. Activated HOFs with enhanced surface polarization show highly selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 based on differences of molecule polarizability.







Abstract

The activated HOFs BTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a and PTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a show highly selective separation of CO2/N2 with a record high ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity &gt;2000 under ambient temperature and pressure.

         <title>Finite Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional DNA Hierarchical Nanoarchitectures through Orthogonal and Directional Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing robust orthogonal and directional bonding lays the foundation for the construction of finite DNA origami superstructures with complex shapes. By employing a twelve&#8208;valence hexagonal prism DNA origami as the building block, versatile superstructures were obtained from different combinations of building blocks with appropriate valences. All of these superstructures are fully addressable and could guide the assembly of guest molecules to produce functional devices.







Abstract
Reliable orthogonal bonding with precise and flexible orientation control would be ideal for building finite complex nanostructures via self&#8208;assembly. Employing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA origami, hexagonal prism DNA origami (HDO), as building block, we demonstrate it is practical to construct finite hierarchical nanoarchitectures with complicated conformations through orthogonal and directional bonding. The as&#8208;designed HDO building block has twelve prescribed directional valences in 3D space and each of them supports two opposite orientations, yielding the capability to generate abundant directional bonding. Meanwhile, we minimize the thorny non&#8208;specific interactions among HDOs and enable the orthogonal bonding between any two valences based on self&#8208;similar designing. Consequently, various hierarchical nanostructures are prepared at will simply by the combination of HDOs with appropriate valences. We believe this route towards hierarchically assembly is inspiring and hope it will facilitate the fabrication of functional superstructures.

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Membrane Based on Pillararene&#8208;Intercalated MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare a series of inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanosheets based on pillararene&#8208;intercalated MXene nanosheets is reported, which have larger lateral size compared with the original MXene nanosheets, in which a membrane was formed through vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration. The as&#8208;prepared membranes exhibited relatively high water permeance, rejection, and stability for treating water containing antibiotics under dead&#8208;end filtration and cross&#8208;flow filtration conditions.







Abstract
Discharge of antibiotic&#8208;containing wastewater causes environmental pollution and threatens biological and human health. An efficient treatment method for this wastewater is urgently required. We prepared inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXene&#8211;pillararene nanosheets with a large lateral size (5&#8211;8&#8197;&#956;m). The hybrid nanosheets were stacked on supports via vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration to prepare membranes with regular parallel slits and an interlayer spacing of 1.36&#8197;nm, which were used to purify antibiotic&#8208;containing water. Permeance through the membrane increased 100&#8208;fold compared with most polymeric and other two&#8208;dimensional nanofiltration membranes with similar rejection. This high permeance and rejection was attributed to the large lateral size of the nanosheets, regular interlayer spacing, and electrostatic interaction between the membrane and antibiotics. These membranes will broaden the applications of lamellar materials for the separation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added drugs in academia and industry.

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Pore&#8208;Space Partition and Charge Distribution in Multi&#8208;Modular Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge shifting via pore partition: A nine&#8208;nitrogen ligand simultaneously enables pore&#8208;space partition (via three N's) and charge reallocation (via six N's), thereby paving the way for multi&#8208;modular assembly of a huge family of tunable anionic porous materials with much enhanced chemical stability and selective gas and vapor sorption.







Abstract
We report here a strategy for making anionic pacs type porous materials by combining pore space partition with charge reallocation. The method uses the first negatively charged pore partition ligand (2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene, H&#8208;tph) that simultaneously enables pore partition and charge reallocation. Over two dozen anionic pacs materials have been made to demonstrate their excellent chemical stability and a high degree of tunability. Notably, Ni3&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph (bdt=1,4&#8208;benzeneditetrazolate) exhibits month&#8208;long water stability, while CoV&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph sets a new benchmark for C2H2 storage capacity under ambient conditions for ionic MOFs. In addition to tunable in&#8208;framework modules, we show feasibility to tune the type and concentration of extra&#8208;framework counter cations and their influence on both stability and capability to separate industrial C3H8/C3H6 and C6H6/C6H12 mixtures.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Induced Nanocrystalline Domain Engineering and Surface Passivation in Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through plasma&#8208;enabled post&#8208;treatment technology, a constant elastic collision with a large surface area generates periodic lattice vibration at a high potential difference, thereby rearranging the lattice along the electrically preferred direction. Nanocrystallinity of the semiconductor film is dramatically improved through the rearrangement of lattice, and thus the optoelectric properties of the materials are greatly enhanced.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous materials is key to realizing high&#8208;performance chemical and biological sensors and optoelectronics. However, minimizing surface oxidation and enhancing the domain size without affecting the porous nanoarchitecture are daunting challenges. Herein, we report a hybrid technique that combines bottom&#8208;up electrochemical growth with top&#8208;down plasma treatment to produce mesoporous semiconductors with large crystalline domain sizes and excellent surface passivation. By passivating unsaturated bonds without incorporating any chemical or physical layers, these films show better stability and enhancement in the optoelectronic properties of mesoporous copper telluride (CuTe) with different pore diameters. These results provide exciting opportunities for the development of long&#8208;term, stable, and high&#8208;performance mesoporous semiconductor materials for future technologies.

         <title>Mapping Dual&#8208;Base&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Aryl Amidations: Application in the Synthesis of 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides with 2&#8242;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones enabled the synthesis of sought&#8208;after 4&#8208;quinolones. The use of a new pre&#8208;catalyst supported by PAd2&#8208;DalPhos in combination with a DBU/NaTFA dual&#8208;base system, along with a thorough mechanistic investigation led to a successful demonstration of room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
The C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides with NH substrates employing nickel catalysts and organic amine bases represents an emergent strategy for the sustainable synthesis of (hetero)anilines. However, unlike protocols that rely on photoredox/electrochemical/reductant methods within NiI/III cycles, the reaction steps that comprise a putative Ni0/II C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling cycle for a thermally promoted catalyst system using organic amine base have not been elucidated. Here we disclose an efficient new nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides and 2&#8242;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones, for the first time where the (pseudo)halide is chloride or sulfonate, which makes use of the commercial bisphosphine ligand PAd2&#8208;DalPhos (L4) in combination with an organic amine base/halide scavenger, leading to 4&#8208;quinolones. Room&#8208;temperature stoichiometric experiments involving isolated Ni0, I, and II species support a Ni0/II pathway, where the combined action of DBU/NaTFA allows for room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Rewritable Macromolecular Data Storage with Automated Read&#8208;out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rewriting of information stored on synthetic macromolecules is achieved via the introduction of an editable position tag. The automated read&#8208;out is facilitated by making use of an algorithm that is able to decode large portions of macromolecular information without interference from the operator.







Abstract
Rewriting data stored on synthetic macromolecules is an interesting feature, even though it is considered as being quite challenging within the area of digital macromolecules. In this context, we initially studied a strategy for modifying the position tag of sequence&#8208;encoded macromolecules in a reversible manner. The efficiency of this method, which relies on the orthogonal cleavage of a thioester moiety via aminolysis, was demonstrated by modifying parts of an exemplary sentence. Simultaneously, a novel algorithm was developed to ease the read&#8208;out of macromolecular information by means of MS/MS techniques. This program, Oligoreader, can identify potential information&#8208;containing macromolecules from a series of MS1 spectra, analyze the corresponding MS2 spectra, and finally decode the data. Consequently, the algorithm simplifies the entire read&#8208;out process by avoiding any interference from the operator, which increases the potential for blind sequencing of uniform macromolecules.

         <title>Synergy Effect of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ionic Compound: Dual Interfacial Energy Level Regulation and Passivation to Promote Voc and Stability of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound QAPyBF4 was used as perovskite modulator in the Research Article by Juin&#8208;Jei Liou, Taiho Park, Zong&#8208;Xiang Xu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117303). Experimental investigations showed that p&#8208;type conjugated cations [QAPy]2+ adsorb on the perovskite surface with under&#8208;coordinated Pb cations and highly electronegative [BF4]&#8722; anions enriched at the SnO2 interface. This spontaneous diffusion effect of cation and anion improves the band alignment at two adjacent perovskite interfaces and reduces recombination losses.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Addition of Aryl Iodides across Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioenriched alcohols comprise much of the framework of organic molecules. Here, we first report that chiral nickel complexes can catalyze the intermolecular enantioselective addition of aryl iodides across aldehydes to provide diverse optically active secondary alcohols using zinc metal as the reducing agent. This method shows a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions and precludes the traditional strategy through the pregeneration of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic studies indicate that an in situ formed arylnickel, instead of an arylzinc, adds efficiently to aldehydes, forming a new C&#8722;C bond and a chiral nickel alkoxide that may be turned over by zinc powder.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first example of an intermolecular thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene coupling reaction is reported for the one&#8208;pot construction of C&#8208;S and C&#8208;C bonds. This opens a new dimension in building molecular complexity to access densely functionalized products. The progress was achieved by suppressing hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and associative reductant upconversion (via associative electron upconversion C&#8208;S three&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;bond formation) using an Eosin Y/DBU/MeOH photocatalytic system. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combining online ESI&#8208;UHRMS, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling, determination of quantum yield and computational modeling revealed a unique photoredox cycle with four radical&#8208;involving stages. Previously unavailable products of the thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reaction were obtained in good yields with high selectivity and can serve as stable precursors for the synthesis of synthetically demanding activated 1,3&#8208;dienes.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Uranyl&#8208;Imprinted Nanocage for Selective Uranium Recovery from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adsorbent was fabricated by the in&#8197;situ construction of a uranyl&#8208;imprinted nanostructure in a MOF material. Impressively, the adsorbent shows highly selective uranium extraction ability in natural seawater, which was attributed to the fitting coordination structure for uranyl.







Abstract
An adaptive coordination structure is vital for selective uranium extraction from seawater. By strategy of molecular imprinting, uranyl is introduced into a multivariate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) during the synthesis process to guide the in situ construction of proper nanocage structure for targeting uranyl binding. Except for the coordination between uranium with four oxygen from the materials, the axial oxygen of uranyl also forms hydrogen bonds with hydrogen from the phenolic hydroxyl group, which enhances the binding affinity of the material to uranyl. Attributing to the high binding affinity, the adsorbent shows high uranium binding selectivity to uranyl against not only the interfering metal ions, but also the carbonate group that coordinates with uranyl to form [UO2(CO)3]4&#8722; in seawater. In natural seawater, the adsorbent realizes a high uranium adsorption capacity of 7.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, together with an 18.38 times higher selectivity to vanadium.

         <title>Electrochemical Cage Activation of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboranes are boron&#8208;carbon molecular clusters, possessing unique properties, such as their icosahedron geometry, high boron content and a delocalized three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity. These features render carboranes valuable building blocks for applications to supramolecular design, nanomaterials, optoelectronics, boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents and organometallic coordination chemistry. Despite tremendous progress in this field, stoichiometric chemical redox reagents are largely required for oxidative carborane cage activation. In this context, electrosyntheses represent an alternative strategy for more sustainable molecular syntheses. Only in the recent few years, considerable progress has been made in electrochemical cage functionalization of carboranes, which are summarized in this. We anticipate that electrocatalysis will play an increasingly powerful stimulus within the current renaissance of carborane electrochemistry</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores harnessed by the pathways of photoinduced counterion migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the emerging field of intramolecular charge transfer induced counterion migration, we report the new insights into photophysical features of luminescent donor&#8208;acceptor phosphonium dyes (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;)  n  A  +  [X  &#8211;  ] (&#960; = &#8211;(C  6  H  4  )  x  &#8211;). The unique connectivity of the phosphorus atom affords multipolar molecules with variable number of arms and the electronic properties of the acceptor group. In the ion paired form, the transition from dipolar to quadrupolar configuration enhances the low energy migration&#8208;induced band by providing the additional pathways for anion motion. The multipolar architecture, adjustable lengths of the &#960;&#8208;spacers and the nature of counterions allow for efficient tuning the emission and achieving nearly pure white light with quantum yields around 30%. The methyl substituent at the phosphorus atom reduces the rate of ion migration and suppresses the red shifted bands, simultaneously improving total emission intensity. The results unveil the harness of multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores by anion migration via structure and branching of donor&#8208;acceptor arms.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker Molecules Convert Commercial Fluorophores into Tailored Functional Probes during Bio&#8208;labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many life&#8208;science techniques and assays rely on selective labelling of biological target structures with commercial fluorophores that have specific yet invariant properties. Consequently, a fluorophore (or dye) is only useful for a limited range of applications, e.g., as a label for cellular compartments, super&#8208;resolution imaging, DNA sequencing or for a specific biomedical assay. Modifications of fluorophores with the goal to alter their bioconjugation chemistry, photophysical or functional properties typically require complex synthesis schemes. We here introduce a general strategy that allows to customize these properties during bio&#8208;labelling with the goal to introduce the fluorophore in the last step of bio&#8208;labelling. For this, we present the design and synthesis of &#8216;linker&#8217; compounds, that bridge biotarget, fluorophore and a functional moiety via well&#8208;established labelling protocols. Linker molecules were synthesized via the Ugi&#8208;four component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) which facilitates a modular design of linkers with diverse functional properties and bioconjugation&#8208; and fluorophore attachment moieties. To demonstrate the possibilities of different linkers experimentally, we characterized the ability of commercial fluorophores from the classes of cyanines, rhodamines, carbopyronines and silicon&#8208;rhodamines to become functional labels on different biological targets  in vitro  and  in vivo  via thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry. With our strategy, we showed that the same commercial dye, can become a photostable self&#8208;healing dye or a sensor for bivalent ions subject to the linker used. Finally, we quantified the photophysical performance of different self&#8208;healing linker&#8208;fluorophore conjugates and demonstrated their applications in super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motors transform external energy input into directional motions and offer exquisite precision for nano&#8208;scale manipulations. To make full use of molecular motor capacities, their directional motions need to be transmitted and used for powering downstream molecular events. Here we present a macrocyclic molecular motor structure able to perform repetitive molecular threading of a flexible tetraethylene glycol chain through the macrocycle. This mechanical threading event is actively powered by the motor and leads to a direct translation of the unidirectional motor rotation into unidirectional translation motion (chain versus ring). The mechanism of the active mechanical threading is elucidated and the actual threading step is identified as a combined helix inversion and threading event. The established molecular machine function resembles the crucial step of macroscopic weaving or sewing processes and therefore offers a first entry point to a &#8220;molecular knitting&#8221; counterpart.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Concurrent Template Strategy for Ordered Mesoporous Intermetallic Nanoparticles with Controllable Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermetallic nanomaterials with stoichiometrically atomic orderliness have extensive potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. However, the synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with precisely controlled macroscopic morphology and mesoscopic structure is still out&#8208;of&#8208;reach, limiting their practical applications to some extent. Here, we report a general concurrent template strategy for precise synthesis of mesoporous Pt&#8208;/Pd&#8208;based intermetallic nanoparticles with desired morphologies and ordered mesostructures, for the first time. The concurrent template not only supplies a mesoporous metal seed for heterogeneous nucleation of atomically ordered intermetallic phases but also provides a nanoconfinement mesoporous environment for nanocasting synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles with ordered mesostructure and rhombic dodecahedral morphology under elevated temperature. Using the selective hydrogenation of 3&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic reaction, mesoporous intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles exhibited a remarkably controllable selectivity towards 3&#8208;nitrostyrene, 3&#8208;aminostyrene, and 3&#8208;aminoethylbenzene, respectively, depending on their atomically ordered intermetallic phases and confined crystalline mesoporosity. This work provides a very powerful strategy for the precise preparation of ordered mesoporous intermetallic nanocrystals for application in selective catalysis and fuel cell electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>The Interplay between Kinetics and Thermodynamics in Furan Diels&#8211;Alder Chemistry for Sustainable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The furan Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloaddition is a powerful green methodology to upgrade bio&#8208;derived resources into valuable, renewable chemical products. The intricate interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics often complicates the understanding of this chemistry. In this review we provide simple structure&#8211;reactivity&#8211;stability relationships to guide future efforts in the design of efficient new synthesis routes based on furan DA reactions.







Abstract
Biomass&#8208;derived furanic platform molecules have emerged as promising building blocks for renewable chemicals and functional materials. To this aim, the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloaddition stands out as a versatile strategy to convert these renewable resources in highly atom&#8208;efficient ways. Despite nearly a century worth of examples of furan DA chemistry, clear structure&#8211;reactivity&#8211;stability relationships are still to be established. Detailed understanding of the intricate interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics in these very particular [4+2] cycloadditions is essential to push further development and truly expand the scope beyond the ubiquitous addend combinations of electron&#8208;rich furans and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. Herein, we provide pertinent examples of DA chemistry, taken from various fields, to highlight trends, establish correlations and answer open questions in the field with the aim to support future efforts in the sustainable chemicals and materials production.

         <title>Highly Efficient Multiphoton Absorption of Zinc&#8208;AIEgen Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) with concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). MEPL parameters of the Zn&#8208;AIEgen hinged MOFs are far superior to some of the best multiphoton absorption (MPA) materials including the perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
A series of luminescent frameworks was synthesized from the selective combination of aggregation induced emission (AIE)&#8208;linker tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) and Zn2+. Complex 1 was formed by the close packing of Zn&#8208;TCPE hinge, and isostructural complexes 2&#8211;5 were constructed by the linkage of Zn&#8208;TCPE layer and pillar ligands. These complexes exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) and concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). The multiphoton absorption (MPA) parameters of 1 are superior to other multiphoton emission materials including the perovskite nanocrystals. The incorporation of pillar linkers slows down the charge transfer between layers of Zn&#8208;TCPE, and the aromatic core of pillar linkers has a great influence on the MPA performance of the corresponding frameworks.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Networks Enable Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl&#8208;Olefin Metathesis**

H&#8208;bonding network: Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can act as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor to enhance the catalytic efficiency of simple Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts in carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by stabilization of all transition states and intermediates along the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Synthetic chemists have learned to mimic nature in using hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions to dictate the spatial arrangement of reaction substrates and to stabilize transition states to enable highly efficient and selective reactions. The activation of a catalyst molecule itself by hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, in order to enhance its catalytic activity to achieve a desired reaction outcome, is less explored in organic synthesis, despite being a commonly found phenomenon in nature. Herein, we show our investigation into this underexplored area by studying the promotion of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) solvent in combination with para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA). Our experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal not only an interesting role of HFIP solvent in assisting pTSA Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, but also insightful knowledge about the current limitations of the carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction.

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;Assisted Engineering of pH/Enzyme Dual&#8208;Activatable ZIF@Polymer Nanosystem for Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics with Enhanced Deep&#8208;Tumor Penetration</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel pH/enzyme dual&#8208;activatable nanoplatform (ZIF@DG) was developed via in&#8197;situ encapsulation of therapeutics into a zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;8, combined with microfluidics&#8208;assisted preparation of a DG polymer coating. The nanoplatform can co&#8208;deliver the protein drug ribonuclease A and the small&#8208;molecule drug doxorubicin with controlled drug release to deep tumor regions for synergistic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The impermeable barriers of solid tumors restrict the co&#8208;delivery of protein&#8208;based drugs and chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment. Therefore, we developed a ZIF&#8208;DOX/RA@DG nanosystem that encapsulates ribonuclease A (RA) and doxorubicin (DOX) in a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) core, with a dextran&#8208;based coating (DG). The nanosystem exhibits dual&#8208;responsiveness due to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase&#8208;activatable cationization and acidic microenvironment&#8208;triggered degradation. The DG&#8208;coating process was achieved using a microfluidic approach, which stabilized the polymer responsiveness, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based structure, and bioactivity of the encapsulated therapeutics. In&#8197;vivo results confirmed that the nanosystem could co&#8208;deliver RA and DOX to deep impermeable lesions with a synergistic anticancer therapeutic effects. Such a multi&#8208;drug delivery system based on an intelligent&#8208;responsive design and a microfluidics&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy shows great clinical prospects.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Component Excitonic Switch Utilizing High&#8208;Performance Diarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly methylated diarylethenes derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine are reported with high thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and fluorogenicity. With these, an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides has been designed: one containing the fluorogenic diarylethene as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form an efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer pair.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes but have rarely been used in materials science. Here, we have developed doubly methylated DAEs derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine with high thermal stability and fatigue resistance. These new photoswitches not only outperform their predecessors but also rival classical non&#8208;nucleosidic DAEs. To demonstrate the utility of these new DAEs, we have designed an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides: one strand containing a fluorogenic double&#8208;methylated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form a highly efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer (FRET) pair. The system was operated in liquid and solid phases and showed both strong distance&#8208; and orientation&#8208;dependent photochromic FRET. The superior ON/OFF contrast was maintained over up to 100 switching cycles, with no detectable fatigue.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Nanoagents Based on Lanthanide Nucleotide Self&#8208;Assemblies toward Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled lanthanide nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with tunable size (4.6&#8211;105.7&#8197;nm) are developed by employing nanomicelles as a template. High&#8208;resolution spectra at 10&#8197;K are provided for the first time to unravel the local site symmetry of Ln3+ inside the LNNPs. The ultrasmall DOX@LNNPs can achieve rapid renal clearance and unique tumor accumulation, thus enabling efficient tumor&#8208;specific therapy with negligible long&#8208;term toxicity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoagents, which simultaneously satisfy normal tissue clearance and tumor&#8208;specific responsive treatment, are highly attractive for precise cancer theranostics. Herein, we develop a unique template&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy for the exquisitely controlled synthesis of self&#8208;assembled lanthanide (Ln3+) nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with amorphous structure and tunable size from sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm to 105&#8197;nm. By virtue of the low&#8208;temperature (10&#8197;K) and high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, the local site symmetry of Ln3+ in LNNPs is unraveled for the first time. The proposed LNNPs are further demonstrated to possess the ability for highly efficient loading and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive release of doxorubicin. Particularly, sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm LNNPs not only exhibit excellent biocompatibility and predominant renal&#8208;clearance performance, but also enable efficient tumor retention. These findings reveal the great potential of LNNPs as a new generation of therapeutic platform to overcome the dilemma between efficient therapy and long&#8208;term toxicity of nanoagents for future clinical applications.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks via a Polycondensation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 3D crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were synthesized by a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach by using Td symmetrical tetrahedral amidine hydrochloride and aldehyde. The 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and have moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%), and excellent thermal and chemical stability.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is still considered as a great challenge due to the less reversible covalent bonds of triazine linkages. The research studies of crystalline CTFs to date have been limited to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystalline CTFs have never been reported before. Herein we report the design and synthesis of two 3D crystalline CTFs, termed 3D CTF&#8208;TPM and 3D CTF&#8208;TPA through a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach. The targeted 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and show moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%). Moreover, these 3D CTFs exhibit ultrastability in the presence of boiling water, strong acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (1&#8197;M NaOH). This contribution represents the first report of 3D crystalline CTFs, which not only extends their structural diversity but also offers a synthetic strategy and structural basis for expanding practical applications of CTF materials.

The research studies of crystalline CTFs to date have been limited to two-dimensional (2D) structures, and the three-dimensional (3D) crystalline CTFs have never been reported before. Herein we report the design and synthesis of two 3D crystalline CTFs, termed 3D CTF-TPM and 3D CTF-TPA through a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach. The targeted 3D CTFs adopt &lt;b&gt;ctn&lt;/b&gt; topology, and show moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%). Moreover, these 3D CTFs exhibit ultrastability in the presence of boiling water, strong acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (1&#8197;M NaOH). This contribution represents the first report of 3D crystalline CTFs, which not only extends their structural diversity but also offers a synthetic strategy and structural basis for expanding practical applications of CTF materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metallofullertube of Ce2@C100 with a Carbon Nanotube Segment: Synthesis, Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps was synthesized and characterized. Notably, Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 shows high single&#8208;molecule conductivity and unique supramolecular assembly.







Abstract
Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end&#8208;capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100, which has a tubular C100 cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and spherical Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80, their structure&#8211;property relationship has been compared by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single&#8208;molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 was up to eight times larger than that of Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80. Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and a [12]CPP nanohoop was investigated, and theoretical calculations revealed that metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 adopted a &#8220;standing&#8221; configuration in the cavity of [12]CPP. These results demonstrate the special nature of this kind of metallofullertube.

         <title>Ultrafast Metal Electrodeposition Revealed by In Situ Optical Imaging and Theoretical Modeling towards Fast&#8208;Charging Zn Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast metal electrodeposition in fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries was investigated by in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling. The critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode were uncovered, guided by which a highly reversible Zn metal electrode in an aqueous battery with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved.







Abstract
Metallic Zn is a preferred anode material for rechargeable aqueous batteries towards a smart grid and renewable energy storage. Understanding how the metal nucleates and grows at the aqueous Zn anode is a critical and challenging step to achieve full reversibility of Zn battery chemistry, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, by combining in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling, we uncover the critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode, that is, the competition among crystallographic thermodynamics, kinetics, and Zn2+&#8208;ion diffusion. Moreover, steady&#8208;state Zn metal plating/stripping with Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% is achieved at 10&#8211;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a reasonably high concentration (3&#8197;M) ZnSO4 electrolyte. Significantly, a long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stable Zn metal electrode is realized with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in both Zn||Zn symmetrical cells and MnO2||Zn full cells.

         <title>Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) as a Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Scaffold with a Minimal Structure and High Density of Functionalizable Sites</title>

Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) is proposed as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA as a molecular scaffold was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands.







Abstract
Functionalizable synthetic molecules with nanometer sizes and defined shapes in water are useful as molecular scaffolds to mimic the functions of biomacromolecules and develop chemical tools for manipulating biomacromolecules. Herein, we propose oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Oligo&#8208;NMA forms a defined shape in water without hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or ring constraints, which enables the molecule to act as a scaffold with minimal atomic composition. Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and &#945;&#8208;carbons of oligo&#8208;NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo&#8208;NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.

         <title>Dual Active Centers Bridged by Oxygen Vacancies of Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Hybrids Supported on Molybdenum Oxide for Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;SA (single atom)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ species neighboring oxygen vacancies are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. More importantly, Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 by the effect of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+).







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) holds significant potential compared with the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency owing to localized electron deficiency. Herein, Ru&#8208;SA (single atoms)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ (4&lt;n&lt;6) species neighboring oxygen vacancies (OV) are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 through the presence of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+). The Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H2, and Mon+ species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N2, finally leading to NH3 synthesis on Mon+&#8722;OH. The NH3 generation rate is up to 4.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm.

&lt;/sub&gt; hybrids can quantitatively produce NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the presence of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mo&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). The Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Mo&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, finally leading to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis on Mo&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OH. The NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; generation rate is up to 4.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Platinum Supernanoparticles for Urinary Microfluidic Monitoring of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia&#8208;triggered platinum supernanoparticles dissociated into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters, which could be cleared by the kidney through urine, in response to the tumor microenvironment. After collection of the excreted nanosensors, the disease status was monitored visually and quantitatively by using a microfluidic chip.







Abstract
Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor&#8208;specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar&#8208;chart chip (V&#8208;Chip) for point&#8208;of&#8208;care analysis. The V&#8208;Chip signals of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow&#8208;up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.

         <title>Molecular and Spin Structures of a Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Triradical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formally equilateral triradical with D3h symmetry is subject to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion to create two distorted C2v structures (i.e., acute and obtuse forms) and these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted in the solution and solid states.







Abstract
A through&#8208;space conjugated multi&#8208;phenalenyl triradical 1&#8201;a has been prepared and characterized. Partial occupancy of doubly degenerate molecular orbitals in 1&#8201;a leads to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, creating a molecular skeleton in which C2v doublet states are lower in energy than undistorted D3h doublet and quartet states. Triradical 1&#8201;a exists in an acute form in the solution state, whereas it adopts a preferred obtuse form in the solid state. The results of the investigation show that these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted by thermal energy.

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control over Multicolor Molecular Emission by Temporal Chemical Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor molecular emission is controlled in a dynamic timing manner by introducing a temporal chemical lock. The temporal life&#8208;time of the systems can be encoded by molecularly engineering the structural information.







Abstract
Dynamic control over molecular emission, especially in a time&#8208;dependent manner, holds great promise for the development of smart luminescent materials. Here we report a series of dynamic multicolor fluorescent systems based on the time&#8208;encoded locking and unlocking of individual vibrational emissive units. The intramolecular cyclization reaction driven by adding chemical fuel acts as a chemical lock to decrease the conformational freedom of the emissive units, thus varying the fluorescence wavelength, while the resulting chemically locked state can be automatically unlocked by the hydrolysis reaction with water molecules. The dynamic molecular system can be driven by adding chemical fuels for multiple times. The emission wavelength and lifetime of the locking states can be readily controlled by elaborating the molecular structures, indicating this strategy as a robust and versatile way to modulate multi&#8208;color molecular emission in a time&#8208;encoded manner.

         <title>Selective Fluorescence Imaging of Cancer Cells Based on ROS&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Cross&#8208;Linking of Artificial Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial enzyme that responds to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was designed through introducing a catalytic histidine residue at one of the thiols of pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). The artificial enzyme could in&#8197;situ cross&#8208;link to form an assembled structure that could trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of pro&#8208;fluorophore and activate the turn&#8208;on fluorescence inside cancer cells for selective diagnosis.







Abstract
Inside living cells, regulation of catalytic activity of artificial enzymes remains challenging due to issues such as biocompatibility, efficiency, and stability of the catalyst, by which the practical applications of artificial enzymes have been severely hindered. Here, an artificial enzyme, PTT&#8208;SGH, with responsiveness to reactive oxygen species (ROS), was obtained by introducing a catalytic histidine residue to pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PTT). The artificial enzyme formed large aggregates in cells via the intracellular ROS&#8208;mediated oxidation of thiol groups. The process was significantly facilitated in tumor cells because of the higher ROS concentration in the tumor microenvironment. The catalytic activity of this artificial enzyme was intensively enhanced through deprotonation of cross&#8208;linked PTT&#8208;SGH, which showed typical esterase activities. Selective fluorescence imaging of tumor cells was achieved using the artificial enzyme to trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of the caged fluorophore inside living cells.

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel with efficient atmospheric water harvesting is developed based on anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel could achieve 0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 water vapor sorption within 120&#8197;minutes at 30&#8201;% relative humidity and produce 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. This tactful designed polyzwitterionic hydrogel provides new insight on how to fabricate efficient atmospheric water harvesting materials.







Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is regarded as one of the promising strategies for freshwater production desirable to provide sustainable water for landlocked and arid regions. Hygroscopic materials have attracted widespread attention because of their water harvesting performance. However, the introduction of many inorganic salts often leads to aggregation and leakage issues in practical use. Here, polyzwitterionic hydrogels are developed as an effective AWH material platform. Via anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, the hygroscopic salt coordinated with polymer chains could capture moisture and enhance the swelling property, leading to a strong moisture sorption capacity. The hydrogel shows superior AWH performance (0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, 120&#8197;minutes for equilibrium at 30&#8201;% relative humidity) and produces 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. It is anticipated that the polyzwitterionic hydrogels with unique salt&#8208;responsive properties could provide new insights into the design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation AWH materials.

The hydrogel shows superior AWH performance (0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 120&#8197;minutes for equilibrium at 30&#8201;% relative humidity) and produces 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; freshwater per day. It is anticipated that the polyzwitterionic hydrogels with unique salt-responsive properties could provide new insights into the design and synthesis of next-generation AWH materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3: Neutral Metalloid Radical Precursors upon Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 was proven to be an effective radical precursor under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The metalloid nature of Ge allows single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) at the neutral Ge center and leads to advantages in separation and derivatization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, in particular alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, another proposal is reported by using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3, as radical precursors. Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 shows comparable activity to that of Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722; and Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722; in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 is the first successful group&#8197;14 tetraalkyl nucleophile in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes offset the limitation of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study suggests that an alkyl radical is generated from a tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also result in the development of more non&#8208;ionic alkyl radical precursors with a metalloid center.

         <title>Engineering Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Oligonucleotides by Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Incorporation of Cathepsin B Sensitive Dipeptide Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide phosphoramidites were developed for automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. The enzymatic cleavage of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 by cathepsin B is efficient in the context of single&#8208;stranded DNA, but is sterically hindered by double&#8208;stranded DNA and short hairpin loops. The design of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone allows the construction of oligonucleotide&#8211;drug conjugates which release their small&#8208;molecule payload after enzymatic cleavage.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides containing cleavable linkers have emerged as versatile tools to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA. However, the limitations of previously reported cleavable linkers including photolabile and disulfide linkers have restricted their applications in vivo. Inspired by the cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide linkers in antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Adcetris, we have developed Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone phosphoramidites for the automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. Cathepsin B digests Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone linkers efficiently, enabling cleavage of oligonucleotides into two components or release of small&#8208;molecule payloads. Based on the prior success of dipeptide linkers in ADCs, we believe that these dipeptide linker phosphoramidites will promote new clinical applications of therapeutic oligonucleotides.

         <title>A Calix[3]acridan&#8208;Based Host&#8722;Guest Cocrystal Exhibiting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials through host&#8722;guest charge transfer interactions was proposed. Consequently, a new class of macrocycle namely calix[3]acridan was conveniently synthesized in 90% yield. The host&#8208;guest cocrystal formed by calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF property due to intense intermolecular change transfer interactions. Moreover, the spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital resulted in a very small single&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.014 eV and hence guaranteed an efficient reverse intersystem crossing for TADF. Especially, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70% was achieved and it represented the highest value among the reported intermolecular donor&#8208;acceptor TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination and Betaine Modification Augment the Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing Ability of Cylindrical Polymer Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing ability of drugs is of paramount importance for the treatments of central nervous system diseases. However, the known methods for drug transport across BBB are generally complicated and inefficient, and exhibit serious side effects in some cases. Herein, we report an exciting finding that fluorination and betaine modification can significantly augment the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of cylindrical polymer brushes (CPBs), which was demonstrated by the comparison with the CPBs modified with alkyl and poly(ethylene glycol) chains, respectively. We surmise that fluorination enhances the BBB penetration of the CPBs by increasing the hydrophobicity and reducing the surface energy, and betaine medication achieves this function via the betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries. By means of in vitro BBB model, we demonstrated that the CPBs penetrated BBB through transendothelial transport. This work provides a novel strategy for enhancing the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Co&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fenton reactions have been recently applied in tumor catalytic therapy, whose efficacy suffers from the unsatisfactory reaction kinetics of Fe3+ to Fe2+ conversion. Here we introduce a co&#8208;catalytic concept in tumor catalytic therapy by using a two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet atomically dispersed with Fe species. The single&#8208;atom Fe species act as active sites for triggering Fenton reactions, while the abundant sulfur vacancies generated on the nanosheet favor electron capture by hydrogen peroxide for promoting hydroxyl radical production. Moreover, the 2D MoS2 support also acts as a co&#8208;catalyst to accelerate the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by the oxidation of active Mo4+ sites to Mo6+, thereby promoting the whole catalytic process. The 2D nanocatalyst exhibits a desirable catalytic performance, as well as a significantly enhanced anticancer efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, which indicates the feasibility for applying such a co&#8208;catalytic concept in tumor therapy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fenton reactions have been recently applied in tumor catalytic therapy, whose efficacy suffers from the unsatisfactory reaction kinetics of Fe3+ to Fe2+ conversion. Here we introduce a co-catalytic concept in tumor catalytic therapy by using a two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet atomically dispersed with Fe species. The single-atom Fe species act as active sites for triggering Fenton reactions, while the abundant sulfur vacancies generated on the nanosheet favor electron capture by hydrogen peroxide for promoting hydroxyl radical production. Moreover, the 2D MoS2 support also acts as a co-catalyst to accelerate the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by the oxidation of active Mo4+ sites to Mo6+, thereby promoting the whole catalytic process. The 2D nanocatalyst exhibits a desirable catalytic performance, as well as a significantly enhanced anticancer efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, which indicates the feasibility for applying such a co-catalytic concept in tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Carbon Science: Efficient Carbon Resource Processing, Utilization, and Recycling towards Carbon Neutrality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient utilization and recycling of carbon resources, which contain mainly the elements C, H, and O, is an effective way to minimize CO2 emission. In this Minireview, green carbon science is discussed in combination with related fields, including petroleum refining and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials from coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics.







Abstract
Green carbon science is defined as the &#8220;study and optimization of the transformation of carbon&#8208;containing compounds and the relevant processes involved in the entire carbon cycle from carbon resource processing, carbon energy utilization, CO2 fixation, and carbon recycling to utilize carbon resources efficiently and minimize the net CO2 emission.[1] Green carbon science is related closely to carbon neutrality, and relevant fields have developed quickly in the last decade. In this Minireview, we propose the concept of carbon energy index, and the recent progress in petroleum refining, and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials using coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics is highlighted in combination with green carbon science. An outlook for these important fields is provided in the final section.

         <title>Engineering MoOx/MXene Hole Transfer Layers for Unexpected Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of semiconductor photoanodes is of great practical interest for the realization of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) MXene quantum dots (MQD) or two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets (MN) were grafted on BiVO4  substrate, then as&#8208;assemblied MoOx  layer by combining ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) was constructed as a promising model system of integrated photoanodes. As&#8208;prepared OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4  array not only achieves a current density of 5.85 mA cm&#8208;2  at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), but also remarkably enhances photostability. From electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, high PEC performance is ascribed to the incorporation of MoOx/MQD as hole transfer layers, retarding charge recombination, promoting hole transfer and accelerating water splitting kinetics. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work not only demonstrates the potential utilization of hole transfer layers, but also sheds light on rational design and fabrication of integrated photoanodes for feasible solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Construction of N&#8208;Heterocycles via 1,4&#8208;Palladium Shift&#8208;Mediated Double C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past years, Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation provided efficient and step&#8208;economical methods to synthesize carbo&#8208; and heterocycles via direct C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp  3  ) bond formation. We report herein that 1,4&#8208;Pd shift allows access to N&#8208;heterocycles which are difficult to build via a direct reaction. It is shown that  o  &#8208;bromo&#8208;  N  &#8208;methylanilines undergo 1,4&#8208;Pd shift at the  N  &#8208;methyl group, followed by intramolecular trapping by C(sp  2  )&#8211;H or C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation at another nitrogen substituent and remote C&#8211;C bond formation to generate biologically relevant isoindolines and &#946;&#8208;lactams. The product selectivity is influenced by the employed ligand, with NHCs favoring the product of remote C&#8211;C coupling against products arising from direct C&#8211;C coupling and N&#8208;demethylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Extrusion Printing for Simultaneous Crystallization&#8208;Deposition of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive extrusion printing (REP) is demonstrated as an approach to simultaneously crystallize and deposit films of the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Cu3btc2  (btc = 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate), also known as HKUST&#8208;1. The technique co&#8208;delivers inks of the copper(II) acetate and H  3  btc starting materials directly on&#8208;surface and on&#8208;location for rapid nucleation into films at room temperature. The films were analyzed using PXRD, profilometry, SEM and thermal analysis techniques and confirmed high quality Cu3btc2  films are produced in low&#8208;dispersity interconnected nanoparticulate form. The porosity was examined using gas adsorption which showed REP gives Cu3btc2  films with open interconnected pore structures, demonstrating the method bestows features that traditional synthesis does not. REP is a technique that opens the field to time&#8208;efficient large&#8208;scale fabrication of MOF interfaces and should find use in a wide variety of coating application settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing GLUT1 Targeted Pro&#8208;oxidant Ascorbate for Synergistic Phototherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite extensive efforts to realize effective photodynamic therapy (PDT), there is still a lack of therapeutic approaches concisely&#8208;structured to mitigate major obstacles of PDT in clinical applications. Herein, we report a molecular strategy exploiting ascorbate chemistry to enhance the efficacy of PDT in cancer cells overexpressing glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). AA&#8208;EtNBS, a 5&#8208;O&#8208;substituted ascorbate&#8208;photosensitizer (PS) conjugate, undergoes a reversible structural conversion of the ascorbate moiety in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), thereby promoting its uptake in GLUT1&#8208;overexpressed KM12C colon cancer cells and perturbing tumor redox homeostasis, respectively. Due to the peculiar pro&#8208;oxidant role of ascorbate in tumour environments, AA&#8208;EtNBS effectively sensitised KM12C cancer cells prior to PS&#8208;mediated superoxide radical generation under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) illumination. AA&#8208;EtNBS successfully exhibited GLUT1&#8208;targeted synergistic therapeutic efficacy during PDT both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study outlines a promising strategy employing ascorbate both as a targeting unit for GLUT1&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and redox homeostasis destruction agent, thereby enhancing therapeutic responses towards anticancer treatment when used in conjunction with conventional PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Silaborative Assembly of Allenamides and Alkynes: Highly Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled Access to Bi&#8208; or Trimetallic Skipped Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly stereo&#8208; and regiocontrolled multicomponent approach to skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes decorated with one boryl and two silyl functionalities is described. This Pd&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economical union of allenamides, alkynes, and Me  2  PhSiBpin (or Et  3  SiBpin) proceeds without the use of phosphine ligands, instead relying on chelation through the internal amide group of the allenamide sulfonyl. A variety of alkynes, including those derived from complex bioactive molecules, can be efficiently coupled with allenamides and Me  2  PhSiBpin in good yields and with excellent selectivity. The synthetic potential was demonstrated through multiple valuable chemoselective transformations, establishing new disconnections for functionalized dienes. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the reaction first proceeded through borylation of the allenamide, followed by silylation of the alkyne and then reductive elimination, which convergently assemble the skipped 1,4&#8208;diene.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A highly stereo- and regiocontrolled multicomponent approach to skipped 1,4-dienes decorated with one boryl and two silyl functionalities is described. This Pd-catalyzed atom-economical union of allenamides, alkynes, and Me  2  PhSiBpin (or Et  3  SiBpin) proceeds without the use of phosphine ligands, instead relying on chelation through the internal amide group of the allenamide sulfonyl. A variety of alkynes, including those derived from complex bioactive molecules, can be efficiently coupled with allenamides and Me  2  PhSiBpin in good yields and with excellent selectivity. The synthetic potential was demonstrated through multiple valuable chemoselective transformations, establishing new disconnections for functionalized dienes. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the reaction first proceeded through borylation of the allenamide, followed by silylation of the alkyne and then reductive elimination, which convergently assemble the skipped 1,4-diene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography with On&#8208;Line Deuterated Solvent Exchange for Streamlined Structure Elucidation at the Microgram Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the forefront of chemistry and biology research, development timelines are fast&#8208;paced and large quantities of pure targets are rarely available. Herein, we introduce a new framework, which is built upon an automated, online trapping&#8208;enrichment multi&#8208;dimensional liquid chromatography platform (TE&#8208;  Dt  &#8208;mDLC) that enables: 1) highly efficient separation of complex mixtures in a first dimension (  1  D  &#8208;UV); 2) automated peak trapping&#8208;enrichment and buffer removal achieved through a sequence of H  2  O and D  2  O washes using an independent pump setup; and 3) a second dimension separation (  2  D  &#8208;UV&#8208;MS) with fully deuterated mobile phases and fraction collection to minimize protic residues for immediate NMR analysis while bypassing tedious drying processes and minimizing analyte degradation. Diverse examples of target isolation and characterization from organic synthesis and natural product chemistry laboratories are illustrated, demonstrating recoveries above 90% using as little as a few micrograms of material.</dc:description>
