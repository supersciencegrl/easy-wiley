         <title>Stereodivergent Attached&#8208;Ring Synthesis via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions: A Short Formal Synthesis of Merrilactone A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to control the diastereoselectivity of bond formation at a prochiral attached&#8208;ring bridgehead is reported. An unusual stereodivergent Michael reaction relies on basic vs. Lewis acidic conditions and non&#8208;covalent interactions to control&#160;re&#8208;&#160;vs.&#160;si&#8208;&#160;facial selectivity en route to fully&#8208;substituted attached&#8208;rings. This divergency reflects differential engagement of one rotational isomer of the attached&#8208;ring system. The successful synthesis of an&#160;erythro&#160;subtarget diastereomer ultimately leads to a short formal synthesis of merrilactone A.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Cationic Low&#8208;Coordinate Tetrylenes: Highly Lewis Acidic &#963;&#8208;Donor Ligands in Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel non&#8208;innocent ligand class, namely cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles, is reported in the phosphine&#8208;functionalised cationic tetrylene Ni  0  complexes, [  PhR  DippENi(PPh  3  )  3  ]  +  (  4a/b  (Ge) and  5  (Sn);  PhR  Dipp = {[Ph  2  PCH  2  SiR  2  ](Dipp)N}  &#8208;  ; R = Ph,  i  Pr; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ). The inherent electronic nature of low&#8208;coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8208;E&#8208;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic E  II  centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH  3  . Further, the Ge  II  centre in  4a/b  readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF  6  ]  &#8208;  to form the fluoro&#8208;germylene complex  PhR  DippGe(F)Ni(PPh  3  )  3  9  , despite this Ge  II  centre simultaneously being a  &#963;  &#8208;donating ligand towards Ni  0  . Alongside the observed catalytic ability of  4  and  5  in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi&#8208;talented ligand class in cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic kinetic sensitization of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds &#8211; Access to medium&#8208;sized rings via a De Mayo&#8208;type ring expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated two&#8208;carbon ring expansion of  &#946;  &#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with unactivated olefins providing facile access to medium&#8208;sized rings. Selective sensitization of the substoichiometric enol tautomer enables reactivity with substrates incompatible with the classical De Mayo&#8208;reaction conditions. Key to success is the identification of the metal&#8208;based sensitizer  fac  &#8208;[Ir(CF  3  &#8208;pmb)  3  ], which possesses a high triplet excited state energy of 73.3 kcal mol  &#8211;1  . This exactly falls in the range between the triplet energies of the enol and keto tautomer, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic sensitization. Demonstrating the applicability of  fac  &#8208;[Ir(CF  3  &#8208;pmb)  3  ] as a photocatalyst in organic synthesis for the first time, we describe a two&#8208;step photocycloaddition&#8208;ring&#8208;opening cascade with  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters, &#8208;diketones and &#8208;ketoamides. The mechanism is corroborated by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, as well as further experimental and computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conjugated Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight Oligoparaphenylene Nanohoop with Adaptive Cavities Derived from Cyclooctatetrathiophene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fully conjugated figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight nanohoop is presented with facile synthesis. The molecule&#8217;s lemniscular skeleton features the combination of two strained oligoparaphenylene loops and a flexible cyclooctatetrathiophene core. Its rigid yet guest&#8208;adaptive cavities enable the formation of the peanut&#8208;like 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes with C  60  or C  70  , which have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and characterized in solution. Further computational studies suggest notable geometric variations and non&#8208;covalent interactions of the cavities upon binding with different fullerenes, as well as the overall conjugation comparable to cycloparaphenylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Pairing in the Mordenite Framework as a Function of the CuI/CuII Speciation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25891-25896, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As evidenced by advanced X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis, Cu&#8208;pairing in copper&#8208;exchanged mordenite is favored by the +2 oxidation state. The optimal Cu&#8211;Cu distance in the oxidized state favors the formation of dimeric mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper sites.







Abstract
A series of gas&#8208;phase reactants is used to treat a Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite zeolite with the aim of studying the influence of the reaction environment on the formation of Cu pairs. The rearrangement of Cu ions to form multimeric sites as a function of their oxidation state was probed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and also by applying advanced analysis through wavelet transform, a method able to specifically locate Cu&#8211;Cu interactions also in the presence of overlapping contributions from other scattering paths. The nature of the Cu&#8208;oxo species formed upon oxidation was further crosschecked by DFT&#8208;assisted fitting of the EXAFS data and by resonant Raman spectroscopy. Altogether, the CuI/CuII speciation clearly correlates with Cu proximity, with metal ion pairs quantitatively forming under an oxidative environment.

         <title>The Unusual Conductivity of Na+ in PEO&#8208;Based Statistical Copolymer Solid Electrolytes: When Less Means More</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25897-25904, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid polymer electrolytes from synthesized statistical copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide were mixed with various amounts of NaClO4. Physical crosslinking with cations is more prone to happen at high contents in both salt and comonomers, reducing the ionic conductivity. Low salt content (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) is thus preferred, contrasting with classical Nernstian behavior, leading to ionic conductivity of 0.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The low conductivity of Na+ electrolytes in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) curtails the development of Na polymer batteries. In this study, NaClO4 (3&#8211;24&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 90&#8211;9:1 O:Na) is dissolved in statistical copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) (0&#8211;20&#8197;mol&#8201;%). Remarkably, the conductivity of these SPEs increases as the concentration of Na+ decreases, thus departing from the usual Nernstian behavior. Using a combination of calorimetric measurements and molecular dynamic simulations, this unusual phenomenon is attributed to the presence of physical cross&#8208;links generated by Na+. As a result, polymers containing a low salt concentration (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) display a drastically enhanced ionic conductivity (up to 0.2 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), thus paving the way for the design of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PEO&#8208;based sodium batteries operational at room temperature.

&lt;p&gt;Solid polymer electrolytes from synthesized statistical copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide were mixed with various amounts of NaClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Physical crosslinking with cations is more prone to happen at high contents in both salt and comonomers, reducing the ionic conductivity. Low salt content (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) is thus preferred, contrasting with classical Nernstian behavior, leading to ionic conductivity of 0.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C.

Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed a simple neutralization assay based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. This assay can assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities. We used this assay to profile neutralization capacity in patients infected with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and vaccinated individuals and show that this assay is useful for various clinical applications.







Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) manifests with high clinical variability and warrants sensitive and specific assays to analyze immune responses in infected and vaccinated individuals. Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed an assay to assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. The assay does not require live viruses or cells and can be performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory within two hours. We used this assay to assess neutralization and antibody levels in patients who died of COVID&#8208;19 and patients hospitalized for a short period of time and show that neutralization and antibody levels increase over time. We also adapted the assay for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and measured neutralization capacity in pre&#8208;pandemic healthy, COVID&#8208;19 infected, and vaccinated individuals. This assay is highly adaptable for clinical applications, such as vaccine development and epidemiological studies.

Abstract
We present (3+2)&#8208; and (4+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes with N&#8208;sulfinylamines and a sulfur diimide, along with a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy for the formal insertion of HNSO2 into D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. These are rare examples of cycloadditions with D&#8211;A cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes whereby the 2&#960; component consists of two different heteroatoms, thus leading to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings containing adjacent heteroatoms.

         <title>Enantiopure C5 Pentaindenocorannulenes: Chiral Graphenoid Materials</title>

Four chiral C5 bowl&#8208;shaped aromatic hydrocarbons with exceptional configurational stability derived from pentaindenocorannulene synthesized. The chirality of these carbon bowls is instrumental to establishing the formation of columnar supramolecular assemblies in solution.







Abstract
Chiral carbon nanomaterials offer numerous prospects for material science. As a fundamental building block for non&#8208;planar graphenoid materials, pentaindenocorannulene (PIC) with its C5v symmetrical structure presents a platform for creation of supramolecular chiral carbon materials. Specifically, when uniformly penta&#8208;substituted on its periphery, PIC generates C5 symmetrical chiral buckybowls capable of columnar stacking. The synthesis and resolution of such PICs are achieved, assignment of absolute configuration is established by comparison of ECD and VCD spectra with theory, and material characterization is reported. Evidence for columnar stacking in solution and in the crystal is presented.

         <title>Inhibition Mechanism of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Ketone&#8208;Based Inhibitors Unveiled by Multiscale Simulations: Insights for Improved Designs**
</title>

Multiscale simulations unveil the binding and reaction mechanism of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231 inhibitor. This compound contains a hydroxymethyl group that plays a relevant role in the formation of the noncovalent and covalent complexes. In silico modifications show a possible strategy for the design of new inhibitors.







Abstract
We present the results of classical and QM/MM simulations for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 3CL protease by a hydroxymethylketone inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231. In the noncovalent complex the carbonyl oxygen atom of the warhead is placed in the oxyanion hole formed by residues 143 to 145, while P1&#8211;P3 groups are accommodated in the active site with interactions similar to those observed for the peptide substrate. According to alchemical free energy calculations, the P1&#8242; hydroxymethyl group also contributes to the binding free energy. Covalent inhibition of the enzyme is triggered by the proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. This step is followed by the nucleophilic attack of the S&#947; atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor and a proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom mediated by the P1&#8242; hydroxyl group. Computational simulations show that the addition of a chloromethyl substituent to the P1&#8242; group may lower the activation free energy for covalent inhibition

         <title>Using Stereochemistry to Control Mechanical Properties in Thiol&#8211;Yne Click&#8208;Hydrogels</title>

Controlling the stereochemistry of double bonds that are formed in situ using the nucleophilic thiol&#8211;yne addition enables the synthesis of robust hydrogels with mechanical properties that relate to the double bond stereochemistry. This approach allows the synthesis of hydrogels in which the other chemical and hence physical parameters remain the same providing a platform from which to isolate mechanical properties to direct cell differentiation.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of polymers has a profound impact on their mechanical properties. While this has been observed in thermoplastics, studies on how stereochemistry affects the bulk properties of swollen networks, such as hydrogels, are limited. Typically, changing the stiffness of a hydrogel is achieved at the cost of changing another parameter, that in turn affects the physical properties of the material and ultimately influences the cellular response. Herein, we report that by manipulating the stereochemistry of a double bond, formed in situ during gelation, materials with diverse mechanical properties but comparable physical properties can be obtained. Click&#8208;hydrogels that possess a high %&#8197;trans content are stiffer than their high %&#8197;cis analogues by almost a factor of&#8197;3. Human mesenchymal stem cells acted as a substrate stiffness cell reporter demonstrating the potential of these platforms to study mechanotransduction without the influence of other external factors.

         <title>SmCo5 with a Reconstructed Oxyhydroxide Surface for Spin&#8208;Selective Water Oxidation at Elevated Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
Polarized spins occurring at the ferromagnetic/oxyhydroxide interface of surface&#8208;reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy led to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins were aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60&#8201;&#176;C (see picture).







Abstract
The efficiency of electrolytic hydrogen production is limited by the slow reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface&#8208;reconstructed ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts with a spin&#8208;pinning effect at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface could enhance the spin&#8208;dependent OER kinetics. However, in real&#8208;life applications, electrolyzers are operated at elevated temperature, which may disrupt the spin orientations of FM catalysts and limit their performance. In this study, we prepared surface&#8208;reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy, which possesses polarized spins at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface that lead to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins could be further aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. Moreover, the operation temperature was elevated to mimic the practical operation conditions of water electrolyzers. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>An Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Enhanced Li+ Transport Ability Enables Stable Li Deposition for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25973-25980, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Li deposition in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is achieved through introducing hydrofluoroether to regulate the solvation environment of electrolyte to boost Li+ transport ability according to the Sand formula. The formation of sliced ionic aggregate leads to the improved transport parameters in Sand formula. The performance of Li&#8208;O2 battery is greatly improved thanks to the realized robust Li deposition behavior.







Abstract
Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte could endow Li&#8208;O2 batteries with low charging overpotential. However, their weak Li+ transport ability (LTA) leads to non&#8208;uniform Li deposition. Herein, guided by Sand formula, the LTA of TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is greatly enhanced to realize robust Li deposition through introducing hydrofluoroether (HFE) and optimizing electrolyte component ratios to regulate solvation environment. The solvation environment changes from Li(TFSI)2&#8722; ion pair into ionic aggregate clusters in the optimal electrolyte thanks to the slicing function of HFE toward ionic aggregate network. The transport parameters of Sand formula are synchronously enhanced, resulting in highly robust Li deposition behavior with greatly improved Coulombic efficiency (ca. 97.5&#8201;%) and cycling rate (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Cycling stability of Li&#8208;O2 batteries was greatly improved (a tiny overpotential rise of 64&#8197;mV after 75&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Site Concerted Proton&#8211;Electron Transfer in a Manganese&#8208;Based Complete Functional Model for [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25839-25845, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a mononuclear manganese complex, synchronous e&#8722; and H+ transfer occurred by a concerted pathway from spatially distinct sites to the reaction center (see scheme). By virtue of the multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET) mechanism, this model complex lowered the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to approximately 20&#8197;mV when the weak acid phenol was used as a proton source.







Abstract
The active site of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (H2ase) is preorganized with an amine (azadithiolate) as a proton relay and a [4Fe4S] subunit as an electron reservoir, which together lower the overpotential for proton reduction and hydrogen oxidation by multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET). Herein, we report a mononuclear manganese complex, fac&#8208;[Mn(CO)3(6&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenol)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;quinoline) Br] (1), as a rare model to fully mimic the functions of the H2ase. In 1, a redox&#8208;active bidentate ligand with a pendent phenol replicates the roles of the electron reservoir and the proton relay in the enzyme. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed two consecutive MS&#8208;CPET processes in the catalytic cycle, in each of which an electron stored in the reductive ligand and a proton at the proximal phenol moiety are transferred to the Mn center in a concerted way. By virtue of this mechanism, complex 1 exhibited a low overpotential comparable to that of natural enzyme in electrochemical hydrogen production using phenol as a proton source.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Spin&#8208;Dependent Transport in Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based Supramolecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25958-25965, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoresistance at room temperature is found in CoII and CuII metalloporphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular devices. The inversion of the magnetization of the Ni STM tip results in a change in the transport properties through the molecule. Such an effect appears for positive and negative bias. DFT&#8208;NEGF and TDDFT calculations were employed to explain the spin&#8208;polarization of the current.







Abstract
Here we present room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;dependent charge transport measurements in single&#8208;molecule junctions made of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular assemblies. They display large conductance switching for magnetoresistance in a single&#8208;molecule junction.

&lt;p&gt;Magnetoresistance at room temperature is found in Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; metalloporphyrin-based supramolecular devices. The inversion of the magnetization of the Ni STM tip results in a change in the transport properties through the molecule. Such an effect appears for positive and negative bias. DFT-NEGF and TDDFT calculations were employed to explain the spin-polarization of the current.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present room-temperature spin-dependent charge transport measurements in single-molecule junctions made of metalloporphyrin-based supramolecular assemblies. They display large conductance switching for magnetoresistance in a single-molecule junction. The magnetoresistance depends acutely on the probed electron pathway through the supramolecular wire: those involving the metal center showed marked magnetoresistance effects as opposed to those exclusively involving the porphyrin ring which present nearly complete absence of spin-dependent charge transport. The molecular junction magnetoresistance is highly anisotropic, being observable when the magnetization of the ferromagnetic junction electrode is oriented along the main molecular junction axis, and almost suppressed when it is perpendicular. The key ingredients for the above effect to manifest are the electronic structure of the paramagnetic metalloporphyrin, and the spinterface created at the molecule&#8211;electrode contact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Recognition of Quinones in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity with Anthracene Sidewalls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25981-25987, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new biomimetic host with anthracene sidewalls was constructed based on the concept of endo&#8208;functionalized cavity and by employing the synthetic strategy of simultaneous construction. This host is able to effectively bind quinones with high selectivity by employing shielded noncovalent interactions and the hydrophobic effect.







Abstract
Selective molecular recognition in water is the foundation of numerous biological functions but is a challenge for most synthetic hosts. We employ the concept of endo&#8208;functionalized cavity and the strategy of simultaneous construction to address this issue. The concept and the strategy were demonstrated in the construction of a biomimetic host for selectively recognizing quinones in water. The host was synthesized by joining two pieces of bent anthracene dimer through amide bond formation, affording a deep hydrophobic cavity and inward&#8208;directing hydrogen bonding sites. The host can recognize quinones over their close analogues in water, and its association affinity to p&#8208;benzoquinone is the highest among all the known hosts and is even comparable to that of the bioreceptor. The binding with an anthraquinone reaches nanomolar affinity. Shielded hydrogen bonding, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and charge transfer interactions, and the hydrophobic effect are responsible for the high binding affinity and selectivity.

         <title>Defying Thermodynamics: Stabilization of Alane Within Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>

Experiments and calculations are presented to elucidate the mechanism of nanoconfinement and thermodynamic stabilization of AlH3 inside the pores of a bipyridine&#8208;functionalized cyclic triazine framework, CTF&#8208;bipyridine, which is responsible for the unprecedented reversibility of the hydride under 70&#8197;MPa hydrogen pressure at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The highly unfavorable thermodynamics of direct aluminum hydrogenation can be overcome by stabilizing alane within a nanoporous bipyridine&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine framework (AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipyridine). This material and the counterpart AlH3@CTF&#8208;biphenyl rapidly desorb H2 between 95 and 154&#8201;&#176;C, with desorption complete at 250&#8201;&#176;C. Sieverts measurements, 27Al MAS NMR and 27Al{1H} REDOR experiments, and computational spectroscopy reveal that AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipyridine dehydrogenation is reversible at 60&#8201;&#176;C under 700&#8197;bar hydrogen, &gt;10 times lower pressure than that required to hydrogenate bulk aluminum. DFT calculations and EPR measurements support an unconventional mechanism whereby strong AlH3 binding to bipyridine results in single&#8208;electron transfer to form AlH2(AlH3)n clusters. The resulting size&#8208;dependent charge redistribution alters the dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation thermochemistry, suggesting a novel strategy to enable reversibility in high&#8208;capacity metal hydrides.

         <title>Self&#8208;Metalation of Porphyrins at the Solid&#8211;Gas Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25988-25993, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic self&#8208;metalation of tetrapyrroles at surfaces can be promoted by oxygen at the solid&#8211;gas interface already at room temperature, lowering the reaction barrier as in the case of 2H&#8208;TPP/Pd(100).







Abstract
Self&#8208;metalation is a promising route to include a single metal atom in a tetrapyrrolic macrocycle in organic frameworks supported by metal surfaces. The molecule&#8211;surface interaction may provide the charge transfer and the geometric distortion of the molecular plane necessary for metal inclusion. However, at a metal surface the presence of an activation barrier can represent an obstacle that cannot be compensated by a higher substrate temperature without affecting the layer integrity. The formation of the intermediate state can be facilitated in some cases by oxygen pre&#8208;adsorption at the supporting metal surface, like in the case of 2H&#8208;TPP/Pd(100). In such cases, the activation barrier can be overcome by mild annealing, yielding the formation of desorbing products and of the metalated tetrapyrrole. We show here that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;TPP at the Pd(100) surface can be promoted already at room temperature by the presence of an oxygen gas phase at close&#8208;to&#8208;ambient conditions via an Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanism.

Crystallization&#8208;induced&#8208;emission AggRetina probe serves as a fluorescent polarity ruler to dissect the enriched heterogeneity inside aggregated proteins.







Abstract
We report a crystallization&#8208;induced emission fluorophore to quantitatively interrogate the polarity of aggregated proteins. This solvatochromic probe, namely &#8220;AggRetina&#8221; probe, inherently binds to aggregated proteins and exhibits both a polarity&#8208;dependent fluorescence emission wavelength shift and a viscosity&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity increase. Regulation of its polarity sensitivity was achieved by extending the conjugation length. Different proteins bear diverse polarity upon aggregation, leading to different resistance to proteolysis. Polarity primarily decreases during protein misfolding but viscosity mainly increases upon the formation of insoluble aggregates. We quantified the polarity of aggregated protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest in live cells via HaloTag bioorthogonal labeling, revealing polarity heterogeneity within cellular aggregates. The enriched micro&#8208;environment details inside misfolded and aggregated proteins may correlate to their bio&#8208;chemical properties and pathogenicity.

The oxidation of physiologically stable diazaborines in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the key to the construction of ROS&#8208;responsive antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. These conjugates are a new class of therapeutics that combine the lethality of potent cytotoxic drugs with the targeting ability of antibodies to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells.







Abstract
Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of therapeutics that combine the lethality of potent cytotoxic drugs with the targeting ability of antibodies to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells. In this study we show for the first time the synthesis of a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ADC (VL&#8208;DAB31&#8208;SN&#8208;38) that is highly selective and cytotoxic to B&#8208;cell lymphoma (CLBL&#8208;1 cell line, IC50 value of 54.1&#8197;nM). The synthesis of this ADC was possible due to the discovery that diazaborines (DABs) are a very effective ROS&#8208;responsive unit that are also very stable in buffer and in plasma. DFT calculations performed on this system revealed a favorable energetic profile (&#916;GR=&#8722;74.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) similar to the oxidation mechanism of aromatic boronic acids. DABs&#8217; very fast formation rate and modularity enabled the construction of different ROS&#8208;responsive linkers featuring self&#8208;immolative modules, bioorthogonal functions, and bioconjugation handles. These structures were used in the site&#8208;selective functionalization of a VL antibody domain and in the construction of the homogeneous ADC.

         <title>Noncovalent CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Phosphoramidite Palladium(II) Complexes with Strong Conformational Preference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25832-25838, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a combined NMR and computational study of a supramolecular balance to quantify ligand&#8211;ligand interactions in metal complexes and induce high heterocomplex preferences. Noncovalent interaction areas of flexible chiral phosphoramidite ligands are identified in palladium complexes with high conformational stability. The combined CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions reveal design patterns for binding and folding of chiral ligands and catalysts.







Abstract
The weak noncovalent interactions and flexibility of ligands play a key role in enantioselective metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In transition metal complexes and their catalytic applications, the experimental assessment and the design of key interactions is as difficult as the prediction of the enantioselectivities, especially for flexible, privileged ligands such as chiral phosphoramidites. Therefore, the interligand interactions in cis&#8208;PdIIL2Cl2 phosphoramidite complexes were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and computations. We were able to induce a strong conformational preference by breaking the symmetry of the C2&#8208;symmetric side chain of one of the ligands, and shift the equilibrium between hetero&#8208; and homocomplexes towards heterocomplexes because of interligand interactions in the cis&#8208;complexes. The modulation of aryl substituents was exploited, along with the solvent effect. The combined CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions reveal design patterns for binding and folding of chiral ligands and catalysts.

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25846-25855, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with minimal phototoxicity, &#956;M affinities and high turn&#8208;on ratios. Tailored for 4D, long&#8208;term and multiple&#8208;color recording of Zn2+/insulin co&#8208;secretion in &#946;&#8208;cells and islets, the new probes promise to unveil the spatial&#8208;temporal regulation of islet endocrinology.







Abstract
Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with Kd values ranging from 190&#8197;nM to 74&#8197;&#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real&#8208;time monitoring the high concentration of Zn2+ co&#8208;released with insulin during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long&#8208;term live recording of isolated islets. A Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probe with high turn&#8208;on ratio (&gt;100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late&#8208;stage N&#8208;alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets. The time&#8208;lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red&#8208;shifted Zn2+ and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Sialylated Glycoforms of Human Erythropoietin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25922-25932, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two glycoforms of human erythropoietin (EPO) were synthesized by sequential native chemical ligation combining chemical and enzymatic methods. The sialylated glycoform EPO&#8197;S was assembled stepwise from sialoglycopeptides but more rapidly by direct sialylation of the asialo glycoform EPO&#8197;A. The native fold was evident from CD spectra, HR&#8208;MS, and binding to the human EPO receptor (EPOR).







Abstract
Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) is the main therapeutic glycoprotein for the treatment of anemia in cancer and kidney patients. The in&#8208;vivo activity of EPO is carbohydrate&#8208;dependent with the number of sialic acid residues regulating its circulatory half&#8208;life. EPO carries three N&#8208;glycans and thus obtaining pure glycoforms provides a major challenge. We have developed a robust and reproducible chemoenzymatic approach to glycoforms of EPO with and without sialic acids. EPO was assembled by sequential native chemical ligation of two peptide and three glycopeptide segments. The glycopeptides were obtained by pseudoproline&#8208;assisted Lansbury aspartylation. Enzymatic introduction of the sialic acids was readily accomplished at the level of the glycopeptide segments but even more efficiently on the refolded glycoprotein. Biological recognition of the synthetic EPOs was shown by formation of 1:1 complexes with recombinant EPO receptor.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Hydroamination of Alkenes with N&#8208;Fluorobenzenesulfonimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25949-25957, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly general and efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed radical hydroamination of alkenes with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide and its analogues has been developed. The corresponding asymmetric version has also been achieved by using a chiral cobalt(II)&#8208;salen catalyst in good to excellent level of enantiocontrol.







Abstract
An efficient and general radical hydroamination of alkenes using Co(salen) as catalyst, N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) and its analogues as both nitrogen source and oxidant was successfully disclosed. A variety of alkenes, including aliphatic alkenes, styrenes, &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, acids, as well as enones, were all compatible to provide desired amination products. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction underwent a metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkene, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles. Moreover, by virtue of modified chiral cobalt(II)&#8208;salen catalyst, an unprecedented asymmetric version was also achieved with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol.

     alt="Cobalt-Catalyzed Radical Hydroamination of Alkenes with N-Fluorobenzenesulfonimides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly general and efficient Co-catalyzed radical hydroamination of alkenes with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-fluorobenzenesulfonimide and its analogues has been developed. The corresponding asymmetric version has also been achieved by using a chiral cobalt(II)-salen catalyst in good to excellent level of enantiocontrol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient and general radical hydroamination of alkenes using Co(salen) as catalyst, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) and its analogues as both nitrogen source and oxidant was successfully disclosed. A variety of alkenes, including aliphatic alkenes, styrenes, &#945;, &#946;-unsaturated esters, amides, acids, as well as enones, were all compatible to provide desired amination products. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction underwent a metal-hydride-mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkene, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and nitrogen-based nucleophiles. Moreover, by virtue of modified chiral cobalt(II)-salen catalyst, an unprecedented asymmetric version was also achieved with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol. This novel asymmetric radical C&#8722;N bond construction opens a new door for the challenging asymmetric radical hydrofunctionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Platform for Site&#8208;Specific DNA&#8208;Antibody Bioconjugation by Using Benzoylacrylic&#8208;Labelled Oligonucleotides</title>

BA&#8208;PFP is a simple and practical reagent that enables preparation of a range of diverse site&#8208;specific, homogenous DNA&#8208;protein/antibody bioconjugates under mild conditions. The generated constructs can be conveniently characterized by an optimized LC&#8208;MS method and utilized as probes for cell imaging using fluorescence or super&#8208;resolution DNA&#8208;PAINT microscopy.







Abstract
Many bioconjugation strategies for DNA oligonucleotides and antibodies suffer limitations, such as site&#8208;specificity, stoichiometry and hydrolytic instability of the conjugates, which makes them unsuitable for biological applications. Here, we report a new platform for the preparation of DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates with a simple benzoylacrylic acid pentafluorophenyl ester reagent. Benzoylacrylic&#8208;labelled oligonucleotides prepared with this reagent can be site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a range of proteins and antibodies through accessible cysteine residues. The homogeneity of the prepared DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates was confirmed by a new LC&#8208;MS protocol and the bioconjugate probes were used in fluorescence or super&#8208;resolution microscopy cell imaging experiments. This work demonstrates the versatility and robustness of our bioconjugation protocol that gives site&#8208;specific, well&#8208;defined and plasma&#8208;stable DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates for biological applications.

The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) of amphiphilic oligomers in aqueous medium is presented. Azobenzene&#8208;derived oligophosphates undergo morphological transformation upon light&#8208;triggered isomerization. In a reversible process, sheet&#8208;like SPs are switched to toroid&#8208;shaped objects by changing the configuration of the building blocks.







Abstract
An amphiphilic phosphodiester&#8208;linked azobenzene trimer has been exploited in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers. The trimer can reversibly undergo thermal and photoisomerization between Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers. Its self&#8208;assembly properties in aqueous medium have been investigated by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, demonstrating that E&#8208; and Z&#8208;azobenzene trimers form supramolecular nanosheets and toroidal nanostructures, respectively. By virtue of the E/Z photoisomerization of the azobenzene units, the two different supramolecular morphologies can be switched by photoirradiation. The findings pave a way towards stimuli&#8208;responsive, water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers which hold great promise in the development of smart functional materials.

         <title>Characterizing the Conformational Distribution in an Amorphous Film of an Organic Emitter and Its Application in a &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>

         <dc:description>
Until now, the influence of the conformational distribution on the photophysics and device performance of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has not been clear. Herein, conformational populations in disordered solid states are quantitatively measured for the first time. A high&#8208;performance &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; OLED with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% is achieved.







Abstract
The conformational distribution and mutual interconversion of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters significantly affect the exciton utilization. However, their influence on the photophysics in amorphous film states is still not known due to the lack of a suitable quantitative analysis method. Herein, we used temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy to quantitatively measure the relative populations of the conformations of a TADF emitter for the first time. We further propose a new concept of &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; for realizing high&#8208;efficiency nondoped OLEDs. Interestingly, this &#8220;compositionally&#8221; pure film actually behaves as a film with a dopant (quasi&#8208;equatorial form) in a matrix (quasi&#8208;axial form). The concentration&#8208;induced quenching that may occur at high concentrations is thus expected to be effectively relieved. The &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; OLED prepared with the newly developed TADF emitter TP2P&#8208;PXZ as a neat emitting layer realizes a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% and neglectable efficiency roll&#8208;off.

Reversible solid transformation between solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30 and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30a has been unveiled by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, microporous HOF&#8208;30a enables the selective adsorption of propyne over propylene according to single&#8208;component sorption and breakthrough experiments. The preferred propyne location in HOF has also been identified by SCXRD test.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine with the help of different solvents provides isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;30). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals HOF&#8208;30 possesses 3D ten&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia nets connected by two kinds of hydrogen bonds, namely solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers. Degassing treatment for HOF&#8208;30 yields HOF&#8208;30a with 3D ten&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia nets but linked with sole carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers.

         <title>Back Cover: Defying Thermodynamics: Stabilization of Alane Within Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Reversible Hydrogen Storage (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 49/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 26000-26000, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster of alane (AlH3) stabilized by coordination to nitrogen binding sites within the nanopores of a bipyridine&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine framework, CTF&#8208;bipy, is shown on the cover image. In their Research Article on page&#8197;25815, Vitalie Stavila, Mark&#8197;D. Allendorf, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how the resulting AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipy material releases hydrogen at temperatures as low as 95&#8201;&#176;C with full decomposition at 250&#8201;&#176;C. The hydride can be regenerated at 60&#8201;&#176;C under 700&#8197;bar hydrogen, a pressure that is more than an order of magnitude lower compared to that required to hydrogenate bulk aluminum.

A core&#8211;shell structure based on a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) and an upconversion nanoparticle is constructed by Tian&#8208;Fu Liu et&#8197;al. as described in their Communication on page&#8197;25701. The upconversion nanoparticle &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared irradiation into visible light, which excites the HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; to achieve photothermal and photodynamic bacterial inhibition. The cover picture by Bai&#8208;Tong Liu illustrates the structure behaving like a Chinese lantern, in which the core&#8211;shell configuration delivers brightness and happiness.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Double Proton Transfer Across a Table: The Formic Acid Dimer&#8211;Fluorobenzene Complex (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 49/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25999-25999, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With fluorobenzene as a neighboring molecule, the protons of the formic acid dimer can still switch through quantum tunneling as they do in the pure formic acid dimer. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, Weixing Li, Denis&#8197;S. Tikhonov, and Melanie Schnell reveal the following mechanism in their Communication on page&#8197;25674: The neighboring fluorobenzene does not affect the reaction barrier but decreases the tunneling rate of the double&#8208;proton transfer of the formic acid dimer. The molecular view on the environment reorganization in this proton&#8208;transfer reaction is a step towards understanding these reactions in a complex environment.

Insulin secretion from &#946;&#8208;cells in intact islets can now be recorded together with calcium signal and organelles. In their Research Article on page&#8197;25846, Zhixing Chen and co&#8208;workers developed a new class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with minimal phototoxicity. Tailored for 4D, long&#8208;term, and multiple&#8208;color recording of Zn2+/insulin co&#8208;secretion in &#946;&#8208;cells and islets, the new probes promise to unveil the spatial&#8208;temporal regulation of islet endocrinology.

         <title>Electrophilic Aminating Agents in Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25640-25666, December 1, 2021. </description>

This Review outlines the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis. A wide range of C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming methods are highlighted, including polar, radical and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes.







Abstract
Classical amination methods involve the reaction of a nitrogen nucleophile with an electrophilic carbon center; however, in recent years, umpoled strategies have gained traction where the nitrogen source acts as an electrophile. A wide range of electrophilic aminating agents are now available, and these underpin a range of powerful C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming processes. In this Review, we highlight the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis.

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;Metal Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25624-25638, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted worldwide attention owing to the high energy density of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Nevertheless, the actual energy density of LMBs is often inferior to that of Li&#8208;ion batteries. This Review describes crucial parameters of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs, summarizes the recent advances in electrolyte systems for practical LMBs, and provides new perspectives for the design of novel electrolytes for LMBs.







Abstract
Given the limitations inherent in current intercalation&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries, much research attention has focused on potential successors to Li&#8208;ion batteries such as lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries. In order to realize the potential of these batteries, the use of metallic lithium as the anode is essential. However, there are severe safety hazards associated with the growth of Li dendrites, and the formation of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; during cycles leads to the inevitable loss of active Li, which in the end is undoubtedly detrimental to the actual energy density of Li&#8208;metal batteries. For Li&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions, a low negative/positive ratio (N/P ratio), a electrolyte/cathode ratio (E/C ratio) along with a high&#8208;voltage cathode is prerequisite. In this Review, we summarize the development of new electrolyte systems for Li&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions, revisit the design criteria of advanced electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries and provide perspectives on future development of electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.

Chemistry is central to addressing the challenges of human security in today's world, but surprisingly its role and contributions have not yet been explicitly defined. In this Essay, the repositioning of chemistry in this context is seen to present a powerful opportunity for its renewal as a science for the benefit of society. Chemists will need to play new roles and engage more directly and dynamically at the interface of science, society and policy.







Abstract
Human security, defined as &#8220;freedom from want and fear and freedom to live in dignity&#8221;, provides an overarching concept to address threats to human security dimensions such as health, food, economics, the environment and sustainable development, while placing the individual at the centre of attention. Chemistry is central to addressing these challenges, but surprisingly its role and contributions to human security have hitherto not been explicitly set out. This article situates chemistry in the human security framework, highlighting areas where chemistry knowledge, methods and products are vital. It underscores three complementary facets: 1)&#8197;chemistry contributes to many dimensions of human security, but needs to do much more in the light of oncoming global challenges; 2)&#8197;the human security framing illuminates areas where chemistry itself needs to adapt to contribute better, by intensification of current approaches and/or by building or strengthening chemistry tools, skills and competencies; and 3)&#8197;repositioning as central to human security affords chemistry a powerful opportunity to refresh itself as a science for the benefit of society&#8212;and it will need to engage more directly and dynamically at the interface of science, society and policy in order to do so.

         <title>Reconfigurable Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Lattices: Static and Dynamic Angle Control</title>

Branching orientation control of four&#8208;arm junction lattices can be achieved by branch point sequences or by enforcing struts.







Abstract
Branched DNA motifs serve as the basic construction elements for all synthetic DNA nanostructures. However, precise control of branching orientation remains a key challenge to further heighten the overall structural order. In this study, we use two strategies to control the branching orientation. The first one is based on immobile Holliday junctions which employ specific nucleotide sequences at the branch points which dictate their orientation. The second strategy is to use angle&#8208;enforcing struts to fix the branching orientation with flexible spacers at the branch points. We have also demonstrated that the branching orientation control can be achieved dynamically, either by canonical Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing or non&#8208;canonical nucleobase interactions (e.g., i&#8208;motif and G&#8208;quadruplex). With precise angle control and feedback from the chemical environment, these results will enable novel DNA nanomechanical sensing devices, and precisely&#8208;ordered three&#8208;dimensional architectures.

         <title>Bis(perfluoropinacolato)silane: A Neutral Silane Lewis Superacid Activates Si&#8722;F Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25799-25803, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Si&#8208;based Lewis superacid was synthesized by using highly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoropinacolato substituents. The formed silane was obtained as the acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct and comprehensively characterized. The reaction with Et3SiF led to fluoride abstraction yielding the anionic fluorosilicate and the acetonitrile stabilized silylium ion. Catalysis screenings demonstrated high activity in Lewis acid catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Despite the earth abundance and easy availability of silicon, only few examples of isolable neutral silicon centered Lewis superacids are precedent in the literature. To approach the general drawbacks of limited solubility and unselective deactivation pathways, we introduce a Lewis superacid, based on perfluorinated pinacol substituents. The compound is easily synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale as the corresponding acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct 1&#8901;(MeCN) and was fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SC&#8208;XRD) and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations. Lewis acidity investigations by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and fluoride abstraction experiments indicate a Lewis superacidic nature. The challenging Si&#8722;F bond activation of Et3SiF is realized and promising catalytic properties are demonstrated, consolidating the potential applicability of silicon centered Lewis acids in synthetic catalysis.

         <title>Electron Localization and Lattice Strain Induced by Surface Lithium Doping Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of Formate from CO2</title>

A surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped SnLi catalyst prepared by controlled electrochemical lithiation presented an outstanding partial current density of &#8722;1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of formate production, due to the local electron localization and lattice strain on the Sn surface. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed a high power density and an excellent stability of &gt;800 cycles.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 conversion to formate is a promising approach for reducing CO2 level and obtaining value&#8208;added chemicals, but its partial current density is still insufficient to meet the industrial demands. Herein, we developed a surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped tin (s&#8208;SnLi) catalyst by controlled electrochemical lithiation. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Li dopants introduced electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface, thus enhancing both activity and selectivity of the CO2 electroreduction to formate. The s&#8208;SnLi electrocatalyst exhibited one of the best CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate performances, with a partial current density of &#8722;1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for producing formate and a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed one of the highest power densities of 1.24&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding stability of &gt;800 cycles. Our work suggests a promising approach to incorporate electron localization and lattice strain for the catalytic sites to achieve efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate electrosynthesis toward potential commercialization.

         <title>Biosynthetic Studies of Phomopsins Unveil Posttranslational Installation of Dehydroamino Acids by UstYa Family Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25729-25734, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the fungal ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide phomopsin was elucidated by gene inactivation experiments. Notably, chlorination by tyrosinase&#8208;like enzyme PhomQ1 and desaturation of amino acid moieties by UstYa family (DUF3328) proteins PhomYc/Yd/Ye were uncovered. Besides the known function of UstYa homologues, this study unveiled the remarkable functional diversity of these fungi&#8208;specific proteins.







Abstract
UstYa family proteins (DUF3328) are widely and specifically distributed in fungi. They are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and nonribosomal peptides, and possibly catalyze various reactions, including oxidative cyclization and chlorination. In this study, we focused on phomopsin&#8197;A, a fungal RiPP consisting of unique nonproteinogenic amino acids. Gene knockout experiments demonstrated that three UstYa homologues, phomYc, phomYd, and phomYe, are essential for the desaturation of amino acid moieties, showing unprecedented function among UstYa family proteins. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that their amino acid sequences are highly diverged and that most remain uncharacterized, paving the way for genome mining of fungal metabolites with unique modifications.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Ionic Liquids for the Fabrication of Ionogel Films and Patterns</title>

Chemical vapor deposition of an ionic liquid allows the formation of ionogel thin films and microdrops in high resolution. The non&#8208;volatile ionic liquid is formed on a surface by reaction of two non&#8208;volatile precursors. A broad range of applications will benefit from this new &#8220;IL&#8208;CVD&#8221; approach, which enables the fabrication of microdevices.







Abstract
Film deposition and high&#8208;resolution patterning of ionic liquids (ILs) remain a challenge, despite a broad range of applications that would benefit from this type of processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ILs. The IL&#8208;CVD method is based on the formation of a non&#8208;volatile IL through the reaction of two vaporized precursors. Ionogel micropatterns can be easily obtained via the combination of IL&#8208;CVD and standard photolithography, and the resulting microdrop arrays can be used as microreactors. The IL&#8208;CVD approach will facilitate leveraging the properties of ILs in a range of applications and microfabricated devices.

         <title>Construction of Function&#8208;Oriented Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructures in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsive Bacterial Inhibition</title>

In this study, core&#8211;shell heterostructures of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were fabricated via a stepwise ligand&#8208;grafting method. The UCNP &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation into visible ranges, which can further excite the HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; to achieve near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photothermal and photodynamic bacterial inhibition.







Abstract
Exploration of effective ways to integrate various functional species into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is critically important for their applications but highly challenging. In this study, according to the &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; strategy, core&#8211;shell heterostructure of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and HOFs was fabricated for the first time via a ligand&#8208;grafting stepwise method. The UCNPs &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (980&#8197;nm) into visible light (540&#8197;nm and 653&#8197;nm), which further excites the perylenediimide&#8208;based HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; through resonance energy transfer. In this way, the nanocomposite inherits the high porosity, excellent photothermal and photodynamic efficiency, NIR photoresponse from two parent materials, achieving intriguing NIR&#8208;responsive bacterial inhibition toward Escherichia coli. This study may shed light on the design of functional HOF&#8208;based composite materials, not only enriching the HOF library but also broadening the horizon of their potential applications.

In this study, according to the &#8220;bottle-around-ship&#8221; strategy, core&#8211;shell heterostructure of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and HOFs was fabricated for the first time via a ligand-grafting stepwise method. The UCNPs &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near-infrared (NIR) irradiation (980&#8197;nm) into visible light (540&#8197;nm and 653&#8197;nm), which further excites the perylenediimide-based HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; through resonance energy transfer. In this way, the nanocomposite inherits the high porosity, excellent photothermal and photodynamic efficiency, NIR photoresponse from two parent materials, achieving intriguing NIR-responsive bacterial inhibition toward &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. This study may shed light on the design of functional HOF-based composite materials, not only enriching the HOF library but also broadening the horizon of their potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoroallylation of Aryl Halides and Pseudo Halides with Difluoroallylboron Reagents in High Regioselectivity</title>

The coupling of a difluoroallylboronate with aryl and heteroaryl halides and triflates provides a convenient and broadly applicable synthesis of difluoroallylarenes. The difluoroallyl boron reagent is formed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of the inexpensive reagent 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene, and the products undergo a wide range of reactions to a series of difluoro&#8208;substituted analogs of common biologically valuable building blocks.







Abstract
We report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl halides and pseudo halides with 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronates in high yield with high regioselectivity, and we report the preparation of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronate reactants by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of inexpensive gaseous 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene with bis(pinacolato)diboron. The gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl and heteroaryl bromides proceeds with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Pd]) and tolerates a wide range of functional groups, including primary alcohols, secondary amines, ethers, ketones, esters, amides, aldehydes, nitriles, halides, and nitro groups. This protocol extends to aryl iodides, chlorides, and triflates, as well as substituted difluoroallyl boronates, providing a versatile synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroallyl arenes that we show to be valuable intermediates to a series of fluorinated building blocks.

         <title>General Synthesis of Multiple&#8208;Cores@Multiple&#8208;Shells Hollow Composites and Their Application to Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25719-25722, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable synthesis strategy is developed to fabricate multiple&#8208;cores@multiple&#8208;shells composite, which is applicable for diverse cores and shells. The cores and shells could be tuned to be homogeneous or heterogeneous with the number of cores and shells well controlled. Such a structure shows great promise for superior energy storage, multi&#8208;drug co&#8208;delivery and sequential release, and tandem catalysis applications.







Abstract
Rational nanostructure design has proved fruitful in addressing the bottlenecks of diverse fields. Especially hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) have stood out due to their temporal&#8211;spatial ordering mass transfer and buffering effect. Localizing multiple cores in a HoMS is highly desired, which could endow it with more fascinating properties. However, such a structure has been barely reported due to the highly challenging fabrication. Here, we develop a controllable synthesis strategy to realize such a structure, which is applicable for diverse cores and shells. Additionally, cores and shells could be tuned to be homogeneous or heterogeneous, with the core and shell number well controlled. In&#8197;situ TEM analysis verifies that the inner shell confines the expansion orientation of cores, while the outer shell maintains a stable interface. In addition to energy storage, such structure is also promising for multi&#8208;drug co&#8208;delivery and sequential responsive release as well as tandem catalysis applications.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Growth of Preferred&#8208;Oriented MOF Thin Film on Nanowire Array for High&#8208;Performance Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25758-25761, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, as well as precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on a nanowire array substrate. Compared to 2D thin films, the Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film shows one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD and fastest response speed among all reported chemiresistive NH3 sensing materials at RT.







Abstract
High&#8208;quality MOF thin films with high orientation and controlled thickness are extremely desired for applications. However, they have been only successfully fabricated on flat substrates. Those MOF 2D thin films are limited by low exposed area and slow mass transport. To overcome these issues, MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, and precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on nanowire array substrate for the first time. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film is superior to corresponding 2D thin films and showed one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD, and fastest response among all reported chemiresistive NH3 sensing materials at RT. This work provides a feasible approach to grow preferred&#8208;oriented 3D MOF thin film, offering new perspectives for constructing MOF&#8208;based heterostructures for advanced applications.

A novel procedure on carbonylative trifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. Catalyzed by a copper catalyst, carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes with Togni&#8208;CF3 and nitrogen (or oxygen) nucleophiles occurred successfully. A variety of valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amides, esters and acids were obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Ethylene gas can also be successfully applied.







Abstract
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative trifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. A broad range of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated carboxylic acid derivatives were prepared in moderate to excellent yields from simple alkenes with excellent regioselectivity. It is noteworthy that ethylene gas, as the simplest olefin, can also be applied directly to obtain &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amides and ester. This transformation presents the first example on carbonylative trifluoromethylation of alkenes.

         <title>Highly Perfluorinated Covalent Triazine Frameworks Derived from a Low&#8208;Temperature Ionothermal Approach Towards Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>

Highly perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks with nanoporous architecture are fabricated via a low temperature ionothermal pathway taking advantage of the superior catalytic activity of Lewis superacids and demonstrate good performance in electroreduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks (F&#8208;CTFs) have shown unique features and attractive performance in separation and catalysis. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art F&#8208;CTFs synthesized via the ZnCl2&#8208;promoted procedure have quite low fluorine contents due to C&#8722;F bond cleavage induced by chloride (a Lewis base) and the harsh conditions deployed (400&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C).

&lt;p&gt;Highly perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks with nanoporous architecture are fabricated via a low temperature ionothermal pathway taking advantage of the superior catalytic activity of Lewis superacids and demonstrate good performance in electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks (F-CTFs) have shown unique features and attractive performance in separation and catalysis. However, state-of-the-art F-CTFs synthesized via the ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-promoted procedure have quite low fluorine contents due to C&#8722;F bond cleavage induced by chloride (a Lewis base) and the harsh conditions deployed (400&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C). Fabricating F-CTFs with high fluorine contents (&amp;gt;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%) remains challenging. Herein, we present a low-temperature ionothermal approach (275&#8201;&#176;C) to prepare F-CTFs, which is achieved via polymerization of tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFPN) over the Lewis superacids, e.g., zinc triflimide [Zn(NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] without side reactions. With low catalyst loading (equimolar), F-CTFs are afforded with high fluorine content (31&#8197;wt&#8201;%), surface area up to 367&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and micropores around 1.1&#8197;nm. The highly hydrophobic F-CTF-1 exhibits good capability to boost electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO, with faradaic efficiency of 95.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and high current density (&#8722;141&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) surpassing most of the metal-free electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Based Electron Donators to Stabilize and Activate Ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles for Efficient Hydrogen Atom Dissociation and Gas Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25766-25770, December 1, 2021. </description>

Co/NC heterojunctions are used as &#8220;solid ligands&#8221; to control the growth of as&#8208;supported ultrafine Pt nanoparticles via donating electrons. Ultrafine Pt nanoparticles with enhanced electron density promote the proton capture from electrolyte to catalyst surface, the dissociation of Pt&#8722;H bonds and successive release of H2 molecules from the Pt surface.







Abstract
Platinum (Pt) is the most effective bench&#8208;marked catalyst for producing renewable and clean hydrogen energy by electrochemical water splitting. There is demand for high HER catalytic activity to achieve efficient utilization and minimize the loading of Pt in catalysts. In this work, we significantly boost the HER mass activity of Pt nanoparticles in Ptx/Co to 8.3 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C by using Co/NC heterojunctions as a heterogeneous version of electron donors. The highly coupled interfaces between Co/NC and Pt metal enrich the electron density of Pt nanoparticles to facilitate the adsorption of H+, the dissociation of Pt&#8722;H bonds and H2 release, giving the lowest HER overpotential of 6.9&#8197;mV vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid among reported HER electrocatalysts. Given the easy scale&#8208;up synthesis due to the stabilization of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles by Co/NC solid ligands, Ptx/Co can even be a promising substitute for commercial Pt/C for practical applications.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Mediated N2&#8208;Splitting and Functionalization in the Presence of a Coordinated Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25804-25808, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molybdenum pincer for N2&#8208;splitting and functionalization is reported. The N2&#8208;cleavage affords a molybdenum nitrido complex and proceeds in the presence of a coordinated alkyne, that is, in the presence of a weaker C&#8801;C bond. The spatially and rationally restricted alkyne moiety is also tolerated during N&#8208;functionalization of the former nitrido complex.







Abstract
A new [PCCP]&#8208;coordinated molybdenum platform comprising a coordinated alkyne was employed for the cleavage of molecular dinitrogen. The coordinated &#951;2&#8208;alkyne was left unaffected during this reduction. DFT calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via an initially generated terminal N2&#8208;complex, which is converted to a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;(&#951;1:&#951;1)&#8208;N2&#8208;bridged intermediate prior to N&#8722;N bond cleavage. Protonation, alkylation and acylation of the resulting molybdenum nitrido complex led to the corresponding N&#8208;functionalized imido complexes. Upon oxidation of the N&#8208;acylated imido derivative in MeCN, a fumaronitrile fragment was built up via C&#8722;C coupling of MeCN to afford a dinuclear molybdenum complex. The key finding that the strong N&#8801;N bond may be cleaved in the presence of a weaker, but spatially constrained C&#8801;C bond contradicts the widespread paradigm that coordinated alkynes are in general more reactive than gaseous N2.

         <title>An Integrated Photoelectrochemical Nanotool for Intracellular Drug Delivery and Evaluation of Treatment Effect</title>

An integrated photocathodic nanotool was fabricated for dual&#8208;functional intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of cellular oxidative stress in single live cell.







Abstract
With reduced background and high sensitivity, photoelectrochemistry (PEC) may be applied as an intracellular nanotool and open a new technological direction of single&#8208;cell study. Nevertheless, the present palette of single&#8208;cell tools lacks such a PEC&#8208;oriented solution. Here a dual&#8208;functional photocathodic single&#8208;cell nanotool capable of direct electroosmotic intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of oxidative stress is devised by engineering a target&#8208;specific organic molecule/NiO/Ni film at the tip of a nanopipette. Specifically, the organic molecule probe serves simultaneously as the biorecognition element and sensitizer to synergize with p&#8208;type NiO. Upon intracellular delivery at picoliter level, the oxidative stress effect will cause structural change of the organic probe, switching its optical absorption and altering the cathodic response. This work has revealed the potential of PEC single&#8208;cell nanotool and extended the boundary of current single&#8208;cell electroanalysis.

         <title>Double Proton Transfer Across a Table: The Formic Acid Dimer&#8211;Fluorobenzene Complex</title>

Proton transfer via tunneling is a fundamental quantum&#8208;mechanical phenomenon. We report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in the complex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The experiment indicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked structure. The fluorobenzene environment slows down the proton transfer in this complex compared to the free formic acid dimer.







Abstract
Proton transfer via tunneling is a fundamental quantum&#8208;mechanical phenomenon. We report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in the complex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The assignment of the spectrum indicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked structure. Each rotational transition of the parent isotopologue exhibits splitting. Isotopic substitution experiments show that the spectral splitting results from double&#8208;proton transfer tunneling in the formic acid dimer. Presence of fluorobenzene as a neighboring molecule does not quench the double proton transfer in the formic acid dimer but decreases its tunneling splitting from 341(3)&#8197;MHz to 267.608(1)&#8197;MHz. Calculations suggest that the presence of the weakly bounded fluorobenzene does not influence the activation energy of the proton transfer. The fluorobenzene is reoriented with respect to the formic acid dimer during the course of the reaction, slowing down the proton transfer motion.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced On/Off Switching of the Surfactant Character of the o&#8208;Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) Anion with No Covalent Bond Alteration</title>

Quantum chemistry reveals a photoinduced cisoid to transoid rotation in the o&#8208;cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;, driven by the larger stability of the transoid rotamer in the excited triplet state. The non&#8208;radiative decay, supported by non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics and the absence of signal in fluorescence mapping experiments, allows the thermal recovery of the dominant cisoid arrangement in water solution.







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;) is a well&#8208;known metallacarborane with multiple applications in a variety of fields. In aqueous solution, the cisoid rotamer is the most stable disposition in the ground state. The present work provides theoretical evidence on the possibility to photoinduce the rotation from the cisoid to the transoid rotamer, a conversion that can be reverted when the ground state is repopulated. The non&#8208;radiative decay mechanisms proposed in this work are coherent with the lack of fluorescence observed in 3D fluorescence mapping experiments performed on [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and its derivatives. This phenomenon induced by light has the potential to destruct the vesicles and micelles cisoid [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; typically forms in aqueous solution, which could lead to promising applications, particularly in the field of nanomedicine.

         <title>A Modular Cascade Synthetic Strategy Toward Structurally Constrained Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25695-25700, December 1, 2021. </description>

We developed a novel modular synthetic strategy for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via a cascade reaction. Notably, the obtained BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking.







Abstract
A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs) via a cascade reaction from the readily available ortho&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted diarylalkynes. This domino process involves borylative cyclization, 1,4&#8208;boron migration and successive two&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Two types of sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs bearing B&#8208;doped [4]helicene (1&#8201;a&#8208;1&#8201;i) or BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene (1&#8201;n&#8208;1&#8201;t) and double [4]helicene (1&#8201;u&#8208;1&#8201;v) are constructed by this cascade reaction. Remarkably, this synthetic strategy is characterized by modest yields (20&#8211;50&#8201;%) and broad substrate scope (18 examples) with versatile functional group tolerance. The resultant sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs show good stability under ambient conditions and are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Interestingly enough, BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene 1&#8201;o forms a unique alternating &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer of enantiomers within a helical columnar superstructure, while BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene 1&#8201;u establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking. The synthetic approach reported herein represents a powerful tool for the rapid generation of novel sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs, which are highly attractive for the elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationship and for potential optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Exploiting Configurational Lability in Aza&#8208;Sulfur Compounds for the Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25680-25687, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual stereochemical feature of certain sulfonimidamides, in which tautomeric forms are also enantiomeric, has been exploited to develop a catalytic enantioselective synthesis of alkylated sulfonimidamides. The reactions proceed through a prochiral anionic intermediate to deliver enantiomerically enriched products. A double&#8208;alkylated, cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived catalyst is used as a phase&#8208;transfer catalyst.







Abstract
Methods for establishing the absolute configuration of sulfur&#8208;stereogenic aza&#8208;sulfur derivatives are scarce, often relying on cumbersome protocols and a limited pool of enantioenriched starting materials. We have addressed this by exploiting, for the first time, a feature of sulfonimidamides in which it is possible for tautomeric structures to also be enantiomeric. Such sulfonimidamides can readily generate prochiral ions, which we have exploited in an enantioselective alkylation process. Selectivity is achieved using a readily prepared bis&#8208;quaternized phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The overall process establishes the capability of configurationally labile aza&#8208;sulfur species to be used in asymmetric catalysis.

Control of the silylhalide and solvent, affords selective avenues to the disilylacetal (R3SiOCH2OSiR3), methoxysilane (R3SiOCH3), methyliodide (CH3I) and methane (CH4) under mild conditions. The mechanism is studied by DFT and accounts for the observed selectivity.







Abstract
The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) derived from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and B(C6F5)3 is shown to mediate the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 using H2 as the reductant and a silylhalide as an oxophile. The nature of the products can be controlled with the judicious selection of the silylhalide and the solvent. In this fashion, this metal&#8208;free catalysis affords avenues to the selective formation of the disilylacetal (R3SiOCH2OSiR3), methoxysilane (R3SiOCH3), methyliodide (CH3I) and methane (CH4) under mild conditions. DFT studies illuminate the complexities of the mechanism and account for the observed selectivity.

Heterostructured Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) are rationally designed and fabricated through a two&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;engaged synthetic approach. With the structural and compositional advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows efficient Zn&#8208;ion storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability and ultra&#8208;stable cycle life.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;based oxides have sparked extensive scientific interest for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to the rich abundance, plentiful oxidation states, and high output voltage. However, the further development of Mn&#8208;based oxides is severely hindered by the rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, a two&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;engaged templating strategy has been developed to rationally synthesize heterostructured Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) for stable zinc ion storage. The distinctive composition and hollow heterostructure endow MO&#8211;ZMO HOs with abundant active sites, enhanced electric conductivity, and superior structural stability. By virtue of these advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage of MO&#8211;ZMO HOs mainly originates from the highly reversible Zn2+ insertion/extraction reactions.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Functional Thermoplastic Elastomer with Excellent Mechanical Properties by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Copolymerization of Ethylene and Fluorostyrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25735-25740, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new functionalized thermoplastic elastomer with excellent toughness and efficient elastic recovery has been successfully achieved through the direct copolymerization of E and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;fluorostyrene (oFS/mFS/pFS) using the scandium complex. The DFT simulation reveals that the bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing ligand of the catalytic precursor prefers E propagation to generate long E&#8211;E segments.







Abstract
Herein, we report copolymerizations of ethylene (E) and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;fluorostyrenes (SF=oFS/mFS/pFS) by using quinolyl methylene fluorenyl scandium complex (Flu&#8208;CH2&#8208;Qu)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2. The copolymerizations proceed in a controlled fashion to afford copolymers composed of &#8220;soft&#8221; ethylene&#8208;fluorostyurene (E&#8211;SF) random segments (Tg=&#8722;22.2&#8211;5.1&#8201;&#176;C) and &#8220;hard&#8221; crystalline ethylene&#8211;ethylene (E&#8211;E) segments (Tm=42.3&#8211;130.2&#8201;&#176;C). The copolymers behave like thermoplastic elastomers at room temperature by showing high stress values up to 39.5&#8197;MPa under elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break above 774&#8201;% with elastic recovery over 75&#8201;%. The excellent mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the microphase separation of the nanoscale crystalline E&#8211;E domain from the amorphous E&#8211;SF copolymer matrix proved by AFM, WAXD and SAXS. The mechanism investigation by the density functional theory (DFT) simulation reveals that the steric bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing ligand of the catalytic precursor prefers E propagation to generate long E&#8211;E segments, while the incorporation of SF is thermodynamic control.

         <title>Repurposing &#960; Electrophilic Cyclization/Dealkylation for Group Transfer</title>

Hijacking electrophilic cyclization intermediates allows for a pathway to acyclic tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes with predictable regio&#8208; and stereochemistry. Mechanistic studies indicate concerted thioboration of the alkyne precedes rate&#8208;determining ring opening and investigate the effects of ring&#8208;size and functional groups on reaction selectivity.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled group&#8208;transfer route toward the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes is described. In this route, an electrophilic heterocyclization is followed by ring&#8208;opening group transfer. Specifically, a thioboration reaction transforms readily available alkynyl sulfide precursors into alkenyl boronates and alkenyl sulfides with defined regio&#8208; and stereochemistry in one synthetic step using commercially available B&#8208;chlorocatecholborane (ClBcat). Mechanistic studies identified the likely pathway as proceeding through zwitterionic rather than haloborated intermediates. The regio&#8208; and stereochemistry set in the initial cyclization step is preserved in the final acyclic alkene product, producing alkenes with up to four modifiable substituents with predictable regio&#8208; and stereochemistry. Downstream functionalization reactions showcase the versatility of the substitutions of the resulting alkenes. The mechanistic concept maps onto future reaction designs, given the abundance of known electrophiles and nucleophiles for electrophilic heterocyclization/dealkylation sequences.

Au(SIPr)NTf2 has been identified for the room temperature ATA reaction to afford diverse 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes with 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline as amine and aldehyde and TFE or HFIP as the mediator. A formal synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine and synthetic transformations have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed room temperature allenation of terminal alkynes (ATA) with aldehydes affording 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes with diverse functional groups has been developed by identifying a gold(I) catalyst and an amine. The practicality of this reaction has been demonstrated by a ten gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the synthetic potentials have been demonstrated via various transformations and formal total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine.

&lt;p&gt;Au(SIPr)NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been identified for the room temperature ATA reaction to afford diverse 1,3-disubstituted allenes with 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline as amine and aldehyde and TFE or HFIP as the mediator. A formal synthesis of (&#8722;)-centrolobine and synthetic transformations have been demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gold-catalyzed room temperature allenation of terminal alkynes (ATA) with aldehydes affording 1,3-disubstituted allenes with diverse functional groups has been developed by identifying a gold(I) catalyst and an amine. The practicality of this reaction has been demonstrated by a ten gram-scale synthesis and the synthetic potentials have been demonstrated via various transformations and formal total synthesis of (&#8722;)-centrolobine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the gold catalyst, the aldehyde effect, the fluoroalkyl hydroxyl solvent (TFE or HFIP) and the structure of amine are vital in this room temperature ATA reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring Expansion Toward Enantioenriched Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Benzosiloles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25723-25728, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy for the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles in excellent yields and enantioselectivities enabled by a Ni0/chiral PR3&#8208;catalyst system. Moreover, preliminary studies on the chiroptical properties of silicon&#8208;stereogenic bis&#8208;silicon&#8208;bridged &#960;&#8208;extended systems, which were synthesized by the presented catalysis strategy, are also described.







Abstract
The development of a straightforward strategy to obtain enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles remains a challenging yet appealing synthesis venture due to their potential future application in chiral electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this context, all of the existing methods rely on Rh&#8208;catalyzed systems and are somewhat limited in scope. Herein, we disclose the first Ni0&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion process that enables the preparation of benzosiloles possessing tetraorganosilicon stereocenters in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The presented catalysis strategy is further applied to the asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic bis&#8208;silicon&#8208;bridged &#960;&#8208;extended systems. Preliminary studies reveal that such compounds exhibit fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.

         <title>Cobalt Single Atom Incorporated in Ruthenium Oxide Sphere: A Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for HER and OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly active and stable bifunctional noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial goal for clean and renewable energy, which still remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient and stable catalyst comprising Co single atom incorporated in RuO2 sphere for HER and OER, in which Co single atom in the RuO2 sphere were confirmed by XAS, AC&#8208;STEM, and DFT. This tailoring strategy uses Co single atom to modify the electronic structures of the surrounding Ru atoms and thereby remarkably elevates the electrocatalytic activities. The catalyst requires ultralow overpotentials, 45 mV for HER and 200 mV for OER, to deliver 10 mA/cm2 current density. The theoretical calculations reveal that the energy barriers for HER and OER are lowered after incorporation of cobalt single atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Rhamnolipid Toxin by Redox Liposome Single Impact Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of Rhamnolipid virulence factor produced by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  involved in nosocomial infections is reported by using the redox liposome single impact electrochemistry. Redox liposomes based on 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine as a pure phospholipid and potassium ferrocyanide as an encapsulated redox content are designed for using the interaction of the target toxin with the lipid membrane as a sensing strategy. The electrochemical sensing principle is based on the weakening of the liposomes lipid membrane upon interaction with Rhamnolipid toxin which leads upon impact at an ultramicroelectrode to the breakdown of the liposomes and the release/electrolysis of its encapsulated redox probe. We present as a proof of concept the sensitive and fast sensing of a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid which is detected after less than 30 minutes of incubation with the liposomes, by the appearing of current spikes in the chronoamperometry measurement.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Chiral Polyrotaxane Monolayer with Emergent and Steerable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we propose a mechanically interlocked strategy to achieve 2D chiral polyrotaxane (2D  CPR  ) monolayer with emergent and steerable CPL activity by utilizing &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the chiral wheel and a luminescent dynamic covalent organic framework as 2D polymeric axle. Such methodology, integrating the host&#8208;guest and dynamic covalent chemistry, enabled the direct construction of delaminated 2D  CPR  monolayer with extraordinarily large size (up to tens of micrometers) and simultaneously endowed chirality to the extended 2D  CPR  network to generate CPL activity. Importantly, not only the structure but also the CPL performance of 2D  CPR  network can be further regulated by the feeding amount of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This work demonstrated a monolayered 2D  CPR  with CPL activity for the first time. The insightful structure&#8208;property relationship on the induced CPL will benefit to a deep understanding of the excited&#8208;state chirality of 2D chiral nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Eutectic Crystallization Activates Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we discovered a novel crystallized Zn2+ conductor based on inducing crystallization of high&#8208;entropy, charge&#8208;separated eutectic liquids. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first introduction of the concept of a crystallized eutectic material to achieve dramatically enhanced multivalent&#8208;ion transport properties. This facile strategy may also open up opportunities for designing a wide variety of new solid ionic conductors.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state zinc (Zn) batteries offer a new candidate for emerging applications sensitive to volume, safety and cost. However, current solid polymeric or ceramic electrolyte structures remain poorly conductive for the divalent Zn2+, especially at room temperature. Constructing a heterogeneous interface which allows Zn2+ percolation is a viable option, but this is rarely involved in multivalent systems. Herein, we construct a solid Zn2+&#8208;ion conductor by inducing crystallization of tailored eutectic liquids formed by organic Zn salts and bipolar ligands. High&#8208;entropy eutectic&#8208;networks weaken the ion&#8208;association and form interfacial Zn2+&#8208;percolated channels on the nucleator surfaces, resulting in a solid crystal with exceptional selectivity for Zn2+ transport (t
=0.64) and appreciable Zn2+ conductivity (&#963;
=3.78&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, over 2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional polymers), and finally enabling practical ambient&#8208;temperature Zn/V2O5 metal solid cells. This design principle leveraged by the eutectic solidification affords new insights on the multivalent solid electrochemistry suffering from slow ion migration.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we discovered a novel crystallized Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductor based on inducing crystallization of high-entropy, charge-separated eutectic liquids. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first introduction of the concept of a crystallized eutectic material to achieve dramatically enhanced multivalent-ion transport properties. This facile strategy may also open up opportunities for designing a wide variety of new solid ionic conductors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state zinc (Zn) batteries offer a new candidate for emerging applications sensitive to volume, safety and cost. However, current solid polymeric or ceramic electrolyte structures remain poorly conductive for the divalent Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, especially at room temperature. Constructing a heterogeneous interface which allows Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; percolation is a viable option, but this is rarely involved in multivalent systems. Herein, we construct a solid Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ion conductor by inducing crystallization of tailored eutectic liquids formed by organic Zn salts and bipolar ligands. High-entropy eutectic-networks weaken the ion-association and form interfacial Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-percolated channels on the nucleator surfaces, resulting in a solid crystal with exceptional selectivity for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
=0.64) and appreciable Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;
=3.78&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#8201;&#176;C, over 2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional polymers), and finally enabling practical ambient-temperature Zn/V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; metal solid cells. This design principle leveraged by the eutectic solidification affords new insights on the multivalent solid electrochemistry suffering from slow ion migration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocyclic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads Composed of a Perylene Bisimide Dye Surrounded by Oligothiophene Bridges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of a perylene bisimide dye bridged by one or two quinquethiophene units are described. The compounds show panchromatic light absorption in the UV/Vis spectrum, multiple reversible redox processes, and a highly efficient charge separation by photoinduced electron transfer.







Abstract
Two macrocyclic architectures comprising oligothiophene strands that connect the imide positions of a perylene bisimide (PBI) dye have been synthesized via a platinum&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling strategy. The crystal structure of the double bridged PBI reveals all syn&#8208;arranged thiophene units that completely enclose the planar PBI chromophore via a 12&#8208;membered macrocycle. The target structures were characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, as well as cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry. Both donor&#8211;acceptor dyads show ultrafast F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer and photoinduced electron transfer, thereby leading to extremely low fluorescence quantum yields even in the lowest polarity cyclohexane solvent.

         <title>Chemoselective and Diastereoselective Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Nucleoside Analogues by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Furanosyl Acetates with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile synthesis of C&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues from readily available furanose acetates and aryl iodides is disclosed. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling showed good functional&#8208;group compatibility and excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. The high chemoselectivity with respect to aryl iodides enabled the efficient preparation of a variety of C&#8208;aryl halide furanosides suitable for various post&#8208;functionalization reactions.







Abstract
Canonical nucleosides are vulnerable to enzymatic and chemical degradation, yet their stable mimics&#8212;C&#8208;aryl nucleosides&#8212;have demonstrated potential utility in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology, although current synthetic methods remain limited in terms of scope and selectivity. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling to prepare C&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues from readily available furanosyl acetates and aryl iodides. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed modular approach is characterized by mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity, and high functional&#8208;group compatibility. The exclusive chemoselectivity with respect to the aryl iodide enables efficient preparation of a variety of C&#8208;aryl halide furanosides suitable for various downstream transformations. The practicality of this transformation is demonstrated through the synthesis of a potent analogue of a naturally occurring NF&#8208;&#954;B activator.

         <title>Five&#8208;Fold Symmetric Pentaindolo&#8208; and Pentakis(benzoindolo)Corannulenes: Unique Structural Dynamics Derived from the Combination of Helical and Bowl Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes with five azahelicene units were prepared and their structural dynamics were studied experimentally and theoretically. This motif contains many conformational isomers owing to the helical and bowl chiralities. The interconversion networks were explored by using GRRM17 program, which revealed that the co&#8208;existing corannulene and azahelicene moieties lower the activation energy barriers for some isomerization processes.







Abstract
Peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes bearing quintuple azahelicene units, 10 and 11, were prepared and their dynamic behaviors were studied experimentally and theoretically. The fused corannulenes were synthesized from sym&#8208;pentabromocorannulene in three steps. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis for 10 displayed a conformer possessing a P(M) bowl chirality and a PPMPM (PMPMM) helical chirality, which was found to be the most stable conformer(s). Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements of 10 and 11 revealed that their structural isomers can be interconvertible in solution, depending on the steric congestion around the helical scaffolds. Automated search for conformers in the equilibrium and transition states by Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method revealed their interconversion networks, including bowl&#8208;inversion and helical&#8208;inversion. This analysis indicated that the co&#8208;existing corannulene and azahelicene moieties influence the conformational dynamics, which leads to mitigation of the activation energy barriers for isomerization.

         <title>Active Exsolved Metal&#8211;Oxide Interfaces in Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Ceria Monoliths for Efficient and Durable CH4/CO2 Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we created active metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths with in situ exsolved single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles and show efficient and durable CH4/CO2 reforming at a relatively low temperature of 450&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 provides an attractive route to convert greenhouse gas into syngas; however, the resistance to sintering and coking of catalyst remains a fundamental challenge at high operation temperatures. Here we create active and durable metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) CeO2 monoliths with in situ exsolved single&#8208;crystalline (SC) Ni particles and show efficient dry reforming of CH4/CO2 at temperatures as low as 450&#8201;&#176;C. We show the excellent and durable performance with &#8776;20&#8201;% of CH4 conversion and &#8776;30&#8201;% of CO2 conversion even in a continuous operation of 240&#8197;hours. The well&#8208;defined active metal&#8211;oxide interfaces, created by exsolving SC Ni nanoparticles from PSC NixCe1&#8722;xO2 to anchor them on PSC CeO2 scaffolds, prevent nanoparticle sintering and enhance the coking resistance due to the stronger metal&#8211;support interactions. Our work would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the technique of creating active and durable metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in PSC monoliths could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.

         <title>Photoinitiated anti&#8208;Hydropentafluorosulfanylation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of new (Z)&#8208;(1&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanes was performed via the photoinitiated anti&#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes. The reaction of SF5Cl with 24 substrates in the presence of (TMS)3SiH as a H&#8208;atom donor gave access to the undocumented Z&#8208;isomer. The origins of this unusual selectivity were investigated by DFT calculations, which provide a better understanding of the geometry and reactivity of SF5&#8208;substituted vinylic radicals.







Abstract
A photoinitiated anti&#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes using SF5Cl and (TMS)3SiH as the hydrogen atom donor is reported. This transformation generates selectively (Z)&#8208;(1&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanes (Z:E : &gt;85:15), thus allowing the preparation of this previously unknown geometrical isomer. DFT calculations highlight that the selectivity is due to the intrinsic preference of SF5&#8208;substituted vinylic radicals to adopt a cis geometry, and to increased steric contacts during the transition structures leading to the minor (E)&#8208;products.

         <title>Density&#8208;Dependent Emission Colors from a Conformation&#8208;Switching Chromophore in Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color emission is achieved from a single fluorescent component by incorporating it into polyurethane matrices. Facilitated by the chemical structure of polyurethanes, the emission color could be modulated from blue to red by simply tuning the density of the chromophores, via either synthetic or physical approaches.







Abstract
Achieving full&#8208;color emission from a single chromophore is not only highly desirable from practical considerations, but also greatly challenging for fundamental research. Herein, we demonstrated the density&#8208;dependent emission colors from a single boron&#8208;containing chromophore, from which multi&#8208;color fluorescent polyurethanes were prepared as well. Originating from its switchable molecular conformations, the emission color of the chromophore was found to be governed by the packing density and strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding interactions. The chromophore was incorporated into polyurethanes to achieve full&#8208;color emitting materials; the emission color was only dependent on the chromophore density and could be tuned via synthetic approach by controlling the compositions. The emission colors could also be modulated by physical approaches, including by swelling/deswelling process, compression under high pressure, and even blending the fluorescent polyurethane with non&#8208;emitting ones.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based Crosslinked Polymer Networks for Highly Effective Iodine Adsorption from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based crosslinked polymer networks was synthesized via Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara polycondensation. One system, C[4]P&#8208;BTP, was found to be highly effective for iodine capture from water with an uptake capacity of 3.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and quick kinetics (kobs=7.814&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8197;min&#8722;1). Flow&#8208;through adsorption experiments revealed that C[4]P&#8208;BTP was able to remove 93.2&#8201;% of iodine from an aqueous phase with a flow rate of 1&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1.







Abstract
A series of calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based crosslinked polymer networks designed for iodine capture is reported. These materials were prepared by Sonogashira coupling of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;alkynylphenyl)calix[4]pyrrole with bishalide building blocks with different electronic properties and molecular sizes. Despite their low Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas, iodine vapor adsorption capacities of up to 3.38&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 were seen, a finding ascribed to the presence of a large number of effective sorption sites including macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;rich cavities, aryl units, and alkyne groups within the material. One particular system, C[4]P&#8208;BTP, was found to be highly effective at iodine capture from water (uptake capacity of 3.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 from a concentrated aqueous KI/I2 solution at ambient temperature). Fast capture kinetics (kobs=7.814&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1) were seen. Flow&#8208;through adsorption experiments revealed that C[4]P&#8208;BTP is able to remove 93.2&#8201;% of iodine from an aqueous source phase at a flow rate of 1&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1.

         <title>Quantifying Intracellular Single Vesicular Catecholamine Concentration with Open Carbon Nanopipettes to Unveil the Effect of L&#8208;DOPA on Vesicular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single vesicular catecholamine concentrations in the intracellular environment were calculated based on the narrowed distributions of vesicular content and size obtained with 100&#8197;nm open CNPs. We have shown that vesicular dense core size and content increase while catecholamine concentrations are essentially unchanged after exposure to L&#8208;DOPA.







Abstract
Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of exocytosis is essential for uncovering the pathologies of neuronal disorders and developing related pharmaceuticals. In this work intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC) measurements with different&#8208;sized (50&#8211;500&#8197;nm radius) open carbon nanopipettes (CNPs) were performed to quantify the vesicular content and release kinetics of specific vesicle populations grouped by orifice sizes. Intracellular vesicles with radius below 100&#8197;nm were captured and narrowed between 50 and 100&#8197;nm. On the basis of this, single vesicular catecholamine concentrations in the intracellular environment were quantified as 0.23&#8211;1.1&#8197;M. Our results with L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)&#8208;exposure indicate that L&#8208;DOPA regulates exocytosis by increasing the dense core size and vesicular content while catecholamine concentrations did not show obvious alterations. These were all achieved simultaneously and relatively noninvasively with open CNPs.

         <title>Divergent and Modular Synthesis of Terpenoid Scaffolds via a AuI Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot sequence involving an exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a Lewis acid gold(I) catalyzed cyclization has allowed access to three complex polycyclic scaffolds. Structural diversity is obtained by varying solvent and the ligand of the gold(I) catalyst. An additional Diels&#8211;Alder step generates tetracyclic cores possessing up to 5 stereocenters.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot cascade sequence to generate synthetically challenging polycyclic scaffolds is reported utilizing a novel Lewis acid gold catalyst for the key cyclization step, enabling the divergent synthesis of both 6,6,5&#8208;tricyclic and 6,6,6,5&#8208;tetracyclic cores through both ligand and reaction condition control. We have combined the intrinsic complexity and stereoselectivity of cycloadditions with the electronic and steric properties of gold complexes to selectively generate complex polycyclic scaffolds in a single operation.

We have combined the intrinsic complexity and stereoselectivity of cycloadditions with the electronic and steric properties of gold complexes to selectively generate complex polycyclic scaffolds in a single operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Dye&#8208;Triplet&#8208;Sensitized Upconversion Emission Through the Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in CsLu2F7:Yb/Er Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of upconversion (UC) nanocrystals of CsLu2F7:Yb/Er are developed to achieve efficient UC through triplet sensitization of NIR dye IR808, resulting in a 1309&#8208;fold enhancement in UC luminescence intensity and a more than 180&#8208;fold improvement of the absolute UC quantum yield over bare counterparts. Sensitive detection of intracellular ClO&#8722; is demonstrated by virtue of the 808&#8208;nm/980&#8208;nm dual excited ratiometric UC luminescence.







Abstract
Lanthanide (Ln3+)&#8208;doped upconversion (UC) nanoprobes, which have drawn extensive attention for various bioapplications, usually suffer from small absorption cross&#8208;sections and weak luminescence intensity of Ln3+ ions. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of a new class of Ln3+&#8208;doped UC nanoprobes based on CsLu2F7:Yb/Er nanocrystals (NCs), which can effectively increase the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency from singlet excited state to triplet excited state of IR808 up to 99.3&#8201;% through the heavy atom effect. By virtue of the efficient triplet sensitization of IR808, the optimal UC luminescence (UCL) intensity of IR808&#8208;modified CsLu2F7:Yb/Er NCs is enhanced by 1309 times upon excitation at 808&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the intense dye&#8208;triplet&#8208;sensitized UCL, the nanoprobes are demonstrated for sensitive assay of extracellular and intracellular hypochlorite with an 808&#8208;nm/980&#8208;nm dual excited ratiometric strategy.

         <title>Structural and Molecular Basis of the Catalytic Mechanism of Geranyl Pyrophosphate C6&#8208;Methyltransferase: Creation of an Unprecedented Farnesyl Pyrophosphate C6&#8208;Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA, and its complex with S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Further analysis based on site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and computational calculations provided the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Furthermore, an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C6&#8208;methyltransferase was created by introducing a W210A substitution.







Abstract
Prenyl pyrophosphate methyltransferases enhance the structural diversity of terpenoids. However, the molecular basis of their catalytic mechanisms is poorly understood. In this study, using multiple strategies, we characterized a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA. Biochemical analysis revealed that BezA requires Mg2+ and solely methylates GPP. The crystal structures of BezA and its complex with S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved at 2.10 and 2.56&#8197;&#197;, respectively. Further analyses using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations revealed the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Importantly, the function of E170 as a catalytic base to complete the methylation reaction was established. We also succeeded in switching the substrate specificity by introducing a W210A substitution, resulting in an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C6&#8208;methyltransferase.

         <title>Unlocking the Stereoselectivity and Substrate Acceptance of Enzymes: Proline&#8208;Induced Loop Engineering Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of interfaced proline residues as the &#8220;key&#8221; to unlock enzyme evolvability and thus access biocatalysts with highly improved catalytic performance.







Abstract
Protein stability and evolvability influence each other. Although protein dynamics play essential roles in various catalytically important properties, their high flexibility and diversity makes it difficult to incorporate such properties into rational engineering. Therefore, how to unlock the potential evolvability in a user&#8208;friendly rational design process remains a challenge. In this endeavor, we describe a method for engineering an enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenase. It enables synthetically important substrate acceptance for 4&#8208;chlorophenyl pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl ketone, and perfect stereocontrol of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configured products. Thermodynamic analysis unveiled the subtle interaction between enzyme stability and evolvability, while computational studies provided insights into the origin of selectivity and substrate recognition. Preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of the (S)&#8208;product (73&#8201;% yield; &gt;99&#8201;% ee) was performed on a gram&#8208;scale. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates that interfaced proline residues can be rationally engineered to unlock evolvability and thus provide access to new biocatalysts with highly improved catalytic performance.

         <title>Configurational Lability at Tetrahedral Phosphorus: syn/anti&#8208;Isomerization of a P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphiranium Cation by Intramolecular Epimerization at Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral carbon and analogous four&#8208;coordinate main&#8208;group compounds are configurationally stable, but we report intramolecular P&#8208;epimerization of chiral phosphiranium cations under mild conditions. How? In the proposed mechanism, P&#8208;C cleavage yields an intermediate pendant &#946;&#8208;carbocation which promotes low&#8208;barrier pyramidal inversion at phosphorus, while hyperconjugative stabilization from a P&#8208;C &#963;&#8208;bond preserves the cation's C&#8208;chirality.







Abstract
Tetrahedral main&#8208;group compounds are normally configurationally stable, but P&#8208;epimerization of the chiral phosphiranium cations syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;[Mes*P(Me)CH2CHPh][OTf] (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;(t&#8208;Bu)3C6H2) occurred under mild conditions at 60&#8201;&#176;C in CD2Cl2, resulting in isomerization to give a syn&#8208;enriched equilibrium mixture. Ion exchange with excess [NBu4][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT] (&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT=&#916;&#8208;P(o&#8208;C6Cl4O2)3) followed by chromatography on silica removed [NBu4][OTf] and gave mixtures of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[Mes*P(Me)CH2CHPh][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT]&#8901;x[NBu4][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT]. NMR spectroscopy showed that isomerization proceeded with epimerization at P and retention at C. DFT calculations are consistent with a mechanism involving P&#8208;C cleavage to yield a hyperconjugation&#8208;stabilized carbocation, pyramidal inversion promoted by &#963;&#8208;interaction of the P lone pair with the neighboring &#946;&#8208;carbocation, and ring closure with inversion of configuration at P.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild visible light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkyl Heck reaction of diazo compounds and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is reported. This method features Br&#248;nsted acid assisted generation of hybrid palladium C(sp3)&#8208;centered radical intermediate and broad reaction scope, highlighting the diverse applicability and the potential utility of this protocol in late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
A mild visible light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkyl Heck reaction of diazo compounds and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is reported. A broad range of vinyl arenes and heteroarenes with high functional group tolerance, as well as a range of different diazo compounds, can efficiently undergo this transformation. This method features Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;assisted generation of hybrid palladium C(sp3)&#8208;centered radical intermediate, which allowed for new selective C&#8722;H functionalization protocol.

         <title>Selective Approaches to &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Arylated Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzyl vinyl ethers have selectively been arylated at either &#945; or &#946; position by fine&#8208;tuned Heck&#8208;type palladium catalyses. In contrast to previous protocols, no excess of arylating reagent or substrate chelation is necessary. For achieving good yields and high &#945;/&#946;&#8208;selectivities various factors determining the catalytic system had to be optimized. The results of DFT computational studies correlate selectivity with electron richness on the Pd center.







Abstract
We developed simple and efficient protocols for palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;arylations of structurally diverse vinyl ethers. Both catalytic methods proceed under relatively mild reactions conditions applying to a broad substrate range including more complex compounds providing arylated glucal or isochromene. Lacking the common requirement of a large reagent excess, the transformations are highly economic and limiting the waste production. Results from computational studies (DFT) provided insight into the key factors determining the pronounced regioselectivities of the investigated reactions.

         <title>Solar Urea: Towards a Sustainable Fertilizer Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct urea synthesis from NH3 and CO2 was achieved over Pd/LTA&#8208;3A powered solely by solar energy. Pd nanoparticles serve the dual function of catalyzing the dissociation of NH3 and providing the photothermal driving force for reaction with CO2, while the absorption capacity of LTA&#8208;3A removes by&#8208;product H2O, shifting the equilibrium towards urea production.







Abstract
Urea, an agricultural fertilizer, nourishes humanity. The century&#8208;old Bosch&#8211;Meiser process provides the world's urea. It is multi&#8208;step, consumes enormous amounts of non&#8208;renewable energy, and has a large CO2 footprint. Thus, developing an eco&#8208;friendly synthesis for urea is a priority. Herein we report a single&#8208;step Pd/LTA&#8208;3A catalyzed synthesis of urea from CO2 and NH3 under ambient conditions powered solely by solar energy. Pd nanoparticles serve the dual function of catalyzing the dissociation of NH3 and providing the photothermal driving force for urea formation, while the absorption capacity of LTA&#8208;3A removes by&#8208;product H2O to shift the equilibrium towards urea production. The solar urea conversion rate from NH3 and CO2 is 87&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This advance represents a first step towards the use of solar energy in urea production. It provides insights into green fertilizer production, and inspires the vision of sustainable, modular plants for distributed production of urea on farms.

         <title>Athermal, Chemically Triggered Release of RNA from Thioester Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioester linked oligo(T) nucleic acids are utilized for an efficient enrichment of mRNA from total RNA under ambient temperature. The selective binding of uncharged oT TENA to the poly(A) tail of the mRNA and release via a self&#8208;immolative degradation of thioester backbone under ambient temperature were the key features that enabled this approach.







Abstract
An athermal approach to mRNA enrichment from total RNA using a self&#8208;immolative thioester linked nucleic acids (TENA) is described. Oligo(thymine) (oT) TENA has a six&#8208;atom spacing between bases which allowed TENA to selectively base&#8208;pair with polyadenine RNA. As a result of the neutral backbone of TENA and the hydrophobicity of the octanethiol end group, oT TENA is water insoluble and efficiently pulled down 93&#177;2&#8201;% of EGFP mRNA at a concentration of 10&#8197;ng&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1. Self&#8208;immolative degradation of TENA upon ambient temperature exposure to nucleophilic buffer components (Tris, DTT) allowed recovery of 55&#177;27&#8197;ng of mRNA from 3.1 &#956;g of total RNA, which was not statistically different from the amount recovered using Dynabeads&#174; mRNA DIRECT Kit (89&#177;24&#8197;ng). Gene expression as measured by RT&#8208;qPCR was comparable for both enrichment methods, suggesting that the mild conditions required for enrichment of mRNA using oT TENA are compatible with RT&#8208;qPCR and other downstream molecular biology applications.

         <title>Connecting Rheological Properties and Molecular Dynamics of Egg&#8208;Tempera Paints based on Egg Yolk</title>

Crack the code of egg&#8208;tempera paints: The macroscopic and microscopic properties of egg&#8208;tempera paint prepared with green earth are highlighted via rheology and NMR relaxometry.







Abstract
Egg&#8208;tempera painting is a pictorial technique widely used in the Middle Ages, although poorly studied in its physico&#8208;chemical aspects until now. Here we show how NMR relaxometry and rheology can be combined to probe egg&#8208;tempera paints and shed new light on their structure and behavior. Based on recipes of the 15th century, model formulations with egg yolk and green earth have been reproduced to characterize the physicochemical properties of this paint at the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales. The rheological measurements highlight a synergetic effect between green earth and egg yolk, induced by the interactions between them and the structural organisation of the system. 1H&#8197;NMR relaxometry emphasizes the presence and the structure of a network formed by the yolk and the pigment.

The rheological measurements highlight a synergetic effect between green earth and egg yolk, induced by the interactions between them and the structural organisation of the system. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR relaxometry emphasizes the presence and the structure of a network formed by the yolk and the pigment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oriented Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Ion Flux and Smart Gating Nanofluidic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic ion transport holds high promise in bio&#8208;sensing and energy conversion applications. However, smart nanofluidic devices with high ion flux and modulable ion transport capabilities remain to be realised. Herein, we demonstrate smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (2D COF) membranes with vertically aligned nanochannel arrays that achieved a 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher ion flux compared with that of conventional single&#8208;channel nanofluidic devices. The surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion conductance is dominant for electrolyte concentration up to 0.01 M. Moreover, owing to the customisable pH&#8208;responsivity of imine and phenol hydroxyl groups, the COF&#8208;DT membranes attained an actively modulable ion transport with a high pH&#8208;gating on/off ratio of ~100. The customisable structure and rich chemistry of COF materials will offer a promising platform for manufacturing nanofluidic devices with modifiable ion/molecular transport features.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lateral Flow Test for Staphylococcus aureus in Nasal Mucus Using a New DNAzyme as the Recognition Element</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of pathogenic bacteria in complex biological matrices remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the selection and optimization of a new DNAzyme for  Staphylococcus aureus  (SA) and the use of the DNAzyme to develop a simple lateral flow device (LFD) for detection of SA in nasal mucus. The DNAzyme was generated by  in vitro  selection using a crude extra/intracellular mixture derived from SA, which could be used directly for simple solution or paper&#8208;based fluorescence assays for SA. The DNAzyme was further modified to produce a DNA cleavage fragment that acted as a bridging element to bind DNA&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles to the test line of a LFD, producing a simple colorimetric dipstick test. The LFD was evaluated with nasal mucus samples spiked with SA, and demonstrated that SA detection was possible in minutes with minimal sample processing.</dc:description>

         <title>M&#246;bius Zn(II)&#8208;Hexaphyrins Bearing a Chiral Coordinating Arm: A Chiroptical Switch Featuring P/M Twist Inversion Controlled by Achiral Effectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By their conformational flexibility, M&#246;bius aromatic hexaphyrins provide a dynamic chirality attractive to develop stimuli responsive systems such as chiroptical switches. A regular [28]hexaphyrin has been equipped with a chiral coordinating arm to achieve transfer of chirality from a fix stereogenic element to the dynamic M&#246;bius one. The arm allows straightforward formation of labile monometallic Zn(II) complexes with an exogenous ligand, either a carboxylato or an amino with opposite  inwards  /  outwards  orientations relative to the M&#246;bius ring. As a corollary, the chiral coordinating arm is constrained over the ring or laterally, inducing opposite  P  and  M  M&#246;bius configurations with unprecedented high stereoselectivity (diast. excess greater than 95 %). By tuning the transfer of chirality, these achiral effectors generate electronic circular dichroism spectra with bisignate Cotton effect of opposite signs. Switching between distinct chiroptical states was ultimately achieved in mild conditions owing to ligand exchange, with high robustness (10 cycles).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fe  3+  complexes in aqueous solution can exist as discrete mononuclear species or multinuclear magnetically coupled species. Stimuli&#8208;driven change to Fe  3+  speciation represents a powerful mechanistic basis for magnetic resonance sensor technology, but ligand design strategies to exert precision control of aqueous Fe  3+  magnetostructural properties are entirely underexplored. In pursuit of this objective, we rationally designed a ligand to strongly favor a dinuclear &#181;&#8208;oxo&#8208;bridged and antiferromagnetically coupled complex, but which undergoes carboxylesterase mediated transformation to a mononuclear high&#8208;spin Fe  3+  chelate resulting in substantial T  1  &#8208;relaxivity increase.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Embedding heteroatoms into the main backbones of polymeric materials has become an efficient tool for tailoring their structures and improving their properties. However, owing to comparatively harsh heteroatom&#8208;doping conditions, this has rarely been explored in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein,  upon Aldol condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium salt with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde, a two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was achieved, which was further converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacement of oxonium ions with nitrogen atoms under ammonia treatment. The two heteroatom&#8208;embedded COFs are conceptually isoelectronic with each other, featuring similar geometric structures but different electronic structures, rendering them capable of catalyzing the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component synthesis of tri&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives with good recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable PdI Dimer Enabled Remote Functionalization: Access to Fluorinated 1,1&#8208;Diaryl Alkanes with Unprecedented Speed</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a remote arylation in less than 10&#8197;min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air&#8208;stable PdI dimer [Pd(&#956;&#8208;I)(PCy2tBu)]2.







Abstract
While remote functionalization via chain walking has the potential to enable access to molecules via novel disconnections, such processes require relatively long reaction times and can be in need of elevated temperatures. This work features a remote arylation in less than 10&#8197;min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air&#8208;stable PdI dimer [Pd(&#956;&#8208;I)(PCy2tBu)]2, which in contrast to its PtBu3 counterpart does not trigger direct coupling at the initiation site, but regioconvergent and chemoselective remote functionalization to yield valuable fluorinated 1,1&#8208;diaryl alkanes. Our combined experimental and computational studies rationalize the origins of switchability, which are primarily due to differences in dispersion interactions.

         <title>Photocleavable Fluorescent Membrane Tension Probes: Fast Release with Spatiotemporal Control in Inner Leaflets of Plasma Membrane, Nuclear Envelope, and Secretory Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open, dynamic, and elusive membrane motifs are labeled without chemical or physical interference to image their order and tension in living cells: Fast release with light from specific targets liberates the original small&#8208;molecule flipper probe in the innermost leaflet of the nuclear envelope, the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, or along the secretory pathway to address current questions of biological significance.







Abstract
Mechanosensitive flipper probes are attracting interest as fluorescent reporters of membrane order and tension in biological systems. We introduce PhotoFlippers, which contain a photocleavable linker and an ultralong tether between mechanophore and various targeting motifs. Upon irradiation, the original probe is released and labels the most ordered membrane that is accessible by intermembrane transfer. Spatiotemporal control from photocleavable flippers is essential to access open, dynamic or elusive membrane motifs without chemical or physical interference. For instance, fast release with light is shown to place the original small&#8208;molecule probes into the innermost leaflet of the nuclear envelope to image changes in membrane tension, at specific points in time of membrane trafficking along the secretory pathway, or in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to explore membrane asymmetry. These results identify PhotoFlippers as useful chemistry tools to enable research in biology.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanopatterns of Molecular Spoked Wheels with Orthogonal Pillars: The Observation of a Fullerene Haze</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthetic approach paves the way to nanoscale platform molecules for supramolecular graphite surface patterns at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. While a perylene dye bound at the end of the pillar remains fixed above the molecule center and points into solution, a fullerene ester bound at the same position performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.







Abstract
Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two&#8208;dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0&#8197;nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These also show that, in contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2&#8197;nm above the graphite substrate. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8211;pillar distances by 15&#8201;% and block unspecific intercalation.

         <title>Druggable Allosteric Sites in &#946;&#8208;Propeller Lectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug&#8208;like inhibitors for bacterial carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins called lectins are challenging. Computational and experimental analyses (NMR and SPR) of related &#946;&#8208;propeller lectins from Burkholderia ambifaria (BambL), Ralstonia solanacearum (RSL), and Aspergillus fumigatus (AFL) identified druggable secondary pockets, which will support the design of allosteric inhibitors as new therapeutics against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.







Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins (lectins) are auspicious targets in drug discovery to combat antimicrobial resistance; however, their non&#8208;carbohydrate drug&#8208;like inhibitors are still unavailable. Here, we present a druggable pocket in a &#946;&#8208;propeller lectin BambL from Burkholderia ambifaria as a potential target for allosteric inhibitors. This site was identified employing 19F&#8197;NMR fragment screening and a computational pocket prediction algorithm SiteMap. The structure&#8211;activity relationship study revealed the most promising fragment with a dissociation constant of 0.3&#177;0.1&#8197;mM and a ligand efficiency of 0.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;HA&#8722;1 that affected the orthosteric site. This effect was substantiated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in the orthosteric and secondary pockets. Future drug&#8208;discovery campaigns that aim to develop small molecule inhibitors can benefit from allosteric sites in lectins as a new therapeutic approach against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>Mo3S132&#8722; Intercalated Layered Double Hydroxide: Highly Selective Removal of Heavy Metals and Simultaneous Reduction of Ag+ Ions to Metallic Ag0 Ribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation of Mo3S132&#8722; into MgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) gives a new material. Mo3S13&#8208;LDH, which exhibits enormous adsorption capacities of noble metal silver (qmAg=1073&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and toxic Hg2+ (qmHg=594&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) as well as high uptake selectivity for Ag+ and Cu2+. Both S22&#8722; and Mo4+ in Mo3S13&#8208;LDH contribute to the reduction of Ag+ to metallic Ag0.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new material by intercalating Mo3S132&#8722; into Mg/Al layered double hydroxide (abbr. Mo3S13&#8208;LDH), exhibiting excellent capture capability for toxic Hg2+ and noble metal silver (Ag). The as&#8208;prepared Mo3S13&#8208;LDH displays ultra&#8208;high selectivity of Ag+, Hg2+ and Cu2+ in the presence of various competitive ions, with the order of Ag+&gt;Hg2+&gt;Cu2+&gt;Pb2+&#8805;Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+. For Ag+ and Hg2+, extremely fast adsorption rates (&#8776;90&#8201;% within 10&#8197;min, &gt;99&#8201;% in 1&#8197;h) are observed. Much high selectivity is present for Ag+ and Cu2+, especially for trace amounts of Ag+ (&#8776;1&#8197;ppm), achieving a large separation factor (SFAg/Cu) of &#8776;8000 at the large Cu/Ag ratio of 520. The overwhelming adsorption capacities for Ag+ (qmAg=1073&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Hg2+ (qmHg=594&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) place the Mo3S13&#8208;LDH at the top of performing sorbent materials. Most importantly, Mo3S13&#8208;LDH captures Ag+ via two paths: a) formation of Ag2S due to Ag&#8208;S complexation and precipitation, and b) reduction of Ag+ to metallic silver (Ag0). The Mo3S13&#8208;LDH is a promising material to extract low&#8208;grade silver from copper&#8208;rich minerals and trap highly toxic Hg2+ from polluted water.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Monohydrosilanes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular hydrosilylation strategy was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral monohydrosilanes. This protocol is suitable for the synthesis of dihydrobenzosilole&#8208;, tetrahydrobenzosiline&#8208; and oxatetrahydrobenzosiline&#8208;based monohydrosilanes with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Notably, the catalyst loading could be reduced to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
Enantiopure monohydrosilanes are versatile chiral reagents for alcohol resolution and mechanistic investigation. Herein, we have demonstrated the asymmetric synthesis of monohydrosilanes via an intramolecular hydrosilylation strategy. This protocol is suitable for the synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic monohydrosilanes, including a class of chiral oxasilacycles, with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Notably, the catalyst loading could be reduced to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% which makes this one of the most efficient methods to access chiral monohydrosilanes. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate this Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction might proceed via a Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism, and the enantio&#8208;determining step was predicted to be oxidative addition of Si&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Access to Axially Chiral Olefins via C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Directing Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two classes of tetrasubstituted axially chiral olefins have been accessed in excellent enantioselectivity via RhIII&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation assisted by a migratable directing group.







Abstract
Axially chiral open&#8208;chain olefins represent an underexplored class of chiral platform. In this report, two classes of tetrasubstituted axially chiral acyclic olefins have been accessed in excellent enantioselectivity and regioselectivity via C&#8722;H activation of (hetero)arenes assisted by a migratable directing group en route to coupling with sterically hindered alkynes. The coupling of indoles bearing an N&#8208;aminocarbonyl directing group afforded C&#8211;N axially chiral acrylamides with the assistance of a racemic zinc carboxylate additive. DFT studies suggest a &#946;&#8208;nitrogen elimination&#8211;reinsertion pathway for the directing group migration. Meanwhile, the employment of N&#8208;phenoxycarboxamide delivered C&#8722;C axially chiral enamides via migration of the oxidizing directing group. Experiments suggest that in both cases the (hetero)arene substrate adopts a well&#8208;defined orientation during the C&#8722;H activation, which in turn determines the disposition of the alkyne in migratory insertion. Synthetic applications of representative chiral olefins are demonstrated.

         <title>Hyperbranched Microwire Networks of Organic Cocrystals with Optical Waveguiding and Light&#8208;Harvesting Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical micro&#8208; and nanostructures made of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are not yet reported due to the weak control over intermolecular interactions and little&#8208;known complex assembly behavior of organic species. Hyperbranched microwire networks comprising binary organic arene&#8208;perfluoroarene cocrystals were created, which show optical waveguiding and light&#8208;harvesting abilities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of hyperbranched organic microwire (MW) networks comprising 1,4&#8208;bis(pentafluorostyryl)benzene (10Ft) and 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BA) using a simple solution co&#8208;assembly route. Pure 10Ft or BA assemblies cannot produce such complex MW networks; in contrast with a binary cocrystal of 10Ft and BA with a 2:1 molar ratio ((2:1)10Ft:BA), which is formed via intermolecular arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interactions. A new generation of multiple MWs grow epitaxially on the previous generation of MWs to form MW arrays in which BA may also act as an intermediate product to facilitate the regeneration of (2:1)10Ft:BA. Highly aligned and well&#8208;connected MW networks enable superior optical waveguiding ability. Moreover, a red&#8208;emitting dopant, 5,12&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)naphthacene (BN) was incorporated into (2:1)10Ft:BA host MWs, giving light&#8208;harvesting hierarchical MW networks via an energy&#8208;transfer (ET) process. The realization of the hyperbranched MWs provides us with deep insight into the rational creation of complex branched arrays from functional organic cocrystals.

         <title>Maximizing Electroactive Sites in a Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Significantly Improved Carbon Dioxide Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D imide&#8208;bonded covalent organic framework (COF) composed of cobalt&#8208;phthalocyanine subunits has been prepared and used in CO2 reduction reaction electrocatalysis, showing the high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion Faradaic efficiency. In particular, the active electrocatalytic centers and current density (jCO) of this 3D COF have been significantly improved in comparison to that of the 2D COF electrocatalyst with the same phthalocyanine subunits.







Abstract
Synthesis of functional 3D COFs with irreversible bond is challenging. Herein, 3D imide&#8208;bonded COFs were constructed via the imidization reaction between phthalocyanine&#8208;based tetraanhydride and 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)adamantine. These two 3D COFs are made up of interpenetrated pts networks according to powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas adsorption analyses. CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 doped with carbon black has been employed to fabricate the electrocatalytic cathode towards CO2 reduction reaction within KHCO3 aqueous solution, displaying the Faradaic efficiency of 88&#8211;96&#8201;% for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at the voltage range of ca. &#8722;0.60 to &#8722;1.00&#8197;V (vs. RHE). In particular, the 3D porous structure of CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 enables the active electrocatalytic centers occupying 32.7&#8201;% of total cobalt&#8208;phthalocyanine subunits, thus giving a large current density (jCO) of &#8722;31.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.90&#8197;V. These two parameters are significantly improved than the excellent 2D COF analogue (CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;1, 5.1&#8201;% and &#8722;21.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Polycarbonates by Organocatalytic Copolymerization of CO2 and Epoxides: From High Pressure and Temperature to Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB, as a superior organocatalyst toward copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxides, has a metal&#8208;free nature, exhibits high efficiency and selectivity, can be used under ambient conditions, and synthesizes diverse CO2&#8208;PC products.







Abstract
Organophosphazenes combined with triethylborane (TEB) were selected as binary organocatalyts for the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides. Both the activity and selectivity were highly dependent on the nature of phosphazenes. 2,4,6&#8208;Tris[tri(1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)&#8208;iminophosphorane]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3) with a relatively low basicity (pKa=26.5 in CD3CN) and a bulky molecular size (&#966;=1.3&#8197;nm) exhibited an unprecedented efficiency (TON up to 12240) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% polymer selectivity and &gt;99&#8201;% carbonate linkages) toward copolymerization of CO2 and cyclohexene oxide (CHO), and produced CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs) with high molar masses (Mn up to 275.5&#8197;kDa) at 1&#8197;MPa of CO2 and 80&#8201;&#176;C. Surprisingly, this binary catalytic system achieved efficient CO2/CHO copolymerization with TOF up to 95&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;atm pressure and room temperature.

         <title>Stacked but not Stuck: Unveiling the Role of &#960;&#8594;&#960;* Interactions with the Help of the Benzofuran&#8211;Formaldehyde Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8594;&#960;* interaction is discovered to be by far the main stabilizing contribution in the benzofuran&#8211;formaldehyde adduct, resulting in an interaction energy of &#8722;16.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The characterization of eleven singly&#8208;substituted isotopologues allowed for an accurate semi&#8208;experimental equilibrium structure determination, which points out a carbon&#8211;carbon distance (3.2257&#177;0.0006&#8197;&#197;) between formaldehyde and benzofuran shorter than the sum of the carbon van der Waals radii.







Abstract
The 1:1 benzofuran&#8211;formaldehyde complex has been chosen as model system for analyzing &#960;&#8594;&#960;* interactions in supramolecular organizations involving heteroaromatic rings and carbonyl groups. A joint &#8220;rotational spectroscopy&#8211;quantum chemistry&#8221; strategy unveiled the dominant role of &#960;&#8594;&#960;* interactions in tuning the intermolecular interactions of such adduct. The exploration of the intermolecular potential energy surface led to the identification of 14 low&#8208;energy minima, with 4 stacked isomers being more stable than those linked by hydrogen bond or lone&#8208;pair&#8594;&#960; interactions. All energy minima are separated by loose transition states, thus suggesting an effective relaxation to the global minimum under the experimental conditions. This expectation has been confirmed by the experimental detection of only one species, which was unambiguously assigned owing to the computation of accurate spectroscopic parameters and the characterization of 11 isotopologues. The large number of isotopic species opened the way to the determination of the first semi&#8208;experimental equilibrium structure for a molecular complex of such a dimension.

         <title>Bulk Electrocatalytic NADH Cofactor Regeneration with Bipolar Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wireless electrocatalytic regeneration of the enzymatically active cofactor NADH is achieved on functionalized carbon beads suspended in the bulk phase of a bipolar electrochemical cell. The catalytic efficiency can be fine&#8208;tuned by the concentration of suspended particles and the applied external electric field.







Abstract
Electrochemical regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is an extremely important challenge for the electroenzymatic synthesis of many valuable chemicals. Although some important progress has been made with modified electrodes concerning the reduction of NAD+, the scale&#8208;up is difficult due to mass transport limitations inherent to large&#8208;size electrodes. Here, we propose instead to employ a dispersion of electrocatalytically active modified microparticles in the bulk of a bipolar electrochemical cell. In this way, redox reactions occur simultaneously on all of these individual microelectrodes without the need of a direct electrical connection. The concept is validated by using [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ functionalized surfaces, either of carbon felt as a reference material, or carbon microbeads acting as bipolar objects. In the latter case, enzymatically active 1,4&#8208;NADH is electroregenerated at the negatively polarized face of the particles. The efficiency of the system can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the electric field in the reaction compartment and the number of dispersed microelectrodes. This wireless bioelectrocatalytic approach opens up very interesting perspectives for electroenzymatic synthesis in the bulk phase.

         <title>An N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization Strategy for Accessing Diverse N&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Azoles from Nitriles and 1,3&#8208;Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable N&#8208;trifuoromethylative cyclization strategy is reported to construct N&#8208;CF3 tetrazoles/imidazoles/1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. N&#8208;CF3 nitrilium derivatives are obtained via the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of nitriles and well used as NCF3&#8208;containing synthons in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cyclizations for the first time. A generic platform for accessing diverse N&#8208;CF3 azoles is thus provided.







Abstract
N&#8208;Trifluoromethyl azoles are valuable targets in medicinal chemistry, but their synthesis is challenging. Classical preparation of N&#8208;CF3 azoles relies on the functional group interconversions but suffers from tedious N&#8208;pre&#8208;functionalization and unfriendly agents. Introduction of the CF3 onto the nitrogen of heterocycles provides a direct route to such motifs, but the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation remains underdeveloped. Reported here is an alternative and scalable cyclization strategy based on NCF3&#8208;containing synthons for constructing N&#8208;CF3 azoles. The approach involves the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of nitriles followed by a [3+2] cyclization between resulting N&#8208;CF3 nitrilium derivatives and 1,3&#8208;dipoles. PhICF3Cl was an effective CF3 source for the transformation. As a result, a generic platform is established to divergently synthesize N&#8208;trifluoromethylated tetrazoles, imidazoles, and 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles by using sodium azide, activated methylene isocyanides, and diazo compounds as dipoles.

         <title>Stable Isotope Phosphate Labelling of Diverse Metabolites is Enabled by a Family of 18O&#8208;Phosphoramidites**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 18O2&#8208;phosphoramidites facilitates synthetic access on gram&#8208;scale to various isotopically pure 18O&#8208;labelled phosphate products, like nucleotides, inositol phosphates, polyphosphates, and DNA. The utility of these 18O&#8208;natural products is underlined in the assignment of various metabolites from biological matrices using capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionisation triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Stable isotope labelling is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in quantitative mass spectrometry, yet often accessing the required standards is cumbersome and very expensive. Here, a unifying synthetic concept for 18O&#8208;labelled phosphates is presented, based on a family of modified 18O2&#8208;phosphoramidite reagents. This toolbox offers access to major classes of biologically highly relevant phosphorylated metabolites as their isotopologues including nucleotides, inositol phosphates, &#8208;pyrophosphates, and inorganic polyphosphates. 18O&#8208;enrichment ratios &gt;95&#8201;% and good yields are obtained consistently in gram&#8208;scale reactions, while enabling late&#8208;stage labelling. We demonstrate the utility of the 18O&#8208;labelled inositol phosphates and pyrophosphates by assignment of these metabolites from different biological matrices. We demonstrate that phosphate neutral loss is negligible in an analytical setup employing capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionisation triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.

         <title>X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X Halogen Bond&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=Cl, Br, I) type weak halogen bonds induce the formation of supramolecular helical structures both in solid and solution state. The halogen bonds could further influence the helical nanoarchitectures in mono&#8208; and multiple&#8208;component coassemblies with melamine, providing a flexible route to prepare chiral functional materials.







Abstract
The halogen bond is the attractive interaction between the electrophilic region of a halogen atom and the nucleophilic region of another molecular entity, emerging as a favorable manner to manipulate supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assemblies. Engineering halogen bonded helical structures remains a challenge due to its sensitivity to solvent polarity and competitive forces like hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=Cl, Br, I) type weak halogen bond that induces the formation and evolution of supramolecular helical structures both in solid and solution state. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenylalanine derivatives with F, Cl, Br and I substitution self&#8208;assembled into 21 helical packing driven by hydrogen bond and halogen bond, respectively. The specific molecular geometries of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids gave rise to multiple noncovalent forces to stabilize the X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X halogen bond with small bond energies ranging from &#8722;0.69 to &#8722;1.49&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Halogen bond induced an opposite helicity compared to the fluorinated species, accompanied by the inversed circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Layered Double Hydroxide&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Prussian Blue Membranes for Precise Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we prepared continuous polycrystalline Prussian blue (PB) membrane showing precise dye rejection and monovalent ion discrimination ability. The introduction of a calcined NiFe&#8208;CO3 layered double hydroxide buffer layer on the substrate was found to play a paramount role in the formation of PB membrane with desirable microstructure and performance.







Abstract
Prussian Blue (PB), which was first discovered as robust blue&#8208;colored pigment in the year 1706, has shown promising prospects in disease treatment, energy conversion, water splitting, and sensing. Relying on the uniform 3.2&#8197;&#197;&#8208;sized pore channels as well as high stability in aqueous environments, in this study, we pioneered in situ preparation of polycrystalline PB membranes to justify their dye rejection and metal ion discrimination ability in aqueous environments. Among various factors, the introduction of calcined NiFe layered double hydroxide buffer layers on porous &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 substrates was found to play a paramount role in the formation of continuous polycrystalline PB membranes, thereby leading to excellent dye rejection efficiency (&gt;99.0&#8201;%). Moreover, prepared PB membranes enabled discriminating different monovalent metal ions (e.g., Li+, Na+, and K+) depending on their discrepancy in Stokes diameters, showing great promise for lithium extraction from smaller&#8208;sized metal ions.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multifunctional Carbon&#8208;Based Nanoparticle&#8208;supported Dispersed Cu2+ Disrupts Redox Homeostasis to Enhance CDT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In chemodynamic therapy (CDT), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production plays an important role for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy. However, the high levels of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells consume the ROS, directly reducing the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized carbon&#8208;based nanoparticle (Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs) using one&#8208;pot strategy, which consume GSH  via  redox reactions to produce Cu+  that catalyze H2O2  to produce &#183;OH, thus the ROS level was observably increased through this synergistic effect.  In vivo  experiments further revealed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs could effectively inhibit tumor growth. Additionally, Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs can affect the activity of some protein sulfhydryl groups in cells, which was assessed by rdTOP&#8208;ABPP assay. In general, this study not only provides a potential CDT drug, but also provides a strategy for one&#8208;pot synthesis of multifunctional nanomaterials.</dc:description>

In general, this study not only provides a potential CDT drug, but also provides a strategy for one-pot synthesis of multifunctional nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Photopolymerization of Stable Poly(Catecholamines)&#8208;DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of multicomponent polymer hybrids with nanometer precision is chemically challenging in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, we leverage the fidelity of the DNA origami technique to install a multi&#8209;wavelength responsive photopolymerization system with nanometer resolution. By precisely immobilizing various photosensitizers on the origami template, which are only activated at their respective peak wavelength, we can control sequential polymerization processes. In particular, the triggered photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species that in turn initiate the polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. We imprint polymeric layers at designated positions on DNA origami, which modifies the polyanionic nature of the DNA objects, thus, promoting their uptake into living cells while preserving their integrity. Our herein proposed methodology provides a rapid platform to access complex 3D&#160;nanostructures by customizing material and biological interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>The Aryne Phosphate Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of phosphates to act as efficient arynophiles is demonstrated. The resulting aryne phosphate reaction is a versatile tool for arene phosphorylation or phosphate arylation. A broad scope of variously arylated phosphate products is culminating in novel nucleotide analogues and a benchmarking octaphosphorylation.







Abstract
Condensed phosphates are a critically important class of molecules in biochemistry. Non&#8208;natural analogues are important for various applications, such as single&#8208;molecule real&#8208;time DNA sequencing. Often, such analogues contain more than three phosphate units in their oligophosphate chain. Consequently, investigations into phosphate reactivity enabling new ways of phosphate functionalization and oligophosphorylation are essential. Here, we scrutinize the potential of phosphates to act as arynophiles, paving the way for follow&#8208;up oligophosphorylation reactions. The aryne phosphate reaction is a powerful tool to&#8212;depending on the perspective&#8212;(oligo)phosphorylate arenes or arylate (oligo&#8208;cyclo)phosphates. Based on Kobayashi&#8208;type o&#8208;silylaryltriflates, the aryne phosphate reaction enables rapid entry into a broad spectrum of arylated products, like monophosphates, diphosphates, phosphodiesters and polyphosphates. The synthetic potential of these new transformations is demonstrated by efficient syntheses of nucleotide analogues and an unprecedented one&#8208;flask octaphosphorylation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of a distannyne supported by a pincer ligand bearing pendant amine donors that is capable of reversibly activating E&#8211;H bonds at one or both of the tin centres through dissociation of the hemi&#8208;labile N&#8211;Sn donor/acceptor interactions. This chemistry can be exploited to sequentially (and reversibly) assemble mixed&#8208;valence chains of tin atoms of the type ArSn{Sn(Ar)H}  n  SnAr (  n  = 1, 2). The experimentally observed (decreasing) propensity towards chain growth with increasing chain length can be rationalized both thermodynamically and kinetically by the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the &#8211;Sn(Ar)H&#8211; backbone units generated via oxidative addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection and Imaging of the Plant Pathogen Response by Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Polyphenol Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular sensors for plant polyphenol imaging based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are presented. These sensors probe the polyphenol content in complex biological systems such as the plant rhizosphere. In summary, this approach enables real&#8208;time spatiotemporal visualization of plant defense via polyphenols release.







Abstract
Plants use secondary metabolites such as polyphenols for chemical defense against pathogens and herbivores. Despite their importance in plant pathogen interactions and tolerance to diseases, it remains challenging to detect polyphenols in complex plant tissues. Here, we create molecular sensors for plant polyphenol imaging that are based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We identified polyethylene glycol&#8211;phospholipids that render (6,5)&#8208;SWCNTs sensitive (Kd=90&#8197;nM) to plant polyphenols (tannins, flavonoids, &#8230;), which red&#8208;shift (up to 20&#8197;nm) and quench their emission (ca. 1000&#8197;nm). These sensors report changes in total polyphenol level after herbivore or pathogen challenge in crop plant systems (Soybean Glycine max) and leaf tissue extracts (Tococa spp.). We furthermore demonstrate remote chemical imaging of pathogen&#8208;induced polyphenol release from roots of soybean seedlings over the time course of 24&#8197;h. This approach allows in situ visualization and understanding of the chemical plant defense in real time and paves the way for plant phenotyping for optimized polyphenol secretion.

         <title>Rotation in an Enantiospecific Self&#8208;Assembled Array of Molecular Raffle Wheels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kagome network on the Ag(111) surface hosts guest molecules with enantiomeric selectivity. Each larger pore confines a single guest molecule. The punctuated pirouette of the guest molecule in this confined space is unravelled by a combination of density functional theory and variable temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy in real time at the single molecule level.







Abstract
Tailored nano&#8208;spaces can control enantioselective adsorption and molecular motion. We report on the spontaneous assembly of a dynamic system&#8212;a rigid kagome network with each pore occupied by a guest molecule&#8212;employing solely 2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid on Ag(111). The network cavity snugly hosts the chemically modified guest, bestows enantiomorphic adsorption and allows selective rotational motions. Temperature&#8208;dependent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies revealed distinct anchoring orientations of the guest unit switching with a 0.95&#8197;eV thermal barrier. H&#8208;bonding between the guest and the host transiently stabilises the rotating guest, as the flapper on a raffle wheel. Density functional theory investigations unravel the detailed molecular pirouette of the guest and how the energy landscape is determined by H&#8208;bond formation and breakage. The origin of the guest's enantiodirected, dynamic anchoring lies in the specific interplay of the kagome network and the silver surface.

         <title>Photocatalytic Sulfonylcarbocyclization of Alkynes Using SEt as a Traceless Directing Group: Access to Cyclopentenes and Indenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes using SEt as a traceless directing group is developed, providing a facile access to highly substituted cyclopentenes and indenes from readily available starting materials.

Cyclopentenes and indenes are important structural scaffolds in synthetic, medical, and material chemistry. Cyclization of alkynes via remote C&#8722;H functionalization is an appealing approach to construct these motifs due to its high efficiency and step&#8208;economy. Herein, a traceless directing group strategy was designed to reverse the regioselectivity of radical addition which enabled an unprecedented photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes by forming C&#8722;C bond on inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. It offers a facile access to decorated cyclopentenes and indenes under mild conditions. The resultant products could be converted into a set of valuable molecular scaffolds, including a key intermediate of AM&#8208;6226. Mechanistic experiments suggest a radical cascade pathway comprising a Markovnikov&#8208;type sulfonylation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization, and &#946;&#8208;elimination. This study lays further groundwork for the use of anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization in rapidly assembling five&#8208;membered carbocycles.

&lt;p&gt;A photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes using SEt as a traceless directing group is developed, providing a facile access to highly substituted cyclopentenes and indenes from readily available starting materials. It represents a new advance on anti-Baldwin 5-endo-trig radical cyclization of all-carbon systems, which may be valuable for the fast construction of five-membered carbocycles.

         <title>Vitamin D Inhibits the Early Aggregation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and Modulates Exocytosis Revealed by Electrochemical Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical measurement of the early aggregation of &#945;&#8208;Syn and exocytosis event of PC12, revealing a new neuroprotective role of VD that can inhibit the &#945;&#8208;Syn monomers aggregation into &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers and modulate exocytosis. This research provides an efficient strategy for early treatment and prevention of the neurodegenerative diseases associated with &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) localizes at presynaptic terminal and modulates synaptic functions. Increasing evidence demonstrate that &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers, forming at the early of aggregation, are cytotoxic and is thus related to brain neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we find that vitamin D (VD) can reduce neurocytotoxicity. The reduced neurocytotoxicity might be attributed to the less amount of large&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers inhibited by VD, measured by electrochemical collision at single particle level, which are not observable with traditionally ensembled method. Single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA) results show that VD can recover the amount of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers, further verifying the neuroprotection of VD. Our study reveals the neuroprotective role of VD through inhibiting &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation, which is envisioned to be of great importance in treatment and prevention of the neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Construction of Tricyclic Nitrogen Heterocycles by a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Allenynes and Application to Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold&#8208;catalyzed biscyclization of hydroxyisobutyryl (Hib)&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was promoted by BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to give 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives, some of which were converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A hexacyclic indolium salt (see structure) showed concentration&#8208;dependent photophysical properties attributable to aggregate formation.







Abstract
A novel approach to the direct construction of tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles based on gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of aminoallenynes is described. The expected biscyclization reaction of hydroxyisobutyryl&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was efficiently promoted by a catalytic amount of BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to produce 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives in good yields. When the reaction was combined with Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation or palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation, the resulting tricyclic products were efficiently converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A newly obtained hexacyclic indolium salt showed characteristic concentration&#8208;dependent absorption and emission properties.

         <title>Macrocycle Dynamics in a Branched [8]Catenane Controlled by Three Different Stimuli in Three Different Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched [8]catenane was synthesized from a one&#8208;pot procedure with good efficiency. Rigidifying/loosening the mechanical bond in the core, middle or periphery of the [8]catenane resulted in, respectively a large, middle and small degree of change in the catenane dynamics and flexibility.







Abstract
A branched [8]catenane from an efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis (72&#8201;% HPLC yield, 59&#8201;% isolated yield) featuring the simultaneous use of three kinds of templates and cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;mediated azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CBAAC) for ring&#8208;closing is reported. Design and assembly of the [8]catenane precursors are unexpectedly complex that can involve cooperating, competing and non&#8208;influencing interactions. Due to the branched structure, dynamics of the [8]catenane can be modulated in different extent by rigidifying/loosening the mechanical bonds at different regions by using solvent polarity, acid&#8208;base and metal ions as the stimuli. This work not only highlights the importance of understanding the delicate interplay of the weak and non&#8208;obvious supramolecular interactions in the synthesis of high&#8208;order [n]catenane, but also demonstrates a complex control of dynamics and flexibility for exploiting [n]catenanes applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;uniform Photoinduced Unfolding of Supramolecular Polymers Leading to Topological Block Nanofibers</title>

         <dc:description>
Helically folded supramolecular polymers with a high internal rigidity undergo non&#8208;uniform unfolding upon UV&#8208;irradiation, affording topological block nanofibers consisting of two distinct domains with helically folded and unfolded structures.







Abstract
Synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional nanofibers with distinct topological (higher&#8208;order structural) domains in the same main chain is one of the challenging topics in modern supramolecular polymer chemistry. Non&#8208;uniform structural transformation of supramolecular polymer chains by external stimuli may enable preparation of such nanofibers. To demonstrate feasibility of this post&#8208;polymerization strategy, we prepared a photoresponsive helically folded supramolecular polymers from a barbiturate monomer containing an azobenzene&#8208;embedded rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold. In contrast to previous helically folded supramolecular polymers composed of a more flexible azobenzene monomer, UV&#8208;light induced unfolding of the newly prepared helically folded supramolecular polymers occurred nonuniformly, affording topological block copolymers consisting of folded and unfolded domains. The formation of such blocky copolymers indicates that the photoinduced unfolding of the helically folded structures initiates from relatively flexible parts such as termini or defects. Spontaneous refolding of the unfolded domains was observed after visible&#8208;light irradiation followed by aging to restore fully folded structures.

The present study offers a best&#8208;of&#8208;both&#8208;worlds approach and enabled the synthesis of a tRNA derivative with four modifications. This approach is compatible with a whole toolbox of light&#8208;reactive and other modifications.







Abstract
Herein, we present a multi&#8208;cycle chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified RNA with simplified solid&#8208;phase handling to overcome size limitations of RNA synthesis. It combines the advantages of classical chemical solid&#8208;phase synthesis and enzymatic synthesis using magnetic streptavidin beads and biotinylated RNA. Successful introduction of light&#8208;controllable RNA nucleotides into the tRNAMet sequence was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The methods tolerate modifications in the RNA phosphodiester backbone and allow introductions of photocaged and photoswitchable nucleotides as well as photocleavable strand breaks and fluorophores.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds is an important way to construct P&#8208;chiral ligands. Herein, we report a new strategy that adopts the pyridinyl moiety as the coordinating group in the cobalt&#8208;catalysed asymmetric nucleophilic addition/alkylation of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs). A series of tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) were generated with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5&#8201;% ee, and with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Responsive Jamming of Nanoparticle Dense Suspensions towards Macroscopic Liquid&#8208;Solid Switchable Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Nanoparticle aggregation for constructing functional materials has shown enormous advantages in various applications. Most efforts focused on ordered nanoparticle aggregation for specific functions but often limited in irreversible aggregation processes due to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Herein, we report a reversible disordered aggregation of SiO  2  &#8208;PNIPAAm nanoparticles (SPNPs) through thermo&#8208;responsive jamming, obtaining smart liquid&#8208;solid switchable materials. The smart materials can display a switch between liquid&#8208;like state and solid&#8208;like state responding to temperature change. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs. Notably, the materials at solid&#8208;like state show anti&#8208;impact property and can withstand the impact of a steel sphere with a speed of 328 cm/s. We envision that this finding offers inspirations to design smart liquid&#8208;solid switchable materials for impact protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of High Energy Density Diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;Phenothiazine Hybrid Catholytes for Non&#8208;Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational molecular design, simple chemical synthesis, and structure&#8211;property computation analysis, a new catholyte with high potential, two&#8208;electron transfer, and high solubility is developed for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries.







Abstract
This report describes the design of diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;phenothiazine hybrid catholytes for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries. The molecules are synthesized in a rapid and modular fashion by appending a diaminocyclopropenium (DAC) substituent to the nitrogen of the phenothiazine. Combining a versatile C&#8208;N coupling protocol (which provides access to diverse derivatives) with computation and structure&#8208;property analysis enabled the identification of a catholyte that displays stable two&#8208;electron cycling at potentials of 0.64 and 1.00&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ as well as high solubility in all oxidation states (&#8805;0.45&#8197;M in TBAPF6/MeCN). This catholyte was deployed in a high energy density two&#8208;electron RFB, exhibiting &gt;90&#8201;% capacity retention over 266&#8197;hours of flow cell cycling at &gt;0.5&#8197;M electron concentration.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of a Macrobicyclic Olefin Bearing a Sacrificial Silyloxide Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a macrobicyclic olefin system bearing a sacrificial silyloxide bridge on the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;positions of the double bond as a new sequence&#8208;defined monomer for regio&#8208;selective ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. The monomeric sequence information is implanted in the macro&#8208;ring, while the small ring with a substantial ring tension can provide not only narrow polydispersity, but also high regio&#8208;/stereospecificity.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) has been regarded as a powerful tool for sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization. However, the traditional entropy&#8208;driven ROMP of macrocyclic olefins suffers from the lack of ring strain and poor regioselectivity, whereas the relay&#8208;ring&#8208;closing metathesis polymerization inevitably brings some unnecessary auxiliary structure into each monomeric unit. We developed a macrobicyclic olefin system bearing a sacrificial silyloxide bridge on the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;positions of the double bond as a new class of sequence&#8208;defined monomer for regioselective ROMP. The monomeric sequence information is implanted in the macro&#8208;ring, while the small ring, a 3&#8208;substituted cyclooctene structure with substantial ring tension, can provide not only narrow polydispersity, but also high regio&#8208;/stereospecificity. Besides, the silyloxide bridge can be sacrificially cleaved by desilylation and deoxygenation reactions to provide clean&#8208;structured, non&#8208;auxiliaried polymers.

         <title>Secondary Structure Tuning of a Pseudoprotein Between &#946;&#8208;Meander and &#945;&#8208;Helical Forms in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dipeptide functionalized with azide and alkyne, designed to undergo polymerization, crystallized in a geometry unsuitable for cycloaddition. However, it reacted at a high temperature, in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion, to yield a large polymer. The obtained polymer adopts a &#946;&#8208;meander&#8208;type secondary structure, which can be tuned to an &#945;&#8208;helix structure in solid&#8208;state by dissolution and solvent&#8208;evaporation.







Abstract
Tuning the secondary structure of a protein or polymer in the solid&#8208;state is challenging. Here we report the topochemical synthesis of a pseudoprotein and its secondary structure tuning in the solid&#8208;state. We designed the dipeptide monomer N3&#8208;Leu&#8208;Ala&#8208;NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;C&#8801;CH (1) for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Dipeptide 1 adopts an anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like stacked arrangement in its crystals. Upon heating, the dipeptide undergoes quantitative TAAC polymerization in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion yielding large polymers. The reaction occurs between the adjacent monomers in the H&#8208;bonded anti&#8208;parallel stack, yielding pseudoprotein having a &#946;&#8208;meander structure. When dissolved in methanol, this pseudoprotein changes its secondary structure from &#946;&#8208;meander to &#945;&#8208;helical form and it retains the new secondary structure upon desolvation. This work demonstrates a novel paradigm for tuning the secondary structure of a polymer in the solid&#8208;state.

&lt;p&gt;A dipeptide functionalized with azide and alkyne, designed to undergo polymerization, crystallized in a geometry unsuitable for cycloaddition. However, it reacted at a high temperature, in a crystal-to-crystal fashion, to yield a large polymer. The obtained polymer adopts a &#946;-meander-type secondary structure, which can be tuned to an &#945;-helix structure in solid-state by dissolution and solvent-evaporation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning the secondary structure of a protein or polymer in the solid-state is challenging. Here we report the topochemical synthesis of a pseudoprotein and its secondary structure tuning in the solid-state. We designed the dipeptide monomer N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Leu-Ala-NH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&#8801;CH (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) for topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Dipeptide &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; adopts an anti-parallel &#946;-sheet-like stacked arrangement in its crystals. Upon heating, the dipeptide undergoes quantitative TAAC polymerization in a crystal-to-crystal fashion yielding large polymers. The reaction occurs between the adjacent monomers in the H-bonded anti-parallel stack, yielding pseudoprotein having a &#946;-meander structure. When dissolved in methanol, this pseudoprotein changes its secondary structure from &#946;-meander to &#945;-helical form and it retains the new secondary structure upon desolvation. This work demonstrates a novel paradigm for tuning the secondary structure of a polymer in the solid-state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Deficiency&#8208;Dependent CO2 Electroreduction over Copper&#8208;Based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering A&#8208;site cation deficiency of Cu&#8208;based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite oxides is an effective strategy to enhance their CO2 electroreduction properties. With La2&#8722;xCuO4&#8722;&#948; (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it was demonstrated that their Faradaic efficiency ratios of C2+/CH4 featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the x values, with a maximum point at x=0.1.







Abstract
We report an effective strategy to enhance CO2 electroreduction (CER) properties of Cu&#8208;based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite oxides by engineering their A&#8208;site cation deficiencies. With La2&#8722;xCuO4&#8208;&#948; (L2&#8722;xC, x=0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, we demonstrate that their CER activity and selectivity (to C2+ or CH4) show either a volcano&#8208;type or an inverted volcano&#8208;type dependence on the x values, with the extreme point at x=0.1. Among them, at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V, the L1.9C delivers the optimal activity (51.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (41.5&#8201;%) for C2+, comparable to or better than those of most reported Cu&#8208;based oxides, while the L1.7C exhibits the best activity (25.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (22.1&#8201;%) for CH4. Such optimized CER properties could be ascribed to the favorable merits brought by the cation&#8208;deficiency&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies and/or CuO/RP hybrids, including the facilitated adsorption/activation of key reaction species and thus the manipulated reaction pathways.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced C4&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Pyridinium Salts with Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;carbonyl alkylation of pyridines was developed by employing various cyclopropanols and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts under mild conditions. This method provides as an effective tool for the synthesis of valuable &#946;&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;functionalized carbonyl frameworks with excellent C4 selectivity and the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex and medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization of heteroarenes is of considerable importance for streamlining the rapid modification of bioactive molecules. Herein, we report a general strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;carbonyl alkylation at the C4 position of pyridines with high site selectivity using various cyclopropanols and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. In this process, hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer between the generated sulfonamidyl radicals and O&#8722;H bonds of cyclopropanols generates &#946;&#8208;carbonyl radicals, providing efficient access to synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;pyridylated (aryl)ketones, aldehydes, and esters with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. In addition, the mild method serves as an effective tool for the site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex and medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Phosphorus&#8208;Directed Borylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphines turned to be powerful directing groups for the electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation of arenes. The reaction involves P&#8208;stabilized boreniums as key intermediates. It provides a direct, efficient, and general way of preparing phosphine&#8211;boranes.







Abstract
Spectacular progress has recently been achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines as well as directed electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation. As shown here, P&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation provides a new, straightforward, and efficient access to phosphine&#8211;boranes. It operates under metal&#8208;free conditions and leverages simple, readily available substrates. It is applicable to a broad range of backbones (naphthyl, biphenyl, N&#8208;phenylpyrrole, binaphthyl, benzyl, naphthylmethyl) and gives facile access to various substitution patterns at boron (by varying the boron electrophile or post&#8208;derivatizing the borane moiety). NMR monitoring supports the involvement of P&#8208;stabilized borenium cations as key intermediates. DFT calculations reveal the existence and stabilizing effect of &#960;&#8208;arene/boron interactions in the (biphenyl)(i&#8208;Pr)2P&#8594;BBr2+ species.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Multiphoton Excitation Regulator for the Activation of Inert C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through covalent modification of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide mimics and CeIII&#8208;OEt moieties in a metal&#8211;organic framework, a new multiphoton excitation approach was developed. This new strategy enables step&#8208;by&#8208;step triggering of the photoinduced electron transfer, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer and hydrogen atom transfer processes for activation of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and oxygen.







Abstract
The activation and oxidization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into value&#8208;added chemicals affords attractively economic and ecological benefits as well as central challenge in modern chemistry. Inspired by the natural enzymatic transformation, herein, we report a new multiphoton excitation approach to activate the inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and oxygen by integrating the photoinduced electron transfer (PET), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) events together into one metal&#8208;organic framework. The well&#8208;modified nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) mimics oxidized CeIII&#8208;OEt moieties to generate CeIV&#8208;OEt chromophore and its reduced state mimics NAD. via PET. The in situ formed CeIV&#8208;OEt moiety triggers a LMCT excitation to form the alkoxy radical EtO., abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, accompanying the recovery of CeIII&#8208;OEt and the formation of alkyl radicals. The formed NAD. activates oxygen to regenerate the NAD+ for next recycle, wherein, the activated oxygen species interacts with the intermediates for the oxidization functionalization, paving a catalytic avenue for developing scalable and sustainable synthetic strategy.

The formed &lt;b&gt;NAD&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; activates oxygen to regenerate the &lt;b&gt;NAD&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for next recycle, wherein, the activated oxygen species interacts with the intermediates for the oxidization functionalization, paving a catalytic avenue for developing scalable and sustainable synthetic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Short&#8208;Wavelength Phase&#8208;Matching Second Harmonic Generation in Boron&#8208;Rich Borosulfate with Planar [BO3] Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borosulfate consisting of condensed tetrahedral [BO4] and [SO4] units always possesses small birefringence and unsatisfied phase&#8208;matching property. For the first time, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planner [BO3] group has been introduced into borosulfate, leading to an evidently enhanced birefringence and a short&#8208;wavelength phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation in ABSO.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals which can produce short&#8208;wavelength lasers via a direct second harmonic generation (SHG) process are of great importance in modern laser technology. Currently, the exploration of UV NLO crystals in borosulfates is nearly stagnant since the non&#8208;phase matching (PM) property lies on the small birefringence induced by the intrinsically small optical anisotropy of the tetrahedral groups. Herein, for the first time, the planar [BO3] units were introduced into borosulfates leading to a boron&#8208;rich borosulfate (NH4)2B4SO10 with unprecedented [B4SO10]&#8734; layers and evidently enhanced birefringence. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves the shortest SHG PM wavelength of 252&#8197;nm in all reported borosulfates with deep UV cutoff edge (184&#8197;nm), large SHG response (1.1&#215;KDP at 1064&#8197;nm and 0.15&#215;&#946;&#8208;BBO at 532&#8197;nm) and large birefringence (0.053 at 1064&#8197;nm) and is easy to grow single crystals via simple chemical vapor deposition method. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing planar [BO3] units to optimize birefringence of borosulfates, and also open up broad prospects for UV NLO crystals in boron&#8208;rich borosulfates.

         <title>Sink/Float Magnetic Immunoassays for In&#8208;Field Bioassays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sink/float magnetic immunoassays detect proteins, antibodies, and bacteria in samples using a simple mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe protocol that uses a biofunctionalized small sphere, some liquid reagents and a small permanent magnet. A simple sink/float test of the sphere identifies if the analyte is above or below a predetermined level; the sphere sinks only if the analyte is above the concentration level.







Abstract
Analytical tests/devices that are used outside laboratory settings are required to have a very simple analytical protocol to get clearance by regulatory authorities. This study describes sink/float magnetic immunoassays, a new type of rapid, mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe, instrument&#8208;free tests for the detection of biomarkers in untreated biological samples that are very simple and might meet the simple&#8208;to&#8208;use criterion of authorities to be used in the field. These tests can tell whether an analyte is above or below a predetermined level within 25&#8211;45&#8197;minutes based on the sinking or floating of a mm&#8208;sized sphere on the surface of which an immunoassay that uses reporter antibodies conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles is performed. This manuscript describes the theory and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of sink/float magnetic immunoassays for the detection of C&#8208;Reactive Protein, anti&#8208;Treponema pallidum antibodies and E.&#8197;coli bacteria.

         <title>Strong SHG Responses in a Beryllium&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Hydroxyborate via Covalent Bond Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical hydroxyborate, NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), was constructed by a covalent bond modification strategy via a facile hydrothermal reaction. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH is SHG&#8208;active at both 1064&#8197;nm and 532&#8197;nm, with deep&#8208;UV transparency to wavelengths below 190&#8197;nm, and good phase&#8208;matchability in the near deep&#8208;UV region, a rare combination for NLO hydroxyborates.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are key materials in creating tunable deep&#8208;UV lasers for frequency conversion technology. However, practical application of the sole usable crystal, KBe2BO3F2, has been hindered by the high toxicity of beryllium and its layering tendency in crystal growth. Herein, we report a beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;UV NLO material NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), synthesized by a covalent bond modification strategy under hydrothermal conditions. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH exhibits strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at 1064&#8197;nm (3.3 &#215; KH2PO4) and 532&#8197;nm (0.55 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4), both amongst the largest powder SHG responses for a deep&#8208;UV borate, with good phase&#8208;matchability and a short wavelength cutoff edge (below 190&#8197;nm). NSBOH possesses a 3D covalent anionic [B9O19]&#8734; honeycomb&#8208;like framework with no layering. The Sr2+ and Na+ ions, residing in the cavities of the anionic framework, act as templates for the assembly and favorable alignment of NLO&#8208;active groups, resulting in an optimal balance between strong SHG activities and wide UV transparency. These merits indicate NSBOH is a very attractive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO applications.

         <title>Selective Benzylic CH&#8208;Borylations by Tandem Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inexpensive cobalt catalyst enables the combination of benzylic CH&#8208;borylation and dehydrocoupling to an overall acceptorless dehydrogenative functionalization of hydrocarbons at mild conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate a tandem catalysis via molecular CoI catalysts.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activations are environmentally and economically attractive synthetic strategies for the construction of functional molecules as they obviate the need for pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and minimize waste generation. Great challenges reside in the control of selectivities, the utilization of unbiased hydrocarbons, and the operation of atom&#8208;economical dehydrocoupling mechanisms. An especially mild borylation of benzylic CH bonds was developed with the ligand&#8208;free pre&#8208;catalyst Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 and the bench&#8208;stable and inexpensive borylation reagent B2pin2 that produces H2 as the only by&#8208;product. A full set of kinetic, spectroscopic, and preparative mechanistic studies are indicative of a tandem catalysis mechanism of CH&#8208;borylation and dehydrocoupling via molecular CoI catalysts.

         <title>Rigid Bridge&#8208;Confined Double&#8208;Decker Platinum(II) Complexes Towards High&#8208;Performance Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence</title>

Strong intramolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt/&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions confined by rigid bridges lead to fast radiative decay and high&#8208;efficiency red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence from triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) excited states. Together with short emission lifetimes, high&#8208;performance red and NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A molecular design to high&#8208;performance red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) emitters remains demanding. Herein a series of dinuclear platinum(II) complexes featuring strong intramolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions has been developed by using N&#8208;deprotonated &#945;&#8208;carboline as a bridging ligand. The complexes in doped thin films exhibit efficient red to NIR emission from short&#8208;lived (&#964;=0.9&#8211;2.1&#8197;&#956;s) triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) excited states. Red OLEDs demonstrate high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 23.3&#8201;% among the best PtII&#8208;complex&#8208;doped devices. The maximum EQE of 15.0&#8201;% and radiance of 285&#8197;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 for NIR OLEDs (&#955;EL=725&#8197;nm) are unprecedented for devices based on discrete molecular emitters. Both red and NIR devices show very small efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness. Appealing operational lifetimes have also been revealed for the devices. This work sheds light on the potential of intramolecular metallophilicity for long&#8208;wavelength molecular emitters and electroluminescence.

         <title>Near&#8208;Equilibrium Growth of Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Framework/Graphene Oxide Hybrid Materials for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;phase method has been developed for the synthesis of highly conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Vacuum filtration leads to the formation of a uniform conducting film of the COFs and COF&#8208;GO hybrid materials on a variety of substrates. The overpotential of one of the materials was as low as 45&#8197;mV in 0.5&#8201;m H2SO4 and reached a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is better than all the metal&#8208;free catalysts currently available.







Abstract
Facile synthesis and post&#8208;processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under mild synthetic conditions are highly sought after and important for widespread utilizations in catalysis and energy storage. Here we report the synthesis of the chemically stable aza&#8208;fused COFs BPT&#8208;COF and PT&#8208;COF by a liquid&#8208;phase method. The process involves the spontaneous polycondensation of vicinal diamines and vicinal diketones, and is driven by the near&#8208;equilibrium growth of COF domains at a very low monomer concentration. The method permits in&#8197;situ assembly of COFs and COF&#8208;GO hybrid materials and leads to the formation of a uniform conducting film on arbitrary substrates on vacuum filtration. When used as electrocatalysts, the as&#8208;prepared membranes show a fast hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential (45&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a small Tafel slope (53&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), which are the best among metal&#8208;free catalysts. Our results may open a new route towards the preparation of highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Design and Development of a Bioorthogonal, Visualizable and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important endogenous gasotransmitter, but the targeted delivery and real&#8208;time feedback of exogenous H2S are still challenging. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) compound, which can react with a strained alkyne via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and the retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to generate carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the precursor of H2S, and a thiophene derivative with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Moreover, the diphenylamino substituent in DTO greatly increases the mitochondrial targeting of this H2S delivery system. Such a bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has integrated three functions in one system for the first time: (1) in&#8208;situ controllable H2S release, (2) concomitant fluorescence response, and (3) mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential loss alleviation by using this system in H9c2 cells under oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Raman probing of hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8208;graphene interfaces with atomic layer accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic metals under photoexcitation can generate energetic hot electrons to directly induce chemical reactions. However, the capability and fundamental insights of the transportation of these hot electrons at plasmonic metal&#8208;2D material interfaces remain unclear. Herein, hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8208;graphene interfaces has been in situ studied using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with atomic layer accuracy. Combining in situ SERS studies with density functional theory calculations, it is proved that hot electrons can be injected from plasmonic Au nanoparticles to graphene and directly penetrate graphene to trigger photocatalytic reactions. With increasing graphene layers, the transportation of hot electrons decays rapidly and would be completely blocked after five layers of graphene. Moreover, the transfer of hot electrons can be modulated by applying an external electric field, and the hot&#8208;electron transfer efficiency under electrochemical conditions is improved by over three times in the presence of a monolayer of graphene. These fundamental understandings about hot&#8208;electron transfer provide insightful information to promote the design of more efficient plasmonic materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single&#8208;atom catalysts have received widespread attentions and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non&#8208;metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) via high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C&#8208;Se&#8208;C bond. Impressively, the obtained single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability that even surpass state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noble metal catalysts and many previously reported nanocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Se single atoms can serve as the ORR active sites and contribute to lowering the reaction barrier. Our discoveries demonstrate the promising prospects for utilizing metal&#8208;free single atom&#8208;based materials for efficient electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adequate hole mobility is the prerequisite for dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs). Constraining configurational variation of polymer chains to afford a rigid and planar backbone can reduce unfavorable reorganization energy and improve hole mobility.  Herein, a noncovalently conformational locking via S&#8208;&#8208;O secondary interaction is exploited in a phenanthrocarbazole (  PC  ) based polymeric HTM,  PC6  , to fix molecular geometries and significantly reduce reorganization energy. Systematic study from structurally explicit repeats to targeted polymers reveals that the broad and planar backbone of  PC  remarkably enhances &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of adjacent polymers, facilitating intermolecular charge transfer greatly. The inserted &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; oxygen atoms passivate the trap sites efficiently at perovskite/HTM interface and further depressing interfacial recombination. Consequently, PSC employing  PC6  as dopant&#8208;free HTM offers an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.2% and significantly improved longevity, rendering it as one of the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparing two&#8208;dimensional ordered Li0.33La0.557TiO3 crystal in interlayer channel of thin laminar inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte towards ultrafast Li+ transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic superionic conductor holds great promise for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the ionic conductivity of traditional inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is always unsatisfactory owing to the grain boundary resistance and large thickness. Here, a 13 &#956;m&#8208;thick laminar framework with ~ 1.3 nm interlayer channels is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling rigid, hydrophilic vermiculite (Vr) nanosheets. Then, Li  0.33  La  0.557  TiO  3  (LLTO) precursors are impregnated in interlayer channels and afterwards in&#8208;situ sintered to large&#8208;size, oriented, and defect&#8208;free LLTO crystal. We demonstrate that the confinement effect permits ordered arrangement of LLTO crystal along the c&#8208;axis (the fastest Li  +  transfer direction), permitting the resultant 15 &#956;m&#8208;thick Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte an ionic conductivity of 8.22&#215;10  &#8722;5  S cm  &#8722;1  and conductance of 87.2 mS at 30  o  C. These values are several times&#8217; higher than that of traditional LLTO&#8208;based electrolytes. Moreover, Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte has a compressive modulus of 1.24 GPa. Excellent cycling performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO  4  battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Metallacycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Photosensitizer for In Vivo Image&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Inactivation of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infection is one of the greatest threats to public health. In vivo real&#8208;time monitoring and effective treatment of infected sites through non&#8208;invasive techniques, remain a challenge. Herein, we designed a Pt(II) metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer through the host&#8211;guest interaction between a pillar[5]arene&#8208;modified metallacycle and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl]pyridinium. Benefit from this design, such supramolecular photosensitizer, with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, demonstrated improved fluorescence performance and efficient photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of bacteria. In vivo studies revealed that it displayed precise fluorescence tracking of  S. aureus  &#8208;infected sites, and in situ performed image&#8208;guided efficient PDI of  S. aureus  without noticeable side effects. These results demonstrated that metallacycle combined with host&#8208;guest chemistry could provide a paradigm for the development of powerful photosensitizers for biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Imparting CO2 Electroreduction Auxiliary for Integrated Morphology Tuning and Performance Boosting in a Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies that enable simultaneous morphology&#8208;tuning and electroreduction performance boosting are much desired for the exploration of covalent organic frameworks in efficient CO2 electroreduciton. Herein, a kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and investigate their CO2 electroreduction performance. The obtained nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Tph&#8208;COF&#8208;Dct) with large&#8208;scale (~1.0 &#956;m) and ultrathin (~3.8 nm) morphology enable a superior FECH4 (~80%) (almost doubly enhanced than bare COF) with large current&#8208;density (&#8208;220.0 mA cm&#8208;2) at &#8208;0.9 V. The boosted performance can be ascribed to the immobilized functionalizing exfoliation agent (Dct groups) with integrated amino and triazine groups that strengthen CO2 absorption/activation, stabilize intermediates and enrich the CO concentration around the Cu active sites as revealed by DFT calculations. The point&#8208;to&#8208;point functionalization strategy for modularly assembling Dct&#8208;functionalized COF catalyst for CO2 electroreduction will open up the attractive possibility of developing COFs as efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in the Sensing and Treatment of Wound Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wound biofilms represent a particularly challenging problem in modern medicine. They are increasingly antibiotic resistant and can prevent the healing of chronic wounds. However, current treatment and diagnostic options are hampered by the complexity of the biofilm environment. In this review, we present new chemical avenues in biofilm sensors and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offering promise for better detection, chemical specificity, and biocompatibility. We briefly discuss existing methods for biofilm detection and focus on novel, sensor&#8208;based approaches that show promise for early, accurate detection of biofilm formation on wound sites and that can be translated to point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. We then discuss technologies inspired by new materials for efficient biofilm eradication. We focus on ultrasound&#8208;induced microbubbles and nanomaterials that can both penetrate the biofilm and simultaneously carry active antimicrobials and discuss the benefits of those approaches in comparison to conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Structural Changes and Thermodynamics in Protein Phase Separation Processes of an Intrinsically Ordered&#8208;Disordered Protein Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastin&#8208;like proteins (ELPs) are biologically important proteins and models for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and dynamic structural transitions associated with coacervates and liquid&#8208;liquid phase transitions. However, the conformational status below and above coacervation temperature and its role in the phase separation process is still elusive. Employing matrix least&#8208;squares global Boltzmann&#8208;fitting of the circular dichroism spectra of the ELPs (VPGVG)  20  , (VPGVG)  40  and (VPGVG)  60  , we found that coacervation occurs sharply when a certain number of repeat units has acquired &#946;&#8208;turn conformation (in our sequence setting a threshold of ~20 repeat units). The differential scattering of the coacervate suspensions indicated that this fraction of &#946;&#8208;turn structure is still retained after polypeptide assembly. Such conformational thresholds may also have a role in other protein assembly processes with implications for the design of protein&#8208;based smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical, Highly Open Microtubes and Columnar Liquid Crystals Self&#8208;Assembled from Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Colloidal Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of simple building blocks to produce hierarchical and porous structured materials is highly desired. Rings are simple colloidal particles but unique for their internal cavities. Here we report the self&#8208;assembly (SA) of colloidal rings with tunable asymmetry mediated by a depletion force and demonstrate a variety of porous colloidal superstructure from microtubes, flexible chains, (plastic) crystals to highly open liquid crystals (LCs) can be formed along the predesigned SA paths. In particular, the SA is staged in binary or ternary systems. Large rings first form complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies by capturing smaller rings, which, as new building blocks, can further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. Moreover, a plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found from asymmetrical rings. The SA with colloidal rings opens a new avenue to construct hierarchical and porous ordered metamaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>19F NMR Allows to Investigate the Fate of Platinum(IV) Prodrugs in Physiological Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pt(IV) prodrugs can overcome resistance and side effects of conventional Pt(II) anticancer therapies. By  19  F&#8208;labeling of a Pt(IV) prodrug (Pt&#8208;FBA, FBA =  p  &#8208;fluorobenzoate), the activation under physiological conditions could be investigated. It is found that, unlike single&#8208;electron reductants, multi&#8208;electron agents can efficiently promote the two electrons reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II). Moreover, the activation of Pt&#8208;FBA in cell lysate is highly dependent upon the type of cancer cells. When administered to  E. coli  , Pt&#8208;FBA is reduced intracellularly and free FBA can shuttle out of the cell. Interestingly, the reduction rate greatly increases by inducing metallothionein overexpression and is lowered by addition of Zn(II) ions. Finally, when injected into mice, Pt&#8208;FBA undergoes fast reduction in the bloodstream accompanied by metabolic degradation of FBA; nevertheless, unreduced Pt&#8208;FBA can accumulate to detectable levels in liver and kidneys. The proposed  19  F&#8208;NMR approach has the advantage of avoiding the interference of all background signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Containing Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites for Capture of Low&#160;Concentration Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capture of low concentration CO  2  presents numerous challenges. Here, we report that zinc containing chabazite (CHA) zeolites can realize high capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, and low desorption energy when capturing  ca.  400 ppm CO  2  . Control of the state and location of the zinc ions in the CHA cage is critical to the performance. Zn  2+  loaded onto paired anionic sites in the six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) in the CHA cage are the primary sites to adsorb  ca.  0.51 mmol CO  2  /g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=  ca.  7, a 17&#8208;fold increase compared to the parent H&#8208;form. The capacity is increased further to  ca.  0.67 mmol CO  2  /g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=  ca.  2 due to more paired sites for zinc exchange. Zeolites with double six&#8208;membered rings (D6MRs) that orient 6MRs into the cages give enhanced uptakes for CO  2  adsorption with zinc exchange. The results reveal that zinc exchanged CHA and several other small pore, cage containing zeolites are worthy of further investigation for the capture of low concentration CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Interface pH by N&#8208;Modified Graphdiyne for Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn dendrite issue was intensively studied via tuning zinc ion flux. pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. Here, we construct a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface (NGI) to stabilize pH by mediating hydrated zinc ion desolvation. Operando pH detection reveals pH stabilization by NGI. This works with pores in NGI to achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and an increased symmetric cell lifespan by 116 times. Experimental and theoretical results owe pH stabilization to desolvation with a reduced activation energy achieved by electron transfer from solvation sheath to N atom. The efficient desolvation ensures that electron directly transfers from substrate to Zn2+  (rather than the coordinated H2O), avoiding O&#8208;H bond splitting. Hence, Zn&#8208;V6O13  battery achieves a long lifespan at 20.65 mA cm&#8208;2  and 1.07 mAh cm&#8208;2. This work reveals the significance of interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) membranes with high pore density and tunable pore size down to subnanoscale exhibit great potentials in ion separation when appropriately designed and prepared. By a washing&#8208;assisted secondary growing method, a well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along [022] direction is synthesized on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)&#8208;modified AAO substrate. Because of the oriented growth of UiO&#8208;67 nanocrystals, highly interconnected ion&#8208;transporting channels are created throughout the UiO&#8208;67/AAO membrane to achieve ultrahigh Li  +  permeance of 27.01 mol&#183;m  &#8722;2  &#183;h  &#8722;1  as well as very decent Li  +  /Mg  2+  selectivity of up to 159.4. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high selectivity is associated with the large disparity of transport energy barrier between Li  +  and Mg  2+  , which is caused by different extent of ion dehydration in unique bimodal and oriented membrane channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Lactone Backbone Density in Rigid Electron&#8208;Deficient Semiconducting Polymers Enabling High n&#8208;type Organic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three lactone&#8208;based rigid semiconducting polymers were designed to overcome major limitations in the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics, namely electrical conductivity and air stability. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated that increasing the lactone group density by increasing the benzene content from 0% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50% (P&#8208;50), and 75% (P&#8208;75) resulted in progressively larger electron affinities (up to 4.37 eV), suggesting a more favorable doping process, when employing (N&#8208;DMBI) as the dopant. Larger polaron delocalization was also evident, due to the more planarized conformation, which is proposed to lead to a lower hopping energy barrier. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity increased by three orders of magnitude, to achieve values of up to 12 S/cm and Power factors of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 were thereby enabled. These findings present new insights into material design guidelines for the future development of air stable n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Li&#8208;CO2 Battery Enabled by Carbon Nanotube/Carbon Nitride Heterostructured Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;CO2  batteries are explored as promising power systems to alleviate environmental issues and to implement space applications. However, sluggish cathode kinetics of CO2  reduction/evolution result in low round&#8208;trip efficiency and poor cycling stability of the fabricated energy&#8208;storage devices. Herein, we design a heterostructued photocathode comprising carbon nanotube and carbon nitride to accelerate cathode reactions of a Li&#8208;CO2  battery under illumination. Benefiting from the unique defective structure of carbon nitride&#160;and favorable interfacial charge transfer, the photocathode effectively harvests ultraviolet&#8208;visible light to generate abundant photoexcited carriers and coordinates energetic photoelectrons/holes to participate in the discharge/charge reactions, leading to efficient photo&#8208;energy utilization in decreasing reaction barriers and enhancing thermodynamic reversibility of Li&#8208;CO2  battery. The resulting battery delivers high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8% (ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.04 V) and superior cycling stability (86.1% efficiency retention after 100 cycles).</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Li-CO2  batteries are explored as promising power systems to alleviate environmental issues and to implement space applications. However, sluggish cathode kinetics of CO2  reduction/evolution result in low round-trip efficiency and poor cycling stability of the fabricated energy-storage devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy&#8208;efficient selective physisorption driven C2H2 separation from industrial C2&#8208;C1 impurities such as C2H4, CO2 and CH4 marks high importance in the purification of downstream commodity chemicals. We address this challenge employing a series of isoreticular cationic metal&#8208;organic frameworks, namely iMOF&#8208;nC (n = 5, 6, 7). All three square lattice topology MOFs registered higher C2H2 uptakes versus the competing C2&#8208;C1 gases (C2H4, CO2 and CH4). Dynamic column breakthrough experiments on the best&#8208;performing iMOF&#8208;6C revealed the first three&#8208;in&#8208;one C2H2 adsorption selectivity guided separation of C2H2 from 1:1 C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CH4 mixtures. Density functional theory calculations critically examined the C2H2 selective interactions in iMOF&#8208;nC. Thanks to the abundance of square lattice topology MOFs, this study introduces a crystal engineering blueprint for designing C2H2&#8208;selective layered metal&#8208;organic physisorbents, previously unreported in cationic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolation of the neutral homocyclic silylene 2 is possible via amine ligand abstraction with potassium graphite (KC8) and subsequent reaction with SiMe3Cl from a bicyclic silicon(I) amide J. This reaction proceeds via an anionic homoaromatic silicon ring compound 1 as an intermediate. The twofold&#8208;coordinated silicon atom in the homocyclic silylene 2 is stabilized by an allyl&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. 2 reacts in an oxidative addition with 2 equivalents of MeOH and in cycloadditions with ethene, phenylacetylene, diphenylacetylene and with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene to afford novel functionalized ring compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Bonded Cubic AsN from High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Chemical Reactivity of Arsenic and Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reactivity between As and N2  , leading to the synthesis of crystalline arsenic nitride, is here reported under high pressure and high temperature conditions generated by laser heating in a Diamond Anvil Cell. Single crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at different pressures between 30 and 40 GPa provides evidence for the synthesis of a covalent compound of AsN stoichiometry, crystallizing in a cubic  P213 space group, in which each of the two elements is single&#8208;bonded to three atoms of the other and hosts an electron lone pair, in a tetrahedral anisotropic coordination. The identification of characteristic structural motifs highlights the key role played by the directional repulsive interactions between non&#8208;bonding electron lone pairs in the formation of the AsN structure. Additional data indicate the existence of AsN at room temperature from 9.8 up to 50 GPa. Implications concern fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and the synthesis of innovative advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy Versus Enthalpy Controlled Temperature/Redox Dual&#8208;Triggered Cages for Selective Anion Encapsulation and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New C3&#8208;symmetric imidazole ligands were designed with phosphine and phosphine oxide linkers (LP and LPO, respectively) to demonstrate a dual&#8208;triggered dynamic closed coordination cage. Both LP and LPO form discrete Zn4L4&#8208;closed cages (1P and 1PO, respectively) with excellent selectively for BPh4&#8722;, whereas 1P and 1PO encapsulate neither a slightly larger size anion [B(C6H4CH3)4&#8722;] nor smaller size anions (BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, SbF6&#8722;, and OSO2CF3&#8722;). 1PO exhibits more negative enthalpy and entropy changes upon anion encapsulation, thus releasing almost all of the encapsulated anions at high temperature (343 K) (trigger 1: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1PO &#8644; 1PO + BPh4&#8722;). In contrast 1P has less negative enthalpy and entropy changes, thus preserving the captured anion over a wide range of temperatures (298 K to 343 K). The 1P cage can be quantitatively oxidized to the 1PO cage by a mild oxidant (Ox. = H2O2), and therefore the captured anion can be released by a redox triggering event (trigger 2: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1P + Ox. &#8594; 1PO + BPh4&#8722;).</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme FtmOx1 catalyzes the endoperoxide biosynthesis of verruculogen. Although several mechanistic studies have been carried out, the catalytic mechanism of FtmOx1 is not well determined due to the lack of the reliable complex structure of FtmOx1 with fumitremorgin B. Here we provided the X&#8208;ray structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8226;2OG&#8226;fumitremorgin B at resolution of 1.22 &#197;. Our structures show that the binding of fumitremorgin B has induced the significant compression of the active pocket and Y68 in close proximity to C26 of the substrate. Further MD simulation and QM/MM calculations support the CarC&#8208;like mechanism proposed by Bollinger and coworkers, in which Y68 rather than Y224 acts as the H atom donor for quenching the C26&#8208;centered substrate radical. Our work is consistent with all available experimental data and highlights the importance of the accurate complex structure in mechanistic study of enzymatic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Chemiresistive Detection of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the demonstration of a series of heterobimetallic, isoreticular 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metallophthalocyanine (MPc, M=Co and Ni) units interconnected by Cu nodes towards low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensing of ppm&#8208;levels of carbon monoxide (CO). Devices achieve sub&#8208;part&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) limits of detection (LOD) of 0.53 ppm toward CO at low driving voltages of 0.1 V. MPc&#8208;based Cu&#8208;linked MOFs can continuously detect CO at 50 ppm, the permissible exposure limit required by Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, for multiple exposures and realize CO detection in air and humid environment. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and comparison experiments suggest the contribution of Cu nodes for CO binding and the essential role of MPc units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.</dc:description>

Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and comparison experiments suggest the contribution of Cu nodes for CO binding and the essential role of MPc units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Activatable Afterglow/MRI Bimodal Nanoprobe with Fast Response to H2S for In Vivo Imaging of Acute Hepatitis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate detection of hepatic hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) to monitor H  2  S&#8208;related enzymes&#8217; activity is critical for acute hepatitis diagnosis, but remains a challenge due to the dynamic and transient nature of H  2  S. Here, we report a H  2  S&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared afterglow/MRI bimodal probe  F1  &#8208;GdNP, which shows an &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; MRI signal and &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; afterglow signal toward H  2  S.  F1  &#8208;GdNP shows fast response, high sensitivity and specificity toward H  2  S, permitting afterglow imaging of H  2  S and evaluation of cystathionine  &#947;  &#8208;lyase&#8217;s activity in living mice. We further employ the high spatial&#8208;resolution MRI signal of  F1  &#8208;GdNP to track its delivery and accumulation in liver. Importantly,  F1  &#8208;GdNP offers a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR = 86.2 &#177; 12.0) to sensitively report on the increased hepatic H  2  S level in the acute hepatitis mice via afterglow imaging, which correlated well with the upregulated CSE activity in the liver, showcasing the good potential of  F1  &#8208;GdNP for monitoring of acute hepatitis process in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Unexpectedly High Capacitance of the Metal Nanoparticle/Water Interface &#8211; Molecular Level Insights into the Electrical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrical double&#8208;layer plays a key role in important interfacial electrochemical processes from catalysis to energy stor&#8208;age and corrosion. Therefore, understanding its structure is crucial for the progress of sustainable technologies. We extract new physico&#8208;chemical information on the capacitance and structure of the electrical double&#8208;layer of platinum and gold nanoparticles at the molecular level, employing single nanoparticle electrochemistry. We reveal that the charge storage ability of the solid/liquid interface is larger by one order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude than predicted by the traditional mean&#8208;field models of the double&#8208;layer such as the Gouy&#8208;Chapman&#8208;Stern&#8208;model. Performing Molecular Dynamics simulations, we investigate the possible relationship between the measured high capacitance and adsorption strength of the water adlayer formed at the metal surface. These insights may launch the active tuning of solid&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions as innovative design strategy to transform energy technologies towards superior performance and sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Hexagonal Column Interpenetrated Spheres from Plant Polyphenol/Cationic Surfactants and Their Application as Antimicrobial Molecular Banks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial infections has become a great threat to human health and one of the main risks arises from direct contact with the surfaces contaminated by pathogenic microbes. Developing long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial materials becomes an urgent need. Herein, a kind of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are fabricated by non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid with quaternary ammonium surfactants. Different from one&#8208;time burst release of conventional antimicrobial agents, the HCIS acts like a &#8220;antimicrobial molecular bank&#8221; and releases the antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, leading to long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial performance. Taking advantage of strong hydrophobicity and adhesion, HCISs are applicable to various substrates and endowed with anti&#8208;water washing property, thus showing high  in vitro  antimicrobial efficiency ( &gt; 99 %) even after being used for 10 cycles. Meanwhile, HCISs exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, and have good biocompatibility with mammalian cells. Such a low&#8208;cost and portable long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent meets the growing anti&#8208;infection demand in public spaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Triplet Generation Promoted via Spiro&#8208;Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro&#8208;linked bichromophoric molecular systems are superior for triplet excited state generation. First, the two chromophores are tethered into a close proximity not accessible via alternative linkage, promoting spiro&#8208;conjugation mediated charge&#8208;transfer (CT). Second, the spiro&#8208;orthogonality inhibit FRET&#8208;type non&#8208;radiative deactivation and high rigidity largely suppresses vibronic energy dissipation. An intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant of 1.0&#215;10  11  s  &#8208;1  was previously registered with a spiro&#8208;bis&#8208;benzophenone scaffold. We envisage that triplet generation efficiency could be further enhanced by stabilizing the spiro&#8208;CT state and rationally designed a family of spiro&#8208;compounds (SCTs), which consist of electron&#8208;rich diphenyl ether as the spiro&#8208;CT donor and electron&#8208;deficient dinaphthyl ketone as the spiro&#8208;CT acceptor. Through fine&#8208;tuning of the energy level between the CT and high energy triplet states, near&#8208;unity triplet generation quantum yield was achieved and the underlying ISC mechanism is revealed by using ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Finally, potential triplet sensitizing application was demonstrated in SCTs. Our findings suggest that spiro&#8208;bichromophoric molecular system with an enhanced spiro&#8208;charge transfer warrants efficient triplet generation and represents a powerful design strategy of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet sensitizers with predictable ISC property.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibitor&#8208;Mediated Structural Transition in a Minimal Amyloid Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fundamental clinical importance of amyloid fibril formation, its mechanism is still enigmatic. Crystallography of minimal amyloid models was a milestone in understanding of the architecture and biological activities of amyloid fibers. However, the crystal structure of ultimate dipeptide&#8208;based amyloids is not yet reported. Herein, we present the crystal structure of a typical amyloid&#8208;forming minimal dipeptide, Ac&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;NH2 (Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2), showing a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. The simplicity of the structure helped in investigating amyloid&#8208;inhibition using crystallography, never previously reported for larger peptide models. Interestingly, in the presence of an inhibitor, the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix). This study promotes our understanding of the mechanism of amyloid formation and of the structural transitions that occur during the inhibition process in a most fundamental model.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cu/Ru/Os Complexes: Observation of Conformational Differences Between the Solution Phase and Solid State by Atomic Pair Distribution Function Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering and pair distribution function analysis (HEXS/PDF) is a powerful method to reveal the structure of materials lacking long&#8208;range order, but is underutilized for molecular complexes in solution. Here we demonstrate the application of HEXS/PDF with 0.26 &#197; resolution to uncover the solution structure of five bimetallic Os(II)/Ru(II)/Cu(I) complexes. HEXS/PDF of each complex in acetonitrile solution confirms the pairwise interactions in the local coordination sphere of each metal center as well as the metal&#183;&#183;&#183;metal interactions separated by over 12 &#197;. The metal&#183;&#183;&#183;metal distance detected in solution is compared with that from the crystal structure and molecular models to confirm that distortions to the metal bridging ligand are unique to the solid state. This work presents the first example of observing sub&#8208;&#197; conformational difference by direct comparison of solution phase and solid&#8208;state structures and shows the potential for HEXS/PDF in the determination of solution structure of single molecules.</dc:description>

HEXS/PDF of each complex in acetonitrile solution confirms the pairwise interactions in the local coordination sphere of each metal center as well as the metal&#183;&#183;&#183;metal interactions separated by over 12 &#197;. The metal&#183;&#183;&#183;metal distance detected in solution is compared with that from the crystal structure and molecular models to confirm that distortions to the metal bridging ligand are unique to the solid state. This work presents the first example of observing sub-&#197; conformational difference by direct comparison of solution phase and solid-state structures and shows the potential for HEXS/PDF in the determination of solution structure of single molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface chelation induced by pyridine&#8208;based polymer for efficient and durable air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer doping is a significant approach to precisely control nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites and enhance electronic quality in perovskite solar cells (PSC) prepared in air. Here, a brand&#8208;new self&#8208;healing polysiloxane (SHP) with dynamic 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide (PDCA) coordination units and plenty of hydrogen bonds was designed and incorporated into perovskite films. PDCA units, showing strong intermolecular Pb  2+  &#8208;N  amido  , I  &#8208;  &#8208;N  pyridyl  , and Pb  2+  &#8208;O  amido  coordination interactions, were expected to enhance crystallinity and passivate the grain boundary. In addition, abundant hydrogen bonds in SHP afforded the self&#8208;healing of cracks at grain boundaries for fatigue PSCs. Significantly, the doped device demonstrated a champion efficiency of 19.50% with inconspicuous hysteresis, almost rivaling those achieved in control atmosphere. This strategy of heterocyclic&#8208;based macromolecular doping in PSCs will pave a way for realizing efficient and durable crystalline semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Metal Catalysis towards 7&#8208;Oxostaurosporine and Its Non&#8208;Natural Septanose Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report sequential metal catalysis towards indolocarbazole glycosides. The signature event is highlighted by i) Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed addition of indolocarbazole to alkoxyallene combined with ring closing metathesis; ii) Ru&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective olefin migration; iii) Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization to build the bicyclic core structure of the target compounds. This approach gave access to both natural pyranose&#8208; and non&#8208;natural septanose glycosides. A short formal synthesis of 7&#8208;oxostaurosporine was achieved via this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysics of perylene diimide dianions and their application in photoredox catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;electron reduced forms of perylene diimides (PDIs) are luminescent closed&#8208;shell species whose photochemical properties are underexplored. Our work demonstrates that both water&#8208;soluble and lipophilic variants of PDI dianions have electronically excited states with nanosecond lifetimes that are very strongly reducing. Consequently, thermodynamically demanding photocatalytic reductive dehalogenations and reductive C&#8208;O bond cleavage reactions of lignin model compounds are possible from these excited states under irradiation with green light. Sodium dithionite acts as a convenient reductant, either in aqueous solution or in biphasic water&#8208;acetonitrile mixtures in the presence of a phase transfer reagent. A key point of our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is that straightforward (single) excitation of PDI dianions with green photons provides an excited state that is similarly or more reducing than the much shorter&#8208;lived excited states of PDI monoanions, which are typically accessible after consecutive (biphotonic) excitation with two blue photons. Furthermore, our work introduces the concept of multi&#8208;electron reduction of a photocatalyst by a sacrificial reagent (Na2S2O4) prior to its irradiation with low&#8208;energy photons as a means of generating highly reactive excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Cooperative Catalysis for the On&#8208;surface Synthesis of Linear Heteroaromatic Polymers via Selective C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiospecific C&#8208;H activation is a promising approach to achieve extended polymers with tailored structures. While a recent on&#8208;surface synthetic approach has enabled regioselective homocoupling of heteroaromatic molecules, only small oligomers have been achieved. Herein, selective C H activation for dehydrogenative C&#8722;C couplings of hexaazatriphenylene by Scholl reaction is reported for the first time. By combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we revealed the formation of one&#8208;dimensional polymers with a double&#8208;chain structure. The details of the growth process are rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, pointing out a cooperative catalytic action of Na and Ag adatoms in steering the C&#8208;H selectivity for the polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling Channel Structure&#8211;Diffusivity Relationships in Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of improved zeolite materials for applications in separation and catalysis requires understanding of mass transport. Herein, diffusion of single molecules is tracked in the straight and sinusoidal channels of the industrially relevant ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites using a combination of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and uniformly oriented zeolite thin films. Distinct motion behaviors are observed in zeolite channels with the same geometry, suggesting heterogeneous guest&#8211;host interactions. Quantification of the diffusion heterogeneities in the sinusoidal and straight channels suggests that the geometry of zeolite channels dictates the mobility and motion behavior of the guest molecules, resulting in diffusion anisotropy. The study of hierarchical zeolites shows that the addition of secondary pore networks primarily enhances the diffusivity of sinusoidal zeolite channels, and thus alleviating the diffusion limitations of microporous zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Electrical and Magnetic Properties of Layered Conductive Metal&#8722;Organic Framework With Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes structural elucidation of a layered conductive metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) material Cu  3  (C  6  O  6  )  2  by microcrystal electron diffraction with sub&#8208;angstrom precision. This insight enables the first identification of an unusual &#960;&#8208;stacking interaction in a layered MOF material characterized by an extremely short (2.70 &#197;) close packing of the ligand arising from pancake bonding. Band structure analysis suggests semiconductive properties of the MOF, which are likely related to the localized nature of pancake bonds and the formation of a singlet dimer of the ligand. The spin of Cu(II) within the Kagom&#233; arrangement dominates the paramagnetism of the MOF, leading to strong geometrical magnetic frustration.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Indole Diterpenes Paspalicine, Paspalinine, and Paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paspaline&#8208;derived indole diterpenes (IDTs) are structurally complex mycotoxins with unique tremorgenic activity. Reported are asymmetric total syntheses of three paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs paspalicine, paspalinine and paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene. Our synthesis features (1) green Achmatowicz rearrangement/bicycloketalization for efficient construction of FG rings (75% yield) and (2) cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis of dienyne for highly regioselective formation of CD rings (72% yield). Other highlights include four palladium&#8208;mediated reactions (Stille, aza&#8208;Wacker, Suzuki, and Heck) to forge the BE rings and the installation of two continuous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via reductive ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane and &#945;&#8208;methylation of conjugate ester. Our new synthetic strategy is expected to be applicable to the chemical synthesis of other paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs and will facilitate the bioactivity studies of these agriculturally and pharmacologically important IDTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrins with Multiple Pyrenyl Groups: An Approach to Organic Molecules Exhibiting Bright Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much attention because of its potential for electronic and biological applications. Herein, we report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright CPL by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An a&#8208;cyclodextrin (  CyD  ) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8208;cyclodextrins (  PCD  s) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#949; ~ 10  5  M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  ), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|  g  lum  | ~ 10  &#8211;2  ), and quantum yield (  &#934;  f  ~ 0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (  B  CPL  ) reached 340 M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  . Comprehensive photophysical and chiroptical studies of the  PCD  s with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the  CyD  with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing A New Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material, &#223;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 Inspired by the Phase Transition of the BaB2O4 (BBO) Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals play a significant role in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing a new IR NLO crystal remains a huge challenge because of the unpredictability of inorganic structures. Herein, inspired by phase transformation of the famous BaB2O4  (BBO) crystal, a temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetric (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4  to uncover a new NCS ternary chalcogenide,  &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4  which can exhibit the well&#8208;balanced NLO properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matching SHG response (~0.6&#215;AgGaS2  ), high LDT (10&#215;AgGaS2  ), and large birefringence (  &#8710;n  = 0.18 in the visible region). Therefore,  &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4  will be a promising IR NLO crystal. The analysis for the structure&#8208;property relationship shows that the excellent NLO properties of  &#946;  &#8208;BaGa2Se4  mainly originate from edge&#8208;sharing GaSe4  tetrahedral chains, which are different from B3O6  groups in  &#946;&#8208;BBO and respect a new direction for the design of IR NLO crystals. So, we believe that the current research provides not only a new IR NLO crystal but also some insights for the design of new IR NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective C(sp3)&#8208;N Bond Cleavage of N,N&#8208;Dialkyl Tertiary Amines with the Loss of a Large Alkyl Group via an SN1 Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polar disconnection of the C(sp3)&#8208;N bond of N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tertiary amines via ammonium species conventionally favored the loss of the smaller alkyl group by an SN2 displacement, while selective C(sp3)&#8208;N bond cleavage by cutting off the larger alkyl group is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present a novel Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+1] annulation, proceeding through an alkyne&#8208;directed palladacycle formation and consecutive diamination with a tertiary hydroxylamine by cleaving its N&#8208;O bond and one C(sp3)&#8208;N bond, for the rapid assembly of tricyclic indoles in a single&#8208;step transformation. Noteworthy, experimental results indicated that large tert&#8208;butyl and benzyl groups were selectively cleaved via an SN1 pathway, in the presence of a smaller alkyl group (Me, Et, iPr). Under the guidance of this new finding, tricyclic indoles bearing a removable alkyl group could be exclusively obtained by using a (a&#8208;methyl)benzyl/benzyl or tert&#8208;butyl/2&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl mixed amino source.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Biobased Synthesis of Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Petrochemical based polymers, paints and coatings are cornerstones of modern industry but our future sustainable society demands for greener processes and renewable feedstock materials. A challenge is to access platform monomers from biomass resources while integrating the principles of Green Chemistry in their chemical synthesis. Here, we present a synthesis route starting from biomassderived furfural towards the commonly used monomers maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, implementing environmentally benign photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation and ethenolysis reactions. Maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, transformed into sodium acrylate, were isolated in yields of 85% (2 steps) and 81% (4 steps), respectively. With minimal waste and high atom efficiency, this biobased route provides a viable alternative to access key monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Folding&#8208;induced Fluorescence Enhancement in a Series of Merocyanine Hetero&#8208;Folda&#8208;Trimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many dyes suffer from fast non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, thereby showing only short&#8208;lived excited states and weak photoluminescence. Here we show a pronounced fluorescence enhancement for a weakly fluorescent merocyanine (MC) dye by being stacked to other dyes in hetero&#8208;folda&#8208;trimer architectures. By means of fluorescence spectroscopy (lifetime, quantum yield) the fluorescence enhancement was explained by a decrease of the non&#8208;radiative decay rate due to the rigidifying foldamer architecture and a compared to homo&#8208;trimers increased radiative rate for the hetero&#8208;trimers due to a non&#8208;forbidden lowest exciton state. This folding&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (FIFE) for specific sequences of &#960;&#8208;stacked dyes points at a viable strategy toward improved fluorophores that relates to the approach used by nature in the green fluorescent protein (GFP).</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Oxyphosphonium Ions by&#160;Photoredox/Cobaloxime Catalysis for Scalable Amide and Peptide Synthesis in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late&#8208;stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous&#8208;flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.</dc:description>
