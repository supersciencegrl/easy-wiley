         <title>Estimating Phosphorescent Emission Energies in IrIII Complexes Using Large&#8208;Scale Quantum Computing Simulations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) quantum method was used to calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in phosphorescent IrIII complexes. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 logical qubits. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals studied, setting an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.







Abstract
Here we calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in nine phosphorescent iridium complexes using the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method to determine if quantum simulations have any advantages over classical methods. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 fully&#8208;connected logical qubits. Since such devices do not yet exist, we demonstrate the iQCC method using a purpose&#8208;built quantum simulator on classical hardware. The results are compared to a selection of common DFT functionals, ab initio methods, and empirical data. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals, but with a better correlation coefficient, demonstrating that it is better at predicting the structure&#8211;property relationship. Results indicate that the iQCC method has the required accuracy to design organometallic complexes when deployed on emerging quantum hardware and sets an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Promoted ZnMe/ZnPh Exchange in Eight&#8208;Coordinate [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of the 8&#8208;coordinate RuZn4 heterobimetallic complex [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2] with ZnPh2 leads to complete ZnMe/ZnPh exchange to form [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2]. Both species exhibit equilibria in solution with their alternative 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers and DFT calculations define facile isomerisation and hydride&#8208;assisted ZnMe/ZnPh exchange pathways.







Abstract
The syntheses, reactivity and electronic structure analyses of [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2], 1&#8201;a, and [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2], 2&#8201;b, are reported. 1&#8201;a exhibits an 8&#8208;coordinate Ru centre with axial phosphines and a symmetrical (2&#8201;:&#8201;2) arrangement of ZnMe ligands in the equatorial plane. The ZnMe ligands in 1&#8201;a undergo facile, sequential exchange with ZnPh2 to give 2&#8201;b, which shows a 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 arrangement of ZnPh ligands. Both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b exist in equilibrium with their respective 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers. Mechanisms for ZnMe/ZnPh exchange and isomerisation are proposed using DFT calculations. The relationships of these {Ru(ZnR)4H2} species to isoelectronic Group 8 transition metal polyhydrides and related Schlenk equilibria in the Negishi reaction are discussed.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Alkyl (Hetero)Aryl Ketones by an&#160;Engineered Amine Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct asymmetric reductive amination of heteroaryl ketones has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here we report the engineering of an amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) from  Jeotgalicoccus aerolatus  for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl primary amines in excellent conversions (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The best AmDH variant (  Ja  &#8208;AmDH&#8208;M3  3  ) exhibited high activity and specificity toward alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones, even for those bearing a bulky alkyl chain. An efficient directed evolution approach based on molecular docking was implemented to enlarge the active pocket with a more hydrophobic entrance, which is responsible for the high activity. The&#160;  Ja  &#8208;AmDH&#8208;M3  3  &#160;was also used for preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant amines and a key intermediate of chiral pincer ligands, which highlighted its practical application in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clean air is an indispensable prerequisite for human health. The capture of small toxic molecules requires the development of advanced materials for air filtration. Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials offer highly accessible surface areas but for real&#8208;world applications their assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical mesostructures is essential.

The structured material demonstrates enhanced accessibility of open metal sites and significantly enhanced H  2  S adsorption capacity in gas filtering tests compared with traditional bulk analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Fe(III) and Fe(IV) Cyanide Complexes Using Hypervalent Iodine&#160;Reagents as Cyano&#8208;Transfer One&#8208;Electron Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a new reactivity mode for electrophilic cyano  &#160;  &#160;  l  3  &#8208;iodanes as group transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants to synthesize Fe  III  and Fe  IV  cyanide complexes. The inherent thermal instability of high&#8208;valent Fe  IV  compounds without  pi  &#8208;donor ligands (such as oxido (O  2&#8208;  ), imido (RN  2&#8208;  ) or nitrido (N  3&#8208;  )) makes their isolation and structural characterization a very challenging task. We report the synthesis of an Fe  IV  cyanide complex [(N  3  N&#8217;)FeCN] (  4  ) by two consecutive single electron transfer (SET) processes from Fe  II  precursor [(N  3  N&#8217;)FeLi(THF)] (  1  ) with cyanobenziodoxolone (CBX). The Fe  IV  complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N  3  N&#8217;)Fe  III  ] (  3  ) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of Fe  II  with 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(1H)&#8208;1,2benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of Fe  III  cyanide complex [(N  3  N&#8217;)Fe  III  (CN)(Li)(THF)  3  ] (  2&#8208;Li  THF  ). Complexes  4  and  2Li  THF  have been structurally characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their electronic structure has been examined by M&#246;ssbauer, EPR spectroscopy, and computational analyses.</dc:description>

The Fe  IV  complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N  3  N&#8217;)Fe  III  ] (  3  ) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of Fe  II  with 1-cyano-3,3-dimethyl-3-(1H)-1,2benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of Fe  III  cyanide complex [(N  3  N&#8217;)Fe  III  (CN)(Li)(THF)  3  ] (  2-Li  THF  ). Complexes  4  and  2Li  THF  have been structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and their electronic structure has been examined by M&#246;ssbauer, EPR spectroscopy, and computational analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Mammalian Cells by 19F NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate protein behavior in physiologically relevant environments. Although proven valuable for disordered proteins, we show that in commonly used&#160;  1  H&#8208;  15  N HSQC spectra of globular proteins,&#160; interactions with cellular components often broaden resonances beyond detection. This contrasts&#160;  19  F spectra in mammalian cells, in which signals are readily observed. Using several proteins, we demonstrate that surface charges and interaction with cellular binding partners modulate linewidths and resonance frequencies. Importantly, we establish that&#160;  19  Fparamagnetic relaxation enhancements using stable, rigid Ln(III) chelate pendants, attached via non&#8208;reducible thioether bonds, provide an effective means to obtain accurate distances for assessing protein conformations in the cellular milieu.</dc:description>

         <title>Micromechanically&#8208;Powered Rolling Locomotion of Twisted&#8208;Crystal Optical&#8208;Waveguide&#8208;Cavity as a Mobile Light Polarization Rotor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micromechanically&#8208;powered optical polarization rotors have immense potential in robotic sensors, optoelectronics and photonics. Here, we demonstrate precise mechanical rolling locomotion of twisted microcrystal optical waveguide on the substrate displaying a linear&#8208;polarization rotation of the output signal. Self&#8208;assembly of (  E  )&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;(((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenol produces several naturally twisted microcrystals. The twisted crystals exhibit varying pitch lengths because of strain between several intergrowing, orientationally mismatched nanocrystalline fibres along the [100] direction. The mechanical rolling motion of crystals is due to their twisted morphologies. The crystals are also flexible perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions. The twisted crystals in their straight and bent geometries self&#8208;guide fluorescence along their long&#8208;twisted body axes with low loss. Depending upon the degree of mechanical rolling locomotion, the crystal waveguide cavity correspondingly rotates the polarization of output optical modes. The presented, first of its kind, mechanically rollable twisted&#8208;crystal with a combination of locomotive and photonic attributes unfolds the new dimension in the field of mechanophotonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Redox Looping of a Rhodium/ CexWO3 Photocatalyst for Highly Active and Robust Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has provided an effective avenue to convert two greenhouse gases, CH  4  and CO  2  , into syngas. Here, we design a DRM photocatalyst Rh/Ce  x  WO  3  that invokes both photothermal and photoelectric processes, which overcomes the thermodynamic limitation of DRM under conventional conditions. In contrast to plasmonic or UV&#8208;response photocatalysts, our photocatalyst produces a superior light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 4.65% with a moderate light intensity. We propose that a light&#8208;induced Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal charge transfer plays a crucial role in the DRM reaction, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species to lower the activation energy. Quantum mechanical studies reveal that a high oxygen mobility of Ce  x  WO  3  , accompanied with the formation of oxo&#8208;bridge species, results in a substantial elimination of deposited C species during the reaction. Our catalyst design strategy could offer a promising energy&#8208;efficient industrial process for DRM.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Symmetry Breaking of Monoacylated Anhydroerythritols and meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols through Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols and acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols with a cis configuration revealed that four compounds crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. All compounds racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals of 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
We developed a chiral symmetry breaking method for monoacylated meso diols. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols, meso cyclic diols with a cis configuration, revealed that the O&#8208;(p&#8208;anisoyl) derivative crystallized as a racemic conglomerate of the P212121 crystal system. It was confirmed that the substrate racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Evaporating the solvent gradually from the solution or Viedma ripening to promote crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals. These results provide the first successful example of asymmetric expression and amplification by deracemization of sugar derivatives without an external chemical chiral source. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols. Three O&#8208;monoacylated substrates were successfully deracemized to 99&#8201;% ee by Viedma ripening. We also developed asymmetric desymmetrization of meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols by combining acylation and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>NIRII&#8208;HDs: A Versatile Platform for Developing Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorogenic Probes for Reliable In Vivo Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;HD&#8208;like dyes (NIRII&#8208;HDs) with bright and stable NIR&#8208;II emission together with proper pKa is reported. By decorating the tunable hydroxyl group, the novel NIR&#8208;II dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 can serve as an effective platform to design various activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for reliable in vivo bioimaging with high contrast.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) activatable fluorescent probes can potentially provide a high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep tissue penetration. However, most of the reported NIR&#8208;II activatable small&#8208;molecule probes exhibit poor versatility owing to the lack of a general and stable optically tunable group. In this study, we designed NIRII&#8208;HDs, a novel dye scaffold optimized for NIR&#8208;II probe development. In particular, dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 showed the best optical properties such as proper pKa value, excellent stability, and high NIR&#8208;II brightness, which can be beneficial for in vivo imaging with high contrast. To demonstrate the applicability of the NIRII&#8208;HD5 dye, we designed three target&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for ROS, thiols, and enzymes. Using these novel probes, we not only realized reliable NIR&#8208;II imaging of different diseases in mouse models but also evaluated the redox potential of liver tissue during a liver injury in vivo with high fidelity.

         <title>Environmentally Benign Biosynthesis of Hierarchical MOF/Bacterial Cellulose Composite Sponge for Nerve Agent Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthesized MOF&#8208;based sponge composite materials feature hierarchical pores and tunable MOF loading. They can be used for efficient nerve agent simulant catalytic hydrolysis and toxic nerve agent capture.







Abstract
The fabrication of MOF polymer composite materials enables the practical applications of MOF&#8208;based technology, in particular for protective suits and masks. However, traditional production methods typically require organic solvent for processing which leads to environmental pollution, low&#8208;loading efficiency, poor accessibility, and loss of functionality due to poor solvent resistance properties. For the first time, we have developed a microbial synthesis strategy to prepare a MOF/bacterial cellulose nanofiber composite sponge. The prepared sponge exhibited a hierarchically porous structure, high MOF loading (up to &#8776;90&#8201;%), good solvent resistance, and high catalytic activity for the liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state hydrolysis of nerve agent simulants. Moreover, the MOF/ bacterial cellulose composite sponge reported here showed a nearly 8&#8208;fold enhancement in the protection against an ultra&#8208;toxic nerve agent (GD) in permeability studies as compared to a commercialized adsorptive carbon cloth. The results shown here present an essential step toward the practical application of MOF&#8208;based protective gear against nerve agents.

         <title>Cystine Knot Peptides with Tuneable Activity and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Separate approaches for tuning the activity of cystine knot peptides are reported. Protease inhibitors were designed that had light&#8208;controlled activity and could be switched ON against new targets, or had an affinity tag that allowed inhibitors to be switched OFF. These peptides enabled modulation of target activity with exquisite temporal control.







Abstract
Knottins are topologically complex peptides that are stabilised by a cystine knot and have exceptionally diverse functions, including protease inhibition. However, approaches for tuning their activity in situ are limited. Here, we demonstrate separate approaches for tuning the activity of knottin protease inhibitors using light or streptavidin. We show that the inhibitory activity and selectivity of an engineered knottin can be controlled with light by activating a second mode of action that switches the inhibitor ON against new targets. Guided by a knottin library screen, we also identify a position in the inhibitor's binding loop that permits insertion of a biotin tag without impairing activity. Using streptavidin, biotinylated knottins with nanomolar affinity can be switched OFF in activity assays, and the anticoagulant activity of a factor XIIa inhibitor can be rapidly switched OFF in human plasma. Our findings expand the scope of engineered knottins for precisely controlling protein function.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides Catalyzed by a Single H&#8208;Bond Donor Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple prolinamide bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor urea function catalyzes the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction between tryptamines and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses.







Abstract
The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction (PSR) with aldehydes is well known. However, PSR involving ketones as electrophilic partners is far&#8208;less developed. We report herein the first examples of catalytic enantioselective PSR of tryptamines with &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. A new class of easily accessible prolyl&#8208;urea organocatalysts bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor function catalyzes the title reaction to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic isotope effect using C2&#8208;deuterium&#8208;labelled tryptamine indicates that the rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208; and the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

         <title>A Rational Biphasic Tailoring Strategy Enabling High&#8208;Performance Layered Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational biphasic tailoring strategy to prepare layered composite cathodes with the desired phase ratio is proposed. Benefiting from the reversible phase transition within transition metal slabs and the decreased structure strain at the phase boundary of the intergrowth structure during Na extraction and insertion, the Com&#8208;NaNMFT composite material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes usually exhibit high compositional diversity, thus providing controllable electrochemical performance for Na&#8208;ion batteries. These abundant components lead to complicated structural chemistry, closely affecting the stacking preference, phase transition and Na+ kinetics. With this perspective, we explore the thermodynamically stable phase diagram of various P2/O3 composites based on a rational biphasic tailoring strategy. Then a specific P2/O3 composite is investigated and compared with its monophasic counterparts. A highly reversible structural evolution of P2/O3&#8211;P2/O3/P3&#8211;P2/P3&#8211;P2/Z/O3&#8242;&#8211;Z/O3&#8242; based on the Ni2+/Ni3.5+, Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3.8+/Mn4+ redox couples upon sequential Na extraction/insertion is revealed. The reduced structural strain at the phase boundary alleviates the phase transition and decreases the lattice mismatch during cycling, endowing the biphasic electrode a large reversible capacity of 144&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with the energy density approaching 514&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Structurally Disordered RuO2 Nanosheets with Rich Oxygen Vacancies for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural disorder enhanced catalytic performance is demonstrated for carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets. The improved activity is ascribed to the disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies, which can modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus resulting in a low endothermic potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) and a high efficiency.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate pollutants to ammonia has emerged as an attractive alternative for ammonia synthesis. Currently, many strategies have been developed for enhancing nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) efficiency, but the influence of the degree of structural disorder is still unexplored. Here, carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets with adjustable crystallinity are synthesized by a facile molten salt method. The as&#8208;synthesized amorphous RuO2 displays high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (97.46&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.42&#8201;%), greatly outperforming the crystalline counterparts. The disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies is revealed to modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus lowering the energy of the potential&#8208;determining step (NH2*&#8594;NH3*).

         <title>A Self&#8208;Serviced&#8208;Track 3D DNA Walker for Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Exosomes by Glycoprotein Profiling</title>

         <dc:description>
Exploiting target exosomes (Exos) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track: A self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free and highly sensitive detection of tumor Exos is constructed using split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous walking powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly. This STDW allows the direct detection of tumor Exos in serum and clinical samples.







Abstract
Sensitive and accurate analysis of low&#8208;concentration of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (Exos) in biofluids is essential for noninvasive cancer diagnosis but is still challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;sensitive methods with low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;operation. Herein, exploiting target Exos as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track for the first time, we developed a self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free detection of tumor Exos using exosomal glycoprotein, which was enabled by split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous running powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). Benefiting from high selectivity and sensitivity of the STDW assay, direct detection of tumor Exos in cell culture medium and serum could also be realized. Furthermore, this method exhibited high accuracy in clinical sample analysis, offering the potential for early cancer diagnosis and postoperative response prediction.

         <title>Insights into Dynamic Surface Bromide Sites in Bi4O5Br2 for Sustainable N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic N2 reduction on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 nanosheets reveals a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of the catalyst surface. Creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle.







Abstract
Simulating photosynthesis has long been one of the ideas for realizing the conversion of solar energy into industrial chemicals. Heterogeneous N2 photofixation in water is a promising way for sustainable production of ammonia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the complex aqueous photocatalytic N2 reduction is still lacking. In this study, a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of catalyst surface for N2 reduction are revealed on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 (BOB) nanosheets, in which the creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle. Our rapid scan in situ FT&#8208;IR spectra verify that photocatalytic N2 reduction proceeds through an associative alternating mechanism on BOB surface with bromine vacancies (BrV&#8208;BOB). This work provides a new strategy to combine light&#8208;dependent facilitated reaction with light&#8208;independent regeneration of catalyst for advancing sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>Organoplatinum Compounds as Anion&#8208;Tuneable Uphill Hydroxide Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active and directional hydroxide transport is realized by using PtII organometallic compounds as carriers based on their hydrolysis reaction combined with the different permeability of the neutral form and the charged form PtII aqua species. These compounds can transport hydroxide selectively &#8220;uphill&#8221;, a gradient in a liposomal system producing a transmembrane pH gradient, and tuneable activity is achieved by adding anions through a ligand&#8208;exchange reaction.







Abstract
Active transport of ions uphill, creating a concentration gradient across a cell membrane, is essential for life. It remains a significant challenge to develop synthetic systems that allow active uphill transport. Here, a transport process fuelled by organometallic compounds is reported that creates a pH gradient. The hydrolysis reaction of PtII complexes results in the formation of aqua complexes that established rapid transmembrane movement (&#8220;flip&#8208;flop&#8221;) of neutral Pt&#8722;OH species, leading to protonation of the OH group in the inner leaflet, generating OH&#8722; ions, and so increasing the pH in the intravesicular solution. The organoplatinum complex effectively transports bound hydroxide ions across the membrane in a neutral complex. The initial net flow of the PtII complex into the vesicles generates a positive electric potential that can further drive uphill transport because the electric potential is opposed to the chemical potential of OH&#8722;. The OH&#8722; ions equilibrate with this transmembrane electric potential but cannot remove it due to the relatively low permeability of the charged species. As a result, effective hydroxide transport against its concentration gradient can be achieved, and multiple additions can continuously drive the generation of OH&#8722; against its concentration gradient up to &#916;pH&gt;2. Moreover, the external addition of different anions can control the generation of OH&#8722; depending on their anion binding affinity. When anions displayed very high binding affinities towards PtII compounds, such as halides, the external anions could dissipate the pH gradient. In contrast, a further pH increase was observed for weak binding anions, such as sulfate, due to the increase of positive electric potential.

         <title>Superhydrophilic 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks as Broadband Absorbers for Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>

A 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthr&#8208;acene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) with both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions is developed for solar steam generation (SSG) and delivers an excellent water evaporation up to 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation.







Abstract
The intrinsic hydrophobicity and limited light absorption especially in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of porous organic polymers are two bottlenecks impeding their applications in solar steam generation (SSG). Herein, we develop a 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) (TPAD&#8208;COF) featuring both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering from the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions for SSG. TPAD&#8208;COF serving as a highly efficient photothermal conversion material without any additives displays an excellent water evaporation of 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under 1 sun irradiation. Further extension of the light absorption range of the TPAD&#8208;based COF is realized through post&#8208;synthetic modification by chelating BF2 moieties. Systematic control experiments and analysis confirm that the hydrophilicity of photothermal conversion materials plays a more dominant role in the current TPAD&#8208;based COFs for SSG.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of alkenes represents a very important approach to access optically active cyclic ethers.

         <title>Generation and release of OH radicals from the reaction of H2O with O2 over soot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>OH radicals in the air maintain the oxidizing power of the troposphere. A conventional view is that particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere is a major sink of OH radicals, thereby lowering the oxidizing power of atmosphere in the event of high&#8208;level PM. By contrary, our joint experimental/theoretical study reveals a new mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by carbonaceous soot particles. We show that water and O  2  react on carbonaceous surfaces and give rise to gaseous OH radicals under irradiation. With ample delocalized &#960; electrons, carbonaceous surfaces enable the easy desorption of hydroxyl groups to produce gaseous OH radicals, evidenced by direct observation of the steady generation of OH radicals on a carbonaceous surface. Our results reveal a new chemical mechanism for the production of OH radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Mediating Oxidation of Thioethers with Iodine &#8208; A Mild and Versatile Pathway to Trigger the Formation of Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of redox&#8208;triggerable peptide hydrogels poses fundamental challenges, since the highly specific peptide architectures required inevitably limit the versatility of such materials. A powerful, yet rarely applied approach to bypass those barriers is the application of a mediating redox reaction to gradually decrease the pH during hydrogel formation. We report a versatile strategy to trigger the formation of peptide hydrogels from readily accessible acid&#8208;triggerable gelators by generating protons by oxidation of thioethers with triiodide. Adding thiodiglycol as a readily available thioether auxiliary to the basic precursor solution of a peptide gelator efficiently yielded hydrogels after mixing with triiodide, as studied in detail for Nap&#8208;FF and demonstrated for other peptides. Furthermore, incorporation of the thioether moiety in the gelator backbone via the amino acid methionine as shown for the tailormade Nap&#8208;FMDM peptide provides a useful modulation option reducing the number of additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is used to treat solid tumors by locally delivering radiation. However, due to nephro&#8208; and hepato&#8208;toxicity, it is limited by its dosage. To amplify radiation damage to tumor cells, radiolabeled nanogels can be used. We show that by tuning the mechanical properties of nanogels significant enhancement in circulation half&#8208;life of the gel could be achieved. We demonstrate why and how small changes in the mechanical properties of the nanogels influence its cellular fate. Nanogels with a storage modulus of 37 kPa were minimally phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages compared to nanogels with 93 kPa modulus. Using PET/CT a significant difference in the blood circulation time of the nanogels was shown. Computer simulations affirmed the results and predicted the mechanism of cellular uptake of the nanogels. Altogether, this work emphasizes the important role of elasticity even for particles that are inherently soft such as nano&#8208; or microgels.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe the development of an efficient method for the olefination of hydrazones and oximes. The key design approach that enables this transformation is tuning of the energy/polarity of C=N &#960;&#8208;bonds by employing electron withdrawing groups (NR  2  , OR). The resulting hydrazones or oximes facilitate olefination with ruthenium alkylidenes. Through this approach, we show that air&#8208;stable, commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes provide access to functionalized alkenes (20 examples) in ring&#8208;closing reactions with yields up to 88%.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Optimization of Compositions of High&#8208;Entropy Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxides are investigated theoretically as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The energetics of the reaction is calculated on individual active sites following two different pathways, and it is shown that the overpotential and preferred pathway depend on the local atomic environment. A surface model is constructed in order to identify the composition that maximises the catalytic activity.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides are oxides consisting of five or more metals incorporated in a single lattice, and the large composition space suggests that properties of interest can be readily optimised. For applications within catalysis, the different local atomic environments result in a distribution of binding energies for the catalytic intermediates. Using the oxygen evolution reaction on the rutile (110) surface as example, here we outline a strategy for the theoretical optimization of the composition. Density functional theory calculations performed for a limited number of sites are used to fit a model that predicts the reaction energies for all possible local atomic environments. Two reaction pathways are considered; the conventional pathway on the coordinatively unsaturated sites and an alternative pathway involving transfer of protons to a bridging oxygen. An explicit model of the surface is constructed to describe the interdependency of the two pathways and identify the composition that maximizes catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;High-entropy oxides are investigated theoretically as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The energetics of the reaction is calculated on individual active sites following two different pathways, and it is shown that the overpotential and preferred pathway depend on the local atomic environment. A surface model is constructed in order to identify the composition that maximises the catalytic activity.

         <title>A Crystalline Partially Fluorinated Triazine Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline, partially fluorinated triazine covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed with broad visible&#8208;light responsiveness, improved charge separation and transfer, and enhanced O2 affinity. The COF exhibited attractive photocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for H2O2 production under visible&#8208;light irradiation, and with higher activity than previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
A partially fluorinated, metal&#8208;free, imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional triazine covalent organic framework (TF50&#8208;COF) photocatalyst was developed. Fluorine (F)&#8208;substituted and nonsubstituted units were integrated in equimolar amounts on the edge aromatic units, where they mediated two&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. F&#8208;substitution created an abundance of Lewis acid sites, which regulated the electronic distribution of adjacent carbon atoms and provided highly active sites for O2 adsorption, and widened the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range of the catalyst, while enhancing charge separation. Varying the proportion of F maximized the interlayer interactions of TF50&#8208;COF, resulting in improved crystallinity with faster carrier transfer and robust photostability. The TF50&#8208;COF catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability in O2 photoreduction into H2O2, with a high H2O2 yield rate of 1739&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 5.1&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, exceeding the performance of previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Induced Emergent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral terpyridine&#8208;based ZnII complex has been developed that forms fluorescent complexes with nucleotides, but only in the presence of ATP. A chiral assembly is generated that exhibits circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum factor as high as 0.20. This discrimination of ATP from other nucleotides should allow applications in encryption.







Abstract
Biomimetic ATP&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly is important to understand various biological processes and dissipative systems. Here, we report an ATP&#8208;driven chiral assembly exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) via the interaction of an achiral terpyridine&#8208;based ZnII complex with nucleotides. It was found that while the metal complexes could co&#8208;assemble with the nucleotides to form fluorescent assemblies, only a combination of furan&#8208;substituted terpyridine complex and ATP showed an intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 0.20. This means that the complex could recognize ATP using CPL as a readout signal, thus providing an example of ATP encryption. Interestingly, when ATP was transferred into ADP or AMP under enzymatic hydrolysis, the CPL decreases or disappears. Addition of ATP generates CPL again, thus producing an ATP&#8208;induced CPL system. This work presents the first example of ATP&#8208;induced CPL and encryption.

         <title>A Pair of Atypical KAS III Homologues with Initiation and Elongation Functions Program the Polyketide Biosynthesis in Asukamycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KAS IIIs are known to be involved in the initiation step of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In vitro reconstitution of the upper triene chain of asukamycin unveils two highly unusual KAS IIIs which both exhibit initiation and iterative elongation activity. Together with the permissive ketoreductase and dehydratase, these C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes can synthesize a large variety of polyenes.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III (KAS III) is a class of important C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes that mostly catalyze the initiation of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we elucidated an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) system that involves two unique KAS IIIs (AsuC3 and C4) in the biosynthesis of the upper triene chain of asukamycin. Significantly, AsuC3 and C4 have both initiation and iterative elongation activity, while being functionally biased toward the elongation and initiation steps, respectively. Mutational analysis revealed that their catalytic activities rely on the catalytic triad Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Asn. Unlike other KAS IIIs, AsuC3 and C4 are very promiscuous and can accept various lengths of acyl&#8208;CoAs with either cyclic, branched or linear acyl moieties. By cooperation with the permissive ketoreductase (AsuC7) and dehydratase (AsuC8/C9), a large variety of polyenes can be efficiently synthesized. This study significantly broadens the understanding of KAS IIIs and polyketide biosynthesis.

         <title>MOF Synthesis Prediction Enabled by Automatic Data Mining and Machine Learning**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to rationalize and accelerate MOF discovery by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure. The prediction is based on machine learning models, trained on the SynMOF database, constructed via automatic data mining of synthesis parameters from the literature. The model outperforms human expert predictions according to a synthesis survey.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress in the field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the potential of using machine learning (ML) methods to predict MOF synthesis parameters is still untapped. Here, we show how ML can be used for rationalization and acceleration of the MOF discovery process by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure. Our approach is based on: i)&#8197;establishing the first MOF synthesis database via automatic extraction of synthesis parameters from the literature, ii)&#8197;training and optimizing ML models by employing the MOF database, and iii)&#8197;predicting the synthesis conditions for new MOF structures. The ML models, even at an initial stage, exhibit a good prediction performance, outperforming human expert predictions, obtained through a synthesis survey. The automated synthesis prediction is available via a web&#8208;tool on https://mof&#8208;synthesis.aimat.science.

         <title>Colloidal Bismuth Chalcohalide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reliable and versatile colloidal synthetic method to prepare mixed anion semiconductor nanocrystals of the V&#8211;VI&#8211;VII group, namely bismuth chalcohalides, is presented. The chemical stability and the optical absorption properties of the colloidal bismuth chalcohalide nanocrystals may set this class of materials as a promising complement to metal chalcogenides and halides for solution&#8208;processed light&#8208;harvesting purposes.







Abstract
Here we present a colloidal approach to synthesize bismuth chalcohalide nanocrystals (BiEX NCs, in which E=S, Se and X=Cl, Br, I). Our method yields orthorhombic elongated BiEX NCs, with BiSCl crystallizing in a previously unknown polymorph. The BiEX NCs display a composition&#8208;dependent band gap spanning the visible spectral range and absorption coefficients exceeding 105&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The BiEX NCs show chemical stability at standard laboratory conditions and form colloidal inks in different solvents. These features enable the solution processing of the NCs into robust solid films yielding stable photoelectrochemical current densities under solar&#8208;simulated irradiation. Overall, our versatile synthetic protocol may prove valuable in accessing colloidal metal chalcohalide nanomaterials at large and contributes to establish metal chalcohalides as a promising complement to metal chalcogenides and halides for applied nanotechnology.

&lt;p&gt;A reliable and versatile colloidal synthetic method to prepare mixed anion semiconductor nanocrystals of the V&#8211;VI&#8211;VII group, namely bismuth chalcohalides, is presented. The chemical stability and the optical absorption properties of the colloidal bismuth chalcohalide nanocrystals may set this class of materials as a promising complement to metal chalcogenides and halides for solution-processed light-harvesting purposes.

         <title>Characterization of a Nitrogenase Iron Protein Substituted with a Synthetic [Fe4Se4] Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic [Fe4Se4] compound is incorporated into the nitrogenase iron protein, showing redox properties distinct from its [Fe4S4] counterpart that can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.







Abstract
The Fe protein of nitrogenase plays multiple roles in substrate reduction and cluster maturation via its redox&#8208;active [Fe4S4] cluster. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a water&#8208;soluble [Fe4Se4] cluster that is used to substitute the [Fe4S4] cluster of the Azotobacter vinelandii Fe protein (AvNifH). Biochemical, EPR and XAS/EXAFS analyses demonstrate the ability of the [Fe4Se4] cluster to adopt the super&#8208;reduced, all&#8208;ferrous state upon its incorporation into AvNifH. Moreover, these studies reveal that the [Fe4Se4] cluster in AvNifH already assumes a partial all&#8208;ferrous state ([Fe4Se4]0) in the presence of dithionite, where its [Fe4S4] counterpart in AvNifH exists solely in the reduced state ([Fe4S4]1+). Such a discrepancy in the redox properties of the AvNifH&#8208;associated [Fe4Se4] and [Fe4S4] clusters can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements for the substrate reduction and cluster maturation of nitrogenase, pointing to the utility of chalcogen&#8208;substituted FeS clusters in future mechanistic studies of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.

         <title>Superstable and Intrinsically Self&#8208;Healing Fibrous Membrane with Bionic Confined Protective Structure for Breathable Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing fibrous membrane with bionic confined protective structure is constructed through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The breathable self&#8208;healing fibrous membrane imitates not only the sensing function, but also the healing process of biological skin, exhibiting great potential for the next&#8208;generation advanced bionic artificial skins.







Abstract
Considerable effort has been devoted to the fabrication of electronic skin that can imitate the self&#8208;healing and sensing function of biological skin. Almost all self&#8208;healing electronic skins are composed of airtight elastomers or hydrogels, which will cause skin inflammation. Fibrous membranes are ideal materials for preparing highly sensitive breathable electronic skins. However, the development of intrinsically self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes with high stability is still a challenge. Here, a novel interface protective strategy is reported to develop intrinsically self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes with a bionic confined structure for the first time, which were further assembled into an all&#8208;fiber structured electronic skin through interfacial hydrogen bonding. The electronic skin is multifunctional with self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;healing, breathability, stretchability, and thermochromism functionalities, which is highly promising for application in intelligent wearable sensing systems.

         <title>Computational Design, Synthesis, and Photochemistry of Cy7&#8208;PPG, an Efficient NIR&#8208;Activated Photolabile Protecting Group for Therapeutic Applications**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The computational design and synthesis of Cy7&#8208;PPG, a new oxygen&#8208;independent novel near&#8208;infrared photolabile protecting group (PPG) is reported. Cy7&#8208;PPG is the most redshifted PPG to date (&#955;max=746&#8197;nm), with unmatched near&#8208;infrared molecular absorptivity and aqueous solubility, and excellent uncaging efficiency, paving the way for the use of PPGs in the clinic.







Abstract
Photolabile Protecting Groups (PPGs) are molecular tools used, for example, in photopharmacology for the activation of drugs with light, enabling spatiotemporal control over their potency. Yet, red&#8208;shifting of PPG activation wavelengths into the NIR range, which penetrates the deepest in tissue, has often yielded inefficient or insoluble molecules, hindering the use of PPGs in the clinic. To solve this problem, we report herein a novel concept in PPG design, by transforming clinically&#8208;applied NIR&#8208;dyes with suitable molecular orbital configurations into new NIR&#8208;PPGs using computational approaches. Using this method, we demonstrate how Cy7, a class of NIR dyes possessing ideal properties (NIR&#8208;absorption, high molecular absorptivity, excellent aqueous solubility) can be successfully converted into Cy7&#8208;PPG. We report a facile synthesis towards Cy7&#8208;PPG from accessible precursors and confirm its excellent properties as the most redshifted oxygen&#8208;independent NIR&#8208;PPG to date (&#955;max=746&#8197;nm).

         <title>Emissive Platinum(II) Macrocycles as Tunable Cascade Energy Transfer Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive PtII macrocycles decorated with hydrophobic alkyl chains are developed as scaffolds for artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems with sequential energy transfer capabilities. These molecules have tunable aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties and form spherical aggregates upon self&#8208;assembly in water&#8211;acetone medium. A strategy to control the light&#8208;harvesting efficiency by changing hydrophobic chain length is shown.







Abstract
Developing artificial light&#8208;harvesting scaffolds with a cascade energy transfer process is significant for better understanding of photosynthesis. Here, we report [3+3] self&#8208;assembled PtII fluorescent macrocycles (3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b) as light&#8208;harvesting platforms with cascade energy transfer. The PtII macrocycles aggregate into nanospheres and show emission&#8208;enhancement characteristics upon increasing water content in acetone medium. These aggregates (3aa and 3ba) serve as energy donors when mixed with the hydrophobic dye Eosin&#8208;Y (ESY). In the presence of a second dye, Nile Red (NiR), an unusual sequential two&#8208;step energy transfer takes place from the macrocycles to NiR. In this case, ESY acts as a bridge in the relay mode. Additionally, a unique strategy to control such an energy transfer process by tuning the chain length of the alkyl group attached to the periphery of the macrocycles is demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
The first Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#947;&#8208;allylic alkylation of free dienolates, generated in situ by Sc&#8208;mediated Meinwald rearrangement of vinyloxiranes atom&#8208;economically, has been established.

Abstract
An unprecedented asymmetric &#947;&#8208;allylic alkylation of free dienolates via Sc/Ir dual catalysis is reported, which affords a range of synthetically versatile &#947;&#8208;allylic crotonaldehydes in high efficiency with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. The dienolates bearing no essential auxiliary groups were generated in situ by scandium triflate&#8208;mediated Meinwald rearrangement of vinyloxiranes atom&#8208;economically. With the assistance of computational density functional theory calculations, a Sc/Ir bimetallic catalytic cycle was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Chemoselective&#160;and Diastereoselective Intramolecular (3+2) Cycloadditions of Epoxy and Aziridinyl Enolsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in highly chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular (3+2) cycloadditions with a range of dienes and olefins. With acyclic dienes, the (3+2) cycloaddition outcompetes the (4+3) pathway traditionally observed in this kind of system almost exclusively. With both conjugated dienes and isolated olefins, excellent diastereoselectivities are observed, and cycloadducts can be obtained in optically&#8208;enriched forms. Computational studies indicate that the stepwise (3+2) cycloaddition involves an activated epoxy/aziridinyl intermediate and the conformational flexibility of the intermediate determines the preference for (3+2) cycloadduct formation. Further transformations of the (3+2) cycloadducts produce densely functionalized  trans  &#8208;hydrindane scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclophenacene&#8208; and Chiral&#8208;Type Cyclophenylene&#8208;Naphthylene Belts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A naphthalene&#8208;embedded conjugated nanobelt is an excellent design for achieving the synthesis of cyclophenacene&#8208;type and chiral&#8208;type carbon nanobelts. A cationic rhodium complex catalyst is a powerful tool for the (asymmetric) synthesis of these analogs, as reported by Ken Tanaka and co&#8208;workers in this Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200800). In the picture, three blue belts in the foreground and the rhodium complex in the back represent the cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene belts and the key catalyst, respectively.

         <title>Integrated Ring&#8208;Chain Design of a New Fluorinated Ether Solvent for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated fluorinated ring&#8208;chain molecular approach was developed through structural modification of a low&#8208;cost, commercial ether for a new solvent 2&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (cFTOF), which served as a single ether solvent for lithium&#8208;metal batteries combining high&#8208;voltage stability up to 6&#8197;V, and regulated Li+ solvation structure, increasing Li+ ion&#8208;pairing with FSI anions in a low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration electrolyte system.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes offer promising features such as high lithium&#8208;ion solvation power and stable interface, yet their limited oxidation stability impedes application in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Whereas the fluorination of the ether backbone improves the oxidative stability, the resulting solvents lose their Li+&#8208;solvation ability. Therefore, the rational molecular design of solvents is essential to combine high redox stability with good ionic conductivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a new high&#8208;voltage fluorinated ether solvent through integrated ring&#8208;chain molecular design, which can be used as a single solvent while retaining high&#8208;voltage stability. The controlled Li+&#8208;solvation environment even at low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration (1&#8197;M or 2&#8197;M) enables a uniform and compact Li anode and an outstanding cycling stability in the Li|NCM811 full cell (20&#8197;&#956;m Li foil, N/P ratio of 4). These results show the impact of molecular design of electrolytes towards the utilization of LMBs.

         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for the controlled synthesis of discrete diamond&#8208;shaped two&#8208;dimensional platelets with tunable surface functionality and luminescence by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of poly(L&#8208;lactides) is described by Anindita Das and Aritra Rajak in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116572). By two&#8208;component co&#8208; and living&#8208;crystallization techniques, pre&#8208;determined sequence&#8208;controlled supramolecular organization of two functional dyes on the co&#8208;platelet and block co&#8208;platelet surface, respectively, can be achieved.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Protein Modification with Reducing Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with diverse reducing carbohydrates was developed. This method enabled the efficient and selective installation of GlcNAc moieties with a stable native&#8208;like linkage and subsequent enzymatic construction of defined oligosaccharides on proteins.







Abstract
Protein glycosylation plays critical roles in many biological processes. However, the fundamental study and application of glycobiology are hindered by the heterogeneousness of oligosaccharides in natural glycoproteins and the difficulty in constructing glycoproteins of human design. Herein, we describe a semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with reducing carbohydrates. The method involves the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified aspartate, which was subsequently quantitatively converted into alanine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydrazide (A&#946;z), and chemoselective conjugation of A&#946;z with a range of readily available reducing carbohydrates. The resulting A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc is a close mimic of native N&#8208;GlcNAc and could be installed on various proteins, including IL&#8208;17A and RNase A. Notably, A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc on proteins reacted with biantennary oligosaccharide oxazoline derivatives through endoglycosidase&#8208;catalyzed transglycosylation reactions to enable the assembly of homogeneous glycans on proteins.

         <title>Cofactor&#8208;Driven Cascade Reactions Enable the Efficient Preparation of Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex de novo biosynthesis of sugar nucleotides was reorganized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through the addition of an excess amount of a cofactor provided by a cofactor regeneration system, thus resulting in high synthetic yields.







Abstract
Glycosylation is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases using sugar nucleotides or occasionally lipid&#8208;linked phosphosugars as donors. However, only very few common sugar nucleotides that occur in humans can be obtained readily, while the majority of sugar nucleotides that exist in bacteria, plants, archaea, or viruses cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by either enzymatic or chemical synthesis. The limited availability of such rare sugar nucleotides is one of the major obstacles that has greatly hampered progress in glycoscience. Herein we describe a general cofactor&#8208;driven cascade conversion strategy for the efficient synthesis of sugar nucleotides. The described strategy allows the large&#8208;scale preparation of rare sugar nucleotides from common sugars in high yields and without the need for tedious purification processes.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticle Library with Precise pH Tunability by Co&#8208;Polymerization with Non&#8208;Ionizable Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy for the development of an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive nanoparticle library with precisely tuned pH transitions (pHt=4.0&#8211;7.4) was proposed through co&#8208;polymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The nanoprobe library exhibits excellent barcode imaging of endosome maturation and precise cancer imaging.







Abstract
Precise monitoring of the subtle pH fluctuation during biological events remains a big challenge. Previously, we reported an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive (UPS) nanoprobe library with a sharp pH response using co&#8208;polymerization of two tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers with distinct pKa. Currently, we have generalized the UPS nanoparticle library with tunable pH transitions (pHt) by copolymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The pHt of nanoparticles is fine&#8208;tuned by the non&#8208;ionizable monomers with different hydrophobicity. Each non&#8208;ionizable monomer presents a constant contribution to pH tunability regardless of tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers. Based on this strategy, we produced two libraries of nanoprobes with continuous pHt covering the entire physiological pH range (5.0&#8211;7.4) for fluorescent imaging of endosome maturation and cancers. This generalized strategy provides a powerful toolkit for biological studies and cancer theranostics.

         <title>Soluble and Perfluorinated Polyelectrolyte for Safe and High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design principle of polymerization and fluorination for salt anions has been proposed and lithiated Nafion (LN) was suggested as a representative soluble lithium salt for the polyelectrolyte solution to improve the Li+ transfer number and produce a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Furthermore, the perfluorinated backbone of LN delivers the polyelectrolyte solution low flammability. Thus, making the Li&#8722;O2 batteries realize all&#8208;round performance amelioration.







Abstract
The severe performance degradation of high&#8208;capacity Li&#8722;O2 batteries induced by Li dendrite growth and concentration polarization from the low Li+ transfer number of conventional electrolytes hinder their practical applications. Herein, lithiated Nafion (LN) with the sulfonic group immobilized on the perfluorinated backbone has been designed as a soluble lithium salt for preparing a less flammable polyelectrolyte solution, which not only simultaneously achieves a high Li+ transfer number (0.84) and conductivity (2.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1), but also the perfluorinated anion of LN produces a LiF&#8208;rich SEI for protecting the Li anode from dendrite growth. Thus, the Li&#8722;O2 battery with a LN&#8208;based electrolyte achieves an all&#8208;round performance improvement, like low charge overpotential (0.18&#8197;V), large discharge capacity (9508&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (225&#8197;cycles). Besides, the fabricated pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;air cells exhibit promising applications to power electronic equipment with satisfactory safety.

         <dc:description>
The DNA damage response, which includes DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint pathways in cancer cells, has been considered one of the main impediments to traditional chemotherapy. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117075), Na Kong, Xingcai Zhang, Wei Tao, Jong&#8197;Seung Kim, and co&#8208;workers developed a multifunctional construct, M1, to target the DNA damage response of cancer cells. The findings identified a critical role of DNA damage repair pathways during 5&#8208;FU/FUDR therapy and underscored the role of inhibition of these pathways in sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.

         <title>Asymmetric Defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;Trifluoromethylpyridines Enabled by Umpolung C&#8208;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;fluorine bond activation of the trifluoromethyl group represents an important approach to fluorine&#8208;containing molecules. While selective defluorinative functionalization reactions of CF  3  &#8208;containing substrates have been achieved by invoking difluorocarbocation, difluorocarboradical, or difluoroorganometallic species as the key intermediates, the transformations via fluorocarbanion mechanism only achieved limited success. Furthermore, the enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the CF  3  group remained a formidable challenge. Here we report a defluorinative functionalization reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines involving difluoro(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl anion as the key intermediate, which was developed based upon our previous studies on the  N  &#8208;boryl pyridyl anion chemistry. In particular, asymmetric defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines and &#8208;pyrimidines could be achieved by using Ir&#8208;catalysis to forge a difluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted chiral center.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Enzyme Activity by the Modulation of Covalent Interactions in the Confined Channels of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable regulations on the enzyme conformation to optimize catalytic performance are highly desired for the immobilized biocatalysts yet remain challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess confined channels with finely tunable pore environment, offering a promising platform for enzyme encapsulation. Herein, we covalently immobilized the cytochrome  c  (Cyt  c  ) in the size&#8208;matched channels of COFs with different contents of anchoring site, and significant enhancement of the stability and activity (~600% relative activity compared with free enzyme) can be realized by optimizing the covalent interactions. Structural analyses on the immobilized Cyt  c  suggest that covalent bonding could induce conformational perturbation resulting in more accessible active sites. The effectiveness of the covalent interaction modulation together with the tailorable confined channels of COFs offers promise to develop high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>More than a Leaving Group: N&#8208;Phenyltrifluoroacetimidate as a Remote Directing Group for Highly &#945;&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;cis Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anomeric configuration can greatly affect the biological functions and activities of carbohydrates. Herein, we report that N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl (PTFAI), a well&#8208;known leaving group for catalytic glycosylation, can act as a stereodirecting group for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Utilizing rapidly accessible 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;OPTFAI glycosyl donors, TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation occurred with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity and broad substrate scope, and the remaining 6&#8208;OPTFAI group can be cleaved chemoselectively. The remote participation of 6&#8208;OPTFAI is supported by the first characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic oxazepinium ion intermediates by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy. These cations were found to be relatively stable and mainly responsible for the present stereoselectivities. Further application is highlighted in glycosylation reactions toward trisaccharide heparins as well as the convergent synthesis of chacotriose derivatives using a bulky 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated donor.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the strong catalyst&#8208;support interaction in WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2&#8208;WC NPs) anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11 wt.%), which significantly promotes the oxygen evolution reaction activity with &#951;10 of 347 mV and mass activity of 1430 A gRu&#8208;1, eight&#8208;fold higher than that of commercial RuO2 (176 A gRu&#8208;1). Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong catalyst&#8208;support interaction between RuO2 and WC support could optimize the surrounding electronic structure of Ru sites to reduce reaction barrier. Considering the likewise excellent catalytic ability for hydrogen production, an acidic OWS electrolyzer with good stability constructed by bifunctional RuO2&#8208;WC NPs only requires a cell voltage of 1.66 V to afford 10 mA cm&#8208;2. The unique 0D/2D nanoarchitectures rationally combined WC support with precious metal oxides provides a promising strategy to tradeoff the high catalytic activity and low cost for acidic OWS application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>External control over the pore size of flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently emerged as an intriguing concept, with possible applications to gas storage and separation. In this work we present a new pressure cell capable for the first time of monitoring through  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray powder diffraction an adsorbent powder under combined uniaxial applied mechanical stress (up to 1 GPa) and gas pressure (up to 20 bar). The combined stress&#8208;pressure clamp (CSPC) cell was successfully exploited to follow the evolution of the CO  2  breathing behaviour of the prototypical complex breathing MIL&#8208;53(Al) system under mechanical compression obtaining structural evidence that this MOF can be maintained in its closed pore state upon compression, precluding its re&#8208;opening at high gas pressure (&gt;7 bar). This novel setup shows potential for the  in&#8208;operando  exploration of flexible systems, in equilibrium and flow configurations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide is a renewable, inexhaustible and cheap alternative to fossil resources for the production of fine chemicals and plastics. This waste can notably be converted into exovinylene cyclic carbonates, unique synthons gaining momentum for preparing an impressive range of important organic molecules and functional polymers following 100% atom economy reactions under mild operating conditions in most cases. This review is summarizing the recent advances made in their synthesis with a particular attention to describe the catalysts needed for their preparation, and discuss the unique reactivity of these CO  2  &#8208;based heterocycles for constructing diverse organic building blocks and (functional) polymers. We also discuss the challenges and the future perspectives in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Biphasic Dye&#8208;sensitized Photosynthesis Cells for TEMPO&#8208;based Oxidation of Glycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This&#160;work reports an aqueous dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPECs) capable of oxidizing glycerol (an archetypical biobased compound) coupled with H  2  &#160;production. We employed a mesoporous TiO  2  &#160;photoanode sensitized with the high potential thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye&#160;  AP11  , encased in an acetonitrile&#8208;based redox&#8208;gel that protects the photoanode from degradation by aqueous&#160;electrolytes. The use of the gel&#160;creates&#160;a biphasic system with an interface at organic (gel) electrode and aqueous anolyte. Embedded in the acetonitrile gel is 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (  TEMPO  ), acting as both a redox&#8208;mediator and a catalyst for oxidative transformations. Upon oxidation of&#160;  TEMPO  &#160;by the photoexcited dye, the in situ generated&#160;  TEMPO  +  &#160;  shuttles through the gel to the acetonitrile&#8211;aqueous interface, where it acts as an oxidant for the selective conversion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde. The introduction of the redox&#8208;gel layer affords a 10&#8208;fold increase in the conversion of glycerol compared to the purely aqueous system. Our redox&#8208;gel protected photoanode yielded stable photocurrent over 48 hours of continuous operation, demonstrating that this DSPEC is compatible with&#160;alkaline&#160;aqueous reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Disproportionation of Nitric Oxide at a Surface&#8208;Bound Nickel Porphyrinoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncommon metal oxidation states in porphyrinoid cofactors are responsible for the activity of many enzymes. The F430 and P450nor co&#8208;factors, with their reduced Ni(I)&#8208; and Fe(III)&#8208;containing tetrapyrrolic cores, are prototypical examples of biological systems involved in methane formation and in the reduction of nitric oxide, respectively. Herein, using a comprehensive range of experimental and theoretical methods, we raise evidence that nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in&#8208;vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation at room temperature. The interpretation of the measurements is far from being straightforward due to the high reactivity of the different nitrogen oxides species (eventually present in the residual gas background) and of the possible reaction intermediates. The picture is detailed in order to disentangle the challenging complexity of the system, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Following Repetitive Stimulation Reveals a Mechanism for Plasticity Changes with Iron Deficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deficiency of iron, the most abundant transition metal in the brain and important for neuronal activity, is known to affect synaptic plasticity, causing learning and memory deficits. How iron deficiency impacts plasticity altering neurotransmission at the cellular level is not fully understood. We used electrochemical methods to study the effect of iron deficiency on plasticity with repetitive stimulations. We show that during iron deficiency, repetitive stimulation causes significant decrease in exocytotic release without changing vesicular content. This results in a lower fraction of release, opposite to the control group, upon repetitive stimulation. These changes were partially reversible by iron repletion. This finding suggests that by decreasing the fraction of vesicular release in response to repetitive stimulation iron deficiency has a negative effect on plasticity. This provides a possible mechanism for iron deficiency modulating plasticity. Extended to the central nervous system, this could be highly significant.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Germanium(I) and Tin(I) Centered Radical Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An isostructural series of heavy Group 14 E(I) radical anions (Ge, Sn, Pb), stabilized by a bulky xanthene&#8208;based diamido ligand are reported. The radical anions were synthesised by the one&#8208;electron reduction of their corresponding E(II) precursor complexes with sodium naphthalenide in THF, yielding the radical anions as charge&#8208;separated sodium salts. The series of main group radicals have been comprehensively characterized by EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analysis, which reveal that in all cases, the spin density of the unpaired electron almost exclusively resides in a  p  &#8208;orbital of &#960; symmetry located on the group 14 center.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual In&#8208;situ Laser Techniques Underpin the Role of Cations in Impacting Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the electrode/electrolyte interface is crucial for optimizing electrocatalytic performances. Here, we demonstrate that the nature of alkali metal cations can profoundly impact the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8208;organic framework (SURMOF) derived electrocatalysts, which are based on NiFe(OOH). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy results show that Raman shifts of the Ni&#8208;O bending vibration are inversely proportional to the mass activities from Cs+ to Li+. Particularly, a laser&#8208;induced current transient technique was introduced to study the cation&#8208;dependent electric double layer properties and their effects on the activity. The catalytic trend appeared to be closely related to the potential of maximum entropy of the system, suggesting a strong cation impact on the interfacial water layer structure. Our results highlight how the electrolyte composition can be used to maximize the performance of SURMOF derivatives toward electrochemical water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Binding&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Mechanical&#8208;Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogous to allosteric enzymes, guest binding introduces a directional pulling or pushing force that acts on the reverse side of a Zn salen complex. This tunable intramolecular force promotes various degrees of conformational and torsional strain, as predicted by both classical conformational analysis and DFT. This strain energy can be further applied to cleave chemical bonds, and the efficiency can be tuned by the identity of allosteric guest.







Abstract
Recently, polymer mechanochemistry has attracted much scientific interest due to its potential to develop degradable polymers. When the two ends of a polymer chain experience a linear pulling stress, molecular strain builds up, at sufficiently strong force, a bond scission of the weakest covalent bond results. In contrast, bond&#8208;breaking events triggered by conformational stress are much less explored. Here, we discovered that a Zn salen complex would undergo conformational switching upon allosteric complexation with alkanediammonium guests. By controlling the guest chain length, the torsional strain experienced by Zn complex can be modulated to induce bond cleavage with chemical stimulus, and reactivity trend is predicted by conformational analysis derived by DFT calculation. Such strain&#8208;release reactivity by a Zn(salen) complex initiated by guest binding is reminiscent of conformation&#8208;induced reactivity of enzymes to enable chemical events that are otherwise inhibited.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of N&#8208;Propargylamides and Their Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptaaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;hexatrienylrhodium(I) complexes induce well&#8208;controlled polymerization of N&#8208;propargylamides and their derivatives in the presence of PPh3, and the obtained polymers have high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The living nature enables control of molecular weights of the polymers and functionalization of both polymer chain ends, and synthesis of novel block copolymers is also demonstrated.







Abstract
A substantially improved method for living polymerization of N&#8208;propargylamides and their derivatives has been developed. Rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain can work as excellent initiators of the polymerization of such non&#8208;conjugated terminal alkynes to give the corresponding cis&#8208;stereoregular polymers having a narrow molecular weight distribution. The typical living nature has been confirmed by investigating the effects of initial feed ratios of the monomer to the initiator on the molecular weight of the resulting polymers as well as multistage polymerization. Moreover, we demonstrated that the present method enables functionalization of both polymer chain ends and synthesis of novel block copolymers consisting of poly(N&#8208;propargylamide) and poly(phenylacetylene) blocks with a narrow molecular weight distribution.

         <title>In Situ Constructed Nano&#8208;Drug Depots through Intracellular Hydrolytic Condensation for Chemotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ is presented. Based on silicon particles, the nano&#8208;drug depots are capable of sustained drug release, which results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer.







Abstract
Intravesical administration of first&#8208;line drugs has shown failure in the treatment of bladder cancer owing to the poor tumor retention time of chemotherapeutics. Herein, we report an intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ, wherein sustained drug release results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer. Briefly, the designed doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;silane conjugates self&#8208;assemble into silane&#8208;based prodrug nanoparticles, which condense into silicon particle&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug depots inside tumor cells. Significantly, we demonstrate that the IHC system possesses highly potent antitumor efficacy, which leads to the regression and eradication of large established tumors and simultaneously extends the overall survival of air pouch bladder cancer mice compared with that of mice treated with Dox. The concept of intracellular hydrolytic condensation can be extended via conjugating other chemotherapeutic drugs, which may facilitate rational design of novel nanomedicines for augmentation of chemotherapy.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Highly Graphitic Carbon Urchin&#8208;Like Hollow Structures Loaded with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms towards Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous urchin&#8208;like N&#8208;doped carbon structures with abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites (Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)) are fabricated by a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy. The unique hollow thorns on the surface, high accessible surface area and good conductivity enable effective electron/mass transfer and afford numerous singe&#8208;Ni sites towards highly efficient CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
The rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts featuring excellent conductivity, highly accessible discrete active sites and favorable mass transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis but remains challenging. In this study, a reliable Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy is developed to synthesize a single&#8208;atom catalyst by transforming metallic Ni into single&#8208;Ni atoms anchored on hollow porous urchin&#8208;like (HPU) N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)), which possesses high crystallinity and sufficient Ni&#8208;N4 moiety (2.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The unique hollow thorns on the surface, good conductivity and large external surface area facilitate electron/mass transfer and exposure of single&#8208;Ni sites. As a result, the Ni&#8208;NC(HPU) catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and high stability for CO2 electroreduction. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can also be facilely extended to prepare distinct hollow porous architectures with similar components, such as the wire&#8208; and sphere&#8208;like ones.

         <title>Catalytic Substrate&#8208;Selective Silylation of Primary Alcohols via Remote Functional&#8208;Group Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular recognition of the substrate structure by catalyst 3 enabled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of long&#8208;chain primary alcohols. Silylation of A proceeded 11 times faster than that of B by recognition of a one&#8208;carbon difference between primary alcohols A and B. Preferential silylation of A took place over that of C by a factor of 21 owing to discrimination of the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting OH group at C(1).







Abstract
Silylation of alcohols has generally been known to take place at the sterically most accessible less&#8208;hindered hydroxy group. Herein, the catalyst&#8208;controlled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of primary alcohols, in which the selectivity was controlled independently of the innate reactivity of the hydroxy group, based on the steric environment, is reported. The chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective silylation of 1,n&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives was achieved and 1,5&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives showed outstandingly high reactivity in the presence of analogues with a shorter or longer chain length under catalyst&#8208;controlled conditions. A highly substrate&#8208;selective catalytic silylation of pentanol analogues was also developed, in which the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting hydroxy groups was effectively discriminated on silylation.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic (2+1) Cycloaddition of Thioketones to Synthesize Tetrasubstituted Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of catalytic enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides with thioketones is presented, catalyzed by chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co&#921;&#921; complexes. This method provides a rapid and facile access to a series of optically active tetrasubstituted thiiranes with good outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 97&#8201;% ee). The origin of stereoselectivity was well elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of thioketones with &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides for the direct synthesis of tetrasubstituted thiiranes. In the presence of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/cobalt(&#921;&#921;) complexes (2&#8211;5&#8197;mol%), excellent efficiency (up to 99&#8201;% yield within 15&#8197;mins) and high stereoselectivity (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 97&#8201;% ee) are available. Elaborations of thiiranes via desulfuration have also been conducted to deliver tetrasubstituted olefins. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reaction initiates from a doublet state cobalt(&#921;&#921;) carbenoid, which is followed by a quartet cobalt(&#921;&#921;)&#8208;bound thiocarbonyl ylide pathway. This work provides a route for the selective construction of tetrasubstituted thiiranes and olefins that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Deep Downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 by Caged Peptide&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen/miR&#8208;140 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tumor cells, a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe self&#8208;assembled with miR&#8208;140 could release the GO203 peptide binding to MUC1 and miR&#8208;140 degrading the PD&#8208;L1 mRNA, thus, achieving the deep downregulation the of PD&#8208;L1 expression. Subsequently, activated immune cells by PDT&#8208;induced release of TAAs would achieve more effective immunotherapy.







Abstract
Downregulating programmed cell death ligand 1(PD&#8208;L1) protein levels in tumor cells is an effective way to achieve immune system activation for oncology treatment, but current strategies are inadequate. Here, we design a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe (GCP) to self&#8208;assemble with miR&#8208;140 forming GCP/miR&#8208;140 nanoparticles. After entering tumor cells, GCP/miR&#8208;140 disassembles in the presence of Cathepsin B (CB) and releases caged GO203 peptide, miR&#8208;140 and PyTPA. Peptide decages in the highly reductive intracellular environment and binds to mucin 1 (MUC1), thereby downregulating the expression of PD&#8208;L1. Meanwhile, miR&#8208;140 reduces PD&#8208;L1 expression by targeting downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 mRNA. Under the action of PyTPA&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), tumor&#8208;associated antigens are released, triggering immune cell attack on tumor cells. This multiple mechanism&#8208;based strategy of deeply downregulating PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells activates the immune system and thus achieves effective immunotherapy.

         <title>A Desaturative Approach for Aromatic Aldehyde Synthesis via Synergistic Enamine, Photoredox and Cobalt Triple Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis enables a desaturative approach for the preparation of aromatic aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic aldehydes are fundamental intermediates that are widely utilised for the synthesis of important materials across the broad spectrum of chemical industries. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult as their functionalizations are generally performed via electrophilic aromatic substitution, SEAr. Here we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach whereby aromatic aldehydes are assembled from saturated precursors via a desaturative process. This novel strategy harnesses the high&#8208;fidelity of Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to quickly construct multi&#8208;substituted cyclohexenecarbaldehyde cores which undergo desaturation via the synergistic interplay of enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis.

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Crystalline Hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 with Open Nanoarchitectures via Anisotropic&#8208;Kinetics Transformation for the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
An anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy is developed to synthesize single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with highly open nanoarchitectures and different compositions. The as&#8208;prepared ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages exhibit remarkably improved catalytic lifetime and reduced coke formation rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction.







Abstract
We report an anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy to prepare single&#8208;crystalline aluminosilicate MFI zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5) with highly open nanoarchitectures and hierarchical porosities. The methodology relies on the cooperative effect of in situ etching and recrystallization on the evolution of pure&#8208;silica MFI zeolite (silicalite&#8208;1) nanotemplates under hydrothermal conditions. The strategy enables a controllable preparation of ZSM&#8208;5 nanostructures with diverse open geometries by tuning the relative rate difference between etching and recrystallization processes. Meanwhile, it can also be extended to synthesize other heteroatom&#8208;substituted MFI zeolite nanocages. Compared with conventional ZSM&#8208;5 microcrystals, nanocrystals, and nanoboxes, the ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages with single&#8208;crystalline nature, highly open nanoarchitectures, and hierarchical porosities exhibit remarkably enhanced catalytic lifetime and low coking rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction.

         <title>Tailoring a Nanochaperone to Regulate &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanochaperone for &#945;&#8208;synuclein was designed and fabricated to prevent the misassembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein. The nanochaperone, termed &#945;S&#8208;nChap, dynamically and transiently captures monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its oligomerization. Moreover, &#945;S&#8208;nChap tightly captures oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its fibrillization.







Abstract
Protein misassembly leads to the formation of dysfunctional and toxic molecular species relating to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tailored a nanochaperone (&#945;S&#8208;nChap) for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to regulate its assembly. The &#945;S&#8208;nChap is capable of i)&#8197;specifically recognizing &#945;&#8208;synuclein; ii)&#8197;dynamically capturing and stabilizing monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and retarding oligomerization; iii)&#8197;tightly capturing oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein to prevent fibrillization; and iv)&#8197;transporting &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers to the lysosomal degradation system. The regulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein assembly by &#945;S&#8208;nChap was studied in vitro. Moreover, the role of &#945;S&#8208;nChap preventing &#945;&#8208;synuclein pathology in cells and protecting neurons from apoptosis was investigated. The strategy of tailoring a nanochaperone to regulate aberrant assembly of pathogenic proteins provides important insights into protein misfolding diseases. We foresee that &#945;S&#8208;nChap has therapeutic value for Parkinson's disease.

         <title>Expressed Protein Selenoester Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) methodology that enables the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified proteins at high dilution is described. EPSL involves the one&#8208;pot conversion of protein acyl hydrazides (derived from recombinant intein fusion precursors) to protein aryl selenoesters, followed by ligation with synthetic modified selenopeptides and chemoselective deselenization.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development and application of a novel expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) methodology for the one&#8208;pot semi&#8208;synthesis of modified proteins. EPSL harnesses the rapid kinetics of ligation reactions between modified synthetic selenopeptides and protein aryl selenoesters (generated from expressed intein fusion precursors) followed by in situ chemoselective deselenization to afford target proteins at concentrations that preclude the use of traditional ligation methods. The utility of the EPSL technology is showcased through the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of ubiquitinated polypeptides, lipidated analogues of the membrane&#8208;associated GTPase YPT6, and site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated variants of the oligomeric chaperone protein Hsp27 at high dilution.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Covalent Triazine Frameworks in a NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 Eutectic Salt for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks with ordered molecular structures were synthesized in a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 eutectic salt system at 200&#8201;&#176;C to produce photocatalysts for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTFs) are typically produced by the salt&#8208;melt polycondensation of aromatic nitriles in the presence of ZnCl2. In this reaction, molten ZnCl2 salt acts as both a solvent and Lewis acid catalyst. However, when cyclotrimerization takes place at temperatures above 300&#8201;&#176;C, undesired carbonization occurs. In this study, an ionothermal synthesis method for CTF&#8208;based photocatalysts was developed using a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 eutectic salt (ES) mixture with a melting point of approximately 200&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature is lower than the melting point of pure ZnCl2 (318&#8201;&#176;C), thus providing milder salt&#8208;melt conditions. These conditions facilitated the polycondensation process, while avoiding carbonization of the polymeric backbone. The resulting CTF&#8208;ES200 exhibited enhanced optical and electronic properties, and displayed remarkable photocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Arylation of Tertiary C&#8722;H Bonds of Cyclobutylmethyl Ketones Using Transient Directing Groups</title>

         <dc:description>
A PdII&#8208;catalyzed tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group is reported. An electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand was identified an external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers was readily accessed in up to 81&#8201;% yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8722;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation.







Abstract
We report the first example of selective PdII&#8208;catalyzed tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group. An electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand was identified as the optimal external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers was readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups in up to 81&#8201;% yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8722;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation.

         <title>Directing Multivalent Aptamer&#8208;Receptor Binding on the Cell Surface with Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA framework&#8208;based programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) and their assemblies with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality were designed. These are employed to direct multivalent aptamer&#8211;receptor binding on the cell membrane interface. The directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces and thus high affinity against target tumor cells.







Abstract
Multivalent interactions of biomolecules play pivotal roles in physiological and pathological settings. Whereas the directionality of the interactions is crucial, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic multivalent ligand&#8211;receptor systems generally lack programmable approaches for orthogonal directionality. Here, we report the design of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) to direct multivalent aptamer&#8211;receptor binding on the cell interface. The positions of the aptamer motifs can be prescribed on tetrahedral DNA frameworks to realize atom&#8208;like orthogonal valence and direction, enabling the construction of multivalent molecules with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality. These directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces. We demonstrate the high&#8208;affinity tumor cell binding with a linear aptPAN oligomer (&#8776;13&#8208;fold improved compared to free aptamers), which leads to &#8776;50&#8201;% suppression of cell growth.

         <title>Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interfacial Chemistry Modulation for Ultra&#8208;High Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a THF&#8208;based electrolyte with a weak solvation structure, Na+ desolvation is fast and a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with abundant NaF and organic compounds is generated on the commercial hard carbon anode. This greatly enhances the interface stability and enables the rapid migration of Na+ in the SEI, thus realizing the high rate capability, long&#8208;term stability and good low&#8208;temperature performance for the hard carbon anode.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries capable of operating at rate and temperature extremes are highly desirable, but elusive due to the dynamics and thermodynamics limitations. Herein, a strategy of electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfacial chemistry modulation is proposed. The commercial hard carbon demonstrates superior rate performance with 212&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the electrolyte with weak ion solvation/desolvation, which is much higher than those in common electrolytes (nearly no capacity in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes). Even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, a high capacity of 175&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (74&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity) can be maintained at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Such an electrode retains 90&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. As proven, weak ion solvation/desolvation of tetrahydrofuran greatly facilitates fast&#8208;ion diffusion at the SEI/electrolyte interface and homogeneous SEI with well&#8208;distributed NaF and organic components ensures fast Na+ diffusion through the SEI layer and a stable interface.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Hosted Enzymes for Continuous Flow Catalysis in Aqueous and Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow enzyme reactor was developed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to immobilize the enzyme. The MOF NU&#8208;1000 was inserted into a HPLC column and loaded with esterase without any modification of the MOF or the enzyme. A high space&#8208;time yield of 1432&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved, and the stability of the immobilized enzyme was enhanced to about 30 times that of the free enzyme.







Abstract
Fully exploiting the potential of enzymes in cell&#8208;free biocatalysis requires stabilization of the catalytically active proteins and their integration into efficient reactor systems. Although in recent years initial steps towards the immobilization of such biomolecules in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken, these demonstrations have been limited to batch experiments and to aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate a MOF&#8208;based continuous flow enzyme reactor system, with high productivity and stability, which is also suitable for organic solvents. Under aqueous conditions, the stability of the enzyme was increased 30&#8208;fold, and the space&#8211;time yield exceeded that obtained with other enzyme immobilization strategies by an order of magnitude. Importantly, the infiltration of the proteins into the MOF did not require additional functionalization, thus allowing for time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient fabrication of the biocatalysts using label&#8208;free enzymes.

The MOF NU-1000 was inserted into a HPLC column and loaded with esterase without any modification of the MOF or the enzyme. A high space-time yield of 1432&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved, and the stability of the immobilized enzyme was enhanced to about 30 times that of the free enzyme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully exploiting the potential of enzymes in cell-free biocatalysis requires stabilization of the catalytically active proteins and their integration into efficient reactor systems. Although in recent years initial steps towards the immobilization of such biomolecules in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken, these demonstrations have been limited to batch experiments and to aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate a MOF-based continuous flow enzyme reactor system, with high productivity and stability, which is also suitable for organic solvents. Under aqueous conditions, the stability of the enzyme was increased 30-fold, and the space&#8211;time yield exceeded that obtained with other enzyme immobilization strategies by an order of magnitude. Importantly, the infiltration of the proteins into the MOF did not require additional functionalization, thus allowing for time- and cost-efficient fabrication of the biocatalysts using label-free enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Profiling of the ADP&#8208;Ribosylome in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For further studies on protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation, two new NAD+ derivatives are introduced, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag. In combination with developed methods for their mild cell delivery, studies of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living human cells were conducted. This approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) with ADP&#8208;ribose and poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as substrate is involved in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways in eukaryotes, notably the response to DNA damage caused by cellular stress. Nevertheless, due to intrinsic properties of NAD+ e.g., high polarity and associated poor cell passage, these PTMs are difficult to characterize in cells. Here, two new NAD+ derivatives are presented, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag and, in combination with developed methods for mild cell delivery, allow studies in living human cells. We show that this approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes such as H2O2&#8208;induced oxidative stress or the effect of the approved anti&#8208;cancer drug olaparib. Our results therefore pave the way for further functional and clinical studies of the ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteome in living cells in health and disease.

         <title>Haptotropism in a Nickel Complex with a Neutral, &#960;&#8208;Bridging cyclo&#8208;P4 Ligand Analogous to Cyclobutadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;dependent reaction of white phosphorus with a Ni0 reagent incorporating a chelating bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) leads to complexes with neutral P2 and P4 ligands. The latter mirrors the coordination of cyclobutadiene to Ni0, displaying olefin&#8208;like bonding and &#951;2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;haptotropism, and can be converted to the former. These findings emphasize the fluidity of cyclo&#8208;P4 coordination modes.







Abstract
Dedicated to Professor Manfred Scheer on the occasion of his 65th birthday
The reaction of (1)Ni(&#951;2&#8208;cod), 2, incorporating a chelating bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) 1, with P4 in pentane yielded the dinuclear complex [(2)Ni]2(&#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P4), 3, formally featuring a cyclobutadiene&#8208;like, neutral, rectangular, &#960;&#8208;bridging P4&#8208;ring. In toluene, the butterfly&#8208;shaped complex [(1)Ni]2(&#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P2), 4, with a formally neutral P2&#8208;unit was obtained from 2 and either P4 or 3. Computational studies showed that a haptotropic rearrangement involving two isomers of the &#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P4 coordination mode and a low&#8208;energy &#956;2,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P4 coordination mode, as previously predicted for related nickel cyclobutadiene complexes, could explain the coalescence observed in the low&#8208;temperature NMR spectra of 3. The insertion of the (1)Ni fragment into a P&#8722;P bond of P7(SiMe3)3, forming complex 5 with a norbornane&#8208;like P7 ligand, was also observed.

         <title>Mechanochemical Access to a Short&#8208;Lived Cyclic Dimer Pd2L2: An Elusive Kinetic Species En Route to Molecular Triangle Pd3L3 and Molecular Square Pd4L4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, a classic self&#8208;assembly reaction studied for the past 30&#8197;years, would always give molecular square Pd4L4 and/or triangle Pd3L3. By solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling, a highly&#8208;reactive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 is isolated for the first time as the major species, highlighting that unique chemical space mechanochemistry can provide an environment to stabilize species that are otherwise too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;based molecular square Pd4L4 and triangle Pd3L3 represent the molecular ancestors of metal&#8208;coordination polyhedra that have been an integral part of the field for the last 30&#8197;years. Conventional solution&#8208;based reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine exclusively give Pd4L4 and/or Pd3L3 as the sole products. We herein show that, under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions, the self&#8208;assembly energy landscape can be thermodynamically manipulated to form an elusive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 for the first time. In the absence of solvent, Pd2L2 is indefinitely stable in the solid&#8208;state, but converts rapidly to its thermodynamic products Pd3L3 and Pd4L4 in solution, confirming Pd2L2 as a short&#8208;lived kinetic species in the solution&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly process. Our results highlight how mechanochemistry grants access to a vastly different chemical space than available under conventional solution conditions. This provides a unique opportunity to isolate elusive species in self&#8208;assembly processes that are too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.

         <title>Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]: A Heteroanionic Nonlinear Optical Material Containing Planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and Heteroleptic [SnOSe3] Anionic Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inorganic heteroanionic materials are attracting increasing attention for exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials because they could better satisfy the necessary but conflicting properties of NLO crystals,  e.g.  large SHG response and wide band&#8208;gap. Up to now, the reports on heteroanionic NLO materials are mainly focused on ultraviolet or visible oxide&#8208;based fluoroborates, fluorophosphates, borate&#8208;phosphates and borate&#8208;iodates. However, the chalcogenide containing different kinds of anionic groups is barely reported. Herein, we have synthesized the first oxychalcogenide&#8208;carbonate, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] that contains two different kinds of anionic groups, [SnOSe3] and [CO3]. It crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric space group and exhibits fascinating NLO properties, including large SHG response (~1&#215;AGS), sufficient birefringence (0.12 @1064 nm), wide band&#8208;gap (3.46 eV) and high laser damage threshold (240 MW/cm2). These make Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]  &#160;a promising NLO crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unravelling the mechanism&#160;of charge accumulation and utilization in the light&#8208;driven carbon dioxide reduction using iron porphyrins bearing hydrogen bonding scaffolds revealed unprecedented puzzle pieces about its rate limiting step. While the formal Fe(0) redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, Zakaria Halime, Ally Aukauloo et&#8197;al. show in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117530) that the Fe(I) species is already involved in the substrate activation of the photocatalytic cycle.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold is a valuable metal that can be dissolved with common household chemicals as reported by Timo Repo&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;in their Research Article (e202117587). By applying catalytic iodine, aqueous hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazol, gold promptly dissolves in ethanol. Catalytic reactions and environmentally benign solvents and reagents are the basis for sustainable development and a gateway to greener future of precious metals recycling.

         <title>Accelerated Mechanochemistry in Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution polymer mechanochemistry is well understood in random coil morphology. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115325), Charles&#8197;E. Diesendruck and Hang Zhang assess covalent mechanochemistry when &#945;&#8208;helices are present in covalent macromolecules. Poly&#8208;&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;glutamate (PBG) with different helicities are prepared by tuning the enantiomeric excess of the feed monomer. Ultrasonication is used to induce solvodynamic shear, leading to the scission of the polymer into smaller helixes.

         <title>Circularly Polarized White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Spiro&#8208;type Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we report the first all thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials based circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;WOLEDs). Two pairs of spiro&#8208;type TADF enantiomers, (R/S)&#8208;SPOCN (5,5'&#8208;((2,2',3,3'&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1,1'&#8208;spirobi [indene]&#8208;7,7'&#8208;diyl)bis(oxy))bis (4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenoxazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phthalonitrile)) and (R/S)&#8208;OSFSO (2'&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) spiro[quinolino [3,2,1&#8208;kl]phenoxazine&#8208;9,9'&#8208;thioxanthene]&#8208;10',10'&#8208;dioxide), serve as emitters with complementary emission. The CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit warm white emission with CIE coordinate of (0.35, 0.46). Besides, decent device performances are observed with external quantum efficiency up to 21.6% at maximum&#160;and 11.8% at 1000 cd/m2. Obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence signals are detected with dissymmetry factor |gEL| around 3.0 &#215; 10&#8208;3. This is the the first report of CP&#8208;WOLEDs that can harvest both of singlet and triplet excitons, which provides a feasible strategy to develop CP&#8208;WOLEDs with remarkable device performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystal via a Persistent Radical Cation Acceptor for Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals for efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion is a long&#8208;sought goal but remains challenging. Here we construct a unique CT cocrystal by using persistent 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3 ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS  +&#8226;  ) as the electron acceptor. The strong persistency and electron affinity of ABTS  +&#8226;  endow a high degree of electron delocalization between ABTS  +&#8226;  and 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine donor. Together with the intrinsic long&#8208;wavelength absorption of ABTS  +&#8226;  , the synthesized cocrystal can effectively capture the full solar spectrum and show distinguished photothermal efficiency. Such cocrystal is further used for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation, and a high evaporation rate of 1.407 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 97.0% have been achieved upon 1 sun irradiation. This work indicates the enormous prospects for charge transfer&#8208;based functional materials through rational radical cations engineering.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Study of enantioselective recognition in water by synthetic chiral macrocyclic receptors is undoubtedly of theoretical and practical significance, but it is a big challenge to achieve the enantioselective recognition with both high enantioselectivity and high affinity in water probably due to the deficiency of such water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors with stable chiral cavities. Herein, we report a new class of chiral macrocyclic arenes named octopus[3]arenes. The enantiomeric macrocycles are composed of three homochiral ethenoanthracene subunits, and they can be synthesized by two pathways and then easily converted into water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes  P  &#8208;  1  and  M  &#8208;  1  . Notably,  P  &#8208;  1  and  M  &#8208;  1  with the rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities exhibit highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with association constant up to 10  6  M  &#8208;1  and  S  /  R  selectivity high up to 12.89.</dc:description>

         <title>An Acid&#8208;regulated Self&#8208;blinking Fluorescent Probe for Resolving Whole&#8208;cell Lysosomes with Long&#8208;term Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging appears to be increasingly important for unraveling organelle dynamics at the nanoscale, but is challenging due to the need for highly photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes. Here, we report a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore that achieved 12 nm spatial resolution and 20 ms time resolution under acidic lysosomal conditions. This fluorophore was successfully applied in super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosomal dynamics over 40 min. The pH dependence of the dye during blinking made the fluorophore sensitive to lysosomal pH. This probe enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed us to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosomal distribution, size, and luminal pH. We also observed a variety of lysosome movement trajectories and different types of interactions modes between lysosomes.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Design Strategy Enabling the Synthesis of Hydrolysis&#8208;Resistant, Water&#8208;Stable Titanium(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its prevalence in the environment, the chemistry of the Ti  4+  ion has long been relegated to anhydrous solutions or hydrolyzed TiO  2  polymorphs. A knowledge gap in stabilizing molecular Ti  4+  species in aqueous environments has prevented the use of this ion for various applications such as cancer therapy, radioimaging, design of water&#8208;compatible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and aqueous&#8208;phase molecular catalysis applications. Herein, we demonstrate that a fragment&#8208;based screening approach of bidentate chelators with Ti  4+  in aqueous solution, as well as computational and structural analysis reliably predicts that a hexadentate analogues of catechol (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol) and deferiprone (3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;pyridone), TREN&#8208;CAM and THP  Me  respectively, form mononuclear Ti  4+  complexes resistant against hydrolysis from pH 4&#8208;10. We further validate our findings using radiochemical labeling with the short&#8208;lived isotopeTi&#8208;45, which demonstrates that the [  45  Ti]Ti&#8208;TREN&#8208;CAM complex remains inert against transchelation in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Borylation of Pyridines with Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports a site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H borylation of pyridines at the  ortho&#8208;position with pinacolborane enabled by an yttrocene catalyst. The reaction provides a new family of 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates with a broad substrate scope and high atom efficiency. The resultant boronates were able to undergo a variety of transformations,  e.g., oxidation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, Chan&#8208;Lam amination and etherification. Catalytic intermediates, including  ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H metalated and borylated complexes, were isolated from stoichiometric experiments and confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Borylation Using Silyl&#8208;Bipyridine Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New ligands for the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation of aliphatic compounds were established. In sharp contrast to 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine and 6&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, 2,2&#180;&#8209;bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives bearing a hydrosilylmethyl group (which would give a thermally stable NNSi pincer complex) served as suitable ligands for the reaction. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand was shown to be an excellent ligand, and various aliphatic compounds were efficiently converted to the corresponding borylated products using the Ir/NNSi pincer catalyst system. The NNSi pincer ligand showed unique selectivity and enabled the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation using pinacolborane [H&#8211;B(pin)] instead of B2(pin)2. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2&#160;was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Bonding Model for Gold(I) Species: The Importance of Pauli Repulsion Revealed in a Gold(I)&#8208;Cyclobutadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the bonding of gold(I) species has been central to the development of gold (I) catalysis. Herein, we present the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal characterization of the first gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex, accompanied with bonding analysis by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy decomposition analysis methods. Analysis of possible coordination modes for the new species not only confirms established characteristics of gold(I) bonding, but also suggests that Pauli repulsion is a key yet hitherto overlooked element. Additionally, we obtain a new perspective on gold(I)&#8208;bonding by comparison of the gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene to congeners stabilized by p&#8208;, d&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals. Consequently, we refine the gold(I) bonding model, with a delicate interplay of Pauli repulsion and charge transfer as the key driving force for various coordination motifs. Pauli repulsion is similarly determined as a significant interaction in gold(I)&#8208;alkyne species, corroborating this revised understanding of gold(I) bonding</dc:description>

         <title>Dismutation of Tricyanoboryllead Compounds:&#160;The Homoleptic Tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of unprecedently air&#8208;stable (tricyanoboryl)&#173;plum&#173;bate anions was obtained by the reaction of the boron&#8208;centered nucleophile B(CN)32&#173;&#8211; with triorganyllead halides. Salts of the anions [R3PbB(CN)3]&#8211; (R = Ph, Et) were isolated and found to be stable in air at room temperature. In the case of Me3PbHal (Hal&#160;= Cl, Br), a mixture of the anions [Me4&#8211;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8211;&#160;(n = 1, 2) was obtained. The [Et3Pb&#173;B(CN)3]&#8211;&#160;ion undergoes stepwise dismutation in aqueous solution to yield the plum&#173;bate anions [Et4&#8211;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8211;&#160;(n = 1&#8211;4) and PbEt4&#160;as by&#8208;product. The reaction rate increases with decreasing pH value of the aqueous solution or by bubbling O2&#160;through the reaction mixture. Adjustment of the conditions allowed the selective formation and isolation of salts of all anions of the series [Et4&#8211;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8211;  (n&#160;= 1&#8211;4) including the homoleptic tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8211;.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic  gem  &#8208;dichlorides are shown to be efficient substrates for catalytic asymmetric allylboration of alkynes. The method employs a chiral NHC&#8208;Cu catalyst capable of generating in a single step chiral skipped dienes bearing a  Z  &#8208;alkenyl chloride, a trisubstituted  E  &#8208;alkenyl boronate and a bis&#8208;allylic stereocenter with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. This high degree of functionalization makes these products versatile building blocks as illustrated with the synthesis of several optically active compounds. DFT calculations support the key presence of a metal cation bridge ligand&#8208;substrate interaction and account for the stereoselectivity outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Boron Carbide on Titanium Dioxide Nanobelt Arrays for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti acts as an efficient and stable 3D electrocatalyst for converting NO to NH3, exhibiting an NH3 yield of 3678.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%. An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves both high power densities and NH3 yields. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic NO reduction is regarded as an attractive strategy to degrade the NO contaminant into useful NH3, but the lack of efficient and stable electrocatalysts to facilitate such multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes impedes its applications. Here, we report on developing amorphous B2.6C supported on a TiO2 nanoarray on a Ti plate (a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti) as an NH3&#8208;producing nanocatalyst with appreciable activity and durability toward the NO electroreduction. It shows a yield of 3678.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a FE of 87.6&#8201;%, superior to TiO2/Ti (563.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 42.6&#8201;%) and a&#8208;B2.6C/Ti (2499.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 85.6&#8201;%). An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves a power density of 1.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 1125&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Non&#8208;binary Encoded Nucleic Acid Barcodes Directly Readable by a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A large collection of unique molecular barcodes is useful in the simultaneous sensing or screening of molecular analytes. Though the sequence of DNA has been widely applied to encode for molecular barcodes, decoding of these barcodes is normally assisted by sequencing. We here demonstrate a barcode system based solely on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic nucleic acids and direct nanopore decoding. Each molecular barcode is composed of &#8220;n&#8221; distinct information nodes in a non&#8208;binary manner and can be sequentially scanned and decoded by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. Nanopore events containing step&#8208;shaped features were consistently reported. 14 unique information nodes were developed which in principle could encode for 14  n  unique molecular barcodes in a barcode containing &#8220;n&#8221; information nodes. These barcode probes were adapted to detect different antibody proteins or cancer&#8208;related microRNAs, suggesting their immediate application in a wide variety of sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>PO43&#8208; Coordinated Robust Single&#8208;Atom Platinum&#160;Catalyst for Selective Polyol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient catalytic conversion over heterogeneous catalyst with excellent resistance against leaching is still a grand challenge for sustainable chemical synthesis in aqueous solution. Herein, we devised a single&#8208;atom Pt  1  /hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst via a simple hydrothermal strategy. Gratifyingly, this robust Pt  1  /HAP catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability for the selective oxidation of C  2  &#8208;C  4  polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids. It is found that the Pt&#8208;(O&#8208;P) linkages with strong electronic&#8208;withdrawing function of PO  4  3&#8208;  (Pt  1  &#8208;OPO  4  3&#8208;  pair active site) not only realize the activation of C&#8208;H bond, but also destabilize the transition state from adsorbed hydroxy acids toward the C&#8208;C cleavage, resulting in the sharply increased selectivity of hydroxy acids. Moreover, the strong PO  4  3&#8208;  &#8208;coordination effect provides electrostatic stabilization for single&#8208;atom Pt, ensuring the highly efficient catalysis of Pt  1  /HAP for over 160 hours with superior leaching resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;throughput approach to repurposing olefin polymerization catalysts for polymer upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and economical plastic waste upcycling to prevent environmental accumulation relies on the development of catalysts capable of polymer degradation. A systematic high&#8208;throughput screening of twenty&#8208;eight polymerization catalysts precursors, belonging to the catalyst families of metallocenes, ansa&#8208;metallocenes, and hemi&#8208; and post&#8208;metallocenes, in cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polybutadiene (PB) degradation reveals, for the first time, important structure&#8208;activity correlations. The upcycling conditions involve activation of the catalysts (at 0.18% catalyst loading) with 15&#8208;30 equiv of tri&#8208;iso&#8208;butyl aluminum at 50 &#176;C in toluene. The data indicate the ability to degrade PB is a general reactivity profile of neutral group 4 metal hydrides. A simple quantitative&#8208;structure activity relationship (QSAR) model utilizing two descriptors for the distribution of steric bulk in the active pocket and one descriptor measuring the electrophilicity of the metal ion reveals that the degradation ability increases with an a) increased but not overbearing steric congestion and b) lower electrophilicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8211;H Silylation of Heteroarenes for the Synthesis of Acyclic Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation for the synthesis of acyclic silanes bearing silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in one enantiomeric form remains unknown to date. Herein, we report the first enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes. This process undergoes a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of acyclic heteroarylated silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, including bis&#8208;Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes, in decent yields with excellent  chemo  &#8208;,  regio  &#8208;, and  stereo  &#8208;control, which significantly enlarge the chemical space of the optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomer&#8208;assisted&#160;Photoactive Layers Enable&#160;&gt;18% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have unique advantages in improving device performance, the morphology assembly in ternary&#8208;phase would be more uncertain or complex than that in binary&#8208;phase. Here, we propose a new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted photoactive layers for high&#8208;performance OSCs. The formed alloy&#8208;like phase of the oligomer:host polymer blend enabled the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs fusing the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, exhibiting substantially enhanced performance and stability compared to the control devices. With the addition of oligomers, outstanding efficiencies of 17.33% for PM6:Y6 device, 18.32% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 device, and 17.13% for PM6/Y6 pseudo&#8208;bilayer device were achieved, all of which are one of the highest values in their corresponding fields. The improved performance originated from the downshift energy levels, enhanced light absorption, optimized blend morphology, favorable charge dynamics, and reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C(sp2)&#8211;Si Coupling of Chlorohydrosilanes via Si&#8211;Cl Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a new method for the synthesis of organohydrosilanes from phenols and ketones. This method is established through reductive C&#8211;Si coupling of chlorohydrosilanes via unconventional Si&#8211;Cl cleavage. The reaction offers access to aryl&#8208; and alkenylhydrosilanes with a scope that is complementary to those of the established methods. Electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled successfully. Functionalities, including Grignard&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., primary amine, amide, phenol, ketone, ester, and free indole), acid&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., ketal and THP protection), alkyl&#8211;Cl, pyridine, furan, thiophene, Ar&#8211;Bpin, and Ar&#8211;SiMe3, were tolerated. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, incorporation of &#8208;Si(H)R2 into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organohydrosilanes are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Nonlinearity Induced by Coaxial Alignment of Polar Chain and Dense [BO3] Units in CaZn2(BO3)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of new efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with large second&#8208;order nonlinearity for short&#8208;wave UV spectral region (&#955;  PM  &#8804; 266 nm, PM = phase&#8208;matching) is still very challenging. Herein, by applying tetrahedra substitution strategy based on Sr  2  Be  2  B  2  O  7  (SBBO), a new beryllium&#8208;free borate CaZn  2  (BO  3  )  2  with double&#8208;layered configuration was rationally designed, which not only preserves the structural merits but also eliminates the limitations of SBBO crystal. CaZn  2  (BO  3  )  2  shows a large PM second harmonic generation (SHG) reponse of 3.8&#215;KDP, which is 38 times higher than its barium analogue. This enhancement originates from the  1  [Zn  2  O  6  ]  &#8734;  polar chains with large net dipole moment and [BO  3  ] units with high NLO active density. Our findings show the great significance of [ZnO  4  ] tetrahedra introduced strategy to design beryllium&#8208;free SBBO&#8208;type NLO crystals and also verify the feasibility of using simple non&#8208;isomorphic substitution to induce giant second&#8208;order nonlinearity enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Topochemical Postulates: Are They Relevant for Topochemical Reactions Occurring at Elevated Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rigid&#160;inositol derived monomer functionalized with azide and alkyne as the complementary reactive groups (CRGs) crystallized as three distinct polymorphs&#160;  I&#8208;III  . Despite the unsuitable orientation of CRGs in the crystals for complete polymerization, all the three polymorphs underwent regiospecific and quantitative topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization upon heating to yield three different polymorphs of 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl&#8208;linked&#8208;poly&#8208;  neo  &#8208;inositol. The molecules in these polymorphs exploit the weak intermolecular interactions, free space in the crystal lattice, and heat energy for their large and cooperative molecular motion to attain a transient reactive orientation, ultimately leading to the regiospecific TAAC reaction yielding distinct crystalline polymers. This study cautions that the overreliance on topochemical postulates for the prediction of topochemical reactivity at high temperatures could be misleading.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Trefoil Knots Featuring Pentadecanuclear Homoleptic AuI&#8208;, AuI/AgI&#8208;, or AuI/CuI&#8208;Alkynyl Coordination</title>

         <dc:description>
Au15 molecular trefoil knots, based on AuI&#8208;alkynyl coordination and featuring AuI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AuI interactions, self&#8208;assemble without requiring bi&#8208; or multidentate/multipodal ligands. These trefoil knots with unprecedentedly high metal nuclearity per trefoil knot strand react with CuI/AgI species to give Au9M6 (M=Cu/Ag) trefoil knots. The solid&#8208;state structures, solution behavior, and photoluminescence properties of the trefoil knots were investigated.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;containing molecular trefoil knots are fascinating ensembles that are usually covalently assembled, the latter requiring the rational design of di&#8208; or multidentate/multipodal ligands as connectors. In this work, we describe the self&#8208;assembly of pentadecanuclear AuI trefoil knots [Au15(C&#8801;CR)15] from monoalkynes HC&#8801;CR (R=9,9&#8208;X2&#8208;fluorenyl with X=nBu, n&#8208;hexyl) and [AuI(THT)Cl]. Hetero&#8208;bimetallic counterparts [Au9M6(C&#8801;CR)15] (M=Cu/Ag) were self&#8208;assembled by reactions of [Au15(C&#8801;CR)15] with [Cu(MeCN)4]+/AgNO3 and HC&#8801;CR. The type of pentadecanuclear trefoil knots described herein is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS. [Au9Cu6(C&#8801;CR)15] is relatively stable in hexane; its excited state properties were investigated. DFT calculations revealed that non&#8208;covalent metal&#8211;metal and metal&#8211;ligand interactions, together with longer alkyl chain&#8208;strengthened inter&#8208;ligand dispersion interactions, govern the stability of the trefoil knot structures.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Quantification of a Highly Biocompatible Dinuclear Iridium(III) Complex for Photocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantification of intracellular content of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs in a single cancer cell remains a challenge. Here, we used single&#8208;cell inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry to study the uptake and retention of mononuclear (Ir1) and dinuclear (Ir2) Ir(III) photo&#8208;redox catalysts in every single cancer cell. This method allowed rapid and precise quantification of drug in individual cancer cells. Importantly, Ir2 showed a significant synergism but not an additive effect for NAD(P)H photocatalytic oxidation. The lysosome&#8208;targeting Ir2 showed low dark toxicity in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo. Ir2 exhibited high photocatalytic therapeutic efficiency at 525 nm with an excellent photo&#8208;index in&#8208;vitro and against tumor&#8208;bearing mice model in vivo. Interestingly, the photocatalytic anticancer profile of the dinuclear Ir2 was much better than the mononuclear Ir1, indicating for the first time that dinuclear metal&#8208;based photocatalysts can be applied for photocatalytic anticancer research.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric&#160;&#946;&#8208;Oxygen Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination reaction is reported in the form of a zirconium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric opening of  meso  &#8208;ketene acetals. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is demonstrated. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, at low catalyst loadings, and produces chiral monoprotected  cis  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diols in good yield and enantiomeric excess. The combination with a Mitsunobu reaction or a one&#8208;pot hydroboration/Suzuki reaction sequence then give&#160;access to additional diol and aminoalcohol building blocks. A stereochemical analysis supported by DFT calculations reveals that a high selectivity in the hydrozirconation step is also important for achieving high enantioselectivity, although it does not constitute the asymmetric step. This insight is crucial for the future development of related asymmetric &#946;&#8208;elimination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Generation of (Iodinated) Polyarenes using Organogermane as Orthogonal Masking Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the modular construction of molecules from suitable building blocks is a powerful means to more rapidly generate a diversity of molecules than through customized syntheses, the further evolution of the underlying coupling methodology is key to realize widespread applications. We herein disclose a complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling strategy of boron containing precursors, which relies on organogermane containing building blocks as key orthogonal functionality and an electrophilic (rather than nucleophilic) unmasking event paired with air&#8208;stable Pd(I) dimer based bond construction. This allows to significantly shorten the reaction times for the iterative coupling steps and/or to close gaps in the accessible compound space, enabling straightforward access also to iodinated compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Diverse Chemiluminescent Dioxetane&#8208;Luminophores Through Convergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane luminophores are an important class of chemiluminescent molecular probes for diagnostics and imaging. We have developed a new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. In a following simple step, the dioxetane is obtained by oxidation of the enolether precursor with singlet&#8208;oxygen. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible.&#160;Such a late&#8208;stage derivatization strategy simplifies the rapid exploration of novel luminogenic molecular structures in a library format and simplifies the synthesis of known dioxetane luminophores.&#160;We expect that this new synthetic strategy will be particularly useful in the design and synthesis of yet unexplored dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Synthesis Enabled Sulfur Atom Strategy for Polymerization&#8208;enhanced and Two&#8208;photon Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facile tailoring of photosensitizers (PSs) with advanced and synergetic properties is highly expected to broaden and deepen the photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. Herein, a catalyst&#8208;free thiol&#8208;yne click reaction was employed to develop the sulfur atom&#8208;based PSs by using the in situ formed sulfur &#8220;heavy atom effect&#8221; to enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC), while such effect can be remarkably magnified by the polymerization. The introduction of tetraphenylpyrazine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) unit was also advantageous in PS design by suppressing their non&#8208;radiative decay to facilitate the ISC in the aggregated state. Besides, the resulting sulfur atom electron donor, together with double bond &#960; bridge and AIE electron acceptor, created a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecular system with good two&#8208;photon excitation properties. Combined with the high singlet oxygen generation efficiency, the fabricated polymer nanoparticles exhibited an excellent in vitro two photon&#8208;excited PDT towards the cancer cells, therefore possessing a huge potential for the deep&#8208;tissue disease therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Biologically Safe, Versatile, and Smart Bismuthene Functionalized with a Drug Delivery System Based on Red Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are currently attracting widespread attention for cancer therapy. However, high toxicity, insensitivity to external stimuli and single therapeutic modality are still key issues hindering their clinical application. Therefore, the construction of a secure, intelligent and versatile nanocomposite is necessary to meet clinical expectations. Herein, we developed a nanocomposite of Bi@RP&#8208;PEG&#8208;DOX with 2D bismuthene loaded with 0D red phosphorus quantum dots and DOX. The nanocomposite with DOX loading capacity (~250%) and photothermal conversion efficiency (~54%) showed synergistic photothermal and photodynamic effects and a sensitive response of drug release to the acidic tumor microenvironment or NIR &#8545; laser irradiation. In particular, based on the Bi and RP, the nanocomposite exhibits good biosafety. Moreover, with the X&#8208;ray attenuation properties of bismuth, the nanocomposite serves as an excellent CT contrast agent, providing potential to perform CT&#8208;guided therapy. Overall, this work provides a promising, biosafe and synergistic strategy for clinical nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Dearomative Hydrogen Atom Abstraction/ Cyclization Cascade of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon irradiation with visible light and sensitization with thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (TXT), substituted indoles undergo a facile and high&#8208;yielding hydrogen atom transfer/cyclization cascade to dearomatized, spirocyclic products.







Abstract
The photochemical synthesis of yet unknown 2&#8208;oxospiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (17 examples, 80&#8211;95&#8201;% yield), 2,4&#8208;dioxospiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (eight examples, 87&#8211;97&#8201;% yield), and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (17 examples, 85&#8211;97&#8201;% yield) is described. Starting from readily accessible 3&#8208;substituted indoles, a dearomatization of the indole core was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955;=420&#8197;nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10&#8197;mol%) as the sensitizer. Based on mechanistic evidence (triplet energy determination, deuteration experiments, by&#8208;product analysis) it is proposed that the reaction proceeds by energy transfer via a 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;diradical intermediate. The latter intermediates are formed by excited state hydrogen atom transfer from suitable alkyl groups within the C3 substituent to the indole C2 carbon atom. Subsequent ring closure proceeds with pronounced diastereoselectivity to generate a 4&#8208; or 5&#8208;membered spirocyclic dearomatized product with several options for further functionalization.

         <title>Selective Coupling of 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters at the more Substituted Site through Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective monofunctionalization of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters was achieved by using a catalyst&#8208;free photoinduced coupling with (hetero)aryl nitriles. The reaction proceeds through electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;driven deboronation and radical 1,2&#8208;boron shift, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reaction also works with primary, secondary, and tertiary boronic esters.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;boronic esters are useful synthetic intermediates particularly as the two boronic esters can be selectively functionalized. Usually, the less hindered primary boronic ester reacts, but herein, we report a coupling reaction that enables the reversal of this selectivity. This is achieved through the formation of a boronate complex with an electron&#8208;rich aryllithium which, in the presence of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl nitrile, leads to the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex. Following visible&#8208;light photoinduced electron transfer, a primary radical is generated which isomerizes to the more stable secondary radical before radical&#8208;radical coupling with the arene radical&#8208;anion, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reactions proceed under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters to provide trans&#8208;substituted products, complementing the selectivity observed in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction.

         <dc:description>We herein describe a new design principle to achieve B/N&#8208;doped cyclophane where an electron&#8208;donor block of three triarylamines (Ar  3  N) and acceptor block of three triarylboranes (Ar  3  B) are spatially separated on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;extended ring system. DFT computations revealed the distinct electronic structure of the  block  &#8208;type macrocycle  MC&#8208;  b  &#8208;B3N3  with a greatly enhanced dipole moment and reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap in comparison to its analogue with alternating B and N sites,  MC&#8208;  alt  &#8208;B3N3  . The unique arrangement of borane acceptor Ar  3  B and amine donor Ar  3  N components in  MC&#8208;  b  &#8208;B3N3  induces exceptionally strong intramolecular charge transfer in the excited state, which is reflected in a largely red&#8208;shifted luminescence at 612 nm in solution. The respective linear open&#8208;chain oligomer  L&#8208;  b  &#8208;B3N3  was also synthesized for comparison. Our new approach to donor&#8208;acceptor macrocycles offers important fundamental insights and opens up a new avenue to unique optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Confined Indium Oxides for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction in a Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust electrocatalyst and advanced devices is important for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction toward the generation of valuable chemicals. We present herein a carbon&#8208;confined indium oxides electrocatalyst for stable and efficient CO2 reduction. The reductive corrosion of oxidative indium to metallic state during electrolysis could be prevented due to carbon protection, and the applied carbon layer also optimizes the reaction intermediate adsorption, which enables both high selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, the formate selectivity exceeds 90% in a wide potential window from &#8208;0.8 V to &#8208;1.3 V vs. RHE. The continuous production of ~ 0.12 M pure formic acid solution is further demonstrated at a current density of 30 mA cm&#8722;2 in a solid&#8208;state electrolyte mediated reactor. This work provides significant concepts in the parallel development of electrocatalysts and devices for carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Alkali Metal Reduction of 1&#8208;Adamantanol by London Dispersion Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of alkali metal 1&#8208;adamantoxide (OAd1) complexes of formula [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2], where M = Li, Na or K, was synthesised by reduction of 1&#8208;adamantanol with excess of the alkali metal. The syntheses indicated that only one out of every three HOAd1 molecules was reduced. An X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the sodium derivative shows that the complex features two unreduced HOAd1 donors as well as the reduced alkoxide (OAd1), with the Ad1 fragments clustered together on the same side of the NaO3 plane, contrary to steric considerations. This is the first example of an alkali metal reduction of an alcohol that is inhibited from completion due to the formation of the [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2] complexes stabilized by London dispersion effects. NMR spectroscopic studies revealed similar structures for the lithium and potassium derivatives. Computational analyses indicate that the decisive London dispersion effects are in the molecular structure are a consequence of the many C&#8211;H&#8230;H&#8211;C interactions between the OAd1 groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Doubly&#8208;Strapped Isolated Perylene Diimide Chromophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene diimides (PDIs), a well&#8208;studied class of organic dyes, have a strong tendency to self&#8208;aggregate in water, thus greatly restricting their phototheranostic applications. Herein, we report a water&#8208;soluble PDI cyclophane &#8220;Gemini Box&#8221; (GBox&#8208;14+), consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by a double cationic molecular strap. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, the chromophore self&#8208;aggregation can be completely eliminated, even in a concentrated aqueous solution up to 2 mM. To our knowledge, GBox&#8208;14+ represents an interesting example of a fluorescent PDI cyclophane in water, capable of being employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging. More importantly, the highly concentrated aqueous solution of PDI radical anion can be significantly stabilized by GBox&#8208;14+ to exhibit an excellent near&#8208;infrared photothermal effect, which was further exploited for efficient and selective antibacterial applications. This work provides a new access to water&#8208;soluble non&#8208;aggregated organic dyes and promotes their potential biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new isolation protocol was recently reported for highly purified metallic Fullertubes D  5h  &#8208;C  90  , D  3d  &#8208;C  96  , and D  5d  &#8208;C  100  which exhibit unique electronic features. Here, we report disclose the oxygen reduction electrocatalytic behaviour of C  60  , C  70  (spheroidal fullerenes), and C  90  , C  96  , and C  100  (tubular fullerenes) using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques. C  96  (a metal&#8208;free catalyst) displayed remarkable ORR activity, with an onset potential of 0.85 V and a halfway potential of 0.75 V, which are close to the values of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C benchmark catalyst. We achieved an excellent power density of 0.75 W/cm  2  using C  96  as a modified cathode in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, comparable to other recently reported efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts. Combined band structure (experimentally calculated) and free&#8208;energy (DFT) investigations show that both favourable energy&#8208;level alignment and highly selective active catalytic sites on the carbon cage are responsible for the C  96  superior activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrochemical redox&#8208;control is an emerging strategy for the regulation of polymerization process without the addition of external oxidants and reductants, which enables the control over composition, microstructure and properties of the polymer products. In this paper, based on the chemical selectivity of heterometallic Salen&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn complexes of different valences, an electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 &amp; epoxides. The switchable redox reactions endowed this system with the capability to easily synthesize a multi&#8208;block copolymer of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC). Moreover, the multi&#8208;block copolymer could be further modified by introducing various monomers with different microstructures and functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Plasmonic Imaging of Ion Migration on Single Nanoparticles and Insight for Double Layer Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion migration on single nanoparticles was directly measured by using a transient microscopy method. Under nanoscale and transient conditions, the electric double layer (EDL) dynamics can deviate significantly from the prediction made by using the classical resistance&#8211;capacitance model. A new model was proposed to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation.







Abstract
Single&#8208;nanoparticle electrochemistry offers electrochemical behaviors of individual entities beyond the ensemble system. An electric double layer (EDL) exists on any charged particle&#8211;liquid interface because of counter&#8208;ion accumulation, while direct measuring of the interfacial ion migration remains a challenge. Herein, a plasmonic&#8208;based transient microscopic method, with a temporal resolution of 1&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;s, was demonstrated to directly track the ion migration dynamics on single charged nanoparticles. We found that the dynamics of EDL formation might deviate significantly from the prediction made by using the classical resistance&#8211;capacitance (RC) model under nanoscale and transient conditions. Under ultrafast charging, due to the limit migration rate of ions in the solution, the actual time scale of the EDL formation could be up to 5&#8197;times slower than the predicted value from the RC model. We then proposed a new theoretical model to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation. These results may expand our current knowledge about nano&#8208;electrochemistry and transient electrochemistry.

         <title>Engineering Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photoenzymatic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalyst&#8211;enzyme coupled artificial photosynthesis system was constructed for photoenzymatic reduction of CO2 using COFs as enzyme carriers. The hybrid system showed an apparent quantum yield as high as 9.17&#177;0.44&#8201;%, surpassing the reported NADH&#8208;regenerated photocatalysts of crystalline framework materials.







Abstract
It is of profound significance concerning the global energy and environmental crisis to develop new techniques that can reduce and convert CO2. To address this challenge, we built a new type of artificial photoenzymatic system for CO2 reduction, using a rationally designed mesoporous olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) as the porous solid carrier for co&#8208;immobilizing formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and Rh&#8208;based electron mediator. By adjusting the incorporating content of the Rh electronic mediator, which facilitates the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactor (NADH) from NAD+, the apparent quantum yield can reach as high as 9.17&#177;0.44&#8201;%, surpassing all reported NADH&#8208;regenerated photocatalysts constructed by crystalline framework materials. Finally, the assembled photocatalyst&#8211;enzyme coupled system can selectively convert CO2 to formic acid with high efficiency and good reusability. This work demonstrates the first example using COFs to immobilize enzymes for artificial photosynthesis systems that utilize solar energy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Precision Synthesis of AB, ABA and ABC Block Copolymers via Switchable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined block copolymers with molecular complexity by simple techniques has always been a meaningful but rarely achieved task. Here, a commercial switchable catalysis is reported comprising a delicate &#8220;double switch&#8221; process. This unique switch can be applied up to pentacomponent mixtures to prepare sequence&#8208;controlled AB, ABA, and ABC copolymers.







Abstract
The switchable catalysis using a commercial salenMn catalyst was firstly developed and applied in the one&#8208;pot selective copolymerization from anhydrides, epoxides, CO2 and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL) mixtures for the precise synthesis of AB, ABA and novel ABC block copolymers. The observed unique double switch process comprising three different polymerization cycles was rationalized by theoretical calculations. Surprisingly, the first block turned out to be an efficient macromolecular initiator for the consecutive introduction of carbonate linkages into copolymers, albeit with dominant cyclization with the catalyst alone. Further, through the selective reaction on different epoxides, the switchable copolymerization of up to five monomers was achieved yielding well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block copolymers with structural diversity and functionality.

         <title>Highly Efficient Polarizing Agents for MAS&#8208;DNP of Proton&#8208;Dense Molecular Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polarizing agent is introduced to efficiently polarize proton&#8208;dense solids through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) ssNMR. This work shows that this new biradical can be used on organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies at high field and fast magic angle spinning (MAS). It notably unlocks the rapid acquisition of 13C&#8211;13C and 15N&#8211;13C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.







Abstract
Efficiently hyperpolarizing proton&#8208;dense molecular solids through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR is still an unmet challenge. Polarizing agents (PAs) developed so far do not perform well on proton&#8208;rich systems, such as organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies. Herein we introduce a new PA, cAsymPol&#8208;POK, and report outstanding hyperpolarization efficiency on 12.76&#8197;kDa U&#8208;13C,15N&#8208;labeled LecA protein and pharmaceutical drugs at high magnetic fields (up to 18.8&#8197;T) and fast magic angle spinning (MAS) frequencies (up to 40&#8197;kHz). The performance of cAsymPol&#8208;POK is rationalized by MAS&#8208;DNP simulations combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). This work shows that this new biradical is compatible with challenging biomolecular applications and unlocks the rapid acquisition of 13C&#8211;13C and 15N&#8211;13C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.

         <title>Generic Rules for Distinguishing Autophoretic Colloidal Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;diffusiophoretic motors slow down sharply with population density while self&#8208;electrophoretic motors maintain an almost constant speed regardless of their population density. Self&#8208;diffusiophoretic motors form continuously growing clusters, while self&#8208;electrophoretic motors form dynamic clusters with limited sizes.







Abstract
Distinguishing the operating mechanisms of nano&#8208; and micromotors powered by chemical gradients, i.e. &#8220;autophoresis&#8221;, holds the key for fundamental and applied reasons. In this article, we propose and experimentally confirm that the speeds of a self&#8208;diffusiophoretic colloidal motor scale inversely to its population density but not for self&#8208;electrophoretic motors, because the former is an ion source and thus increases the solution ionic strength over time while the latter does not. They also form clusters in visually distinguishable and quantifiable ways. This pair of rules is simple, powerful, and insensitive to the specific material composition, shape or size of a colloidal motor, and does not require any measurement beyond typical microscopy. These rules are not only useful in clarifying the operating mechanisms of typical autophoretic micromotors, but also in predicting the dynamics of unconventional ones that are yet to be experimentally realized, even those involving enzymes.

         <title>Overlooked Factors Required for Electrolyte Solvents in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries: Capabilities of Quenching 1O2 and Forming Highly&#8208;Decomposable Li2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs) equipped with a N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited superior cycle characteristics based on the capabilities of quenching 1O2 and forming highly decomposable Li2O2, which have been overlooked as factors required for electrolyte solvents for LOBs.







Abstract
Although sufficient tolerance against attack by superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;) has been mainly recognized as an important property for Li&#8211;O2 battery (LOB) electrolytes, recent evidence has revealed that other critical factors also govern the cyclability, prompting a reconsideration of the basic design guidelines of LOB electrolytes. Here, we found that LOBs equipped with a N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited better cyclability compared with other standard LOB electrolytes. This superior cyclability is attributable to the capabilities of quenching 1O2 and forming highly decomposable Li2O2. The 1O2 quenching capability is equivalent to that of a tetraglyme&#8208;based electrolyte containing a several millimolar concentration of a typical chemical quencher. Based on these overlooked factors, the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte led to superior cyclability despite its lower O2&#8722; tolerance. Thus, the present work provides a novel design guideline for the development of LOB electrolytes.

         <title>Thermal Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Supramolecular Dopant Towards Efficient and Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic supramolecular adhesives with low glass transition temperature and massive hydrogen bonds were designed by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate. The adhesive dopant facilitates a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect at only 70&#8201;&#176;C and contributes to efficient and highly flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) have attracted great attention due to their advantageous traits such as low cost, portability, light&#8208;weight, etc. However, mechanical stability is still the weak point in their practical application. Herein, we prepared efficient FPSCs with remarkable mechanical stability by a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect, which can be realized by the usage of a supramolecular adhesive. The supramolecular adhesive, which was obtained by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, is amphiphilic, has a proper glass transition temperature and a high density of hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and receptors, providing the possibility of thermal dynamic repair of mechanical damage in FPSCs. The adhesive also greatly improves the leveling property of the precursor solution on the hydrophobic poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)]amine (PTAA) surface. PSCs containing this adhesive achieve more than a 20&#8201;% power conversion efficiency (PCE) on flexible substrates and a 21.99&#8201;% PCE on rigid substrates (certified PCE of 21.27&#8201;%), with improved electron mobility and reduced defect concentration.

         <title>Biosynthetic Structural Proteins with Super Plasticity, Extraordinary Mechanical Performance, Biodegradability, Biocompatibility and Information Storage Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysine&#8208;rich structural proteins were synthesized by a microbial system. The protein&#8208;based bioplastics showed super plasticity, extraordinary mechanical performance, desirable biodegradability, biocompatibility, structural stability, and data encoding ability. Information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in this new bioplastic system. This work offers a compelling prospect for developing a new generation of ecological materials.







Abstract
Degradable bioplastics have attracted growing interest worldwide. However, it is challenging to develop bioplastics with a simple processing procedure, strong mechanical performance, good biocompatibility, and adjustable physicochemical properties. Herein, we introduced structural proteins as building blocks and developed a simple environmentally friendly approach to fabricate diverse protein&#8208;based plastics. A cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;level production approach was developed through batch fermentation of Escherichia coli to produce the biomaterials. These bioplastics possess super plasticity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high resistance to organic solvents. Their structural and mechanical properties can be precisely controlled. Besides, high density information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in the bioplastic system. The customizable bioplastics have great potential for applications in numerous fields and are capable to scale up to the industrial level.

         <title>A Smart Theranostic Prodrug System Activated by Reactive Oxygen Species for Regional Chemotherapy of Metastatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers has been developed. The prodrug can selectively target cancer cells and be activated by highly expressed ROS, rapidly releasing drug with high efficiency. It shows significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy towards metastatic cancers (up to 99.9&#8201;%) with no obvious side effects.







Abstract
Metastatic cancer is difficult to cure because of its uncontrollable nature and side effects during treatment. We constructed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system based on an ROS active site linked with both a targeting group and an anticancer drug for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers. The optimized prodrug (Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT) with biotin as the targeting group displayed high sensitivity towards ROS and selectively targeting ability towards cervical cancer cells, showing highly efficient drug release (up to 92&#8201;%) in vitro. Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT thus exerted strong toxicity towards cervical cancer cells, but unlike the parent drug (camptothecin), showed no toxicity towards normal cells. Moreover, the prodrug displayed significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo and eradicated the tumor with no obvious side effects (inhibition of the tumor reached up to 99.9&#8201;%).

         <title>Engineering the Local Atomic Environments of Indium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Production of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination engineering strategy based on a p&#8208;block In single&#8208;atom catalyst with N,S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination on hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC) has been developed. DFT results and electrochemical analysis show a superior 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction performance of the In SAs/NSBC catalyst in alkaline and neutral solutions, which is ascribed to synergistic effects between first&#8208;coordinated N/S, second&#8208;coordinated B, and single In atoms.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth understanding of local atomic environment&#8211;property relationships of p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalysts toward the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has rarely been reported. Here, guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, we develop a heteroatom&#8208;modified In&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;assisted approach to accurately synthesize an optimal catalyst, in which single In atoms are anchored by combined N,S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination supported by the hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC). The In SAs/NSBC catalyst exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity of above 95&#8201;% in a wide range of pH. Furthermore, the In SAs/NSBC&#8208;modified natural air diffusion electrode exhibits an unprecedented production rate of 6.49&#8197;mol peroxide&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and 6.71&#8197;mol&#8201;peroxide&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M PBS electrolyte. This strategy enables the design of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom materials, and provides practical guidance for H2O2 electrosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A coordination engineering strategy based on a p-block In single-atom catalyst with N,S-dual first coordination and B second coordination on hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC) has been developed. DFT results and electrochemical analysis show a superior 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction performance of the In SAs/NSBC catalyst in alkaline and neutral solutions, which is ascribed to synergistic effects between first-coordinated N/S, second-coordinated B, and single In atoms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in-depth understanding of local atomic environment&#8211;property relationships of p-block metal single-atom catalysts toward the 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has rarely been reported. Here, guided by first-principles calculations, we develop a heteroatom-modified In-based metal&#8211;organic framework-assisted approach to accurately synthesize an optimal catalyst, in which single In atoms are anchored by combined N,S-dual first coordination and B second coordination supported by the hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC). The In SAs/NSBC catalyst exhibits a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of above 95&#8201;% in a wide range of pH. Furthermore, the In SAs/NSBC-modified natural air diffusion electrode exhibits an unprecedented production rate of 6.49&#8197;mol peroxide&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;catalyst&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and 6.71&#8197;mol&#8201;peroxide&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;catalyst&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.1&#8197;M PBS electrolyte. This strategy enables the design of next-generation high-performance single-atom materials, and provides practical guidance for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A series of rotaxane&#8208;based catalysts in which the mechanical bond between a bipyridine macrocycle and an NDI&#8208;containing axle is intrinsic to their activity is reported. Computational analysis suggests that the high selectivity observed (&gt;60 fold for Michael addition over a competing decarboxylation pathway) is due to &#960;&#8208;stacking of the mechanically bonded components that leads to high polarizability.







Abstract
We report a series of rotaxane&#8208;based anion&#8211;&#960; catalysts in which the mechanical bond between a bipyridine macrocycle and an axle containing an NDI unit is intrinsic to the activity observed, including a [3]rotaxane that catalyses an otherwise disfavoured Michael addition in &gt;60 fold selectivity over a competing decarboxylation pathway that dominates under Br&#248;nsted base conditions. The results are rationalized by detailed experimental investigations, electrochemical and computational analysis.

         <title>Gold (I/III)&#8208;Catalyzed Trifluoromethylthiolation and Trifluoromethylselenolation of Organohalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first gold(I/III)&#8208;catalyzed direct trifluoromethylthiolation and trifluoromethylselenolation of organohalides are reported. This mild and efficient protocol enjoys a broad substrate scope and high yield (&gt;60 examples with up to 97&#8201;% isolated yield). Its robustness was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, which makes this reaction applicable to pharmaceutical and agrochemical research and development.







Abstract
The first C&#8722;SCF3/SeCF3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions using gold redox catalysis [(MeDalphos)AuCl], AgSCF3 or Me4NSeCF3, and organohalides as substrates are reported. The new methodology enables a one&#8208;stop shop synthesis of aryl/alkenyl/alkynyl trifluoromethylthio&#8208; and selenoethers with a broad substrate scope (&gt;60 examples with up to 97&#8201;% isolated yield). The method is scalable, and its robustness is evidenced by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, which makes this reaction an attractive alternative in the synthesis of trifluoromethylthio&#8208; and selenoethers for pharmaceutical and agrochemical research and development.

         <title>Internal Electric Field and Interfacial Bonding Engineered Step&#8208;Scheme Junction for a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Involved Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8722;N bonding in S&#8208;scheme Fe2O3/C3N4 significantly boosts the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;excited carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers. These enable the light&#8208;involved Li&#8211;O2 battery with a Fe2O3/C3N4 cathode to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13&#8197;V under illumination and a charge voltage of 3.19&#8197;V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability.







Abstract
Li&#8211;O2 batteries have aroused considerable interest in recent years, however they are hindered by high kinetic barriers and large overvoltages at cathodes. Herein, a step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) junction with hematite on carbon nitride (Fe2O3/C3N4) is designed as a bifunctional catalyst to facilitate oxygen redox for a visible&#8208;light&#8208;involved Li&#8211;O2 battery. The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8722;N bonding in the heterojunction boost the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers, at which the photoelectrons on C3N4 and holes on Fe2O3 remarkably accelerate the discharge and charge kinetics. These enable the Li&#8211;O2 battery with Fe2O3/C3N4 to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13&#8197;V under illumination, higher than the equilibrium potential 2.96&#8197;V in the dark, and a charge voltage of 3.19&#8197;V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability. This work will shed light on rational cathode design for metal&#8211;O2 batteries.

         <title>Spatially Confined Intervention of Cellular Senescence by a Lysosomal Metabolism Targeting Molecular Prodrug for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Senotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially confined prodrug activation strategy is reported as a new paradigm of senotherapy. The prodrug is designed to target the defective lysosome metabolism, a unique yet ubiquitous event during cellular senescence, instead of dynamically changing and highly heterogeneous senescence&#8208;related signaling pathways employed in conventional methods, thereby fulfilling robust specificity and broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards senescent cells.







Abstract
Specific intervention of senescent cells (SnCs) is emerging as a powerful means to counteract aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Canonical methods are generally designed to target SnC&#8208;associated signaling pathways, which are however dynamically changing and highly heterogeneous in SnCs, significantly limiting the effectiveness. Here, we present a tailor&#8208;made molecular prodrug targeting lysosome dysfunction, a unique feature shared by virtually all types of SnCs. The prodrug comprises three modules all targeting the altered lysosomal programs in SnCs, namely, a recognizing unit towards the elevated lysosome content, a linker cleavable by the activated lysosomal enzyme, and a lysosomotropic agent targeting the increased lysosomal membrane sensitivity. This spatially confined design enables killing broad&#8208;spectrum SnCs, with high specificity over non&#8208;SnCs. Along with in&#8197;vivo benefits, this work offers a way to significantly expand the applicability of senotherapy in a wide range of diseases.

         <title>A &#8220;Blockchain&#8221; Synergy in Conductive Polymer&#8208;Filled Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Plating/Stripping with High Coulombic Efficiency</title>

A novel concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; matrix Li storage is proposed by utilizing the N&#8208;rich polypyrrole (PPy) as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to fill and interlink the &#8220;blocks&#8221; of MOF cavities. The lithiophilic PPy helps to guide fast infiltration/extrusion of Li+ ions and serve as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li deposition, while the MOF pores enable the compartmentalization of the otherwise bulk Li deposition and provide spatial confinement for accommodating 3D matrix Li storage.







Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume expansion on the metal anodes. Inspired by the &#8220;blockchain&#8221; concept in data mining, here we utilize a conductive polymer&#8208;filled metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as the lithium host, in which polypyrrole (PPy) serves as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to interlink Li &#8220;blocks&#8221; stored in the MOF pores. While the N&#8208;rich PPy guides fast Li+ infiltration/extrusion and serves as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li growth, the MOF pores compartmentalize bulk Li deposition for 3D matrix Li storage, leading to low&#8208;barrier and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping with superb Coulombic efficiency. The as&#8208;fabricated lithium&#8208;metal anodes operate over 700&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and 800 cycles at 1&#8197;C in full cells with a per&#8208;cycle capacity loss of only 0.017&#8201;%. This work might open a new chapter for Li&#8208;metal anode construction by introducing the concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; management of Li plating/stripping.

         <title>Highly Efficient Multiphoton Absorption of Zinc&#8208;AIEgen Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) with concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). MEPL parameters of the Zn&#8208;AIEgen hinged MOFs are far superior to some of the best multiphoton absorption (MPA) materials including the perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
A series of luminescent frameworks was synthesized from the selective combination of aggregation induced emission (AIE)&#8208;linker tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) and Zn2+. Complex 1 was formed by the close packing of Zn&#8208;TCPE hinge, and isostructural complexes 2&#8211;5 were constructed by the linkage of Zn&#8208;TCPE layer and pillar ligands. These complexes exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) and concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). The multiphoton absorption (MPA) parameters of 1 are superior to other multiphoton emission materials including the perovskite nanocrystals. The incorporation of pillar linkers slows down the charge transfer between layers of Zn&#8208;TCPE, and the aromatic core of pillar linkers has a great influence on the MPA performance of the corresponding frameworks.

         <title>Modulating the Frontier Orbitals of an Aluminylene for Facile Dearomatization of Inert Arenes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene at an electron&#8208;deficient aluminylene center can remarkably boost the redox property of the aluminylene via modulation of frontier orbitals. This allows for facile dearomatization of inert arenes via either [4+1] cycloadditions or cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
Lewis bases are well known to stabilize electron&#8208;deficient species. We demonstrate herein that the redox property of a monocoordinated aluminylene 1 featuring only four valence electrons for the shell of Al can be boosted by a Lewis base. The coordination of 1 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) effectively shrinks the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the ensuing acyclic mono&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminylene 2, which is isoelectronic with singlet carbenes. Moreover, such base coordination completely reverses the predominant chemical reactivity (i.e. electrophilicity/nucleophilicity) of aluminylenes. In marked contrast to 1, 2 readily undergoes a [4+1] cycloaddition reaction with naphthalene and biphenylene at room temperature. Strikingly, the enhanced ambiphilic nature of Al in 2 also enables facile cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds of inert arenes in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular fashion affording 3 and 5. The formation of 5 represents the first example of the cleavage of an aromatic C(3)&#8722;C(4) bond in biphenylene by a single&#8208;atom center.

         <title>Clusters Induced Electron Redistribution to Tune Oxygen Reduction Activity of Transition Metal Single&#8208;Atom for Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy of metal clusters regulating metal single&#8208;atom sites is developed to boost the activities of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts (Fe, Co, Ni). Benefiting from the electron redistribution between active sites and substrate, the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and achieves high discharge voltages in various metal&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity can be effectively tuned by modulating the electron configuration and optimizing the chemical bonds. Herein, a general strategy to optimize the activity of metal single&#8208;atoms is achieved by the decoration of metal clusters via a coating&#8211;pyrolysis&#8211;etching route. In this unique structure, the metal clusters are able to induce electron redistribution and modulate M&#8722;N species bond lengths. As a result, M&#8208;ACSA@NC exhibits superior ORR activity compared with the nanoparticle&#8208;decorated counterparts. The performance enhancement is attributed to the optimized intermediates desorption benefiting from the unique electronic configuration. Theoretical analysis reinforces the significant roles of metal clusters by correlating the ORR activity with cluster&#8208;induced charge transfer. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, various metal&#8211;air batteries assembled with Fe&#8208;ACSA@NC deliver remarkable power densities and capacities. This strategy is an effective and universal technique for electron modulation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, which shows great potential in application of energy storage devices.

         <title>Spin Crossover in a Cobalt Complex on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover is induced in self&#8208;assembled tetramers of a Co&#8208;complex on Ag(111) surfaces via the injection of electrons or holes with a scanning tunneling microscope. The resulting memristive current&#8211;voltage characteristic is analysed in terms of the electron transport through the molecular d&#8208;orbitals.







Abstract
The Co&#8208;based complex [Co(H2B(pz)(pypz))2] (py=pyridine, pz=pyrazole) deposited on Ag(111) was investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy at &#8776;5&#8197;K. Due to a bis(tridentate) coordination sphere the molecules aggregate mainly into tetramers. Individual complexes in these tetramers undergo reversible transitions between two states with characteristic image contrasts when current is passed through them or one of their neighbors. Two molecules exhibit this bistability while the other two molecules are stable. The transition rates vary linearly with the tunneling current and exhibit an intriguing dependence on the bias voltage and its polarity. We interpret the states as being due to S=1/2 and 3/2 spin states of the Co2+ complex. The image contrast and the orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude variations of the switching yields can be tentatively understood from the calculated orbital structures of the two spin states, thus providing first insights into the mechanism of electron&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (ELIESST).

     alt="Spin Crossover in a Cobalt Complex on Ag(111)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-crossover is induced in self-assembled tetramers of a Co-complex on Ag(111) surfaces via the injection of electrons or holes with a scanning tunneling microscope. The resulting memristive current&#8211;voltage characteristic is analysed in terms of the electron transport through the molecular d-orbitals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Co-based complex [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B(pz)(pypz))&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (py=pyridine, pz=pyrazole) deposited on Ag(111) was investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy at &#8776;5&#8197;K. Due to a bis(tridentate) coordination sphere the molecules aggregate mainly into tetramers. Individual complexes in these tetramers undergo reversible transitions between two states with characteristic image contrasts when current is passed through them or one of their neighbors. Two molecules exhibit this bistability while the other two molecules are stable. The transition rates vary linearly with the tunneling current and exhibit an intriguing dependence on the bias voltage and its polarity. We interpret the states as being due to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spin states of the Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex. The image contrast and the orders-of-magnitude variations of the switching yields can be tentatively understood from the calculated orbital structures of the two spin states, thus providing first insights into the mechanism of electron-induced excited spin-state trapping (ELIESST).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orthoquinone&#8211;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ordered Channel Structures for Ultrahigh Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF)&#8722;BT&#8208;PTO COF cathode was designed and synthesized for aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries. The inherent ordered open channel structure facilitates ion transfer and insertion, thus making the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism with staged Zn2+ H+ co&#8208;insertion behavior, ultra&#8208;fast kinetics and unprecedented cyclability.







Abstract
Elaborate molecular design on cathodes is of great importance for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries&#8217; performance elevation. Herein, we design a novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework with an ordered channel structures (BT&#8208;PTO COF) cathode for an ultrahigh performance aqueous zinc&#8211;organic battery. The ordered channel structure facilitates ions transfer and makes the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism. Thus, it delivers a high reversible capacity of 225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an exceptional long&#8208;term cyclability (retention rate 98.0&#8201;% at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;18&#8197;C) after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Moreover, a co&#8208;insertion mechanism with Zn2+ first followed by two H+ is uncovered for the first time. Significantly, this co&#8208;insertion behaviour evolves to more H+ insertion routes at high current density and gives the COF ultra&#8208;fast kinetics thus it achieves unprecedented specific power of 184&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1(COF) and a high energy density of 92.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1(COF). Our work reports a superior organic material for zinc batteries and provides a design idea for future high&#8208;performance organic cathodes.

         <title>Structures of Silver Fingers and a Pathway to Their Genotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative AgI binding to CCHH zinc fingers causes zinc ion release followed by a collapse of the stable secondary structure and formation of a highly stable Ag2S2 cluster. CCHC, CCCH and CCCC zinc fingers react analogously. Such silver&#8208;induced perturbation inhibits binding of the CCHH zinc finger protein to its cognate DNA sequence and as a consequence may affect many cellular processes including transcriptional regulation.







Abstract
Recently, we demonstrated that AgI can directly replace ZnII in zinc fingers (ZFs). The cooperative binding of AgI to ZFs leads to a thermodynamically irreversible formation of silver clusters destroying the native ZF structure. Thus, a reported loss of biological function of ZF proteins is a likely consequence of such replacement. Here, we report an X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study of AgnSn clusters formed in ZFs to probe their structural features. Selective probing of the local environment around AgI by XAS showed the predominance of digonal AgI coordination to two sulfur donors, coordinated with an average Ag&#8722;S distance at 2.41&#8197;&#197;. No Ag&#8722;N bonds were present. A mixed AgS2/AgS3 geometry was found solely in the CCCH AgI&#8722;ZF. We also show that cooperative replacement of ZnII ions with the studied Ag2S2 clusters occurred in a three&#8208;ZF transcription factor protein 1MEY#, leading to a dissociation of 1MEY# from the complex with its cognate DNA.

A versatile kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial selective superassembly strategy is demonstrated to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites with tunable diameters, topological architectures and components. Benefiting from the unique asymmetric hollow porous structure and photothermal effect, these nanoparticles are utilized as smart NIR light&#8208;triggered nanovehicles.







Abstract
Hollow nanoparticles featuring tunable structures with spatial and chemical specificity are of fundamental interest. However, it remains a significant challenge to design and synthesize asymmetric nanoparticles with controllable topological hollow architecture. Here, a versatile kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial selective superassembly strategy is demonstrated to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites (AHPCs) with tunable diameters, architectures and components. The size and number of patches on Janus nanoparticles can be precisely manipulated by the precursor and catalyst content. Notably, AHPCs exhibit excellent photothermal conversion performance under the irradiation of a near infrared (NIR) laser. Thus, AHPCs are utilized as NIR light&#8208;triggered nanovehicles and cargos can be controllably released. In brief, this versatile superassembly approach offers a streamlined and powerful toolset to design diverse asymmetric hollow porous composites.

         <title>A Class of Rigid&#8211;Flexible Coupling Crystalline Crosslinked Polymers as Vapomechanical Actuators</title>

A new class of rigid&#8211;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers is fabricated for the first time. The polymers can form self&#8208;standing membranes showing outstanding vapomechanically responsive performance.







Abstract
Fabricating mechanically responsive actuators that can efficiently convert external stimuli into mechanical work is of great significance for real&#8208;world applications. Herein, we rationally design a class of rigid&#8211;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers (CCPs) to fabricate vapomechanically responsive actuators. Interfacial condensation reactions of flexible macromers with rigid monomers afford a series of freestanding CCP membranes. Notably, it is the first example where crosslinked polymers show high crystallinity and porosity. Moreover, the CCP membranes exhibit good mechanical properties and interesting vapor&#8208;triggered actuation performance, which is reversible and repeatable. We find that the unusual polymer structures, high vapor sorption, and anisotropic membranes contribute to the directional deformation performance of the CCP actuators. The synthesis approach in this work provides new insights into the design and fabrication of smart materials for advanced applications.

         <title>Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary complex FtmOx1&#8901;2OG&#8901;fumitremorgin&#8197;B has been solved at a resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;, providing an accurate structural basis for the mechanistic study of endoperoxide formation. The binding conformation of fumitremorgin&#8197;B in this structure is different from any previously docked structures. Structural analysis and multiscale calculations revealed that Y68 radical is key to endoperoxidation.







Abstract
The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme enzyme FtmOx1 catalyzes the endoperoxide biosynthesis of verruculogen. Although several mechanistic studies have been carried out, the catalytic mechanism of FtmOx1 is not well determined owing to the lack of a reliable complex structure of FtmOx1 with fumitremorgin&#8197;B. Herein we provide the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8901;2OG&#8901;fumitremorgin&#8197;B at a resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;. Our structures show that the binding of fumitremorgin&#8197;B induces significant compression of the active pocket and that Y68 is in close proximity to C26 of the substrate. Further MD simulation and QM/MM calculations support a CarC&#8208;like mechanism, in which Y68 acts as the H&#8197;atom donor for quenching the C26&#8208;centered substrate radical. Our results are consistent with all available experimental data and highlight the importance of accurate complex structures in the mechanistic study of enzymatic catalysis.

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Fluorescent Spherical Nucleic Acids Self&#8208;Assembled from a DNA&#8208;Grafted Conjugated Polymer for Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted conjugated polymer (PFBT&#8208;g&#8208;DNA) is synthesized and assembles into fluorescent spherical nucleic acids (FCP&#8208;SNAs) with excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability. Since the FCP&#8208;SNAs can efficiently &#8220;pump&#8221; the collected energy to the receptor, showing exceptional signal transduction ability, they are applied to detect the ultralow concentration of nucleic acid down to 1.7&#8197;pM.







Abstract
The ultralow concentration of nucleic acids in complex biological samples requires fluorescence probes with high specificity and sensitivity. Herein, a new kind of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) is developed by using fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) as a light&#8208;harvesting antenna to enhance the signal transduction of nucleic acid detection. Specifically, amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted FCPs are synthesized and self&#8208;assemble into FCP&#8208;SNA structures. Tuning the hydrophobicity of the graft copolymer can adjust the size and light&#8208;harvesting capability of the FCP&#8208;SNAs. We observe that more efficient signal amplification occurs in larger FCP&#8208;SNAs, as more chromophores are involved, and the energy transfer can go beyond the F&#246;rster radius. Accordingly, the optimized FCP&#8208;SNA shows an antenna effect of up to 37&#8208;fold signal amplification and the limit of detection down to 1.7&#8197;pM in microRNA detection. Consequently, the FCP&#8208;SNA is applied to amplified in situ nucleic acid detecting and imaging at the single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization Induced by a Monodispersed Ga Site on a Pt3Mn Nanocatalyst Boosts Ethanol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monodispersed Ga site tailored Pt3Mn nanocatalyst based on high&#8208;indexed facets was constructed and shows excellent EOR performance with high activity and selectivity towards the C2 reaction pathway, which was attributed to the unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization and atomic&#8208;level interface synergy.







Abstract
Constructing monodispersed metal sites in heterocatalysis is an efficient strategy to boost their catalytic performance. Herein, a new strategy using monodispersed metal sites to tailor Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is addressed by engineering unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization. Thus, monodispersed Ga on Pt3Mn nanocrystals (Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn) with high&#8208;indexed facets was constructed for the first time to drive ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). Strikingly, the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst shows an enhanced EOR performance with achieving 8.41&#8197;times of specific activity than that of Pt/C. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results and theoretical calculations disclose that the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst featuring an unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization not only promote the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;breaking and rapid oxidation of &#8208;OH of ethanol, but also inhibit the generation of poisonous CO intermediate species. This work discloses a promising strategy to construct a novel nanocatalysts tailored by monodispersed metal site as efficient fuel cell catalysts.

A Fe/Mn dual single&#8208;atom catalyst with an excellent bifunctional activity is prepared as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). Profiting from the combined Fe/Mn dual&#8208;site effect as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure, the ZAB could operate efficiently at the ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, a novel dual single&#8208;atom catalyst comprising adjacent Fe&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4 sites on 2D ultrathin N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with porous structure (FeMn&#8208;DSAC) was constructed as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). FeMn&#8208;DSAC exhibits remarkable bifunctional activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Control experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the catalytic activity arises from the cooperative effect of the Fe/Mn dual&#8208;sites aiding *OOH dissociation as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure promoting active sits exposure and mass transfer during the reaction process. The excellent bifunctional activity of FeMn&#8208;DSAC enables the ZAB to operate efficiently at ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, delivering 30&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 peak power density and retaining up to 86&#8201;% specific capacity from the room temperature counterpart.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted CO2 Hydrogenation over Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 Promoted by Active Sites in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd3Cu nanoparticles encapsulated into a MOF affording Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits excellent performance in CO2 hydrogenation enhanced by light irradiation. Photo&#8208;generated electrons migrate from the linkers to activate CO2 adsorbed on Zr&#8211;oxo clusters. Then activated CO2 accepts spillover H* from Pd3Cu to complete the conversion. Significantly, the Pd3Cu spatial position plays a critical role and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;confined Pd3Cu greatly promotes activity.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted great interest while suffering from low conversion and high energy input. Herein, tiny Pd3Cu nanoparticles are confined into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66, to afford Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 for CO2 hydrogenation. Remarkably, it achieves a methanol production rate of 340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C and 1.25&#8197;MPa under light irradiation, far surpassing that in the dark. The photo&#8208;generated electron transfer from the MOF to antibonding orbitals of CO2* promotes CO2 activation and HCOO* formation. In addition, the Pd3Cu microenvironment plays a critical role in CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast to the MOF&#8208;supported Pd3Cu (Pd3Cu/UiO&#8208;66), the Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits a much higher methanol production rate due to the close proximity between CO2 and H2 activation sites, which greatly facilitates their interaction and conversion. This work provides a new avenue to the integration of solar and thermal energy for efficient CO2 hydrogenation under moderate conditions.

&lt;p&gt;The Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu nanoparticles encapsulated into a MOF affording Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu@UiO-66 exhibits excellent performance in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation enhanced by light irradiation. Photo-generated electrons migrate from the linkers to activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbed on Zr&#8211;oxo clusters. Then activated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accepts spillover H* from Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu to complete the conversion. Significantly, the Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu spatial position plays a critical role and UiO-66-confined Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu greatly promotes activity.

         <title>Vanadium&#8208;Incorporated CoP2 with Lattice Expansion for Highly Efficient Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust V&#8722;CoP2 porous nanowire was fabricated by incorporating vanadium into a CoP2 lattice. The V incorporation results in an upshift of the d&#8208;band center, boosting HER activity. Meanwhile, V promotes the generation of a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances the acidic OER stability. It presents a low voltage (1.47&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable stability toward acidic water splitting.







Abstract
A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) in acidic medium is a hopeful scenario for hydrogen production using renewable energy, but the grand challenge lies in substituting noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, a robust electrocatalyst of V&#8722;CoP2 porous nanowires arranged on a carbon cloth is successfully fabricated by incorporating vanadium into the CoP2 lattice. Structural characterizations and theoretical analysis indicate that lattice expansion of CoP2 caused by V incorporation results in the upshift of the d&#8208;band center, which is conducive to hydrogen adsorption for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, V promotes surface reconstruction to generate a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances acid&#8208;corrosion resistance and optimizes the adsorption of water and oxygen&#8208;containing species, thus improving activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Accordingly, it presents a superior acidic overall water splitting activity (1.47&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to Pt&#8722;C/CC||RuO2/CC (1.59&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and remarkable stability. This work proposes a new route to design efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for PEMWE.

         <title>Deeper Insight into the Role of Organic Ammonium Cations in Reducing Surface Defects of the Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism to understand the role of organic ammonium salt (OAS) in improving performances of perovskite solar cells is proposed. Besides passivating defects by itself, OAS also augments the passivation effect of excess PbI2 on the surface of the perovskite film by dispersing it into a discontinuous layer. Furthermore, using PbI2 nanosheets fully dispersed in advance boosts the efficiency to 23.14&#8201;%.







Abstract
Organic ammonium salts (OASs) have been widely used to passivate perovskite defects. The passivation mechanism is usually attributed to coordination of OASs with unpaired lead or halide ions, yet ignoring their interaction with excess PbI2 on the perovskite film. Herein, we demonstrate that OASs not only passivate defects by themselves, but also redistribute excess aggregated PbI2 into a discontinuous layer, augmenting its passivation effect. Moreover, alkyl OAS is more powerful to disperse PbI2 than a F&#8208;containing one, leading to better passivation and device efficiency because F atoms restrict the intercalation of OAS into PbI2 layers. Inspired by this mechanism, exfoliated PbI2 nanosheets are adopted to provide better dispersity of PbI2, further boosting the efficiency to 23.14&#8201;%. Our finding offers a distinctive understanding of the role of OASs in reducing perovskite defects, and a route to choosing an OAS passivator by considering substitution effects rather than by trial and error.

Abstract
D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 4&#8208;((9&#8208;phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethynyl)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D and A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type bis[(4,4&#8242;&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl]ethyne (NINI) with a negligible dipole moment of 0.28&#8197;D, were smartly designed and synthesized to demonstrate the evidence of a molecular dipole as the dominant mechanism for controlling charge separation of organic semiconductors. In aqueous solution, these two novel naphthalimides can self&#8208;assemble to form nanoribbons (NRs) that present significantly different traces of exciton dissociation dynamics. Upon photoexcitation of NINI&#8208;NRs, no charge&#8208;separated excitons (CSEs) are formed due to the large exciton binding energy, accordingly there is no hydrogen evolution. On the contrary, in the photoexcited CZNI&#8208;NRs, the initial bound Frenkel excitons are dissociated to long&#8208;lived CSEs after undergoing ultrafast charge transfer within ca. 1.25&#8197;ps and charge separation within less than 5.0&#8197;ps. Finally, these free electrons were injected into Pt co&#8208;catalysts for reducing protons to H2 at a rate of ca. 417&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, correspondingly an apparent quantum efficiency of ca. 1.3&#8201;% can be achieved at 400&#8197;nm.

         <title>CLIPON: A CRISPR&#8208;Enabled Strategy that Turns Commercial Pregnancy Test Strips into General Point&#8208;of&#8208;Need Test Devices</title>

By rational integration of the human chorionic gonadotropin, CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a/crRNA system, and large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies, a portable sensing platform termed CLIPON has been developed, which can transduce both nucleic acid and non&#8208;nucleic acid targets into commercial pregnancy test strip readout. The detection is sensitive, selective, instrument&#8208;free, and allows future integration into a microchip.







Abstract
Desirable biosensing assays need to be sensitive, specific, cost&#8208;effective, instrument&#8208;free, and versatile. Herein we report a new strategy termed CLIPON (CRISPR and Large DNA assembly Induced Pregnancy strips for signal&#8208;ON detection) that can deliver these traits. CLIPON integrates a commercial pregnancy test strip (PTS) with four biological elements: the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a, crRNA and cauliflower&#8208;like large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies (CLD). CLIPON uses the Cas12a/crRNA complex both to recognize a target of interest and to release CLD&#8208;bound hCG so that target presence can translate into a colorimetric signal on the PTS. We demonstrate the versatility of CLIPON through sensitive and specific detection of HPV genomic DNA, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA and adenosine. We also engineer a cell phone app and a hand&#8208;held microchip to achieve signal quantification. CLIPON represents an attractive option for biosensing and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Chemodivergent Allenylic Alkylation of Vinyl Azides for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Allenylic Amides and Ketones**

The first enantioselective allenylic alkylation of unstabilized enolates is enabled by cooperative iridium and Lewis acid catalysis using vinyl azide as an amide and ketone enolate surrogate. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, these desiccant&#8208;controlled chemodivergent fragment&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;:&#8201;0.1 e.r.







Abstract
The first enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones through allenylic alkylation of vinyl azides is reported. In these chemodivergent reactions, cooperatively catalyzed by a IrI/(phosphoramidite,olefin) complex and Sc(OTf)3, vinyl azides act as the surrogate for both amide enolates and ketone enolates. The desiccant (molecular sieves) plays a crucial role in controlling the chemodivergency of this enantioconvergent and regioselective reaction: Under otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of the desiccant led to &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides, while its absence resulted in &#945;&#8208;allenylic ketones. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, the overall process represents a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT), where both the products are formed with the same absolute configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of vinyl azide as the ketone enolate surrogate in an enantioselective transformation.

         <title>Picking on Carbonate: Kinetic Selectivity in the Encapsulation of Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexapodal capsule has been shown to trap inorganic anions over a large span of time. Whereas small spherical and cylindrical ions enter the cage at a rapid rate (seconds), it takes longer (minutes) for medium&#8208;sized and tripodal species, and larger and tetrahedral anions need hours to days to fully populate the host. Such a kinetic selection could be used for sequestering anions from solution and/or controlling their chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular hosts bind to inorganic anions at a fast rate and select them in proportion with thermodynamic stability of the corresponding [anion&#8834;host] complexes, forming in a reversible manner. In this study, we describe the action of hexapodal capsule 1 and its remarkable ability to select anions based on a large span of rates by which they enter this host. The thermodynamic affinity of 1 toward eighteen anions extends over eight orders of magnitude (0&lt;Ka&lt;108&#8197;M&#8722;1; 1H NMR spectroscopy). The capsule would retain CO32&#8722; (Ka=107&#8197;M&#8722;1) for hours in the presence of eleven competing anions, including stronger binding SO42&#8722;, HAsO42&#8722; and HPO42&#8722; (Ka=107&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). The observed selection resulted from 1 possessing narrow apertures (ca. 3&#215;6&#8197;&#197;) comparable in size to anions (d=3.5&#8211;7.1&#8197;&#197;) slowing down the encapsulation to last from seconds to days. The unorthodox mode of action of 1 sets the stage for creating hosts that pick anions by their ability to access the host.

         <title>Chemiluminescent 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Iridium Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Oxygen Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium(III)&#8208;based chemiluminescent oxygen sensors are described. Energy transfer from the chemiexcited benzoate to the oxygen&#8208;sensitive IrIII sub&#8208;unit results in emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. The corresponding O2&#8208;dependent responses have been exploited for achieving in vitro O2 imaging as well as live animal imaging.







Abstract
Chemiluminescent iridium&#8208;based sensors which demonstrate oxygen&#8194;dependent responses have been developed. The molecular probes, named IrCL&#8208;1, IrCL&#8208;2 and IrCL&#8208;3 consist of oxygen&#8208;sensitive iridium complexes attached to a spiroadamantane 1,2&#8194;dioxetane and operate via energy transfer from the chemiexcited benzoate to the corresponding iridium(III) complex. Complexing the iridium(III) center with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands results in emission in the biologically relevant, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. All probes demonstrate varying oxygen tolerance, with IrCL&#8208;1 being the most oxygen sensitive. These probes have been further utilized for in vitro ratiometric imaging of oxygen, as well as for intraperitoneal, intramuscular and intratumoral imaging in live mice. To our knowledge, these are the first iridium&#8208;based chemiluminescent probes that have been employed for in vitro ratiometric oxygen sensing, and for in vivo tumor imaging.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based COF 2D Materials: Variable Modification of Sensing Performances by Post&#8208;Metallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>

A series of metalloporphyrin covalent organic framework based nanosheets has been synthesized and successfully applied in specific sensing of NO2 at room temperature.







Abstract
2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surfaces are highly sought after for various applications, especially in room&#8208;temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin&#8208;based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific&#8208;sensing of NO2 at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H2&#8208;TPCOF was designed with a largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post&#8208;metallization. After post&#8208;metallization, the metallized M&#8208;TPCOF (M=Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co&#8208;TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO2 with one of the highest sensitivities of all reported 2D materials and COF materials, with an ultra&#8208;low limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6.8&#8197;ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface&#8208;highly&#8208;modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.

&lt;p&gt;A series of metalloporphyrin covalent organic framework based nanosheets has been synthesized and successfully applied in specific sensing of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surfaces are highly sought after for various applications, especially in room-temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin-based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific-sensing of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TPCOF was designed with a largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post-metallization. After post-metallization, the metallized M-TPCOF (M=Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co-TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with one of the highest sensitivities of all reported 2D materials and COF materials, with an ultra-low limit-of-detection of 6.8&#8197;ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface-highly-modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF)&#8208;Based Multifunctional Cargo Vehicle for Reactive&#8208;Gas Delivery and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifaceted metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can act as a food truck to adsorb, store, and deliver toxic gases to organic reactions. We showcase the versatility of MOFs by employing them as a safe&#8208;delivery tool, while simultaneously catalyzing organic reactions, producing yields and conversions that are comparable to the reactions utilizing the toxic gases directly.







Abstract
The efficient delivery of reactive and toxic gaseous reagents to organic reactions was studied using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The simultaneous cargo vehicle and catalytic capabilities of several MOFs were probed for the first time using the examples of aromatization, aminocarbonylation, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions. These reactions highlight that MOFs can serve a dual role as a gas cargo vehicle and a catalyst, leading to product formation with yields similar to reactions employing pure gases. Furthermore, the MOFs can be recycled without sacrificing product yield, while simultaneously maintaining crystallinity. The reported findings were supported crystallographically and spectroscopically (e.g., diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy), foreshadowing a pathway for the development of multifunctional MOF&#8208;based reagent&#8208;catalyst cargo vessels for reactive gas reagents as an attractive alternative to the use of toxic pure gases or gas generators.

We present evidence that the dual emission of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence in solution is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.







Abstract
A series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds 1&#8211;7 have been reported to exhibit unique dual emission, consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in solution. This finding triggered intensive research of RTP in &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron derivatives. Herein, we show clear evidence that the associated dual emission, especially RTP, is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.

Information processing in living cells results from the communication between DNA, RNA, and proteins. Drawing inspiration from these molecular communication systems, Simona Ranallo, Francesco Ricci, and co&#8208;workers describe in their Communication (e202115680) the rational design and optimization of an antibody&#8208;responsive, synthetic DNA&#8208;based device that enables communication between pairs of otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins.

Drawing inspiration from these molecular communication systems, Simona Ranallo, Francesco Ricci, and co-workers describe in their Communication &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202115680"&gt;(e202115680)&lt;/a&gt; the rational design and optimization of an antibody-responsive, synthetic DNA-based device that enables communication between pairs of otherwise non-interacting proteins.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Nitric Acid from Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) has drawn widespread attention due to its potential for the green synthesis of nitric acid. Since a prerequisite for the favorable development of this emerging field is the rational testing of NOR performance, a recommended protocol is presented in this Minireview. In addition, possible reaction mechanisms and future perspectives, as well as challenges related to NOR, are discussed.







Abstract
Nitric acid is widely applied in agriculture and industry. The present manufacturing process via a combination of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process and the Ostwald oxidation process is accompanied by massive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The direct electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitric acid is a promising alternative, especially when it is driven by renewable energy sources. The standardization of performance evaluation is the prerequisite for the design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for NOR. In this context, this Minireview first discusses the history of the development of HNO3 manufacturing and the possible reaction mechanisms for electrocatalytic NOR. Then, a strict protocol for electrochemical NOR experiments is recommended. Finally, general research targets associated with techno&#8208;economic analysis, challenges, and prospects for NOR are summarized for future studies.

Synthetic photoelectrochemistry (PEC) offers new prospects for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. This Review discusses the combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms, scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation.







Abstract
Synthetic photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is receiving increasing attention as a new frontier for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. Herein, the most recent contributions are reviewed, demonstrating exciting new opportunities, namely, the combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms (hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, radical polar crossover, energy transfer sensitization), scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation to temporally enable excited radical ion catalysis.

         <title>Dendritic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Structure, Synthesis and Properties</title>

A comprehensive review on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with radial pores is provided. Perspectives into their formation mechanisms, synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships and future research directions with a focus on biomedical applications are presented.







Abstract
Recently, dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles with widespread applications have attracted great interest. Despite many publications (&gt;800), the terminology &#8220;dendritic&#8221; is ambiguous. Understanding what possible &#8220;dendritic structures&#8221; are, their formation mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationship is fundamentally important. With the advance of characterization techniques such as electron tomography, two types of tree&#8208;branch&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like structures can be distinguished, both described as &#8220;dendritic&#8221; in the literature. In this Review, we start with the definition of &#8220;dendritic&#8221;, then provide critical analysis of reported dendritic silica nanoparticles according to their structural classification. We update the understandings of the formation mechanisms of two types of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; nanoparticles, highlighting how to control their structural parameters. Applications of dendritic mesoporous nanoparticles are also reviewed with a focus on the biomedical field, providing new insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship in this family of nanomaterials.

A radical transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylation of unactivated alkenes with alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides as radical traps and FSO2&#8208;radical precursors is presented. The reaction features high atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, allows the synthesis of quaternary C&#8208;centers and installs a sulfonyl fluoride moiety, which can be conveniently diversified via SuFEx click chemistry.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have found widespread use in chemical biology and drug discovery. The development of synthetic methods for the introduction of the sulfonyl fluoride moiety is therefore of importance. Herein, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes via FSO2&#8208;radical addition with subsequent vicinal alkynylation to access &#946;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;fluorosulfonylalkanes is presented. Alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides are introduced as highly valuable bifunctional radical trapping reagents that also serve as FSO2&#8208;radical precursors. The &#946;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;fluorosulfonylalkanes obtained in these transformations can be readily diversified by using SuFEx click chemistry to obtain sulfonates and sulfonamides.

         <title>Carbamoylated Guanidine&#8208;Containing Polymers for Non&#8208;Covalent Functional Protein Delivery in Serum&#8208;Containing Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenyl carbamoylated guanidine (Ph&#8208;CG) group contributes to the efficient delivery of bioactive proteins in serum&#8208;containing media owing to substantially low pKa, increased hydrophobicity, enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, and cellular entry.







Abstract
Despite the high potential of controlling cellular processes and treating various diseases by intracellularly delivered proteins, current delivery systems exhibit poor efficiency due to poor serum stability, cellular entry, and cytosolic availability of proteins. Here, we report a novel functional group, phenyl carbamoylated guanidine (Ph&#8208;CG), that greatly enhances the delivery efficiency to various types of cells. Owing to the substantially lowered pKa, the hydrophobic Ph&#8208;CG offers optimized inter&#8208;macromolecular interactions via enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The coplanarity of Ph&#8208;CG also leads to the better intracellular entry of protein complexes. Intracellularly delivered apoptosis&#8208;inducing enzymes and antibodies significantly induce cell viability inhibitions in a serum&#8208;containing medium. The newly developed Ph&#8208;CG can be introduced to various existing carriers, leading to the realization of future therapeutic protein delivery.

         <title>Electrochemical Fluorination of Vinyl Boronates through Donor&#8208;Stabilized Vinyl Carbocation Intermediates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl carbocations were generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of alkenyl boronates using electrical potentials. This electrochemical process enabled the formation of these reactive species without the use of Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids. The intermediate vinyl carbocations were trapped with nucleophilic fluoride sources to yield vinyl fluorides; the production of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Br bonds was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrochemical generation of vinyl carbocations from alkenyl boronic esters and boronates is reported. Using easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle nucleophilic fluoride reagents, these intermediates are trapped to form fully substituted vinyl fluorides. Mechanistic studies support the formation of dicoordinated carbocations through sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation events. Notably, this electrochemical fluorination features fast reaction times and Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions. This transformation provides a complementary method to access vinyl fluorides with simple fluoride salts such as TBAF.

         <title>Rational Design of ZnMn2O4 Quantum Dots in a Carbon Framework for Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnMn2O4 quantum dots homogeneously embedded in a carbon framework (ZMO QD@C) are prepared by in&#8208;situ electrochemically inducing a Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived precursor. Owing to the formation of Mn&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds at the interface between the ZMO QDs and the carbon matrix, the composite reveals superior cycling stability in a pure ZnSO4 electrolyte by inhibiting the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and the disproportional reaction of the discharge product.







Abstract
Manganese oxides are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high energy density and low cost. However, in their discharging processes, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and Mn3+ disproportionation often lead to irreversible structural transformation and Mn2+ dissolution, deteriorating the cycling stability of ZIBs. Herein, ZnMn2O4 quantum dots (ZMO QDs) were introduced into a porous carbon framework by in&#8208;situ electrochemically inducing Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived Mn3O4 quantum dots and the carbon composite. In such ZMO QDs and carbon composite, the quantum dot structure endows ZnMn2O4 with a shorter ion diffusion route and more active sites for Zn2+. The conductive carbon framework is beneficial to the fast transport of electrons. Furthermore, at the interface between the ZMO QDs and the carbon matrix, the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds are formed. They can effectively suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and manganese dissolution of discharge products. Therefore, Zn/ZMO QD@C batteries display remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance.

         <title>Transforming Electrocatalytic Biomass Upgrading and Hydrogen Production from Electricity Input to Electricity Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coupling anodic low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation with the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction, a multipurpose electrocatalytic system was assembled for biomass upgrading, hydrogen production, and electricity generation. This system could generate about 2&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced, instead of requiring electricity input.







Abstract
Integrating biomass upgrading and hydrogen production in an electrocatalytic system is attractive both environmentally and in terms of sustainability. Conventional electrolyser systems coupling anodic biosubstrate electrooxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction usually require electricity input. Herein, we describe the development of an electrocatalytic system for simultaneous biomass upgrading, hydrogen production, and electricity generation. In contrast to conventional furfural electrooxidation, the employed low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation enabled the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group to be released as gaseous hydrogen at the anode at a low potential of approximately 0&#8197;VRHE (vs. RHE). The integrated electrocatalytic system could generate electricity of about 2&#8197;kWh per cubic meter of hydrogen produced. This study may provide a transformative technology to convert electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from a process requiring electricity input into a process to generate electricity.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Permeable and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) Enrichable Cross&#8208;Linking Reagent to Advance In&#8197;Vivo Cross&#8208;Linking Mass Spectrometry</title>

A phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX, has been developed that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The optimized tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) system enables the time&#8208;efficient and detailed characterization of protein interaction landscapes in intact human cells.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) is an attractive method for the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein structures and interactions. Currently, the depth of in&#8197;vivo XL&#8208;MS studies is lagging behind the established applications to cell lysates, because cross&#8208;linking reagents that can penetrate intact cells and strategies to enrich cross&#8208;linked peptides lack efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we have developed a phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX, that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. We have established a tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo XL&#8208;MS approach that enables cross&#8208;links in intact human cells to be identified in high numbers with substantially reduced analysis time. Collectively, the developed cross&#8208;linker and XL&#8208;MS approach pave the way for the comprehensive XL&#8208;MS characterization of living systems.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Terpenoid&#8211;Pyrrolobenzoxazine Hybrid Natural Product CJ&#8208;12662</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of the terpene&#8211;amino acid hybrid CJ&#8208;12662 has been uncovered. In particular, the biosynthesis involves two different oxidation strategies (one&#8208;electron or two&#8208;electron oxidation routes) for the modification of each unit, reflecting its chemical reactivity. Finally, ThmM catalyzes the formation of the N&#8208;oxide, which undergoes a [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement to form the unique pyrrolobenzoxazine structure.







Abstract
The fungal natural product CJ&#8208;12662 is a structurally complex terpene&#8211;amino acid hybrid, and is a potent anthelmintic compound. The biosynthetic pathway of CJ&#8208;12662 is elucidated based on metabolite analysis from heterologous expression. We demonstrate the terpene portion is derived from successive P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations of amorpha&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene, while three flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes are involved in morphing the esterified tryptophan into a chlorinated pyrrolobenzoxazine, utilizing a cascaded [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement.

         <title>Functional Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Acetylene Batteries for Electricity Generation and Electrochemical Acetylene Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aqueous Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery is reported, which not only switches energy&#8208;consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but also reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C2H2+Zn+H2O&#8594;C2H4+ZnO. The Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery under a pure acetylene stream manifests an open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.14&#8197;V and a peak power density of 2.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For crude ethylene, the Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery produces polymer&#8208;grade ethylene.







Abstract
The available processes for removing acetylene impurities from crude ethylene are tremendously energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we demonstrate a novel aqueous Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery, which not only switches energy&#8208;consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but also reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C2H2+Zn+H2O&#8594;C2H4+ZnO. Under a pure acetylene stream, this Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery exhibits an open circuit potential of 1.14&#8197;V and a peak power density of 2.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceed those of reported Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries. Even for simulated crude ethylene, the Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery manifests an acetylene conversion of 99.97&#8201;% and continuously produces polymer&#8208;grade ethylene with only &#8776;3&#8197;ppm acetylene during a long&#8208;term discharge operation. Such a functional battery is universally appliable for reducing other alkynes and generating electricity. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for green ethylene purification and the design of functional batteries.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Protein Communication Mediated by an Antibody&#8208;Responsive DNA Nanodevice**

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the highly regulated networks of living systems, two antibody&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;based devices are proposed that enable communication between two otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins.







Abstract
We report here the rational design and optimization of an antibody&#8208;responsive, DNA&#8208;based device that enables communication between pairs of otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins. The device is designed to recognize and bind a specific antibody and, in response, undergo a conformational change that leads to the release of a DNA strand, termed the &#8220;translator,&#8221; that regulates the activity of a downstream target protein. As proof of principle, we demonstrate antibody&#8208;induced control of the proteins thrombin and Taq DNA polymerase. The resulting strategy is versatile and, in principle, can be easily adapted to control protein&#8211;protein communication in artificial regulatory networks.

         <title>Accelerating Radiative Decay in Blue Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters by Minimizing the Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distances</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorophores are constructed with strong through&#8208;space donor&#8211;acceptor interactions by minimizing their face&#8208;to&#8208;face distance of 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, realizing efficient blue emission and fast radiative decay. The materials show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with relieved efficiency roll&#8208;off and CIEy coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15, when used as emitter and sensitizer in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorophors (TADF) featuring through&#8208;space charge transfers (TSCT) suffer from low radiative decay rates (krs), especially for blue emitters. Here, a xanthene bridge is adopted to construct space&#8208;confined face&#8208;to&#8208;face donor&#8211;acceptor alignment and minimize their distances down to 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, even shorter than the interlayer distance of graphite and thus strengthening the electronic interactions. The resulting blue TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit peaks around &#8776;460&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90&#8201;%, and krs of nearly 107&#8197;s&#8722;1, almost 2&#8211;10&#8197;times higher than previously observed values with comparable reverse intersystem crossing rates. The corresponding blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15 using those molecules as emitters and sensitizers, respectively.

Here, a xanthene bridge is adopted to construct space-confined face-to-face donor&#8211;acceptor alignment and minimize their distances down to 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, even shorter than the interlayer distance of graphite and thus strengthening the electronic interactions. The resulting blue TSCT-TADF emitters exhibit peaks around &#8776;460&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of &amp;gt;90&#8201;%, and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;s of nearly 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, almost 2&#8211;10&#8197;times higher than previously observed values with comparable reverse intersystem crossing rates. The corresponding blue organic light-emitting diodes show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15 using those molecules as emitters and sensitizers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Chemical Biology Toolbox Targeting the Intracellular Binding Site of CCR9: Fluorescent Ligands, New Drug Leads and PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the intracellular CCR9 antagonist vercirnon, we developed the first small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based fluorescent ligand targeting the intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) of a GPCR. This tool enabled binding studies via NanoBRET, fluorescence microscopy, and the discovery of a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To induce CCR9 degradation, we developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Starting from vercirnon, an intracellular C&#8722;C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) antagonist and previous phase III clinical candidate for the treatment of Crohn's disease, we developed a chemical biology toolbox targeting the IABS of CCR9. We first synthesized a fluorescent ligand enabling equilibrium and kinetic binding studies via NanoBRET as well as fluorescence microscopy. Applying this molecular tool in a membrane&#8208;based setup and in living cells, we discovered a 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine analogue as a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To chemically induce CCR9 degradation, we then developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we succeeded in showing that our CCR9&#8208;PROTAC is able to reduce CCR9 levels, thereby offering an unprecedented approach to modulate GPCR activity.

         <title>An Overlooked Pathway in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Diazoalkanes with Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most popular illustration of the role of Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMO) in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions must be revised: the reactions of diazoacetates with enamines proceed stepwise and are controlled by interactions of the enamines&#8217; HOMO with &#960;*N=N (LUMO) and not with the unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl fragment (LUMO+1). Tautomers of the intermediate zwitterions have been observed and the mechanism studied by DFT computations.







Abstract
Methyl diazoacetate reacts with 1&#8208;(N&#8208;pyrrolidino)cycloalkenes to give products of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and azo couplings. The kinetics and mechanisms of these reactions were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;systems in the 1,3&#8208;dipoles of the propargyl&#8208;allenyl type allow for two separate reaction pathways for the (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions. The commonly considered concerted pathway is rationalized by the interaction of the enamine HOMO with LUMO+1, the lowest unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl anion fragment of methyl diazoacetate. We show that HOMO/LUMO(&#960;*N=N) interactions between enamines and methyl diazoacetate open a previously unrecognized reaction path for stepwise cycloadditions through zwitterionic intermediates with barriers approximately 40&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in energy in CHCl3 (DFT calculations) than for the concerted path.

         <title>Unifying Scheme for the Biosynthesis of Acyl&#8208;Branched Sugars: Extended Substrate Scope of Thiamine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 12, March 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of bacteria have branched sugars in their outer cell membrane with long, highly modified side chains. LPSs are often crucial factors in the pathogenesis of the bacteria. A unifying explanation of the biosynthesis of these highly interesting structures is introduced, based on the investigation of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes responsible for the linkage of the side chain and the sugar core.







Abstract
Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) dependent enzymes are useful catalysts for asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation through benzoin&#8208;type condensation reactions that result in &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. A wide range of aldehydes and ketones can be used as acceptor substrates; however, the donor substrate range is mostly limited to achiral &#945;&#8208;keto acids and simple aldehydes. By using a unifying retro&#8208;biosynthetic approach towards acyl&#8208;branched sugars, we identified a subclass of (myco)bacterial ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes with a greatly extended donor substrate range, namely functionalized chiral &#945;&#8208;keto acids with a chain length from C4 to C8. Highly enantioenriched acyloin products were obtained in good to high yields and several reactions were performed on a preparative scale. The newly introduced functionalized &#945;&#8208;keto acids, accessible by known aldolase&#8208;catalyzed transformations, substantially broaden the donor substrate range of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes, thus enabling a more general use of these already valuable catalysts.

         <title>para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Borylation of Aromatic Quaternary Ammonium and Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic ammonium and phosphonium salts are important synthetic intermediates and multifunctional materials, but para&#8208;selective functionalization of the aromatic salts remains a challenge. Here we develop an ionic ligand based on our newly designed "biphenyl&#8208;phenanthroline" skeleton and realize the Ir&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective C&#8208;H borylation of seven types of aromatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts. Gram&#8208;scale transformation, late&#8208;stage elaboration for drug molecule, and diversification of borylated products demonstrate the potential utility of this reaction. The mechanistic studies and computational analysis elucidate the origin of para&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Highly reduced Molybdenum Polyoxometalates via the Incorporation of d and f block metal ions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of nanoscale polyoxometalate (POM) clusters has been dominated by  the highly reduced icosahedral {Mo  132  } &#8216;browns&#8217; and the toroidal {Mo  154  } &#8216;blues&#8217; which are 45% and 18% reduced respectively. We hypothesised that there is space for a greater diversity of structures in this immediate reduction zone. Here we show it is possible to make highly reduced mix&#8208;valence POMs by presenting new classes of polyoxomolybdates: [Mo  V  52  Mo  VI  12  H  26  O  200  ]  42&#8208;  {Mo  64  } and [Mo  V  40  Mo  VI  30  H  30  O  215  ]  20&#8208;  {Mo  70  }. The {Mo  64  } cluster archetype has a super&#8208;cube structure and is composed of five different types of building blocks, each arranged in overlayed Archimedean or Platonic polyhedra. The {Mo  70  } cluster comprises five tripodal {Mo  V  6  } and five tetrahedral {Mo  V  2  Mo  VI  2  } building blocks alternatively linked to form a loop with a pentagonal star topology. We also show how the reaction yielding the {Mo  64  } super&#8208;cube can be used in the enrichment of lanthanides which exploit the differences in selectivity in the self&#8208;assembly of the polyoxometalates.</dc:description>
