         <title>Photo&#8208;Mediated Silacyclization by Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Selective C&#9472;F or C&#9472;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavelength&#8208;dependent, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes is developed to enable the efficient construction of six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. Selective C&#8211;F functionalization is achieved under 456&#160;nm LED irradiation, while irradiation at 335&#160;nm promotes acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization via C&#8211;H functionalization.








Abstract
Silacycles have gained significant attention within the synthetic community due to their pivotal roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Despite recent advancements, the defluorosilylation of aryl fluorides with hydrosilanes and the selective silylation of arenes without external oxidants remains challenging. Herein, we present a wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;mediated cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes to efficiently construct six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. By employing a synergistic system of an organophotocatalyst and a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, our approach exploits specific light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) wavelengths (456 and 335&#160;nm) to achieve selective C&#8211;F and C&#8211;H functionalization. This wavelength modulation enables the first successful defluorosilacyclization of ortho&#8208;fluoroallylbenzenes and facilitates an acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization, demonstrating precise site&#8208;selective functionalization. Mechanistic investigations reveal a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;facilitated intermolecular hydrosilylation followed by a wavelength&#8208;dependent, chemoselective intramolecular silacyclization cascade. Additionally, an unprecedented light&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution process involving silane and thiol is uncovered within the cascade C&#8211;H silacyclization. This photo&#8208;mediated strategy offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the synthesis of valuable silacycle compounds, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and precise wavelength&#8208;dependent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Healing Strategy Enabling Efficient and Stable ETL&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing an indium sulfate functional layer at the buried interface, In3+ forms a gradient doping, eliminating harmful defects through dynamic redox cycles (Pb0&#8594;Pb2+, I0&#8594;I&#8722;) to achieve synergistic bulk and interfacial healing, and leading to a high efficiency of 22.97% and excellent device stability for the ETL&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells without electron transport layers (ETL&#8208;free PSCs) have garnered increasing attention in recent years due to their simplified fabrication process and low production costs. However, non&#8208;radiative recombination of charge carriers and band energy mismatch at the interface significantly limit device performance. Here, we propose an ion&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing strategy introducing an indium sulfate (ln2(SO4)3) functional layer at the buried interface of the perovskite. The ln3+ exhibits gradient doping at the buried interface, acting as a redox buffer to oxidize Pb0 to Pb2+, while the generated ln+ reduces I0 to I&#8722;, forming a self&#8208;healing redox dynamic cycle. The incorporation of indium sulfate effectively improves the contact properties and band energy alignment at the ITO/perovskite interface, ultimately achieving a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency of 22.97%. The device retains 91.6% of its initial efficiency after 1200&#160;h of continuous illumination, providing new insights for the development and application of perovskite solar cells without electron transport layers.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Alkaline Double Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double electrolyte strategy combining an acidic catholyte (7&#160;M H3PO4) and an alkaline anolyte (6&#160;M KOH), separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM), enables a 1.83&#160;V aqueous proton battery. Using CoCuHCF and benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) as electrodes, the system achieves high energy&#8212;power output and excellent cycling stability, offering a new path for high&#8208;voltage aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries offer a promising energy storage solution due to their inherent safety, rapid ion mobility, and low cost. However, their performance is largely constrained by water's limited electrochemical stability, restricting operating voltage and energy density. This study addresses this challenge by introducing an innovative acid&#8208;alkaline double electrolyte configuration to achieve high&#8208;voltage aqueous proton batteries. Employing a high&#8208;anodic&#8208;limit acidic catholyte (7&#160;M H3PO4) and a low&#8208;cathodic&#8208;limit alkaline anolyte (6&#160;M KOH), separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM), significantly expands the full battery's electrochemical stability window (ESW) to 2.91&#160;V. Cobalt&#8208;doped Prussian blue (CoCuHCF) was selected as the cathode due to its superior proton kinetics and cycling durability, while benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) was identified as an optimal anode via combined theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Consequently, the battery delivered exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a high energy density of 329.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, a remarkable power density of 14788.3&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1, and excellent cycling stability with 98.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. The proposed acid&#8208;alkaline double electrolyte strategy provides efficient and valuable guidance for advancing aqueous energy storage technologies.

         <title>Tuning Surface Concentrations of Building Units to Enable the Cathodic Deposition of Metastable ZIF&#8208;L Films for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic deposition enables the formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films, yet precise control of surface building&#8208;unit concentrations remain challenging. By finely tuning these concentrations, metastable ZIF&#8208;L membranes are obtained with high gas separation performance. This approach establishes a general strategy for regulating building units under negative bias, applicable to other surface&#8208;sensitive MOFs.








Abstract
Cathodic deposition is an emerging technique for the preparation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films. However, monitoring and controlling the concentrations of MOF building units (i.e., metal nodes and ligands) on the electrode surface remains challenging and has yet to be reported. This limitation greatly hinders the application of this technique to the synthesis of MOFs sensitive to building unit concentrations, such as the well&#8208;known metastable ZIF&#8208;L. Here, using the cathodic deposition of ZIF&#8208;L films as an example, we demonstrate how the surface metal node and ligand concentrations influence ZIF&#8208;L film generation by utilizing in situ pH measurements and theoretical calculations. Also, we propose a strategy to regulate the concentrations of these building units, enabling the straightforward and rapid cathodic deposition of thin ZIF&#8208;L films. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) post&#8208;modification, the electrochemically deposited ZIF&#8208;L films on commercial anodized alumina oxide (AAO) substrate exhibit good gas separation performance, achieving a H2/N2 selectivity of 19.4 and a H2 permeance exceeding 360 GPU (1 GPU&#160;=&#160;3.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;1&#8304; mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1 Pa&#8722;1).

         <title>Chiral Molecules Induce Enantiomorphic Lattice Helicity in Chiral 0D Tin Bromide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral (R&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 and (S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 metal halides crystallize in enantiomorphic helical space groups P61 and P65, respectively. The helical orientation of chiral molecules in the lattice arises due to strong N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and is visualized via sixfold symmetry. The crystals show mirror&#8208;image CD spectra (g&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and circularly polarized SHG with a dissymmetry factor (gCP&#8211;SHG) up to 0.44.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have emerged as a promising class of materials for spin&#8208;controlled optical and optoelectronic effects and related applications. Chiral hybrid metal halides generally crystallize in non&#8208;helical space groups. Herein, we report the discovery of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral (R/S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 (MBA: methylbenzylammonium cation) single crystals with enantiomorphic lattice helicity. The S&#8208;enantiomer of the chiral molecule induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P61 space group (right&#8208;handed, P&#8208;helix), while the R&#8208;enantiomer induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P65 space group (left&#8208;handed, M&#8208;helix). The chiral molecules induce the helical twist of inorganic units in the lattice through N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strong electronic coupling between chiral molecules and SnBr62&#8722; subunits is responsible for the generation of chirality. The chiral crystals exhibit circular dicroism (CD) spectra with a high dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and no Cotton effect, maintaining the same CD sign throughout the spectrum. In addition, they exhibit broadband second harmonic generation (SHG) over a broad excitation range, with a gCP&#8208;SHG up to 0.44. Furthermore, we find that the alloying of Sn with Pb leads to a change in dimensionality from 0D to non&#8208;helical 1D structures. These crystals with helical lattices and interesting CD responses are expected to open new avenues for spin&#8208;controlled applications.

         <title>Convergent Electrochemical&#8211;Chemical Tandem Catalysis Synthesis of Ethylene Oxide from CO2 and Water at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem electrochemical&#8211;chemical system that couples CO2 reduction (CO2R) toward C2H4 and two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) toward H2O2 in a single electrolyzer with ambient epoxidation was reported to produce ethylene oxide (EO) from CO2 and H2O.








Abstract
Ethylene oxide (EO) is an important commodity chemical, and its production currently relies on fossil fuel&#8208;based energy&#8208;intensive thermocatalysis associated with substantial CO2 emissions or the usage of toxic/corrosive precursors (e.g., Cl2). Herein, we report a convergent electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem route for efficient synthesis of EO from CO2 and water under ambient conditions over nonprecious catalysts. Such a protype consists of cathodic CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 and simultaneous anodic two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) to H2O2 in a single electrolyzer, followed by reaction of the two products over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst toward EO with high production rate of 422.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of&#160;&gt;98%. W&#8208;doped CuOx and Cu&#8208;doped SnO2 were used as cathode and anode electrodes with respective Faradaic efficiencies of 63.5% and 75.6% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Systematic characterizations, including 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), isotope&#8208;labeling mass spectrometry (MS), and operando infrared spectroscopy, along with theoretical calculations, reveal that Cu doping breaks the electronic structure symmetry of Sn to induce electron redistribution for optimal adsorption and coupling of key intermediates like *OH in 2e&#8208;WOR. This study offers a sustainable manner for efficient EO synthesis from raw materials with renewable electricity input.

         <title>A Water Soluble and Solid&#8208;State Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) System as Renewable Solar Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;A new series of highly water soluble norbornadienes has been synthesized and characterized as molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems in gram scale. Particularly, concentrated solutions (1&#160;M) and solid&#8208;state heat release showed a thermal heat release of 7.5&#160;and 39.6&#160;K, respectively, with full reversibility in both cases. These systems represent a new avenue for transferring the MOST technology to real and sustainable applications.&#8221;








Abstract
Solar energy storage is key to overcome the intermittent character of sunlight. We present a sustainable solution based on norbornadiene&#8211;quadricyclane pairs for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage working in highly concentrated neutral water solutions and solid state. Photochemical preparation of high&#8208;energy, metastable isomers in previously unattainable 1.64&#160;M solutions was achieved. The best compound can be stored for 1.9 years and is stable in solid state, allowing for the preparation of up to 3&#160;M water solutions. Catalyzed back&#8208;conversion ensures efficient heat release and starting material recovery with remarkable fatigue resistance in water solution and solid state, exhibiting macroscopic heat release in both states, providing a &#916;T of 39.6&#160;K and fully recyclable use. These results highlight a promising avenue for the practical application of MOST technology.

         <title>Programmable Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Through Stereocontrol of Chiral Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Co&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral inducers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) with varying binaphthalene dihedral angles were selected with achiral liquid crystalline polymer PyP to form chiral co&#8208;assemblies. As the dihedral angle of the binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9 could emit inverted and amplified circularly polarized electroluminescence with a |gEL| value up to 0.18 compared with (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) are essential to prospective 3D displays and advanced polarized lighting systems. The rational design of programmable circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) materials with a large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (gEL) remains a great challenge and is still in its preliminary exploration phase. In this work, two aggregation induced emission active (AIE&#8208;active) chiral inducers with different dihedral angles of binaphthalene (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) and achiral acrylate&#8208;based liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) (PyP) were chosed to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. Interestingly, as the dihedral angle of the AIE&#8208;active binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2&#8208;PyP) could emit inverted and amplified CP&#8208;EL signals compared with S&#8208;/R&#8208;1&#8208;PyP after annealing. Significantly, the (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs displayed remarkable blue CP&#8208;EL (&#955;EL&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nm, Lmax&#160;=&#160;14860&#160;cd m&#8722;2) with a record |gEL| value of up to 0.18 in chiral co&#8208;assembled CP&#8208;OLEDs to date. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CP&#8208;EL with tunable signal direction and intensity through stereocontrol of AIE&#8208;active chiral inducers in LCP co&#8208;assembled films, providing a valuable guidance for realizing programmable CP&#8208;EL.

In this work, two aggregation induced emission active (AIE-active) chiral inducers with different dihedral angles of binaphthalene (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-2) and achiral acrylate-based liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) (PyP) were chosed to construct chiral co-assemblies through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. Interestingly, as the dihedral angle of the AIE-active binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co-assemblies (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-2-PyP) could emit inverted and amplified CP-EL signals compared with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-1-PyP after annealing. Significantly, the (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-2)&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;-(PyP)&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;-based CP-OLEDs displayed remarkable blue CP-EL (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nm, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;14860&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with a record |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| value of up to 0.18 in chiral co-assembled CP-OLEDs to date. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CP-EL with tunable signal direction and intensity through stereocontrol of AIE-active chiral inducers in LCP co-assembled films, providing a valuable guidance for realizing programmable CP-EL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive Hydration Chemistry Enables Fast and Durable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

RHM enables adaptive water capture and release in AZIBs, promoting uniform Zn deposition, fast Zn2&#8314; transport, and stable cycling.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage; however, uncontrolled interfacial water remains a major hurdle, limiting both anode stability and ion transport. In this study, 2&#8208;picolinaldehyde (2PA) was chosen as a reversible hydration modulator (RHM) that enables dynamic regulation of interfacial free water. Spectroscopic and computational analyses revealed that RHM captures excess water during plating to suppress hydrogen evolution and corrosion while releasing water during stripping to facilitate Zn2+ solvation and migration. In addition, RHM coordinates with Zn2+ and reorganizes its local coordination environment. Consequently, symmetric cells with the RHM&#8208;ZnSO4 electrolyte deliver prolonged cycling exceeding 4000&#160;h and excellent rate performance, with low voltage polarization even at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The corresponding full cells demonstrate durable operation for over 5000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This adaptive behavior satisfies the distinct interfacial water requirements during Zn plating and stripping, enabling interfacial stability and efficient ion transport, and provides a novel strategy for electrolyte design in AZIBs.

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd and In were chosen to jointly regulate the degree of water involvement during eCO2RR. With aco&#8208;doping ratio of 50:2 (Cu:Pd/In&#160;=&#160;50:2), we achieved a variation from 95% C1 to 70% C2 by changing the ratio of Pd:In. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement reveal the positive correlation between the C2 product selectivity and water involvement. Modulating CO2RR via isolated water induction offers a novel catalyst design strategy to boost C2 products.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8211;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.

         <title>Harnessing Dual Hydrogen Bonding and Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Interactions for Bio&#8208;Inspired Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Electrolytes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Bio&#8208;inspired symmetry disruption in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries: Isobutyramide simultaneously breaks hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and coordinates Zn2+ ions, tailoring solvation structure and stabilizing Zn anodes. This molecular&#8208;level electrolyte engineering suppresses dendrites, mitigates hydrogen evolution, and enables long&#8208;lasting, high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) offer a safe, cost&#8208;effective alternative for large&#8208;scale energy storage but are hindered by zinc dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and unstable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. These challenges largely stem from strong dipole interactions between symmetric water molecules and Zn2+, which destabilize the electric double layer (EDL) and trigger parasitic reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological systems that use asymmetric molecular interactions to regulate aqueous environments, we introduce isobutyramide (IAM) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive. IAM features both carbonyl and amide groups, enabling it to act as a dual&#8208;site hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. This disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in water, reduces water activity, and suppresses HER. Additionally, IAM's lone pairs coordinate strongly with Zn2+, restructuring the solvation sheath and mitigating uncontrolled Zn2+ migration that leads to dendrite formation. This dual&#8208;function, symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy stabilizes the EDL, enhances Zn plating/stripping reversibility, and suppresses interfacial degradation. Electrochemical tests confirm IAM's efficacy: Zn||Cu cells exhibit 99.68% Coulombic efficiency over 1,000 cycles, Zn||Zn symmetric cells remain stable for over 4,250&#160;h, and full&#8208;cell Zn||V2O5 and Zn||I2 systems show significantly enhanced cycling performance. Zn||I2 pouch cells also demonstrate robust long&#8208;term operation. This bio&#8208;inspired approach offers a scalable path to high&#8208;performance, practical aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of 15N&#8208;Labeled Oximes by Alloy Synergy Activation and Hydroxylamine Overhydrogenation Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BixMoy alloys are designed to electrocatalytic conversion of 15NO2&#8210; to 15N&#8208;oxime with a 76% Faradaic efficiency and 88% yield at 3.0 A. Mo serves as the H2O activation site, whereas Bi acts as the 15NO2&#8210; activation site. The synergy between Bi and Mo leads to a high 15N&#8208;oxime formation rate. Moreover, Mo introduction increases the hydrogenation energy barrier for 15NH2OH to 15NH3, suppressing 15NH2OH overhydrogenation and therefore improving 15N&#8208;oxime Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
15N&#8208;labeled molecules are essential for industrial drug development and medical imageology. However, the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled molecules suffers from the complex procedure of de novo synthesis and harsh conditions. Here, we propose an electrochemical strategy to synthesize 15N&#8208;labeled oximes (15N&#8208;oximes) from 15N&#8208;labeled nitrites (15NO2&#8722;) and aldehydes/ketones. Matching the adsorption and activation of H2O and 15NO2&#8722; and inhibiting 15NH2OH overhydrogenation are the keys to realizing efficient ampere&#8208;level electrosynthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled oximes. A bismuth&#8722;molybdenum (BiMo) alloy catalyst is subsequently designed, in which Bi acts as the 15NO2&#8722; activation site, whereas Mo serves as the H2O activation site. The precisely controlled atomic ratio of Mo and Bi ensures that there is sufficient but not excessive active hydrogen provided for 15NO2&#8722; hydrogenation and therefore accelerates the reaction rate.

&lt;p&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; alloys are designed to electrocatalytic conversion of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-oxime with a 76% Faradaic efficiency and 88% yield at 3.0 A. Mo serves as the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O activation site, whereas Bi acts as the &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;&lt;/sup&gt; activation site. The synergy between Bi and Mo leads to a high &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-oxime formation rate. Moreover, Mo introduction increases the hydrogenation energy barrier for &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, suppressing &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH overhydrogenation and therefore improving &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-oxime Faradaic efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeled molecules are essential for industrial drug development and medical imageology. However, the synthesis of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeled molecules suffers from the complex procedure of de novo synthesis and harsh conditions. Here, we propose an electrochemical strategy to synthesize &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeled oximes (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-oximes) from &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeled nitrites (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and aldehydes/ketones. Matching the adsorption and activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and inhibiting &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH overhydrogenation are the keys to realizing efficient ampere-level electrosynthesis of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeled oximes. A bismuth&#8722;molybdenum (BiMo) alloy catalyst is subsequently designed, in which Bi acts as the &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; activation site, whereas Mo serves as the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O activation site. The precisely controlled atomic ratio of Mo and Bi ensures that there is sufficient but not excessive active hydrogen provided for &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogenation and therefore accelerates the reaction rate. Moreover, Mo incorporation increases the energy barrier of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH overhydrogenation and thus improves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-oxime.

This work presents a concept to facilitate proton deintercalation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups to form Ni3+&#9472;O catalytic sites, and further enhance proton transfer efficiency by PO43&#8722;&#8208;induced hydrogen bridges (PO43&#8722;&#8943;H&#9472;O&#9472;Ni2+ &#8594; HPO42&#8722; + Ni3+&#9472;O). Moreover, the rate&#8208;controlling step for OH adsorption happens via hydrogen bridges connecting the PO43&#8722; group with the &#945;&#8208;C in *HMF&#8208;H intermediate, notably decreasing the energy barrier for HMF oxidation.








Abstract
Accelerating proton deintercalation and transfer on the catalyst surface is crucial for the electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into the high&#8208;value 2,5&#8208;furanodicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Herein, we have constructed a Ni(OH)2&#9472;PO43&#8722;/Ni3(PO4)2 heterojunction catalyst that demonstrates exceptional selectivity (97.16%), yield (94.16%), and Faraday efficiency (94.31%) in the selective oxidation of HMF toward FDCA. The incorporation of PO43&#8722; groups triggers the formation of hydrogen bridges and reconfigures the interfacial charge distribution, facilitating the activation and subsequent proton deintercalation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups to generate active Ni3+&#9472;O catalytic sites (PO43&#8722;&#8943;H&#9472;O&#9472;Ni2+ &#8594; HPO42&#8722; + Ni3+&#9472;O). Both density functional theory calculations and pH&#8208;dependent experiments emphasize the crucial function of these hydrogen bridges as proton ferries, effectively boosting the proton transfer efficiency during HMF oxidation. Theoretical studies unveil that the rate&#8208;controlling step for OH adsorption on Ni(OH)2&#9472;PO43&#8722; occurs via the hydrogen bridge connecting the PO43&#8722; group with the &#945;&#8208;C atom in *HMF&#8208;H intermediate (PO43&#8722;&#8943;H&#9472;O&#8943;COR &#8594; PO42&#8722;&#9472;H&#8943;O&#9472;COR), significantly reducing the energy barrier for HMF oxidation. This study introduces a novel hydrogen bridge&#8208;mediated electrooxidation mechanism that holds great potential for advancing biomass conversion technologies.

         <title>Potent Fluorescent Probe for Target&#8208;Engagement Studies of Allosteric Pyruvate Kinase Modulators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LumiPK, a novel environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer, enables direct monitoring of allosteric ligand engagement with pyruvate kinase fused with nanoluciferase (Nluc), focusing on the liver isoform (PKL). In NanoBRET, and fluorescence indicator displacement assays, LumiPK shows high affinity and validates known allosteric modulators of PKL. This tool compound advances target engagement technologies and supports broader PK&#8208;related therapeutic research.








Abstract
Pyruvate kinases (PKs) are highly allosterically regulated enzymes that play a central role in cellular metabolism and are increasingly recognized as valuable therapeutic targets in cancer, metabolic diseases, and diabetes. Despite their biological and clinical significance, methods to directly assess allosteric ligand engagement of PK isoforms remain limited. Here, we report the development of LumiPK, a novel, environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer designed to monitor allosteric binding to the liver isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKL). LumiPK integrates an environment&#8208;sensitive 4&#8208;sulfamonyl&#8208;7&#8208;aminobenzoxadiazole fluorophore into a potent allosteric modulator scaffold. It emerged as the lead compound from a small ligand series, showing high affinity for PKL (KD&#160; = &#160;37&#160;&#177;&#160;5&#160;nM) in recombinant assays; the most potent fluorescent PK reporter reported to date. A NanoBRET assay using a PKL&#8208;Nluc fusion (PKLNluc) enabled intracellular monitoring of unlabeled ligand engagement. LumiPK maintained high potency (EC50&#160; = &#160;18.4&#160;nM) in cellular experiments. Competitive NanoBRET and fluorescence titration assays confirmed binding of known PKL activators (mitapivat, TEPP&#8208;46, DASA&#8208;58) in both cellular and recombinant settings, with KD values remaining consistent across these methods. LumiPK thus provides a robust tool for probing PKL allosteric modulation and fills a key gap in target engagement technologies for PKL.

The rigid&#8208;cation&#8208;assisted (benzyl&#8208;DABCO)2Cu5I7 (Bz&#8208;Cu5I7) complex achieves near&#8208;unity PLQY by suppressing nonradiative losses via &#960;&#8208;conjugations. Its flexible scintillator film enables a high&#8208;resolution (&gt;20 lp mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging, a low radiation dose (71.2 nGyair s&#8722;1), and detailed 3D X&#8208;ray image reconstruction, demonstrating great potential for computed tomography (CT) applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors are essential for 3D X&#8208;ray imaging in computed tomography (CT), but conventional systems require high radiation doses to achieve fine resolution. All&#8208;In&#8208;One (AIO) Cu(I) halide complexes, capable of forming both ionic and coordinate bonds within a single structure, offer efficient scintillation at lower doses, yet their performance remains limited by nonradiative energy losses during indirect X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion. Here, we develop rigid&#8208;cation&#8208;assisted AIO Cu(I) halide complexes by introducing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions to suppress the nonradiative pathways, achieving near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). In particular, the rigid (benzyl&#8208;DABCO)2Cu5I7 (Bz&#8208;Cu5I7) complex stabilizes triplet emissive states, thereby facilitating high&#8208;efficiency radiative recombination and excellent radioluminescence (RL) properties. When incorporated into flexible scintillator film, Bz&#8208;Cu5I7 demonstrates remarkable X&#8208;ray imaging performance, enabling a high spatial resolution exceeding 20 lp mm&#8722;1 and a low radiation dose of 71.2 nGyair s&#8722;1. Importantly, 3D X&#8208;ray image reconstruction of small electronic components reveals fine structural details, highlighting the potential of Bz&#8208;Cu5I7 as a next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray scintillator for low&#8208;dose CT imaging.

All-In-One (AIO) Cu(I) halide complexes, capable of forming both ionic and coordinate bonds within a single structure, offer efficient scintillation at lower doses, yet their performance remains limited by nonradiative energy losses during indirect X-ray-to-light conversion. Here, we develop rigid-cation-assisted AIO Cu(I) halide complexes by introducing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions to suppress the nonradiative pathways, achieving near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). In particular, the rigid (benzyl-DABCO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (Bz-Cu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) complex stabilizes triplet emissive states, thereby facilitating high-efficiency radiative recombination and excellent radioluminescence (RL) properties. When incorporated into flexible scintillator film, Bz-Cu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates remarkable X-ray imaging performance, enabling a high spatial resolution exceeding 20 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low radiation dose of 71.2 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Importantly, 3D X-ray image reconstruction of small electronic components reveals fine structural details, highlighting the potential of Bz-Cu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; as a next-generation X-ray scintillator for low-dose CT imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Twisted&#8221; Terpolymer Donor Enabling High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a new strategy to enhance the stretchability and photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) simultaneously by twisting the conjugated backbone of polymer donors. Efficient OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3% with a remarkable crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 23.8% are fabricated. Moreover, the intrinsically stretchable OSCs (is&#8208;OSCs) achieved a PCE of 14.2% and excellent stretchability with a strain at PCE80% of 31.0%, ranking among the highest values.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (is&#8208;OSCs) hold great potential for next&#8208;generation wearable power generators. Currently, high&#8208;efficiency polymeric donor materials are based on rigid planar conjugated backbones, which limits their mechanical robustness and creates a trade&#8208;off between photovoltaic performance and stretchability. To simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness of is&#8208;OSCs, we develop a series of ductile PM&#8208;BOX% terpolymers by incorporating different amounts (X&#160;=&#160;5, 10, and 20) of 3&#8208;butyloctyl&#8208;thiophene (ThBO) units into PM6 backbone. The BO alkyl side chains appended on Th&#8208;BO units induce a more significant twist in the backbone compared to PM6, which increases the disordered contents and facilitates the stress dissipation, hence enhancing the mechanical stretchability. While the conjugated thiophene unit preserves the &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, maintaining efficient charge transport. As a result, the PM&#8208;BO10%:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based devices outperform the PM6&#8208;based ones, achieving a higher PCE of 18.3% and a superior crack&#8208;onset strain of 23.8%. Additionally, PM&#8208;BO10%:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based is&#8208;OSCs reach a PCE of 14.2% with an excellent PCE retention (80% of its initial PCE at 31.0% strain), marking one of the highest values for is&#8208;OSCs. This twisted terpolymer design strategy paves a novel way for designing efficient polymer donors with excellent stretchability for the application in is&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Generalizing Vinyl Halide Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions with Photoredox and Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy has been developed for predictable and robust vinyl halide cross&#8208;coupling reactions. This approach demonstrates broad applicability across seven distinct bond&#8208;forming transformations, featuring wide electrophile and nucleophile scope, high tolerance for functional groups, and suitability for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biomolecules. It also enables efficient one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step bifunctional transformations.








Abstract
Reliable, broadly applicable cross&#8208;coupling conditions that deliver the desired products with minimal optimization are essential in pharmaceutical research, where efficient synthesis accelerates lead discovery and late&#8208;stage diversification. Although advances like high&#8208;throughput additive screening and commercial catalyst/ligand libraries improve prediction in specific systems, a general strategy for vinyl halide cross&#8208;coupling across diverse bond&#8208;forming reactions remains elusive. Herein, we report a general and highly predictable method for vinyl halide cross&#8208;coupling under photoredox conditions, employing two complementary catalytic systems. In the first, the organic photocatalyst 4CzIPN enables efficient coupling with nucleophiles such as thiols, selenols, sulfinate salts, activated alkenes, phosphorus (III), and boron compounds, affording C(sp2)&#9472;S, &#9472;Se, &#9472;C, &#9472;P, and &#9472;B bonds in high yields. In the second, a dual nickelphotoredox catalytic system facilitates coupling with less reactive nucleophiles, including phosphorus (V), nitrogen, and oxygen. This approach enables seven distinct bond&#8208;forming reactions, offering broad electrophile and nucleophile scope, high functional group tolerance, and applicability to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biomolecules. The simple and consistent conditions enable one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step bifunctional transformations by sequentially activating distinct chemical bonds involving nucleophiles and electrophiles.

         <title>Sustained, Reversible, and Adaptive Non&#8208;Equilibrium Steady States of a Dissipative DNA&#8208;Based System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous supply of an RNA chemical fuel allows sustained non&#8208;equilibrium steady states (NESS) of a dissipative DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction to be achieved. The system can dynamically adapt in real&#8208;time to subtle on&#8208;the&#8208;fly variations of fuel supply, demonstrating remarkable control over a dissipative process, which is unachievable when using batch&#8208;wise fuel additions. We confirmed the non&#8208;equilibrium composition of the system at the NESS.








Abstract
Inspired by nature, researchers have developed several chemical fuel&#8208;driven supramolecular systems aimed at achieving improved kinetic control over their formation and functions. Alongside, DNA&#8208;based systems regulated by energy&#8208;dissipating mechanisms have been reported. However, the majority of these systems rely on batchwise additions of chemical fuels to closed reactors, resulting in transient non&#8208;equilibrium states that differ fundamentally from the sustained and highly adaptable non&#8208;equilibrium steady states (NESS) maintained by living systems through continuous energy dissipation. Here, we demonstrate sustained NESS of a dissipative DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction achieved through the continuous supply of an RNA fuel to an open semi&#8208;batch reactor, using a custom automated setup that enables tunable fuel infusion rates and in situ analysis. Similar to biological NESS, our system dynamically adapts in real&#8208;time to subtle variations in fuel supply, achieving different steady&#8208;state levels of the strand&#8208;displacement reaction. Our approach demonstrates remarkable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly control over a dissipative DNA nanosystem, unachievable when working under batch conditions. Importantly, by fitting the experimental data to a kinetic model of the reaction network, we were able to confirm that the observed steady states correspond to true non&#8208;equilibrium compositions of the system.

         <title>A Universal Voltage&#8208;Enhancement Strategy Based on Multifunctional Ligand&#8208;Mediated Modulation for Na&#8208;Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak&#8208;field ligands reduce Mn octahedral splitting energy, inducing a downshift of the eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ antibonding orbital. This shifts the valence band maximum away from the vacuum level, thereby elevating the Mn3&#8314;/Mn&#8308;&#8314; redox potential with an average voltage increase of 0.24&#160;V.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as promising energy storage solutions due to resource abundance and low cost, yet their practical deployment is hindered by limited operating voltages of cathode materials. Herein, we propose a universal ligand&#8208;field engineering strategy to enhance voltage through electronic structure modulation in transition metal oxides. Using the Na0.67Mg0.2Mn0.8O2 as a model system, weak&#8208;field ligands are introduced to alter the coordination environment of MnO6 octahedra. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the weak&#8208;field ligands reduce Mn octahedral splitting energy, inducing a downshift of the eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ orbital. This shifts the valence band maximum away from the vacuum level, thereby elevating the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox potential with an average voltage increase of 0.24&#160;V. Concurrently, the lowered initial Mn oxidation state induces an increased discharge capacity by 35.7% (153.2&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), while suppressing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions and Mn3+ disproportionation yielding 94.4% capacity retention after 200 cycles (versus 69.9% in pristine sample). This ligand&#8208;engineering strategy in regulating redox voltage can be extended to other systems with eg&#8727;$e_g^*$&#8208;involved redox systems (such as Ni&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and Mn&#8208;based cathodes). Our work establishes a direct correlation between eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ orbital energy modulation and operating voltage, providing foundational insights for designing Na&#8208;layered oxide cathodes with high operating voltage.

         <title>Sustained Release of Underpotential Deposition Initiators for Ah&#8208;Level Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale nickel complex nanofilm sustainably releases nickel ions, precisely controlling zinc deposition to overcome electrolyte&#8208;additive depletion in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. With hydrophobic protection and dynamic underpotential deposition initiation, it delivers 30&#160;000 stable cycles, practical Ah&#8208;level pouch cells (1.5&#160;Ah) with high areal capacity (13.8&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), and efficient photovoltaically re&#8208;charged performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives effectively stabilize aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet their depletion during long&#8208;term cycling leads to eventual battery failure. Here, we address this common issue through sustained release of underpotential deposition initiators from an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve the long&#8208;term operation. This SEI, comprising nickel hydroxide and nickel&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazole complexes embedded in a hydrophobic dodecylphosphonic acid (DPA) monolayer via ion&#8208;layer epitaxy, releases Ni2+ ions on&#8208;demand when local pH rises due to corrosion. In this way, the protection through sustained and controlled release of underpotential deposition initiator over long&#8208;term operation is achieved. Concurrently, the hydrophobic DPA layer restricts direct water contact, effectively suppressing side reactions. Consequently, the engineered Ni@DPA&#8208;coated Zn electrode demonstrates remarkable stability, enduring over 37&#160;500 cycles at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8211;I2 full cells retain exceptional cycling performance for over 30&#160;000 cycles at 45&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, achieving an unprecedented energy density of 270&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (1.5&#160;Ah) delivers a high areal capacity (13.8&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), maintaining 83% capacity after 400 cycles. Demonstrating practical application, a Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cell can be directly charged by an external solar panel with photovoltaic conversion efficiencies up to 10.8%. This approach significantly advances AZIBs toward practical, high&#8208;performance energy storage.

         <title>Transforming Crowded Coacervates into Multi&#8208;Compartmental Hybrid Microreactors for Practical Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicompartmental protocell models with complex architectures are constructed through a versatile structural transformation from membrane&#8208;free coacervates to robust hybrid microreactors, which enables spatiotemporal regulation of individual biocatalysis or divergent cascades with high reaction efficiency.








Abstract
Advancing the design and construction of artificial protocells with organized complexity, diverse functionality and practical applicability is urgently demanded in vitro synthetic biology and bioengineering but remains a grand challenge. Here, we present a versatile Pickering emulsion&#8208;based encapsulation approach to transform membraneless coacervate compartments into robust multicompartmental hybrid microreactors, which concurrently assimilate the expected attributes of hierarchically compartmentalized structure, molecularly crowded environment, selectively permeable ability and mechanically reinforced stability. Single or multiple biological and non&#8208;biological catalytic species can be spatially sequestered in specific domains of the hybrid microreactor, enabling spatiotemporal regulation of individual biocatalysis or divergent cascades with high reaction efficiency. As proof of concept, we not only demonstrate the markedly improved catalytic activity (1.9&#8211;9.2 folds enhancement), strengthened thermostability (up to 100&#160;&#176;C) and impressive long&#8208;term durability (1600&#160;h) of the obtained microreactors in lipase&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of alcohol medicine intermediates, but also showcase their superior capability in processing chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade of ketone hydrogenation&#8208;kinetic resolution and multi&#8208;enzymatic cascade of oxidation reactions. Macromolecular crowding and confinement effects arising from structural features of the hybrid microreactors are identified as the dominant factors for the promotion of catalytic functions.

         <title>Heteroporous Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Framework Cathode for High&#8208;Rate&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on heteroporous D&#8208;A engineering was proposed towards a COF (HDA&#8208;COF) with optimized &#963;e and &#963;ions through Schiff&#8208;base reaction. This heteroporous D&#8208;A engineering endows HDA&#8208;COF with mass transport enhancement and D&#8208;A electron transport promotion to obtain higher active sites availability. Thereby, it can be regarded as advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with high &#963;ions and &#963;e to achieve high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a conspicuous porous material, harvest great promise for rechargeable batteries, owing to well&#8208;defined pore structure and structural precision. However, designing high&#8208;rate&#8208;capacity COF cathode by balancing ions diffusion kinetics and electron transport kinetics based on the framework and pore chemistry remains a challenge. Here, a heteroporous donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering is proposed to design one novel kind of COF (HDA&#8208;COF) with optimized electronic conductivity (&#963;e) and ionic conductivity (&#963;ions). The heteroporous D&#8208;A framework featuring with triangle&#8208;like micropores for promoted electron transport and enlarged hexagonal&#8208;like mesopores for facilitated ions diffusion rate. HDA&#8208;COF demonstrates high compatibility with high &#963;e and &#963;ions verified by the combination of experimental results and theoretical calculations. Notably, HDA&#8208;COF displays favorable fast&#8208;charging performance with 104 mAh g&#8722;1 (277&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, 5 A g&#8722;1) and shorter charge time (75&#160;s), maintaining steadily cycling for 1000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Also, it delivers high discharge capacity of 259&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (627&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, 0.05&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). This work offers in&#8208;depth insights in constructing high&#8208;rate&#8208;capacity COF cathode by synchronously optimizing &#963;e and &#963;ions within a heteroporous D&#8208;A engineering.

         <title>Cyclometalating Ligand Affords NIR Absorption in Ruthenium Complexes for Type&#8208;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing a cyclometalating ligand, we report &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP, which exhibits (metal and ligand)&#8211;ligand charge transfer, resulting in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region absorption. The TPABP ligand, with its strong electron&#8208;donating capacity, promotes Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT), rendering it highly effective under hypoxic conditions. This work provides design principles for cyclometalated Ru (II) complexes with NIR absorption for Type&#8208;I PDT.








Abstract
The development of NIR photosensitizers (PSs) based on Ru complexes with Type&#8208;I process holds substantial promise for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer, though this breakthrough remains unrealized to date. Herein, a pair of cyclometalated Ru enantiomers, [&#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;dqpy&#8208;TPABP]Cl (dqpy: 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine; TPABP: 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)triphenylamine) (&#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP), were synthesized and evaluated. These complexes exhibit strong Ru(d) and TPABP(&#960;) &#8594; dqpy(&#960;*) charge transfer ((metal and ligand)&#8211;ligand charge transfer; ML&#8211;LCT) absorption at &#8764;640&#160;nm, with an extended absorption tail reaching up to 800&#160;nm. Moreover, the TPABP ligand, with its strong electron&#8208;rich capacity, contributes to T1 formation, which increases the electron transfer possibility in the triplet state and promotes Type&#8208;I PDT, making it highly effective for killing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Further encapsulating &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP into polymeric nanoparticles results in high tumor inhibition efficiency (&gt;85%) and causes a strong tumoricidal effect and inhibits lung metastasis of breast tumors under 700&#160;nm light irradiation, thus offering a new strategy for developing NIR Ru complexes for anticancer treatment through the design of cyclometalating ligand.

Moreover, the TPABP ligand, with its strong electron-rich capacity, contributes to T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formation, which increases the electron transfer possibility in the triplet state and promotes Type-I PDT, making it highly effective for killing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Further encapsulating &#923;/&#916;-Ru-TPABP into polymeric nanoparticles results in high tumor inhibition efficiency (&amp;gt;85%) and causes a strong tumoricidal effect and inhibits lung metastasis of breast tumors under 700&#160;nm light irradiation, thus offering a new strategy for developing NIR Ru complexes for anticancer treatment through the design of cyclometalating ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Host&#8211;Guest Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Antimony Halide Enables Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimony halide&#8208;based emitters constructed using a tailor&#8208;made host&#8208;guest structure demonstrated simultaneously improved exciton radiative recombination and charge injection efficiency. The resulting orange LEDs achieve a record&#8208;high EQE of 6.47%, maximum brightness up to 6689&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and large&#8208;area emitting area up to 900 mm2 with uniform luminescence, representing the best performance among the antimony halide systems reported to date.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic antimony (Sb) halides are garnering increasing interest for lead&#8208;free perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), but the non&#8208;radiative recombination and poor charge transport are hard&#8208;treat case to restrict their electroluminescent performance. Here we developed efficient Sb halide LEDs based on the tailor&#8208;made host&#8208;guest (Ph4P)2SbCl5 (Ph4P&#160;=&#160;tetraphenylphosphonium) emitters that enable good luminescence and charge transport properties simultaneously. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the self&#8208;trapped excitons triggered by excited&#8208;state structural deformation were localized in spatial&#8208;confined [SbCl5]2&#8722; polyhedrons, generating a high photoluminescence quantum yield (96.8%). The host&#8211;guest (Ph4P)2SbCl5 emitter with 35DCzPPy (3,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl) pyridine) host shows an enhanced radiative recombination, rooting in the type&#8208;I energy level configuration and efficient energy transfer between 35DCzPPy and (Ph4P)2SbCl5. The 35DCzPPy with delocalized molecular orbital enhances the electrical properties of emitters, which balances the charge transport/injection in devices. These benefits result in efficient Sb halide LEDs with a record&#8208;high luminance of 6689&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and external quantum efficiency of 6.47%. Moreover, large&#8208;area LEDs with an emitting area up to 900 mm2 were demonstrated with uniform emission. This work provides meaningful insights into reaching high&#8208;performance metal halide LEDs towards future practical applications.

         <title>Olefin Ligand Metathesis for Colloidal Emissive Nanocrystals with Enhanced Stability and Photosensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefin metathesis transforms original ligands on colloidal perovskite nanocrystals into metathesized ligands featuring dual anchoring groups, shortened chains, and exposed alkenes at the outermost ligand shell. The stronger binding and reduced conformational entropy enhance colloidal stability, while the exposed alkenes improve photosensitivity, enabling high&#8208;resolution pattern formation under reduced UV exposure.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution patterning of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) is essential for next&#8208;generation display technologies, yet conventional approaches relying on exogenous photosensitive ligands or additives often compromise optical properties and colloidal stability. Here, we present a nondestructive ligand modification strategy based on olefin metathesis, in which original oleic acid and oleylamine ligands are converted into metathesized ligands featuring dual anchoring groups and shortened chains. This structural transformation enhances colloidal stability through stronger chelation and reduced conformational entropy of possible ligand configurations. The removal of sterically hindering hydrocarbon chains exposes reactive alkene moieties, enhancing the photosensitivity of PNCs. The resulting metathesized PNCs (PNC&#8208;M) exhibit excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) retention (&gt;93% after 3 weeks) and strong resistance to structural degradation under ambient conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the strengthened surface&#8211;ligand interactions in PNC&#8208;M, consistent with the experimentally observed structural robustness. Furthermore, PNC&#8208;M enables efficient direct optical lithography at substantially reduced UV doses via alkene polymerization and hydrothiolation, clearly outperforming pristine PNCs (PNC&#8208;P). This strategy offers a general, nondestructive ligand engineering method for various emissive nanocrystals, including II&#8211;VI and III&#8211;V quantum dots, and facilitates high&#8208;resolution lithography under reduced UV exposure by leveraging the enhanced photosensitivity imparted by olefin ligand metathesis.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Precise Control of Stacking Configurations in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;assisted precise modulation Zn&#9472;N coordination can control AA and ABC stacking in 2D COFs, enabling enhanced light absorption, charge transport, and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which reveals critical metal&#8208;solvent&#8208;framework interactions and stacking&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationships for advanced photocatalysts design.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts due to their high surface areas and precisely tunable physicochemical properties. However, it remains a significant challenge to precisely control over interlayer stacking configurations in 2D COFs, which critically influence charge carrier transport and consequently determine catalytic efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent&#8208;driven strategy to precisely regulate the interlayer stacking configurations of metal&#8208;incorporated 2D COFs, successfully achieving both AA eclipsed (COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA) and ABC staggered (COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC) configurations. Notably, by modulating the coordination interactions between solvent 1&#8208;butanol and Zn2+ (within the COFs), the interactions between the Zn2+ and nitrogen atoms (from imine bonds, pyridine, and triazine units) can be precisely tuned, which leads to the formation of AA or ABC stacked 2D COFs. Interestingly, the ABC&#8208;stacked COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC exhibited an extended light absorption and superior charge migration/separation efficiency than those of COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA. As a result, when coupled with Pt co&#8208;catalysts, COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC achieved a high hydrogen evolution rate up to 10.92&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, representing a &#8764;3.5&#8208;fold enhancement over COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA (3.12&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides a fundamental insight into the stacking&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationships in COFs, paving the way for the rational design of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Mechanistically Engineered Heterojunction From Spent LFP for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;guided upcycling strategy converts spent LFP into a coronal NiO/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/LFP(III) heterostructure, achieving nanoscale surface activation for electrocatalysis. The engineered p&#8211;n interface enables lattice oxygen catalysis, while the PO43&#8722;&#8208;rich matrix ensures Cl&#8722; resistance, delivering high OER performance and a six&#8208;fold cost&#8208;efficiency gain over conventional recycling.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale retirement of LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries demands sustainable strategies for material recovery and functional repurposing. However, the inert micrometer&#8208;scale morphology and electronically stable lattice of spent LFP hinder its direct catalytic reuse. Herein, we present a structure&#8208;guided strategy that upcycles spent LFP into a high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Mild air oxidation transforms LFP into a phosphate&#8208;rich Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (LFP(III)) framework decorated with coronal &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots. This reconfiguration preserves the bulk structure while achieving nanoscale surface activation. Subsequent spatially selective growth of NiO on &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 yields a well&#8208;defined p&#8208;NiO/n&#8208;Fe2O3 heterojunction, driving interfacial charge redistribution and promoting formation of catalytically active NiOOH species under operational conditions. In situ Raman and XPS analyses reveal that the heterostructure facilitates lattice oxygen participation via an accelerated lattice oxygen mechanism, while the phosphate&#8208;rich LFP(III) matrix imparts strong electrostatic repulsion toward Cl&#8722;, effectively suppressing halide&#8208;induced corrosion. The resulting LFP(III)/NiO catalyst achieves low overpotentials of 268 and 292&#160;mV at 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in chloride&#8208;containing electrolytes, along with excellent durability. Techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates a six&#8208;fold improvement in cost&#8208;efficiency over conventional recycling. This work establishes a mechanistically informed and energy&#8208;efficient upcycling strategy that bridges battery waste management with functional catalyst design, advancing both sustainable materials chemistry and water&#8208;splitting technologies.

Herein, we present a structure-guided strategy that upcycles spent LFP into a high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Mild air oxidation transforms LFP into a phosphate-rich Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LFP(III)) framework decorated with coronal &#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanodots. This reconfiguration preserves the bulk structure while achieving nanoscale surface activation. Subsequent spatially selective growth of NiO on &#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yields a well-defined p-NiO/n-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction, driving interfacial charge redistribution and promoting formation of catalytically active NiOOH species under operational conditions. In situ Raman and XPS analyses reveal that the heterostructure facilitates lattice oxygen participation via an accelerated lattice oxygen mechanism, while the phosphate-rich LFP(III) matrix imparts strong electrostatic repulsion toward Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, effectively suppressing halide-induced corrosion. The resulting LFP(III)/NiO catalyst achieves low overpotentials of 268 and 292&#160;mV at 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, in chloride-containing electrolytes, along with excellent durability. Techno-economic analysis indicates a six-fold improvement in cost-efficiency over conventional recycling. This work establishes a mechanistically informed and energy-efficient upcycling strategy that bridges battery waste management with functional catalyst design, advancing both sustainable materials chemistry and water-splitting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptidic Tryptophan Halogenation by a Promiscuous Flavin&#8208;Dependent Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ChlH, a flavin&#8208;dependent tryptophan halogenase, was reconstituted in vitro and capable of modifying a wide array of diverse peptidic substrates. This suggests a potential use in the biocatalytic production of chlorinated peptides.








Abstract
Amino acids undergo numerous enzymatic modifications. However, the broad applicability of amino acid&#8208;modifying enzymes for synthetic purposes is limited by narrow substrate scope and often unknown regulatory or accessory factor requirements. Here, we characterize ChlH, a flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase (FDH) from the chlorolassin biosynthetic gene cluster. Unlike characterized peptide&#8208;modifying FDHs, which are limited to either specifically modified peptides or the termini of linear peptides, ChlH halogenates internal Trp residues of linear peptides, as well as N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal Trp. Scanning mutagenesis of the substrate peptide ChlA revealed Trp was tolerated by ChlH at nearly every position. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the importance of a C&#8208;terminal motif in ChlA and provided insight into the lack of Trp14 chlorination in native chlorolassin. Furthermore, halogenation of disparate ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) precursor peptides, pharmacologically relevant peptides, and special examples of internal Trp within proteins was achieved using wild&#8208;type ChlH. A rapid cell&#8208;free biosynthetic assay provided insight into ChlH's preferences. In contrast to characterized FDHs, ChlH halogenates diverse peptide sequences, and we predict this promiscuity may find utility in the modification of additional peptide and protein substrates of biotechnological value.

         <title>Control Over S(VI) Stereogenicity for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Sulfonimidoyl Derivatives by Isothiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Covalent Activation of Sulfur(VI) Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent activation of racemic sulfonimidoyl chlorides via an isothiourea&#8208;derived sulfonimidoyl intermediate is disclosed for the highly enantioselective synthesis of S(VI)&#8208;stereogenic sulfonimidates. The enantioenriched sulfonimidates serve as linchpin intermediates for efficient sulfur(VI)&#8208;phenolate exchange in the construction of a wide range of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides.








Abstract
In contrast to the notable advancements focusing on the preparation of optically enriched S(IV) frameworks in recent years, achieving catalyst stereocontrol over S(VI) stereogenicity to generate chiral S(VI) scaffolds remains a largely underexplored challenge. Herein, we document a new activation mode of isothiourea organocatalysis for the highly enantioselective synthesis of S(VI)&#8208;chiral sulfonimidates. This method involves the covalent activation of racemic S(VI) sulfonimidoyl chlorides through the formation of a pivotal isothiourea&#8208;bound sulfonimidoyl intermediate. The newly formed S(VI)&#8208;based isothiourea reactive species further governs the subsequent asymmetric S&#9472;O bond formation to afford the chiral sulfonimidate products with high yields and selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the facile inversion of the tetrasubstituted S(VI) stereogenic center assisted by the chiral catalyst is crucial in the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) process. Notably, distinct from the extensively studied isothiourea catalysis focused on the activation of &#8220;C&#8221;&#8208;centered substrates, our method introduces a novel S&#8208;atom activation approach, enabling the efficient construction of S(VI) stereogenic centers. Furthermore, the obtained enantioenriched sulfonimidates serve as linchpin intermediates in efficient sulfur&#8208;phenolate exchange for rapid access to diverse S(VI)&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides, and their derivatives, with notable antimicrobial activity against various plant pathogens.

         <title>Precisely Bonded Fe&#9472;Cu Diatomic Sites with Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged Coordination on Hollow C3N4 Spheres for Efficient C&#9472;N Coupling and Selective Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow g&#8208;C3N4 spheres anchored with Fe&#9472;Cu diatomic sites enable efficient photocatalytic CO2 and N2 co&#8208;reduction via selective adsorption and synergistic C&#9472;N coupling. The Fe site activates CO2, while the Cu site stabilizes N2, facilitating *NCON intermediate formation. Atomic&#8208;level Fe&#9472;Cu coordination enhances charge separation, light harvesting, and multireactant activation for sustainable urea synthesis.








Abstract
The photocatalytic synthesis of urea from CO2 and N2 co&#8208;reduction presents a promising alternative to the conventional energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface often limits selectivity and yield. Here, we designed hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) spheres, which serve as a high surface area scaffold for precise anchoring of Fe&#9472;Cu diatomic sites. Hollow architecture enhances light harvesting via inner&#8208;scattering effects and charge separation. Each Fe&#9472;Cu site is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms, forming N2&#9472;Fe1&#9472;Cu1&#9472;N2 /C3N4 DAC (hereafter referred to as FeCu/CN), which enables cooperative activation of CO2 and N2, in contrast to monodispersed diatomic (Fe+Cu/CN), and single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe/CN, Cu/CN). The FeCu/CN bonded pairs serve as highly efficient active centers, facilitating the synergistic adsorption and activation of multiple reactants. Specifically, during the co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2, the Fe1 site preferentially adsorbs and activates CO2, while bonded Cu1 sites stabilize N2 on FeCu/CN and enable synergistic C&#9472;N coupling through the formation of *NCON intermediates. As a result, the FeCu/CN achieves an exceptional urea yield of 7.40&#160;mg&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with a 38.58% selectivity under visible light irradiation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atomic&#8208;level coordination in multireactants and offer insights into the C&#9472;N coupling for value&#8208;added products using CO2 and N2 as feedstock.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis from Plastic Waste and Ammonia via C&#9472;N Bond Construction Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative photocatalytic strategy was reported for sustainable formamide (FA) synthesis via C&#9472;N bond construction from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste. Specifically, Pt1Au/TiO2 catalyst achieves a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 alongside concurrent H2 evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal that single&#8208;atom Pt and Au nanoparticles synergize charge separation, facilitating radical&#8208;mediated photocatalytic redox efficiency. 








Abstract
Photocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into value&#8208;added chemicals represents a sustainable route for plastic valorization. However, previous studies have solely focused on generating oxygenated compounds through intramolecular C&#9472;O bond transformations. Achieving heteroatom&#8208;containing important chemicals via intermolecular coupling reactions is still challenging. Herein, we report the first example of the direct photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) with ammonia to produce formamide (FA) and H2 over a Pt1Au/TiO2 catalyst. Pt1Au/TiO2 delivers a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, as well as H2 evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Photoelectrochemical analyses, including time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reveal that monatomic Pt sites can effectively trap electrons, while Au nanoparticles act as hole sinks, thereby synergistically enhancing charge separation efficiency. Mechanistic investigations via in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) elucidate the reaction pathway: EG undergoes hole&#8208;mediated oxidation to yield an aldehyde intermediate, which is subsequently attacked nucleophilically by hole&#8208;derived &#8226;NH2, inducing sequential C&#9472;C bond cleavage and C&#9472;N bond formation. This work provides critical mechanistic insights for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value heteroatom&#8208;containing chemicals from plastic waste.

&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into value-added chemicals represents a sustainable route for plastic valorization. However, previous studies have solely focused on generating oxygenated compounds through intramolecular C&#9472;O bond transformations. Achieving heteroatom-containing important chemicals via intermolecular coupling reactions is still challenging. Herein, we report the first example of the direct photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of PET-derived ethylene glycol (EG) with ammonia to produce formamide (FA) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over a Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivers a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Photoelectrochemical analyses, including time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reveal that monatomic Pt sites can effectively trap electrons, while Au nanoparticles act as hole sinks, thereby synergistically enhancing charge separation efficiency. Mechanistic investigations via in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) elucidate the reaction pathway: EG undergoes hole-mediated oxidation to yield an aldehyde intermediate, which is subsequently attacked nucleophilically by hole-derived &#8226;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, inducing sequential C&#9472;C bond cleavage and C&#9472;N bond formation. This work provides critical mechanistic insights for the sustainable synthesis of high-value heteroatom-containing chemicals from plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] Cycloadditions of Furan Ortho&#8208;Quinodimethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition of furan ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes is presented. The reaction proceeds in good yields and with high enantioselectivities allowing for the formation of novel classes of cyclooctanoids. DFT calculations point to an intriguing mechanism, where the stereochemical outcome is attributed to protonation of the catalyst&#8208;bound intermediate in the stereo&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
The enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition for the construction of cyclooctanoids is a challenging transformation in organic chemistry. Herein, we present the first organocatalytic enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition of furan ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes, activated by dearomatization of the heteroaromatic compound, which thereby allows for the cycloaddition with dienes. The [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition is catalyzed by a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine in combination with a chiral phosphoric acid and a carboxylic acid affording cyclooctanoids isolated as a single diastereoisomer in good yields and with up to 94% ee. This reaction concept allows for the formation of cyclooctanoids without benzofusion, as demonstrated by oxidative opening of the furan ring. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism for the [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition point to a stepwise process. Surprisingly, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is attributed to protonation of the two organocatalyst&#8208;bound cyclooctanoid intermediates leading to a preferred set&#8208;up for catalyst elimination to account for the absolute configuration of the cyclooctanoid.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe with nitric oxide (NO) and acidity dual&#8208;stimuli responsiveness, permitting highly specific near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) with reduced background interference and minimal therapeutic side effects.








Abstract
The development of activatable optical probes has proved to be a promising approach to improve the accuracy of phototheranostics. However, most such probes are usually responsive to single pathological factor and visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I light upon activation, which restricts the theranostic specificity and tissue penetration depth, respectively. Herein, we develop a nitric oxide (NO) and acidity dual&#8208;stimuli responsive semiconducting polymer nanoprobe for activatable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Specifically, a weak electron acceptor (benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;5,6&#8208;diamine, BT2NH2) has been conjugated with diketopyrrolopyrrole to construct the pathological factor&#8208;sensitive molecular probe. Upon the coactivation of NO and acidity, the BT2NH2 is oxidized to generate a strong electron acceptor (5H&#8208;[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;f]&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, BT3N), leading to the absorption enhancement in the NIR&#8208;II region. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate the successful activation of the probe toward activated macrophages, various cancer cells, drug&#8208;induced liver injury, and breast cancer to output enhanced NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic and photothermal signals, permitting highly specific PAI and PTT with reduced background interference and minimal therapeutic side effects. By virtue of the improved specificity and superior penetration depth, the dual&#8208;stimuli responsive NIR&#8208;II probe has broad prospects for precise visualization and intervention toward NO and acid&#8208;associated pathological and physiological events from deep tissues.

         <title>Toward Bimetallic Nanowire Arrays with Controlled Compositions Using Block Copolymer Films: The Interplay Between Metal Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;impregnation of block copolymer films enables the creation of ordered arrays of bimetallic nanowires (NWs). The dependence of the NW composition on the feed revealed direct and indirect modes of mutual influence between the metal precursors stemming from the types of interactions involved. The insights gained now enable to design and fabricate arrays of multimetallic nanostructures with both complex morphologies and controlled compositions.








Abstract
Metallic nanowire (NW) arrays are promising components for nanotechnology owing to their elongated, continuous, and directional structure. Bimetallic NWs present synergistic effects that are advantageous for applications in catalysis and magnetism. Yet, creating bimetallic NW arrays requires concomitant control over composition and organization. Block copolymer films, which exhibit periodic arrays of nano&#8208;domains, provide templates that satisfy this requirement. Impregnating the film using two metal precursors followed by plasma treatment enabled us to prepare NW arrays with different bimetallic compositions. The NW composition was found to depend on the composition of the impregnation solution in a nontrivial way, which was strongly influenced by the type of metals used. Studying the behavior of three model metal pairs unraveled different characteristic co&#8208;impregnation behaviors, which we could associate with metal&#8208;ligand and metal&#8208;metal interactions. The insights gained in this study allow us to create bimetallic NW arrays with compositions tailored to the desired properties.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Active, Irreversible Covalent Inhibitors Targeting a Surface&#8208;Exposed Non&#8208;Catalytic Lysine on Aurora a Kinase by Using Squarate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel class of covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) targeting surface&#8208;exposed, non&#8208;catalytic lysines by using chemically tunable squarate warheads. The optimized AL8 achieved selective, irreversible inhibition of endogenous Aurora A kinase in cancer cells and with negligible off&#8208;targets. This work establishes a general strategy for modification of weakly nucleophilic, non&#8208;catalytic lysines through rational design of different squarate&#8208;based aminophiles, thus expanding the toolbox of targeted kinase drug discovery. 








Abstract
Targeting surface&#8208;exposed lysines in kinases through covalent modification presents a major challenge due to their high pKa and inherently low reactivity. While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP&#8208;binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface&#8208;exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell&#8208;active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface&#8208;exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well&#8208;known lysine&#8208;reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO2F, and OSO2F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates&#8217; superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low&#8208;reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, AL8 emerged as the first&#8208;in&#8208;class squarate&#8208;based, cell&#8208;active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long&#8208;residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine&#8208;reactive CKIs. Our finding has established squarate&#8208;containing ligands as a unique and readily tunable platform for covalent modification of surface&#8208;exposed, non&#8208;catalytic lysines in targeted kinase drug discovery.

Under Ir&#8208;catalyzed conditions, N&#8208;2&#176;&#8208;alkyl or N&#8208;3&#176;&#8208;alkyl substituents of diverse tertiary aryl amides can be exchanged with the ortho&#8208;aryl C&#9472;H bond of the aromatic unit. Related processes allow the intermolecular transfer of N&#8208;2&#176;&#8208;alkyl substituents, providing a convenient means of introducing difficult&#8208;to&#8208;install ortho&#8208;alkyl units.

These alkyl transfer processes employ a homochiral diphosphonite ligand, and this enforces notable levels of enantioconvergency for non&#8208;stereodefined 2&#176;&#8208;alkyl substituents.

         <title>Phospholipid&#8208;Drug Conjugates Self&#8208;Organized into Well&#8208;Defined Supramolecular Nanotubes for Efficient Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful installation of planar camptothecin (CPT) into PC&#8208;type phospholipids enables the controlled self&#8208;assembly of these molecules into well&#8208;defined supramolecular nanotubes with varying lengths. We highlight the potential of phospholipid nanotubes as a versatile platform for targeted chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical applications.








Abstract
Controlled self&#8208;organization of amphiphilic phospholipid camptothecin (CPT) conjugates (named PCCs) selectively forms supramolecular nanotubes with varying lengths and polydispersity. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanisms governing PCC assembly, demonstrating that &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions derived from the planar, conjugated structure of CPT play a pivotal role in nanotube formation. Precise modulation of the hydrophobic characteristics of PCC linkers enables fine&#8208;tuning of &#960;&#8208;stacking strength, thereby controlling the length of the nanotubes, ranging from the nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale. With exceptionally high drug&#8208;loading efficiencies (43.9% to 52.3%) and stimulus&#8208;responsive release properties, the optimized PCC nanotubes exhibit tumor&#8208;selective cytotoxicity of 20&#8208; to 50&#8208;fold greater potency against tumor cells compared to normal cells. Furthermore, PCC nanotubes of intermediate length (0.3&#8211;0.5&#160;&#181;m) display prolonged circulation times than conventional liposomes, resulting in enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting and therapeutic efficacy.

         <title>Poly(benzoxazine)&#8208;Based Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries With Ultralong Lifespans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel poly(benzoxazine&#8208;propylene&#8208;oxide)&#8208;based gel electrolyte was developed. After ring&#8208;opening curing, the benzoxazine polymer demonstrates a dual crosslinking system comprising both chemical and physical cross&#8208;links, showing exceptional electrolyte adsorption capacity and retention stability. The synergistic interaction between the extended propylene&#8208;oxide chain segments and the electrolyte solution contributes to its high ionic conductivity. The cross&#8208;linked structure significantly enhances electrochemical stability, rendering the electrolyte highly suitable for application in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with ultralong lifespans.








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a desirable candidate for high&#8208;safety lithium batteries but is still plagued by the dynamic fluctuations of liquid electrolyte components, which induce localized fluid aggregation or leakage, ultimately leading to performance instability or even degradation. Here, we develop a novel poly(benzoxazine&#8208;propylene&#8208;oxide)&#8208;based GPE, achieving superior electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously. Through molecular architecture design, the strategic incorporation of long&#8208;chain propylene&#8208;oxide segments and amide functionalities into the benzoxazine backbone endows the polymer matrix with enhanced lithium&#8208;ion transport capability. Catalyst&#8208;free thermal curing triggers oxazine ring&#8208;opening polymerization, constructing three&#8208;dimensional chemically cross&#8208;linked network architecture, generating abundant hydrogen bonds. The synergistic interaction between chemical crosslinking and dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding enabled exceptional electrolyte uptake (600%&#160;w/w within 5&#160;min) coupled with effective solvent immobilization. The incorporated long&#8208;chain propylene&#8208;oxide segments exhibited synergistic solvation effects with carbonate solvents, enabling superior ionic conductivity (9.62 mS cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C). The Li||Li symmetric cells based on PBz&#8208;PO&#8208;GPE 2000 operated for 3000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and LiFePO4||Li full cells delivered 140.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 initial discharge capacity at 2&#160;C rate, near&#8208;unity coulombic efficiency, and 70.5% capacity retention after 1800 cycles. This multiscale design of GPE provides an effective strategy for electrolyte exploration in high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Orthogonal Control of Lattice Oxygen Activation and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Suppression via &#8220;Molecular Gates&#8221; for High&#8208;Efficiency Nitrile Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the principle of biological compartmentalization, Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), a dual&#8208;group molecule with phosphine oxide and alkylamine groups, is introduced as &#8220;molecular gates&#8221; to achieve orthogonal control over lattice oxygen activation and oxygen evolution reaction suppression, and the high&#8208;current nitrile electrosynthesis with unprecedented efficiency and stability is demonstrated.








Abstract
A fundamental barrier to industrial electrosynthesis is the inescapable trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity at high current densities, where parasitic reactions overwhelm the desired interfacial chemistry. Here, we introduce a bioinspired interfacial decoupling strategy using hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) to resolve this challenge for nitrile electrosysthesis. The activation of lattice oxygen for substrate dehydrogenation via metal&#8208;ligand charge redistribution, and the suppression of OH&#8722;&#8208;driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via electrostatic shielding by hydrophobic alkyl chains are concurrently controlled. As a result, we achieved simultaneously high activity (1.37&#160;V @300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), near&#8208;unity selectivity (93.3% Faradaic efficiency (FE)), and pharmaceutical&#8208;grade purity for propionitrile production. Further reinforced by exceptional stability (&gt;300&#160;h at industrially relevant current densities), a record production rate (143.86&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1), and &#8764;30% energy reduction, the system significantly outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. Furthermore, this electrolyte&#8208;catalyst co&#8208;optimization strategy proves universal across primary/secondary amines, offering a blueprint for sustainable chemical manufacturing beyond fossil&#8208;fueled processes.

         <title>Strong Dipole Moments and Increased Charge Transfer in Polymer&#8208;Based Solid Electrolyte Enable Wide&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composite polymer electrolytes (CSEs) were prepared by adding POP&#8208;SO3H@Zn(NO3)2 fillers to PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. The strong dipole moment and accelerated charge transfer properties in POP&#8208;SO3H catalyzed the decomposition of NO3&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; and accelerated the migration of Li+. At the same time, LiF/Li3N/LiZn&#8208;rich SEI are formed to comprehensively improve the battery performance.








Abstract
The development of solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) using lithium and nitrate salts represents a promising approach to enhancing the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the inherent stability of lithium and nitrate salts often results in incomplete decomposition, leading to the formation of inhomogeneous SEI that degrade battery performance. In this study, a strong dipole moment and increased charge transfer strategy are used, which can effectively catalyze the decomposition of NO3&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; and accelerate the migration of Li+, as well as the formation of Li3N&#8208;LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Li/CSEs/LFP batteries demonstrated excellent cycling stability over a wide temperature range (30&#8211;100 &#176;C) and across various charge/discharge rates (1C&#8208;5C). Notably, pouch cells with high loading of Ni90Co5Mn5 and LFP exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance and safety. This work presents a strong dipole moment and increased charge transfer strategy for optimizing polymer electrolytes, providing new insights into optimizing the performance of LMBs.

         <title>Isolable Arylphosphinidene Chalcogenides and their Radical Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolable arylphosphinidene chalcogenides (Ar&#9472;P&#9552;E; E = S, Se, Te) were synthesized and fully characterized, which exhibit P&#9552;E double bonds and rich reactivity at the P&#9552;E units, including [4+2] cycloaddition, oxidation, and X&#9472;H (X = O, N) bond activation. Their one&#8208;electron reduction furnishes persistent radical anions, representing unprecedented isolable pnictinidene chalcogenide&#8208;based radicals.








Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of isolable arylphosphinidene chalcogenides (Ar&#9472;P&#9552;E; 2 (E = S), 3 (E = Se), 4 (E = Te)), prepared via chalcogen atom transfer from tris(dimethylamino)phosphine chalcogenides (Me2N)3P&#9552;E (E = S, Se, Te) to a phosphanorcaradiene. The compounds crystallize at ambient temperature and feature P&#9552;E double bonds, as confirmed by structural and computational studies. Compounds 2&#8211;4 undergo [4+2] cycloaddition with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene to furnish six&#8208;membered heterocyclic products, demonstrating their &#960;&#8208;bond reactivity. Compound 3 reacts with mesityl azide to afford a P(V) compound. Additionally, 2 and 3 are capable of oxidative cleavage of O&#9472;H and N&#9472;H bonds in H2O and NH3, respectively. Furthermore, 2&#8211;4 can be one&#8208;electron reduced to their corresponding radical anion salts, which are unprecedented radical anions of pnictinidene chalcogenides isolable in the condensed phase.

         <title>Micellar Brush&#8208;Directed Oxophilic Zr&#8208;Doped RuO2 Nanoarrays for Durable Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;rich micellar brushes guide the dense accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr&#8308;&#8314; ions through coordination interactions and enable the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO2 nanoarray after calcination. The oxophilic Zr stabilizes the lattice oxygen and creates electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites, which facilitate the adsorption of H2O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER performance.








Abstract
Although being considered as a promising alternative to iridium&#8208;based catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE), cost&#8208;effective ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based anodic catalysts generally lack sufficient stability for harsh operating conditions. Here, we developed a facile method to fabricate erect nanoarrays of interweaved nanorods of zirconium&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (ZrRuO2) for long&#8208;term industrial&#8208;level oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This is accomplished by the spontaneous and abundant accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr4+ ions in pyridine&#8208;rich micellar brushes through coordination interactions, followed by direct calcination in air. The uniform dispersion of Ru and Zr precursors promotes the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO2 nanoarray and the formation of Zr&#8208;OBRI&#8208;Ru bridging oxygen structures. The oxophilic Zr strengthens the stability of the lattice oxygen and prevents its participation in OER. Meanwhile, it also leads to electron deficiency of the bridging Ru sites and facilitates the adsorption of H2O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER stability and activity. Notably, the nanoarray architecture synergistically restricts the voltage loss caused by electron and mass transport. Consequently, the ZrRuO2&#8208;nanoarrays enabled a remarkably low PEM&#8208;WE potential of 1.64&#160;V at 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 with a negligible degradation rate (26 &#181;V h&#8722;1, over 1000&#160;h).

         <title>Regioselective Separation and Extraction of Polyalkylthiophene by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel MOF&#8208;based method for extracting high&#8208;regioregularity poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from crude mixtures. Nanopore threading&#8208;based adsorption enables recognition of erroneous head&#8211;head linkages, allowing precise isolation of regioregular P3HT. Both chromatography and batch processes demonstrate regioregularity&#8208;dependent sorting, introducing a new paradigm in polymer purification.








Abstract
Here, we report a novel method for selectively extracting high&#8208;regioregularity (RR) poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from crude mixtures using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as nanoporous separation media. This approach leverages a kinetically driven &#8220;threading&#8221; mechanism in one&#8208;dimensional MOF channels, which discriminate subtle differences in the bonding patterns, e.g., head&#8208;head and head&#8208;tail linkages, in the main chain. By employing both MOF column chromatography and batch&#8208;scale separation techniques, higher RR fractions of P3HT were readily extracted from a crude mixture containing lower RR fractions.

         <title>Umpolung Activation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;catalyzed umpolung of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) aldehydes enables nucleophilic cycloaddition with carbonyls and imines to form bicyclic lactones and lactams. The resulting oxa&#8208; and aza&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane products can be further transformed into valuable rigid 3D scaffolds, offering a simple and versatile approach to access new chemical space with potential applications in medicinal chemistry. 








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) has predominantly been explored as an electrophile or radical acceptor owing to its inherent polarity. However, its reactivity as a nucleophile remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report an umpolung strategy that reverses the innate polarity of bicyclobutane aldehydes via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This transformation enables the construction of novel rigidified lactones and lactams via coupling with diverse electrophilic partners, including aldehydes, ketones, and imines. The synthetic versatility of this method highlights its potential for applications in medicinal chemistry by providing new building blocks with defined exit vectors.

The resulting oxa- and aza-bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane products can be further transformed into valuable rigid 3D scaffolds, offering a simple and versatile approach to access new chemical space with potential applications in medicinal chemistry. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) has predominantly been explored as an electrophile or radical acceptor owing to its inherent polarity. However, its reactivity as a nucleophile remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report an umpolung strategy that reverses the innate polarity of bicyclobutane aldehydes via N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This transformation enables the construction of novel rigidified lactones and lactams via coupling with diverse electrophilic partners, including aldehydes, ketones, and imines. The synthetic versatility of this method highlights its potential for applications in medicinal chemistry by providing new building blocks with defined exit vectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#8208;fused Heterocycles via Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative [2+2] Photocycloaddition of Indoles, Benzofurans, and Benzothiophenes with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach for the enantioselective [2+2] photocycloaddition dearomatization of indoles, benzothiophenes, and benzofurans with alkenes was developed. This method is characterized by the use of readily available Lewis acid catalysts and the broad diversity of substrates. A wide range of cyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines, dihydrobenzothiophenes, and dihydrobenzofurans were obtained with excellent yields and selectivities. 








Abstract
Cyclobutane&#8208;fused heterocycles are important motifs in biologically active molecules, yet their enantioselective synthesis remains a significant challenge. We report a broadly applicable and modular strategy for constructing these strained architectures through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative [2+2] photocycloaddition of indoles, benzofurans, and benzothiophenes with alkenes. The method employs a simple catalytic system based on commercially available rare&#8208;earth Lewis acids and chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(oxazoline) (PyBox) ligands. A wide array of heteroarenes and styrenes bearing diverse functional groups participate efficiently, delivering cyclobutane&#8208;fused products in up to 96% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, and &gt;99% ee. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and facile removal of the directing group to access functionalized amino acid derivatives. Mechanistic investigations, including ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8211;vis) spectroscopy, nonlinear effect studies, kinetic isotope effects, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that a triplet&#8208;state heteroarene engages in regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective C&#9472;C bond formation under mild photochemical conditions. This study highlights the potential of excited&#8208;state Lewis acid catalysis in unlocking enantioselective dearomatization pathways for complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Rapid and Modular Access to All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Center&#8208;Containing 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes via Cyanocarbene Addition to Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described is a rare example of single&#8208;carbon insertion into the C&#9472;C bond of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using diazo&#8208;free donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) carbenes, which are generated in situ through reactions of ethynyl hypervalent iodine reagents with azides. This method is used for the synthesis of bridge&#8208;functionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs), including BCP&#8208;Sonidegib, which exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib.








Abstract
While 1,3&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have garnered considerable interest in medicinal chemistry as bioisosteres of para&#8208;substituted benzenes, the utilization of bridge&#8208;functionalized BCPs, especially those containing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers at the bridge&#8208;positions, in drug design has lagged behind. This is primarily due to the synthetic challenges associated with these scaffolds. Herein, we report the insertion of diazo&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor carbenes into the C&#9472;C bond of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs), enabling the rapid and modular synthesis of 1,2,2,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) bearing three all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers in up to 83% yield. This transformation is metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, operationally simple, and accomodates to a wide range of substrates. The decoration of bioactive molecules with 2,2&#8208;disubstituted BCP exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib, rendering this method highly practical and appealing. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with control experiments reveal that the reaction proceeds through a stepwise nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening/recyclization pathway, involving the reaction between the singlet carbene species and the BCB skeleton.

         <title>Synergistic Construction of In Situ Self&#8208;Polymerized Interface and Localized pH Buffer Zone for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional electrolyte pH buffer, valerolactam, was developed to stabilize the zinc anode, regulate interfacial pH, self&#8208;polymerize into a robust SEI layer, and suppress polyiodide shuttling, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical use is hindered by challenges such as Zn dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion, and polyiodide shuttle effect. In this study, valerolactam (VL) is employed as an organic pH buffer to address these issues. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that VL can regulate the electrolyte local pH while in situ polymerizing on the electrode surface to form a mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) protection layer, effectively suppressing HER, corrosion, and dendrite growth. Furthermore, the introduction of VL significantly regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, and disrupts the inherent hydrogen bonding network, which enhances the electrochemical performance. As a result, a symmetric cell with VL&#8208;based electrolyte achieves impressive longevity under ultra&#8208;high current density (4000 cycles at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), 4.3 times higher than the counterpart in the conventional ZnSO4 electrolytes. Moreover, VL effectively suppresses polyiodide shuttle effect and improves electrochemical stability. Consequently, Zn&#8211;I2 full battery exhibits exceptional cycling stability, sustaining 26&#160;500 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.4%. Therefore, organic pH buffering engineering has been proved to be a promising strategy for achieving dendrite&#8208;free, shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Ring Flipping in a Threaded Pillar[5]Arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical force was used to flip the orientation of a hydroquinone ring in a threaded pillar[5]arene to reach an elusive conformation not accessible to other methods of activation. The flipping can be suppressed with large substituents on the axle or the macrocycle. This unique molecular motion provides a new mechanism to dissipate mechanical energy with rotaxanes.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are popular macrocycles used in various supramolecular systems and materials due to their unique host&#8211;guest properties and ease of synthesis. Their pillar shape originates from the cyclic arrangement of methylene&#8208;bridged hydroquinone groups. They usually exist in one of two conformations where all the hydroquinone rings are oriented in the same direction (left or right), which is the source of their planar chirality. However, the controlled formation of pillar[n]arenes with intermediate conformations, for example, where only one ring is inverted, remains a challenge. Here we show how mechanical force can be used to reach this elusive conformation via the force&#8208;induced flipping of a single hydroquinone ring in a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based rotaxane. We show that the flipping motion can be controlled with the shape of the stopper and the axle, as well as with the nature of the pillar[5]arene substituents. This flipping behavior acts as a mechanical damper by slowing the scission of the polymer under tension. These results show how mechanical force can be used to access synthetically challenging supramolecular architectures, and we anticipate that this new dampening mechanism will prove useful in the formation of tougher materials.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Electrolyte Additives in a Dual&#8208;Salt System for High&#8208;Performance Four Electron Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries Across a Wide Temperature Range</title>

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;component electrolyte composed of Zn(ClO4)2, ZnCl2, glycerol (Gly), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) enables highly reversible four&#8208;electron aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries over a wide temperature range. Gly and PVA synergistically disrupt the intrinsic H&#8208;bond network and reduce the active water content. The PVA&#8208;containing dual&#8208;salt system effectively activates and stabilizes the I0/I+ redox reaction even under low chloride concentrations.








Abstract
Four&#8208;electron aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (4eAZIBs) with the successful I&#8722;/I0/I+ redox couples have emerged as a promising alternative for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high energy density. However, the practical application of these batteries, particularly in harsh environments, is hindered by the poor reversibility of Zn plating/stripping processes and the instability of I+ species in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Here, we design a multi&#8208;component hybrid electrolyte composed of Zn(ClO4)2, ZnCl2, glycerol (Gly), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to enable highly reversible operation of 4eAZIBs across a wide temperature range. Theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and spectral analyses reveal that Gly and PVA synergistically modify the intrinsic hydrogen bond network and effectively reduce the content of active water molecules, thereby enhancing the plating/stripping behavior of Zn2+, suppressing the hydrolysis of I+, and lowering the freezing point of the electrolyte. Moreover, the PVA&#8208;containing dual&#8208;salt system reduces the Gibbs free energy of the I&#8722;/I0/I+ reaction, facilitating enhanced stability of the 4eAZIBs even under low chloride concentrations. Consequently, the Zn||I2 full cells using this system exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 15&#160;000 cycles with a capacity attenuation of 0.15% per hundred cycles, and along with excellent performance over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 40&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Unlocks Photoluminescence Quantum Efficiency Enhancement in Eu2+&#8208;Doped Phosphors via Bond Angle Variance Index</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design and quantitatively prediction of high&#8208;efficiency Eu2+&#8208;doped phosphors via crystallochemical descriptors are urgently needed. Here, we pioneered a linear equation between PLQY and Bav in apatite&#8208;type La9&#8722;xLuxBi(SiO4)6O3:Eu2+ phosphors and achieves 15.7&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement by controlling bond angle variance (Bav).








Abstract
Rational design of inorganic luminescent materials with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has long been constrained by the absence of precise structural descriptors. Here, we realizes a giant 15.7&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement in apatite&#8208;type La9&#8722;xLuxBi(SiO4)6O3:Eu2+ phosphors and demonstrates that bond angle variance (Bav, &#948;2) can be used as a universal crystallochemical metric. By decoupling the contributions from structural rigidity, thermal quenching (TQ), and cation disorder, we identify isovalent Lu3+ substitution&#8208;driven Bav engineering, and further establish a predictive Bav&#8208;PLQY linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.95) via a generalized distortion quantification model for irregular polyhedra (CN&#160;=&#160;7). Local structure characterization and bond valence sum (Bvs) analyses reveal that &#948;2 modulation optimizes the coordination environments for Eu2+ incorporation while enhancing radiative transitions. This work bridges lattice distortion to PLQY via the Bav descriptor, offering a predictive route toward designing inorganic phosphor and advancing material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to database approaches.

         <title>Oxidative Addition of Aryl Bromides at Palladium(I) to form Palladium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals a detailed mechanistic study of the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to a Pd(I) center to generate an isolable Pd(III) species. UV&#8211;vis and cryo stopped&#8208;flow kinetic studies, including Eyring and Hammett analyses, reveal a rapid oxidative addition step occurring at a Pd(I) center, and a zero&#8208;order dependence on the substrate.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first systematic study of the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to a PdI center to generate organometallic PdIII complexes. These isolable PdIII complexes stabilized by tetradentate macrocyclic pyridinophane ligands exhibit distinct UV&#8211;vis and EPR spectroscopic signatures that allowed for the monitoring of their generation in situ. These ligand scaffolds were sterically and electronically tuned using a modular synthetic approach to probe the kinetic properties and activation parameters of the oxidative addition reaction, and a combination of UV&#8211;vis and cryo stopped&#8208;flow spectroscopic studies reveal a rapid oxidative addition step occurring at a PdI center. In addition, these results are in strong agreement with our recent reactivity studies, which demonstrated that mononuclear PdI systems are competent catalysts in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and thus set the stage for an improved understanding of potential catalytic applications for odd&#8208;electron Pd systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pocket watch illustrates the reversible capture of cyanide by an azacalixarene macrocycle. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide forms a metastable Meisenheimer dianion that slowly reverts to the parent macrocycle. The clockwork symbolises this dissipative cycle, where molecular design and non&#8208;covalent interactions govern the metastability of the adduct. Details of the study are reported by Simon Pascal et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202511037).

         <title>NitrOFF: An Engineered Fluorescent Biosensor to Illuminate Nitrate Transport in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a first&#8208;generation, two&#8208;domain biosensor for nitrate named NitrOFF is reported. The power of directed evolution over seven rounds has unlocked this sensing potential. The integration of in vitro spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography provides insights into the allostery driving the turn&#8208;off fluorescence response. Finally, fluorescence imaging with NitrOFF reveals its potential to illuminate nitrate uptake and modulation in mammalian cells.








Abstract
The duality of nitrate is nowhere better exemplified than in human physiology&#8212;a detrimental pollutant but also a protective nutrient&#8212;particularly as connected to nitric oxide. Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real&#8208;time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus. Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn&#8208;off intensiometric response (Kd &#8776; 9&#160;&#181;M). This was further reinforced by X&#8208;ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate&#8208;bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large&#8208;scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4&#176;. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the &#946;7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, we highlighted the utility of NitrOFF to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Triplet Excitons Tune Lanthanide Emission Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Eu3+&#8208;(or Tb3+&#8208;)&#8208;incorporated Lu3+ molecular crystals were prepared for the demonstration of the emission lifetime tuning method using slow triplet exciton migration. The lanthanide emission lifetimes were drastically extended (&#964;max = 152&#160;ms) by controlling the molar ratios of Eu3+ (or Tb3+) and modifying the ligand structures.








Abstract
Optical codes generated from the emission lifetimes of lanthanide complexes have received considerable attention for their potential application in multiplexed bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, such tunable lifetimes are limited to short ranges (0.01&#8722;1&#160;ms). Herein, we describe a method that extends the emission lifetime using dynamic molecular triplet excitons in aggregation systems composed of lanthanide complexes. To demonstrate the conceptual method, molecular crystals comprising lutetium (Lu3+) and luminescent lanthanide (europium: Eu3+ or terbium: Tb3+) complexes with two organic ligands (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;heptanedionate and 2,7&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)phenanthrene) were prepared. These molecular crystals exhibited persistent emission via slow triplet exciton migration between the phenanthrene units. The extended degree of the lifetime could be controlled between 1 and 152&#160;ms by ligand modifications. This proposed lifetime&#8208;tuning method should significantly expand the encoding capacity of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Acetylene&#8208;Linked Octupolar Conjugated Microporous Polymers for CO2 Photoreduction to Methanol: Effect of Acceptor and &#960;&#8208;Bridge Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of acetylene&#8208;linked specialized donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) were synthesized by varying the acceptor strength and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. These structural modifications were found to influence key factors such as exciton binding energy and charge dynamics, thereby influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol.








Abstract
The development of efficient, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to methanol is promising for alleviating energy and environmental issues, but achieving high selectivity and conversion efficiency without sacrificial agents or co&#8208;catalysts remains a challenge. In this work, we report a series of acetylene&#8208;linked specialized donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) designed with tailored electronic structures to investigate their efficacy in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol in an aqueous NaOH solution under visible light irradiation. Significantly, the optimized porous polymer TTT&#8208;DEBP, featuring a strong electron&#8208;accepting triazine ring and an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated diethynyl biphenyl (DEBP) system, achieved a higher CH3OH production rate of 30.8&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with 90.3% selectivity and excellent recyclability. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the synergistic effect of triazine, biphenyl, and acetylene moieties of the porous network reduces exciton binding energy, enhancing charge separation and transfer, and reduces charge recombination for improved photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Transsulfurase&#8208;Catalyzed Reversible Modification of C&#8208;Terminal Cysteine and Application for Orthogonal Dual Labeling of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the identification of a reversible addition and elimination of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;carboxypropyl (acp) group on the C&#8208;terminal cysteine residues of a broad range of proteins and peptides, specifically mediated by the cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;synthase (CGS) and cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lyase (CGL). This study also demonstrates an application of dual&#8208;enzyme mediation for orthogonal dual labeling of proteins.








Abstract
Protein thiol bioconjugation in combination with reversible modification of cysteine is a powerful strategy for orthogonal dual labeling of protein cysteine residues. Here, we utilize recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) cultivated in high&#8208;phosphate minimal medium for the expression of ubiquitin G76C, and discovered that cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;synthase (CGS), an enzyme in bacterial methionine biosynthesis, catalyzes both in cells and in vitro a site&#8208;specific and high&#8208;efficient &#947;&#8208;replacement reaction of the flexible C&#8208;terminal cysteine with O&#8208;succinyl&#8208;homoserine, leading to the addition of a 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;carboxypropyl (acp) group. Mechanistic studies using high&#8208;resolution NMR reveal a very weak ternary association among cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;synthase, O&#8208;succinyl&#8208;homoserine, and ubiquitin G76C. Cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lyase (CGL), involved in cysteine biosynthesis, specifically catalyzes the &#945;,&#947;&#8208;elimination reaction of the modified unit, thereby effectively removing the acp unit in vitro. Their catalytic efficiency and selectivity of both enzymes were evaluated, and each one shows unidirectional catalytic activity for proteins. Reversible modification of C&#8208;terminal cysteines across a broad range of proteins can be achieved by CGS and CGL. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of using this two&#8208;enzyme system for orthogonal dual labeling of proteins in combination with thiol bioconjugation techniques. This discovery significantly broadens the toolkit for protein thiol modifications and holds substantial application for the dual site&#8208;specific functionalization of proteins.

         <title>Tunable Copolymerization of Oxetane and Anhydrides via a Nonsymmetric Three&#8208;Center Four&#8208;Electron Iodine Activation Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonsymmetric three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron iodine activation platform enables highly selective copolymerization of oxetane and cyclic anhydrides. By tuning halogen&#8211;carboxylate interactions, the system affords precise control over ester&#8211;ether sequence, unlocking programmable access to functional polyesters. 








Abstract
The copolymerization of low&#8208;strain cyclic ethers, such as oxetane and anhydrides, still presents opportunities for improving compositional control in polymer synthesis. In this study, we report a halogen&#8208;bond catalysis platform based on a nonsymmetric three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron ([O&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#183;&#183;&#183;O]+) iodine activation mode that enables highly selective and tunable copolymerization of oxetane and anhydride. This active catalytic structure mediates oxetane insertion through a dynamic equilibrium between nonsymmetric and symmetric iodine&#8208;carboxylate complexes ([O_oxetane&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#183;&#183;&#183;O_carboxylate]+ versus [O_carboxylate&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#183;&#183;&#183;O_carboxylate]+), thereby regulating ester and ether linkage ratio. Mechanistic study reveals that nonsymmetric iodine activation enforces near&#8208;perfect alternating copolymer (&gt;99&#160;mol% selectivity in ester linkage) between oxetane and cyclic anhydrides. Notably, the catalytic system exhibits broad monomer scope, enabling the copolymerization of oxetane with a variety of cyclic anhydrides to yield structurally diverse polyesters. Furthermore, by tuning the carboxylate/I2 ratio, systematic control over the ester&#8208;to&#8208;ether content in the resulting polyesters can be achieved. This work establishes halogen&#8208;mediated nonsymmetric activation as a versatile and programmable platform for constructing composition&#8208;defined polyesters from low&#8208;strain cyclic ethers.

A stable HOF termed as ZNU&#8208;30 is constructed from a linear CP via hydrogen bonds, C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960; and &#960;&#8943;&#960; interactions for efficient gas dehydration with considerable water uptake at low humidity, rapid water sorption kinetics, mild regeneration conditions, and outstanding cycling performance.








Abstract
Two &#8208;(2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous coordination polymers have been extensively explored for their porous nature and thus gas separation, but one&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials remain much less explored due to their reliance on weaker, non&#8208;covalent interactions to sustain the permanent porosity. Recent significant advances on the construction of porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) through synergistic weak interactions have provided us with the promise and motivated us to explore porous HOFs using 1D coordination polymers (CPs), and their multifunctional properties. In this work, we present such a HOF, [Cu(bpy)(H2PO4)&#8729;H2O]n (ZNU&#8208;30), constructed from a linear CP via hydrogen bonds, C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960;, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Upon thermal activation at 373&#160;K under vacuum, ZNU&#8208;30 undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation, yielding ZNU&#8208;30a with 1D channels. Notably, ZNU&#8208;30a exhibits exceptional hydrophilicity, featuring considerable water uptake at low humidity, rapid adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, mild regeneration conditions, and outstanding cycling stability over 100 adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles. Single&#8208;component gas adsorption isotherms reveal unique molecular sieving behavior, with preferential adsorption of water (100&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) over CO2 and C1&#9472;C3 alkene/alkanes (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8) at 298&#160;K. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis and DFT calculations indicate that the selective adsorption of H2O is facilitated by multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the framework. Breakthrough experiments further confirm the material's ability to efficiently separate trace water vapor from CH4 and other gases.

         <title>The Chemistry and Biology of the Tetrodotoxin Natural Product Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrodotoxin is best known as the poison of the pufferfish, which is a delicacy in Japanese cuisine. Its toxicity arises from the selective blockage of NaV channels, which is depicted for the NaV1.7 pore, highlighting the DEKA motif, which permeates sodium ions. Depending on the subtype, inhibiting NaVs can lead to respiratory paralysis (NaV1.4) and heart failure (NaV1.5) or promote the treatment of pain (NaV1.7&#8208;NaV1.9).








Abstract
Tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxic marine alkaloid, first isolated in 1909 from pufferfish and named after the biological order tetraodontiformes. Since its structural elucidation in 1964, it has attracted the interest of synthetic organic chemists due to its exceptional polarity, complex architecture, and important biological activity. This review highlights the diversity of the tetrodotoxin natural product family and discusses the origins of derivatives, biosynthetic hypotheses, and biological activities. Furthermore, potential therapeutic applications and structure&#8211;activity relationship studies are covered, along with the total syntheses of the natural product and selected derivatives that were published to date.

         <title>Topochemical Polymerization of Retro&#8208;Isomeric Peptides for Tuning the Polymer Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two retro&#8208;isomeric peptide monomers containing hydrophobic amino acids for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Crystals of both the retro&#8208;isomers underwent TAAC polymerization to yield isomeric &#8220;difficult peptide&#8221; polymer mimics with differences in reactivity, regioselectivity, and properties. Our study shows that sequence reversal is a new way to obtain structurally and functionally diverse polymers via topochemical polymerization.








Abstract
Peptidomimetic polymers containing hydrophobic amino acids and nonpeptidic linkages are interesting for various applications, particularly hydrophobic coatings. We synthesized two retro&#8208;isomeric peptide monomers decorated with azide and alkyne, viz. N3&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M1) and its retro&#8208;isomer N3&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M2), for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. On heating the crystals at 100&#160;&#176;C, both monomers underwent TAAC polymerization, yielding isomeric &#8220;difficult peptide&#8221; polymer mimics. The monomers showed stark differences in reactivity and regiochemistry of the product formed. Monomer M1 yielded polymer P1 having a 1:1 ratio of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linkages, and monomer M2 reacted regiospecifically, giving 1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked polymer P2. We investigated the hydrophobicity of these isomeric polymers by measuring water contact angles (WCA) of surfaces coated with these polymers; P1 and P2 showed WCA of 120&#176; and 132&#176;, respectively. Our study demonstrates that sequence reversal is a novel approach for accessing structurally and functionally different polymers via topochemical polymerization.

         <title>NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Hydroarylation of Unactivated Alkenes Enabled by Outer&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes using diaryliodonium salts has been developed. This strategy enables high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity in both terminal and internal alkenes via a mechanistic shift to dissociative single&#8208;electron transfer. Mechanistic studies highlight migratory insertion as the key selectivity&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Asymmetric hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes provides a direct route to enantiomerically enriched C&#9472;C bonds in aryl&#8208;containing compounds, a key transformation in pharmaceutical and natural product synthesis. While recent advances have achieved high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with terminal alkenes, controlled hydroarylation of unactivated internal alkenes remains challenging. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed protocol that overcomes this limitation through a mechanistic paradigm shift. By employing diaryliodonium salts as dual&#8208;function reagents, our method achieves high enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity in the hydroarylation of both internal and terminal unactivated alkenes. These salts enable a transition from concerted to stepwise oxidative addition via dissociative single&#8208;electron transfer (DSET), generating a cationic alkyl&#8208;nickel intermediate prone to fragmentation and aryl radical addition. Mechanistic studies, including a key experiment in 1,4&#8208;dioxane yielding an enantiomerically pure solvent&#8208;functionalized product, establish migratory insertion as the enantio&#8208; and regio&#8208;determining step. This approach not only expands the scope of asymmetric hydroarylation but also provides a new mechanistic framework for selective hydrofunctionalization reactions.

         <title>Unveiling the Power of Dark State Photocages: An Efficient Pathway to Triplet State Under Near&#8208;Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a dark state photocage was proposed based on near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated leuco dyes. The dark state enhances triplet&#8208;state formation, enabling the release of dyes and functional molecules under red light irradiation. This platform exhibited excellent &#8220;OFF&#8221;&#8208;to&#8208;&#8220;ON&#8221; tumor imaging contrast and effective tumor inhibition against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and lung metastases.








Abstract
The photocage platform provides a synergistic approach to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Before light activation, both pro&#8208;photosensitizers and pro&#8208;drugs remain inert, ensuring safety. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, they undergo photoactivation and controlled release in deep tissues. However, the low photolysis efficiency of conventional singlet&#8208;state photocages limits their in vivo applications, necessitating an exploration of how excited&#8208;state dynamics influence photolysis. In this study, we introduce the concept of a &#8220;dark state photocage&#8221; and establish a photocage platform responsive to NIR light by incorporating phenoxazine or phenothiazine groups. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the dark state enhances triplet&#8208;state formation and facilitates intersystem crossing, thereby promoting photolysis. These photocages achieve functional molecule release under low&#8208;power NIR light (15 mW&#160;cm&#8315;2), with an efficiency of up to 90%. This advancement enables a sharp transition from an &#8220;OFF&#8221; to an &#8220;ON&#8221; tumor imaging signal and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer under NIR light irradiation, effectively integrating PDT and chemotherapy.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Luminescence Thermometry with Magnetic Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the application potential of magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL) techniques is showcased through the first demonstration of MCPL&#8208;based magneto&#8208;optical thermometry. With the presence of dual&#8208;signaled bands, and the combination of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple linear regression, remarkable sensitivities of up to 30.6%&#160;K&#8722;1 are achieved with the [Dy(acac)3(phen)] complex at 293&#160;K.








Abstract
Lanthanide(III) materials display remarkable optical properties, making them valuable for advancing remote luminescent sensors. The narrow emission bands and energy&#8208;transfer processes can be tailored to respond to external stimuli, such as temperature changes and magnetic fields. The application of magnetic fields lifts the Zeeman degeneracy, creating electronic spin polarization, and giving rise to magneto&#8208;optical phenomena. Magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL) is a magneto&#8208;optical technique in which the differential emission of left and right circularly polarized light is induced by a magnetic field oriented parallel or antiparallel to the light propagation axis. In the context of lanthanide(III) materials, this technique has only been explored in a few studies as a characterization tool. In this study, we present MCPL for a Dy(III) complex for the first time, highlighting its significant potential for magneto&#8208;luminescence thermometry. By studying the [Dy(acac)3(phen)] complex (phen: 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline; acac: acetylacetonate) as an example, a maximum relative sensitivity of 19.7%&#160;K&#8722;1 was observed at 293&#160;K, highlighting the tremendous potential that MCPL emitters hold in the field of luminescent thermometers.

         <title>Homologous Ladder Cyclohexasilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the synthesis of a homologous series of ladder cyclohexasilanes containing 1, 2, or 3 fused rings. The tricyclosilanes rank among the most architecturally and stereochemically complex oligosilanes yet synthesized. A combined experimental and theoretical study suggested that the diastereoselectivity in a key annulation is governed by kinetic control. This study also revealed extended &#963;&#8208;conjugation with each additional ring within the all&#8208;trans ladder cyclosilanes series.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of five new examples of ladder cyclohexasilanes, possessing up to three consecutive fused rings and differing in relative ring fusion configuration and side chain structure. By coupling a 1,4&#8208;dipotassiooligosilyl dianion to a cyclohexasilane, we obtained bi&#8208; and tricyclic ladder cyclohexasilanes. Combined experimental and theoretical studies suggested that annulation could favor the cis configuration under kinetic control, while the trans configuration predominates under thermodynamic control. Computational studies show that with each additional ring in the trans&#8208;diastereomeric series, the predicted onset of light absorption shifts to longer wavelengths.

         <title>A &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; Fluorescent Probe for Multi&#8208;ROS Imaging Unveils Ferroptosis&#8208;Driven Liver Fibrosis Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the molecular network linking ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, a novel &#8220;cocktail&#8221; fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, was designed to monitor dynamic changes in three ROS species in activated HSCs and liver fibrosis mouse models. By application of the probe, the NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;HSCs activation signaling pathway and the pro&#8208;fibrotic role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis were successfully elucidated.








Abstract
Liver fibrosis is a pathological repair response to chronic liver injury and may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma if untreated. Currently, no approved therapies specifically target advanced liver fibrosis, thus exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis has become crucial. Previous studies have highlighted significant controversy regarding the role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis. Given that reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as key mediators to both processes, ROS may serve as a molecular nexus connecting ferroptosis and liver fibrosis. To comprehensively elucidate the molecular network involving ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, we designed and synthesized the first multi&#8208;functional &#8220;cocktail&#8221; fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, enabling highly sensitive and selective simultaneous imaging of O2&#8226;&#8722;, H2O2, and ONOO&#8722;. FP&#8208;ROS was successfully employed to assess ferroptosis levels in the livers of fibrosis mice following drug intervention. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we elucidated the signaling pathway NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a critical role in HSCs activation and further elucidates the molecular interplay between ROS and ferroptosis in fibrosis progression. These findings provide novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for liver fibrosis.

         <title>Deconstructive Radical&#8211;Radical Coupling for Programmable Remote Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified approach to access a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls through a radical&#8208;promoted deconstructive process utilizing dual photocatalysis/carbene catalysis is reported. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with a broad scope with robust functional group tolerance along with application in the preparation of &#947;&#8208;amino esters, three&#8208;component manifolds, and the first enantioselective deconstructive synthesis of 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyls using a chiral NHC catalyst.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A unified approach to access a variety of 1,n-dicarbonyls through a radical-promoted deconstructive process utilizing dual photocatalysis/carbene catalysis is reported. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with a broad scope with robust functional group tolerance along with application in the preparation of &#947;-amino esters, three-component manifolds, and the first enantioselective deconstructive synthesis of 1,5-dicarbonyls using a chiral NHC catalyst.

         <title>Lignin&#8208;Derived Polyanionic Crosslinked Gel Interfacial Layer with Ion&#8208;Sieving and Ion&#8208;Regulating Capabilities for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered interface layer with ion&#8208;sieving and ion&#8208;regulating capacity is constructed to stabilize Zn anodes by simultaneously restricting SO&#8324;2&#8315; diffusion and creating high&#8208;conductivity pathways for Zn2&#8314;, thereby mitigating side reactions. Sodium lignosulfonate forms a molecular adsorbent layer that chelates Zn2&#8314; to regulate uniform deposition, achieving high performance of Zn ion batteries.








Abstract
The severe side reactions and rampant dendrite growth on the zinc (Zn) electrode significantly hinder the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, we fabricate a multifunctional interfacial layer composed of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and polyanionic gel featuring ion&#8208;sieving and ion&#8208;regulating capabilities that effectively protects the Zn anode. The abundant &#9472;SO3&#8722; groups in the polyanionic gel optimize the Zn2+ solvent sheath structure while simultaneously providing ion&#8208;sieving function, which significantly facilitates Zn2+ migration. The lignin derivatives are pre&#8208;adsorbed onto the Zn anode surface, directing nucleation along the Zn (002) plane and offering electrostatic shielding effects to facilitate uniform Zn2+ deposition. Additionally, the polyanionic gel inhibits water activity by forming strong hydrogen bonds with water, while the PVDF layer adjacent to Zn electrode significantly reduces water&#8208;induced side reactions. Consequently, the Zn electrodes incorporating this protective layer demonstrated stable and efficient deposition/stripping behaviors across a wide range of current densities. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells demonstrate remarkable cycling stability, maintaining the capacity of 176.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 and 101.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This innovative strategy presents a promising approach to the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N&#8208;CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N&#8208;CH2F carbamoyl fluorides. The reactivity of fluorine atoms located at different positions of the two building blocks toward nucleophilic substitution was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.








Abstract
The distinctive chemical properties of fluorine atoms have enabled fluorine&#8208;containing compounds to make significant strides in the pharmaceutical and materials fields. However, due to the very limited synthetic methods, the enormous potential of N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds has not yet been unlocked. In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N&#8208;CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N&#8208;CH2F carbamoyl fluorides.

         <title>Bicyclic Selenenyl Sulfides with Tuned Bioreductive Step Rates Reveal Constraints for Probes Targeting Thioredoxin Reductase</title>

         <dc:description>
Thiol reductants activate dichalcogenide probes by a cascade of partly reversible steps. Careful dichalcogenide engineering can tune the rates of these steps separately, to aim at probes that are kinetically selective for specific oxidoreductases in live cells. Here, we deploy regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, template&#8208;, and pH&#8208;control elements to shape the reactivity of bicyclic selenenyl sulfides, giving probes that selectively target the selenoenzyme TrxR1.








Abstract
The reductive activation of dichalcogenide probes by thiol&#8208;type oxidoreductases proceeds through a cascade of consecutive, partly reversible steps. Stereocontrol elements can modulate the reaction rates of these steps to reach substrate&#8208;controlled kinetic selectivity for reductase chemotypes in live cells. We now deploy regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, template&#8208;, and pH&#8208;control elements to shape the reactivity of unprecedented bicyclic selenenyl sulfides (SeSP), arriving at probes that selectively target the mammalian selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase TrxR1. We accessed these densely functionalised cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;thiaselenanes on gram scale over 5 steps by using a regioselective key step that elaborates an unusual, differentially protected 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;aziridine intermediate through sequential one&#8208;pot chalcogen introduction and selenenyl sulfide formation. By profiling a set of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomeric bicycles for their partly or fully reversible reactivity during reductive activation, we show how effects that slow their reduction steps (addition then resolution) can compensate by vastly accelerating subsequent activation (cyclisation) speeds, such that cellular processing is effective and TrxR&#8208;selective. More broadly, this study shows how multistep cascade probes can leverage conformational effects and internal noncovalent interactions to differentiate step kinetics along their on&#8208;target versus off&#8208;target reaction pathways, thus achieving reaction&#8208;based target selectivity in complex biological settings.

         <title>Optimizing Bromine Complexation and Kinetics: a Bisimidazole Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8208;Br Static Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a symmetric bisimidazole&#8208;based complexing agent, [bMImB]Br2, that integrates high N+ atomic charge and low solubility with minimal steric hindrance to enable strong bromine complexation and fast redox kinetics, enabling ZnBr static batteries with high energy density, excellent efficiency, and robust cycling stability.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;bromine (Zn&#8211;Br) static batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage, yet the practical application is hindered by the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off about bromine complexing agents (BCAs) between bromine complexation strength and redox kinetics. Herein, we report a rationally designed bisimidazolium salt, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;1&#8208;yl) butane dibromide ([bMImB]Br&#8322;), which features a symmetric molecular structure that reconciles this contradiction. [bMImB]Br&#8322; demonstrates strong bromine affinity, stemming from its high atomic charge of N+ and low solubility&#8212;properties comparable to those of tetraalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium salts. Simultaneously, it retains low steric hindrance typical of monoimidazole compounds, thereby enabling fast electrode kinetics. As a result, Zn&#8211;Br batteries incorporating [bMImB]Br&#8322; deliver a high specific energy of 116 Wh&#183;kg&#8315;&#185;, alongside an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.22% and energy efficiency (EE) of 89.35% at 10 mAh&#183;cm&#8315;2 (0.5 C) for over 150 cycles. Furthermore, the flexible pouch cell maintains a discharge capacity of 110 mAh and 99.7% CE over 100 cycles, even under mechanical deformation. This work offers a generalizable molecular design strategy for developing next&#8208;generation BCAs in halogen&#8208;based energy storage systems.

&lt;p&gt;Zinc&#8211;bromine (Zn&#8211;Br) static batteries are promising for large-scale energy storage, yet the practical application is hindered by the long-standing trade-off about bromine complexing agents (BCAs) between bromine complexation strength and redox kinetics. Herein, we report a rationally designed bisimidazolium salt, 1,4-bis(3-methylimidazolium-1-yl) butane dibromide ([bMImB]Br&#8322;), which features a symmetric molecular structure that reconciles this contradiction. [bMImB]Br&#8322; demonstrates strong bromine affinity, stemming from its high atomic charge of N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and low solubility&#8212;properties comparable to those of tetraalkyl-quaternary ammonium salts. Simultaneously, it retains low steric hindrance typical of monoimidazole compounds, thereby enabling fast electrode kinetics. As a result, Zn&#8211;Br batteries incorporating [bMImB]Br&#8322; deliver a high specific energy of 116 Wh&#183;kg&#8315;&#185;, alongside an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.22% and energy efficiency (EE) of 89.35% at 10 mAh&#183;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.5 C) for over 150 cycles. Furthermore, the flexible pouch cell maintains a discharge capacity of 110 mAh and 99.7% CE over 100 cycles, even under mechanical deformation. This work offers a generalizable molecular design strategy for developing next-generation BCAs in halogen-based energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Accompanying ATP Synthesis in Polydopamine Microreactors Covered by Lipid Bilayers with ATPase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of CO2 accompanying ATP synthesis is achieved by a biomimetic assembled microreactor based on formate dehydrogenase (FDH), Calvin cycle, and ATPase. FDH fixes CO2 into formate by sacrificing NADH, and the Calvin cycle helps the regeneration of NADH. The protons generated by the enzyme cascade reaction drive the ATPase on the biomimetic membrane to synthesize ATP. 








Abstract
Global energy and environmental crises have stimulated increased efforts toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals or energy substance. Inspired by natural chloroplasts and mitochondria, we build an innovative polydopamine&#8208;armored multiple enzyme microreactor for co&#8208;immobilizing glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric phosphokinase (PGK), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and ATPase&#8208;incorporating proteoliposome, providing spatially confined microenvironments akin to natural systems. Within this microreactor, GAPDH and PGK catalyze the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate to 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric acid, reducing &#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH and generating a proton influx that drives ATP synthesis. The microreactor possesses strong affinity for CO2, combined with FDH, facilitates the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, oxidizing NADH back to NAD+ and enabling the recycling of the NAD+/NADH redox couple. This process further boosts ATP production by contributing additional protons. Such microreactor adeptly orchestrates the chloroplast's enzymes to fix CO2 and the mitochondrion's enzymes to synthesize ATP into a unified artificial biomimetic system, effectively replicating the glycolysis process to simultaneously achieve CO2 fixation, NADH regeneration, and ATP synthesis. This strategy not only holds great potential to inspire significant design innovations for more efficient ATP synthesis from low&#8208;value substances but also greatly expands the application scenarios for biomolecular motors.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sila&#8208;Cycloaddition of Dichlorodisilanes: Selective Si&#9472;Cl Activation for Cyclic Disilanes and Enantioenriched Synthesis</title>

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes enables efficient access to diverse cyclic disilanes via selective Si&#9472;Cl activation. The method tolerates broad diene scope, offers an enantioselective variant, and reveals a unique Ni&#8304;&#8208;mediated SN2&#8208;type activation pathway.








Abstract
Disilanyl architectures holds significant value across diverse fields, particularly in the development of advanced materials. However, their limited accessibility has hindered broader exploration. Herein, we report a catalytic strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic disilanes through a [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. This transformation proceeds under mild, reductive nickel catalysis via an unusual Si&#9472;Cl bond activation pathway and accommodates a broad range of dienes, including bulk feedstocks, cyclic, multi&#8208;substituted, aliphatic, aromatic dienes, and trienes. An asymmetric variant further enables the efficient construction of chiral disilane frameworks with high enantioselectivity. The resulting disilacarbocycle adopts boat&#8208;like conformations, as revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis, due to the elongated Si&#9472;Si and Si&#9472;C bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that a triplet Ni0 species engages in an SN2&#8208;type oxidative addition to the Si&#9472;Cl bond, favoring this pathway over a concerted Si&#9472;Si activation. The resulting Si&#9472;Ni(I) intermediates are energetically preferred over Si&#9472;Ni(II) analogs in the subsequent diene insertion step.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO in 100%: The Synergistic Effect of Nickel and Europium in Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of 3d&#8208;4f nanoclusters with analogous structures were synthesized, and the {Ni24Eu10} cluster demonstrates high stability and exceptional performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO, which can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the Ni(II) and Eu(III) metal centers within its [Ni4Eu] assembly units.








Abstract
Heterometallic transition&#8208;rare earth metal (3d&#8208;4f) clusters with synergistic catalytic activity are rarely identified. Herein, two families of closely related 3d&#8208;Eu clusters were designed to analyze the role of Eu(III) ions during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO. The [M24Eu8] family, where M&#160;=&#160;Co or Ni, shows much lower activity (CO production &lt; 2078&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) compared to the [M24Eu10] family (CO production &gt; 5838&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This is due to the two additional Eu(III) ions in the apical position of the latter which are very active for converting CO2 into CO. Moreover, we found the nickel analogues are better than the cobalt ones, especially for [Ni24Eu10] which exhibits 100% CO selectivity and very high efficacy of 6545.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, while the [Co24Eu10] only shows 55% CO selectivity. Therefore, the coexistence of both apical Eu(III) and Ni(II) ions has been experimentally revealed to be critical for this exceptional catalytic performance of the [Ni24Eu10] cluster. As such, this work unambiguously reveals a synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts and may open a new avenue for more sophisticated reaction design by using the heterometallic coordination clusters.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks With Enhanced Chemical and Photochemical Stability for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stable covalent organic framework (TZ&#8208;COF) incorporating fused&#8208;heterocycle linkages has been synthesized, showing exceptional chemical resilience under harsh conditions and superior photostability relative to traditional double&#8208;bond&#8208;linked COFs. The in situ formation of thiazole linkages provides new protonation sites, enhancing the framework's hydrophilicity, expanding its range of light absorption, and reducing exciton binding energy.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant interest for their potential in photocatalytic solar fuel generation. However, their intrinsic stability&#8212;particularly the photochemical stability, which influences the durability of their photocatalytic performance&#8212;remains a critical challenge. Here, we present the construction of four robust fused&#8208;heterocycle thiazole&#8208;linked COFs (TZ&#8208;COFs 14&#8211;17) through a facile one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction using chrysene&#8208;6,12&#8208;diamine, aldehydes, and sulfur monomers. The incorporation of thiazole linkages within the fused&#8208;ring building blocks imparts exceptional chemical and photochemical stability to these COFs. They demonstrate high stability in strong acid (12&#160;M HCl), strong base (12&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M MeONa), reducing (1&#160;M NaBH4), and oxidizing (1&#160;M H2O2) agents, along with superior photostability under light degradation tests. Significantly, the in situ formed thiazoles introduce new, robust protonation sites compared to commonly used imine linkages, which improve the hydrophilicity, expand the range of light absorption, and lower the exciton binding energy of the framework. TZ&#8208;COF&#8208;17 achieves an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of up to 33.27&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing many previously reported COF photocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;A highly stable covalent organic framework (TZ-COF) incorporating fused-heterocycle linkages has been synthesized, showing exceptional chemical resilience under harsh conditions and superior photostability relative to traditional double-bond-linked COFs. The in situ formation of thiazole linkages provides new protonation sites, enhancing the framework's hydrophilicity, expanding its range of light absorption, and reducing exciton binding energy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant interest for their potential in photocatalytic solar fuel generation. However, their intrinsic stability&#8212;particularly the photochemical stability, which influences the durability of their photocatalytic performance&#8212;remains a critical challenge. Here, we present the construction of four robust fused-heterocycle thiazole-linked COFs (TZ-COFs 14&#8211;17) through a facile one-pot three-component reaction using chrysene-6,12-diamine, aldehydes, and sulfur monomers. The incorporation of thiazole linkages within the fused-ring building blocks imparts exceptional chemical and photochemical stability to these COFs. They demonstrate high stability in strong acid (12&#160;M HCl), strong base (12&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M MeONa), reducing (1&#160;M NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and oxidizing (1&#160;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) agents, along with superior photostability under light degradation tests. Significantly, the in situ formed thiazoles introduce new, robust protonation sites compared to commonly used imine linkages, which improve the hydrophilicity, expand the range of light absorption, and lower the exciton binding energy of the framework. TZ-COF-17 achieves an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of up to 33.27&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing many previously reported COF photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote and Spatiotemporal Modulation of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Croconaine Dyes via NIR Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrate a light&#8208;mediated strategy for fabricating supramolecular polymers and copolymers. By tuning laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength, supramolecular structures can be precisely controlled. The spatial precision of laser irradiation further enables localized supramolecular polymerization and sol&#8211;gel transitions. These findings establish a dynamic platform for regulating supramolecular nanomaterials with tailored structures and functions.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization holds great promise for the fabrication of well&#8208;defined nanostructures. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control over the dynamic assembly of supramolecular polymers using external stimuli remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation strategy that exploits the intrinsic photothermal properties of croconaine&#8208;based molecular building blocks to modulate the aggregation&#8211;dissociation equilibrium of seeds, thereby enabling the formation of supramolecular polymers and copolymers. Light irradiation provides enhanced tunability through adjustments in laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength. Notably, the spatial precision afforded by laser irradiation allows for localized seed dissociation, offering a new approach for spatially controlled supramolecular polymerization. This method also enables efficient light&#8208;mediated gel formation, spatially selective sol&#8211;gel transitions, and healing in supramolecular organogels. These findings demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive strategy for regulating supramolecular polymerization and open new avenues for constructing nanomaterials with programmable structures and functions.

         <title>Acetone Derivatives for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Methylation, Trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;Methylation of (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthetic method enables methylation, trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;methylation of (hetero)aryl halides using cost&#8208;effective methylation reagent (TDTP, TDTPCD3, and TDTP&#8208;13CH3) derived from acetone and isotopic analogs. This homogeneous catalysis protocol bypasses traditional organometallic reagents, operates via methyl radical generation and cross&#8208;coupling, and tolerates diverse functional groups and complex substrates.








Abstract
The development of low&#8208;cost, readily available, and broadly applicable reagents for the methylation, trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;methylation of aryl chlorides is crucial. Using acetone and its isotopic derivatives as feedstocks, we have prepared the methylating, trideuteromethylating, and 13C&#8208;methylating agents TDTP (2&#8208;(1,5,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine), TDTP&#8208;CD3, and TDTP&#8208;&#185;3CH3. Under nickel catalysis and without any additional redox reagent, these reagents efficiently methylate a wide range of (hetero)aryl chlorides, chlorine&#8208;containing complex molecules and phenolic derivatives, showing efficient functional&#8208;group tolerance and scalability; they, therefore, hold great promise for drug discovery and complex molecule synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction begins with nickel&#8208;catalyzed generation of a methyl radical, followed by radical cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Reductive N2 Cleavage and Nitride Insertion Reactivity at Molybdenum Complexes Supported by a Rigid PNP Pincer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive N2 cleavage at an acridane PNP pincer&#8208;supported Mo center leads to the first crystallographically characterized example of an unusual Mo(IV) nitride species featuring a bridging N2 coordination stabilized via Mo&#8208;N2 d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; backbonding interactions. Nitride functionalization with CO leads to Mo(II) isocyanate species.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitride species represent key reactive intermediates in reductive N2 cleavage and functionalization. Toward a better understanding of nitride transfer reactivity, we present a series of Mo&#8208;nitride complexes supported by a rigid diphosphino&#8208;acridane pincer ligand. Notably, the stepwise reduction of a MoIVCl3 complex under N2 allows the isolation of a bridging diazenido intermediate as well as a dinuclear Mo&#8208;nitride species (4) accommodating a bridging N2 moiety. This is the first example of a Mo(IV) nitride&#8208;N2 species, and extensive 15N&#8208;labeling studies were performed to characterize the bridging dinitrogen, diazenido, and nitride moieties. The structure of 4 adopts two orthogonal &#960;&#8208;backbonding interactions between N2 and two structurally rigidified MoIV(N) fragments featuring a filled d&#960; orbital. Effective &#960;&#8208;backbonding from such a MoIV(N) fragment leads to the isolation of PMe3, CO, and CNtBu substituted analogues. Further, reactivity of the Mo&#8208;nitride species with &#960;&#8208;acidic CO and isocyanide leads to the formation of MoII&#8208;isocyanate and &#8208;carbodiimide species, respectively. Computational studies suggest that nitride carbonylation proceeds via an associative nitride insertion pathway, encouraging further studies in direct N2 fixation to value&#8208;added products via nitride functionalization.

         <title>Tuning Eley&#8211;Rideal Mechanism in Electrochemical Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ER mechanism plays a vital role in electrocatalytic hydrogenation, yet its rate&#8208;limiting factors remain poorly understood. Using acetylene hydrogenation as a model, we uncover atomic activation and spatial hindrance as key ER bottlenecks. Cu3Au, with balanced adsorption strength, exemplifies how introducing weak&#8208;binding atoms into moderate&#8208;binding hosts can optimize ER activity.








Abstract
The Eley&#8211;Rideal (ER) mechanism is pivotal in heterogeneous catalysis processes such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, which rely heavily on the interaction between solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;phase species. In this study, we examine the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene to explore the factors influencing the ER mechanism. We employed the density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the hydrogenation of acetylene on face&#8208;centered cubic metals and copper&#8208;based alloys. Microkinetic modeling identifies changes in the rate&#8208;determining steps of different alloys as electronegativity decreases. We then constructed the volcano plot for the adsorption energy toward C2H2 and the reaction rate, which predicted that Cu3Au is the best candidate alloy for the C2H2 semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Both extensive prior research and our experimental findings validated our volcano plot. Notably, our work points out the two key determinants of the ER mechanism: atomic activation and steric hindrance. For metals with weaker adsorption, steric hindrance primarily obstructs the ER mechanism, while for metals with stronger adsorption, the ER mechanism is hindered due to the challenge of atomic activation. Therefore, introducing weak adsorption sites into moderately adsorptive metals can improve the overall efficiency of the ER reaction by balancing these two factors.

We then constructed the volcano plot for the adsorption energy toward C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the reaction rate, which predicted that Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Au is the best candidate alloy for the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; semi-hydrogenation. Both extensive prior research and our experimental findings validated our volcano plot. Notably, our work points out the two key determinants of the ER mechanism: atomic activation and steric hindrance. For metals with weaker adsorption, steric hindrance primarily obstructs the ER mechanism, while for metals with stronger adsorption, the ER mechanism is hindered due to the challenge of atomic activation. Therefore, introducing weak adsorption sites into moderately adsorptive metals can improve the overall efficiency of the ER reaction by balancing these two factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Photocatalysis with Chiral Lewis Acid Catalysis for Enantioselective Hydrosilylation/Hydrogermylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrosilylation and hydrogermylation reactions of &#593;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides under synergistic catalysis are reported. Various chiral organosilicon and organogermanium compounds were prepared by a radical process with good results, which could be transferred to drug intermediates. A series of experiments and DFT calculations revealed the reaction mechanism.








Abstract
Organosilicon compounds demonstrate widespread applications in many fields. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation represents one of the most common and effective methods to synthesize chiral organosilicon compounds, but it largely relies on electron&#8208;rich alkenes and structurally specific hydrosilanes. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a promising new platform for hydrosilylation. However, the enantiocontrol of photoinduced asymmetric hydrosilylation concerning highly reactive radical species is a great challenge. Herein, we report a synergistic catalytic strategy for enantioselective hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes by merging anthraquinone as a dual&#8208;tasked photocatalyst with a chiral Lewis acid catalyst. This protocol shows broad hydrosilane scope with efficient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, delivering diverse enantioenriched organosilicon compounds, which could be readily converted into a series of medicine molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between the photocatalyst and the alkene is crucial for enantiocontrol. Additionally, enantioselective radical hydrogermylation was also achieved under the visible light photoinduced synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Precision Photochemistry: Every Photon Counts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every photon used in a photochemical reaction has the power to dictate the outcome of the reaction. We present a framework whereby understanding the role that each photon has in a reaction can enablechemists to realise the true power of photochemistry and dramatically improve reaction outcomes.We coin this field Precision Photochemistry.








Abstract
Photochemistry is undergoing a precision transformation. Through technological advancements, such as the advent of light emitting diodes and monochromatic lasers, chemists are now able to use photons not only as an energy source but also as a tool for directing photochemical processes with both wavelength and spatiotemporal precision. Enabled by these technologies, the discovery that photochemical action often does not align with molar extinction has catalysed the growth of the research field that we coin Precision Photochemistry. We explain how precision photochemistry stands on four fundamental pillars: molar extinction, wavelength&#8208;dependent quantum yield, concentration of the chromophores, and the length of the irradiation. Each of these four pillars are intrinsically linked and dictate the experimental conditions that should be used (e.g., wavelength, light intensity, and solvent system), as we demonstrate through simulations of a photochemical uncaging system. Building on these pillars, we propose a concrete definition for Precision Photochemistry and highlight important fields within chemistry that will benefit from careful consideration of them. Finally, we address key experimental considerations that must be taken into account when conducting precision photochemistry including the light source, the reaction setup, and the method for determining (wavelength&#8208;dependent) quantum yields. These factors are critical in furthering the development of the field of Precision Photochemistry.

In their Research Article (e202511266), Jiansheng Li and co&#8208;workers synthesized asymmetric CoN1O2 single atoms (SAs) sites and Co nanoclusters (NCs) confined within highly graphitized carbon layers on holey MXene nanosheets via a dual&#8208;coordination strategy. The Co NCs optimized the electronic structure of Co sites, synergistically enhancing peroxymonosulfate adsorption and activation. This catalyst achieved ultrafast pollutant removal through an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven polymerization pathway.

The binding of a hard non&#8208;interacting sphere to a macrocyclic cavity has been investigated to expose the importance of cavity water as determinant of supramolecular and biomolecular binding affinity in aqueous solution. The results demonstrate that the thermochemical properties of water molecules present inside different macrocyclic receptors can largely increase or decrease their binding affinities, for example, for the popular host cucurbit[8]uril, as reported by Jeffry Setiadi, Frank Biedermann, Werner M. Nau, and Michael K. Gilson in their Research Article (e202505713).

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Light&#8208;Driven Ratchet Mechanism Accelerates Regioselective Metal&#8208;Cation Exchange in a Heterobimetallic Helicate (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 35/2025)</title>

A photoswitchable helicate acts like a molecular claw machine: under 405 nm light, it functions as a molecular ratchet that greatly speeds up regioselective ZnII&#8594;FeII exchange, converting a homometallic ZnII helicate into a heterometallic one. Consequently, FeII cations are captured with precise spatial and temporal control, similar to arcade claw machines. Moreover, this ratchet operates autonomously under white light, creating an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium structure, as reported by Larissa von Krbek et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202508952).

         <title>Porous Organic Cages as Building Blocks for Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined nanospaces are key to the design of porous materials like COFs, MOFs, and molecular cages for applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, and energy storage. This Minireview explores the rising role of porous organic cages (POCs) as versatile synthons, highlighting their integration into Cage&#8208;COFs, Cage&#8208;MOFs, and Cage&#8208;POPs. These hybrid materials offer tunable porosity, structural precision, and exciting potential for future applications. 








Abstract
Confined nanospaces play a fundamental role in nature, inspiring synthetic analogues that emulate biological precision and efficiency. Among these, porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and molecular cage compounds have emerged as powerful platforms for catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Recent developments highlight the potential of porous organic cages (POCs) as modular building blocks for the construction of advanced materials. In this Minireview, their integration into extended frameworks, such as Cage&#8208;COFs and Cage&#8208;MOFs, is described, as they allow precise control over porosity and enhance chemical robustness. These hybrids merge the structural regularity of COFs with the discrete functionality of cages, enabling the design of lightweight, hierarchically organised materials. In addition, cage&#8208;containing polymers and supramolecular frameworks are discussed. Collectively, these developments position POCs as versatile synthons for next&#8208;generation porous materials, unlocking pathways toward functional, adaptive, and recyclable architectures.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks: Design Strategy, Structure Feature, and Applications in Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the synthesis strategies, structural characteristics, and structural regulation strategies of metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), as well as their electrochemical energy storage performance in various energy storage devices (LIBs, LMBs, ZABs, Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, LSBs, ZIBs, and SCs).








Abstract
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which can integrate the properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), exhibit high stability, adjustable pore structures, and catalytic activity of metal sites owing to the synergistic interaction between metal sites and covalent backbones. In this regard, MCOFs have gained significant attention as promising electrode materials, where metal ions (Mn+) function as molecular structure switches, providing MCOFs with diverse active sites and modifying their charge density by incorporating different Mn+, thereby imparting unique energy&#8208;storage properties to MCOFs. Furthermore, by optimizing the synthesis strategies of MCOFs, their topological and dimensional structures can be regulated to ensure the stability of the MCOFs. In the challenging landscape of energy storage, MCOFs have surpassed the performance limitations of traditional COFs. Through precise atomic&#8208;level control of metal sites and innovative design of dynamic covalent chemistry, they can significantly enhance the performance of batteries, achieving remarkable performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, and other applications. This review systematically summarizes the research advancements of MCOFs in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices, including lithium&#8208;ion, Li&#8211;CO2, and Zn&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, it examines the synthesis strategies, structural regulation, and structural characteristics of MCOFs to address the challenges encountered in various energy storage devices.

         <title>Superprotonic Conduction Over Wide Humidity Range Driven by Enhanced Proton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although numerous studies on covalent organic framework &#8208;based proton&#8208;conducting membranes have been documented, the majority concentrate on synthesis, with mechanistic investigations remaining relatively sparse. In addition, the mechanistic studies can be categorized into two primary areas. The first area is dedicated to the study of proton diffusion, including the analysis of hydrogen bonding patterns and the mobility of guest molecules. The second area delves into strategies to enhance the proton&#8208;dissociation capability of acidic groups, such as discussing the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups or zwitterionic species. In this work, we meticulously study the role of proton intermediates in proton conduction and have successfully achieved superprotonic conductivity by reducing the proton dissociation energy of these intermediates.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;conducting materials play a key role in various fields, and their proton conduction is profoundly restricted by the proton dissociation process. This process has two components: dissociation from acidic groups (e.g., &#8722;SO3H) and dissociation from intermediate species (e.g., H3O+, C&#9472;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H+). Extensive research has concentrated on the former, utilizing acidic groups with minimal proton dissociation energy or low pKa values, while the latter's substantial effects have been largely overlooked. In reality, proton&#8208;accepting atoms within intermediates, such as oxygen and nitrogen, typically produce a higher electron cloud density compared to those in acidic groups. This results in a pronounced electrostatic binding effect on mobile protons, as well as high dissociation energies. Thus, diminishing the dissociation energy associated with intermediates is paramount in the development of high&#8208;performance proton conductors. Herein, we construct one covalent organic framework&#8208;based proton conductor, achieving superprotonic conduction over a wide humidity range by decreasing the dissociation energy of protons from intermediates. The success of this approach can be attributed to two key factors: the crowded guest molecules within the framework that mitigate proton hydration, and the concurrent establishment of C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H+ interactions. These combined effects significantly reduce the electrostatic attraction exerted on mobile protons, thereby enhancing proton conduction.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Cyanogen Vacancies in Prussian Blue for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an anionic complexation strategy to construct cyanide vacancy&#8208;architected Prussian blue frameworks. Through controlled ligand&#8208;field perturbation, the engineered vacancies activate reversible Fe low&#8208;spin &#8596; high&#8208;spin transitions during cycling, creating adaptive structural accommodation that stabilizes Fe redox centers. This vacancy&#8208;mediated spin&#8208;state engineering establishes a new design paradigm for manipulating electron configuration through defect&#8208;property coupling in coordination materials.








Abstract
Prussian blue (PB), recognized as a promising cathode material, has gained significant attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost, and ease of synthesis. However, the influence of anion vacancies on the stability of the PB framework remains controversial, impeding a comprehensive grasp of their precise role in electrochemical performance and the controlled synthesis of PB with smaller anionic vacancies remains challenging due to the limitations inherent in current synthesis strategies. Herein, we present an anion complexation method to synthesize PB materials with tunable cyanide vacancy concentrations. Furthermore, we propose a vacancy&#8208;driven mechanism that promotes spin transitions coupled with lattice bending, which are more reversible at low&#8208;spin Fe sites, leading to excellent low&#8208;spin stability and the design of materials with outstanding electrochemical performance. This anion complexation method not only provides a novel synthetic pathway for PB materials but also advances the understanding of the composition&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships between cyanide vacancy configurations and spin transition mechanism, highlighting its potential for future energy storage applications.

         <title>Exploring Excited State Proton Transfer in Thin Films Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the effect of vibrational strong coupling of the &#9472;OH stretching mode on the excited state proton transfer process. The results reveal that the quantum yield of RO&#8722;emission and the ESPT rate constant enhance by a factor of two under VSC, compared to the noncavity, half&#8208;cavity, and off&#8208;resonance films. These findings highlight the potential of VSC in controlling various types of chemical reactions that involve proton transfer processes.








Abstract
Molecular structure, solvent/matrix, the surrounding environment, and molecular vibrations can influence the excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Theoretical studies predict that light&#8208;matter strong coupling can modify the energy barrier for proton transfer reactions. Here, we experimentally explore the role of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on the ESPT using the weak photoacid, 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthalenesulfonate (N8S) as the probe. The ESPT in N8S can occur through a solvent/matrix bridge connecting the proton&#8208;donating and accepting units. To check the role of VSC, we embedded N8S in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix and strongly coupled the &#9472;OH stretching vibrational modes of PVA. The steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission analysis reveal that the quantum yield of RO&#8722; emission and the ESPT rate constant enhance by a factor of two under VSC, compared to the noncavity, half&#8208;cavity, and off&#8208;resonance films. Our findings indicate that VSC can be a tool to control the proton transfer processes, opening avenues for developing physically tunable photoacid&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Bulk&#8208; and Surface&#8208;Engineered Carbon Nitride with Promoted Electron Transfer for NADH Regeneration and Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a rhodium complex&#8208;immobilized porous carbon nitride (Rh*&#8208;PCN) through a bulk&#8208; and surface&#8208;engineering strategy. The optimized Rh*&#8208;PCN showed a maximum initial reaction rate of 16.80&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1 for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. By integrating Rh*&#8208;PCN with glutamate dehydrogenase, we established an enzyme&#8208;photo&#8208;coupled catalytic system capable of driving artificial photosynthesis for L&#8208;glutamate production.








Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN), a well&#8208;known photocatalyst, has been extensively utilized in light&#8208;driven redox reactions, including NADH regeneration. However, its catalytic efficiency is hindered by rapid charge recombination due to obstructed electron transfer. Herein, we developed a highly porous CN coated with a thin layer of rhodium complex (Rh*&#8208;PCN) through a combination of bulk and surface engineering for enhanced NADH regeneration. The bulk&#8208;engineered porous network of PCN facilitates oriented electron transfer in Rh*&#8208;PCN, while the surface&#8208;engineered Rh layer minimizes the electron transfer distance between PCN and the rhodium complex. Rh*&#8208;PCN achieves an initial NADH regeneration rate of 16.80&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8315;&#185;&#160;h&#8315;&#185;. Moreover, Rh*&#8208;PCN suppresses enzyme deactivation by compartmentalizing the enzyme from the photogenerated holes on PCN and the rhodium complex. When integrated with glutamate dehydrogenase, the Rh*&#8208;PCN/enzyme coupled system produces L&#8208;glutamic acid.

     alt="Bulk- and Surface-Engineered Carbon Nitride with Promoted Electron Transfer for NADH Regeneration and Artificial Photosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we developed a rhodium complex-immobilized porous carbon nitride (Rh*-PCN) through a bulk- and surface-engineering strategy. The optimized Rh*-PCN showed a maximum initial reaction rate of 16.80&#160;mmol&#160;g-1&#160;h-1 for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. By integrating Rh*-PCN with glutamate dehydrogenase, we established an enzyme-photo-coupled catalytic system capable of driving artificial photosynthesis for L-glutamate production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon nitride (CN), a well-known photocatalyst, has been extensively utilized in light-driven redox reactions, including NADH regeneration. However, its catalytic efficiency is hindered by rapid charge recombination due to obstructed electron transfer. Herein, we developed a highly porous CN coated with a thin layer of rhodium complex (Rh*-PCN) through a combination of bulk and surface engineering for enhanced NADH regeneration. The bulk-engineered porous network of PCN facilitates oriented electron transfer in Rh*-PCN, while the surface-engineered Rh layer minimizes the electron transfer distance between PCN and the rhodium complex. Rh*-PCN achieves an initial NADH regeneration rate of 16.80&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8315;&#185;&#160;h&#8315;&#185;. Moreover, Rh*-PCN suppresses enzyme deactivation by compartmentalizing the enzyme from the photogenerated holes on PCN and the rhodium complex. When integrated with glutamate dehydrogenase, the Rh*-PCN/enzyme coupled system produces L-glutamic acid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microscale Tattooing of Hydrogels and Cells: Benzoxaborole&#8208;Driven Microcontact Printing (&#181;CP) on Glycosylated Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a polymer brush&#8208;assisted microcontact printing (&#181;CP) to pattern glycosylated surfaces. We used a benzoboraxole derivative as an ink for surface patterning. With this novel method, we could functionalize wafer surfaces possessing glycopolymer films, surface&#8208;glycosylated polymer microparticles as well as cellular interfaces.








Abstract
Microcontact printing (&#181;CP) is a widely used technique for microscale surface patterning. In this study, we present a polymer&#8208;supported &#181;CP method for the patterning of (bioactive) glycosylated surfaces under hydrated conditions. Patterning is achieved by direct contact with a grooved polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp, whose surface was grafted with a dopamine&#8208;containing polymer. The polymer brushes offer an anchor for the boronic acid derivative 6&#8208;aminobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ol (ABOB), used as an ink for surface functionalization, to introduce patterns to three different surfaces as substrates: (1) monosaccharide&#8208;modified hydrogel surfaces possessing aldose (glucose, fucose, galactose) or ketose (fructose, sorbose) functions; (2) glycosylated surfaces of polymeric microspheres; and (3) the membranes of mammalian cells, such as human primary gastric cells and others. During &#181;CP, ABOB patterns transferred to the target surface through the formation of carbohydrate&#8208;ABOB complexes at fully hydrated, neutral pH conditions. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the successful transfer of ABOB patterns to glycosylated surfaces, with clear &#8220;tattoo&#8208;like&#8221; signatures observed on hydrogels, glycosylated particle surfaces and cellular interfaces.

         <title>Efficient Red Light&#8211;Driven Singlet Oxygen Photocatalysis with an Osmium&#8208;Based Coulombic Dyad</title>

Red light&#8208;absorbing bichromophores with straightforward preparation and superior photocatalytic activity were developed. Spectroscopic studies provided deep insights into the intra&#8208;ion&#8208;pair energy transfer key step and the novel approach.








Abstract
Photoactive osmium complexes are widely used sensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen because they can be excited directly into their triplet states with low&#8208;energy red light. However, their short&#8208;lived excited states reduce quenching efficiencies and reaction quantum yields significantly. To elongate the excited state lifetime, osmium complexes have been linked to organic chromophores to form molecular dyads. This approach, although effective, is time&#8208; and resource&#8208;consuming, hampering larger&#8208;scale applications. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward approach by directly mixing a readily available cationic osmium complex and an anionic perylene derivative in solution. Strong Coulombic interactions facilitate rapid energy transfer (&#8764;100&#160;ps) from the excited osmium complex to the perylene derivative, mimicking a dyad&#8208;like system. Detailed spectroscopic investigations revealed an increased singlet oxygen formation rate by over one order of magnitude at sub&#8208;millimolar perylene concentrations, attributed to i) the three orders of magnitude longer lifetime of the perylene triplet state produced via intra&#8208;ion&#8208;pair energy transfer and ii) an inherently high singlet oxygen quantum yield of that key species. The novel catalyst system enables highly productive photooxygenations in water and in a MeOH/H2O 10:1 mixture, highlighting the broad applicability and versatility of the Coulombic dyad approach for photocatalytic synthesis and wastewater treatment.

         <title>Photosensitizer Repositioning Affords an Enantiocomplementary Enzyme for [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we capitalize on the versatility offered by genetic code expansion to develop a proficient photoenzyme for [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloadditions that is enantiocomplementary to our recently developed photoenzyme EnT1.3. By repositioning the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer and subsequent directed evolution, we have developed an efficient, highly selective and oxygen tolerant enzyme for a range of [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloadditions.








Abstract
The combination of genetic code expansion and directed evolution has recently given rise to enantioselective photoenzymes for [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloadditions of quinolone and indole derivatives. However, the enzymes reported to date only allow access to one enantiomeric series of the strained cyclobutane products. Here, guided by a crystal structure of our previously engineered enzyme EnT1.3, we show how judicious repositioning of the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer affords an enantiocomplementary [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cyclase, CEnT1.0. Following directed evolution, a proficient and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoenzyme (CEnT1.4) emerged that promotes [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloadditions of a quinolone derivative with exquisite enantiocontrol (99% e.e.) and substantially enhanced regioselectivity compared with EnT1.3 (r.r. 62:1&#160;vs. 9:1). Structural analysis of CEnT1.4, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, reveals a well&#8208;sculpted active site pocket that pre&#8208;organises the substrate for regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalysis. This study highlights the versatility offered by genetically programmed (photo)catalytic elements when developing enzymes for altered stereochemical outcomes.

         <title>A Phenomenological Symmetry Rule for Chemical Reactivity Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general symmetry rule emerges from the study of charge transfer complexes in cavities that points to an underlying framework to the predict the outcome of chemical reactivity under vibrational strong coupling.








Abstract
Symmetry is known to strongly influence the course of a chemical reaction. It has also been found to play a key role in vibrational strong coupling (VSC), where it can influence the outcome of chemical reactions or alter chemical equilibria. However, the precise nature of this effect and its extent remains elusive. To further explore the role of vibrational symmetry, we have investigated the equilibrium constants of different charge transfer complexes, in particular of isomers of trimethyl benzene belonging to different point groups from which a general symmetry rule emerges. We describe the strongly coupled system by a direct product of irreducible representations associated with the complexes and the cavity. As a consequence, the coupled vibration is associated with a new irreducible representation that projects differently on the reaction coordinate of the charge transfer complexation, reflecting the changes in the equilibrium constants. This phenomenological symmetry rule points to a general underlying framework for predicting the outcome of chemical reactivity under VSC.

         <title>Ru Single Atoms Anchored in Metal Borides Enable Hydrogen Spillover for Superior Electrochemical Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;decorated nanoporous metal borides are developed as high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalysts utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. This strategy facilitates dissociation of water into *H and promotes the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface, thereby synergistically reducing the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. 








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate represents a promising and sustainable route for valuable ammonia generation. However, a vital challenge in the nitrate reduction reaction is an insufficient supply of active hydrogen (*H) and slow kinetics at a low working potential, which result in low production efficiency and high energy consumption. Here, we report the single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;decorated nanoporous metal borides as a high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalyst utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. Notably, the RuSA/np&#8208;Ni3B exhibits a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.2%, an NH3 yield of 30.4&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1, and an energy efficiency of 39.1% at &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus RHE. In situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that single&#8208;atom Ru anchored in nanoporous Ni3B not only can efficiently dissociate water into *H and simultaneously promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface but also can optimize surface states of Ni3B active centers, which synergistically reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer integrating nitrate reduction reaction with furfuryl alcohol oxidation reaction achieves current density of 1&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.72&#160;V with 100&#160;h stability, improving the energy efficiency and economy of the system.

         <title>Glycosylation&#8208;Dependent Stability of Human Pentraxin&#8208;2 Revealed by Surface&#8208;Induced Dissociation and Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate glycosylation pattern of human Pentraxin&#8208;2 (PTX&#8208;2) poses a challenge in studying the structural impact of individual glycans. By combining surface&#8208;induced dissociation (SID) or unfolding (SIU) with ion mobility mass spectrometry, we successfully differentiated the stability of glycoengineered PTX&#8208;2 variants. Our approach specifically revealed how terminal sialylation influences both complex and subunit stability.








Abstract
Pentraxin&#8208;2 (PTX&#8208;2), also known as Serum Amyloid P component, functions as an immunoregulatory glycoprotein and plays a crucial role in fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Desialylation of PTX&#8208;2 has recently been associated with reduced bioactivity and diminished inhibition of fibrocyte differentiation in IPF patients. Each monomer in the naturally assembled pentameric complex is N&#8208;glycosylated, predominantly featuring terminal sialic acids on biantennary glycans. However, the influence of these glycoforms on PTX&#8208;2&#8242;s mechanism of action (MoA) and conformational properties has not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, we demonstrate the combined application of surface&#8208;induced dissociation (SID) and ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) to assess the impact of specific glyco&#8208;engineered PTX&#8208;2 variants on the stability of its pentameric and decameric complexes. We further explore the effect of individual monomer glycosylation on complex stability. Our results reveal that high levels of terminal sialylation significantly enhance complex stability, whereas desialylation and mannosylation reduce the stability of both pentameric and decameric PTX&#8208;2 forms. Regarding the stability of single PTX&#8208;2 monomers ejected from the pentamer, in contrast, we found that desialylated and highly mannosylated glycans contribute to the individual monomer stability.

         <title>Selective Nanopore Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A and B in a Single Sample</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a nanopore&#8208;based sensing strategy for ultrasensitive and selective detection of MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B. Utilizing enzyme&#8208;specific peptide transformations and &#945;&#8208;hemolysin nanopores with cucurbit[7]uril, our method achieves picomolar detection, real&#8208;time analysis, and high specificity in cellular and tissue samples, offering a powerful tool for neurological research, diagnostics, and drug screening.








Abstract
Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B) are key enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and are critical biomarkers for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Here, we present a highly sensitive nanopore&#8208;based method for the selective detection and quantification of MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B using specifically designed peptide probes. These probes undergo enzyme&#8208;specific oxidation, generating distinct nanopore translocation signatures that enable precise identification. Our method achieves picomolar&#8208;level detection, outperforming conventional assays such as ELISA. Importantly, we demonstrate its applicability in complex biological samples, including cell lysates (SH&#8208;SY5Y and HepG2) and mouse brain and liver tissues, with results strongly correlating with ELISA. The ability to selectively detect both enzymes within a single sample highlights its advantage in studying enzyme interplay in biological systems. This label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time approach offers a powerful tool for biomedical research, disease diagnostics, and drug screening, with potential for expanding to other clinically relevant enzymes.

         <title>PyBOX&#8208;Integrated Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino acid chiral pool synthesis strategy has been developed for the construction of 1D chiral covalent organic frameworks incorporating a PyBOX skeleton. Subsequent metalation with an ice crystal&#8208;templated freeze&#8208;drying process led to sustainable heterogeneous catalysts for scalable asymmetric acetalization and A3&#8208;coupling reactions.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts based on chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) are the new sensation in asymmetric catalysis. The pyridine&#8208;bis(oxazoline) (PyBOX), on the other hand, is a well&#8208;known class of privileged chiral ligands that can be incorporated with various metal ions for diversified homogeneous asymmetric organic transformations. The integration of the PyBOX into the COF platform will undoubtedly lead to a new breed of heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts. Herein, we report the first example of PyBOX&#8208;based CCOF via chiral pool synthesis for scale&#8208;up catalytic asymmetric acetalization and A3&#8208;coupling reaction. This research provides a novel type of sustainable COF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalyst with gratifying functionalities.

         <title>Thermodynamics of Water Displacement from Binding Sites and its Contributions to Supramolecular and Biomolecular Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The affinity between a guest and a macrocyclic host depends strongly on the water encapsulated inside the host cavity, with free&#8208;energy variations on the order of 20&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 being possible even in the absence of direct host&#8208;guest interactions. This conclusion&#8211;which contrasts alternative views&#8211;can be drawn from molecular dynamics simulations for the binding of a guest with pseudo&#8208;hard&#8208;sphere potential and cucurbit[8]uril host models with varying polarity and polarizability.








Abstract
The role of water displacement in noncovalent binding has been debated in the fields of supramolecular chemistry and drug design. We use molecular dynamics simulations of idealized host&#8208;guest systems to address the long&#8208;standing controversy of whether water is merely a bystander or an actual driver of noncovalent binding in aqueous solution. To isolate hydration effects, we consider a pseudo&#8208;hard&#8208;sphere guest binding to a series of cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based macrocyclic host models whose energetic interactions with water vary widely. The computed free energy cost of displacing water from binding sites ranges from 0 to +37&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, strongly influencing binding affinities. However, neither water density nor excess chemical potential reliably indicates the thermodynamic favorability of cavity water. These results support the concept that &#8220;unfavorable&#8221; binding site water contributes to high&#8208;affinity binding and resolve the paradox of stable but thermodynamically unfavorable cavity water. This work provides insights into the nature of the hydrophobic effect in molecular recognition and offers a framework for understanding the role of water in binding across various host&#8208;guest and protein&#8208;ligand systems.

This conclusion&#8211;which contrasts alternative views&#8211;can be drawn from molecular dynamics simulations for the binding of a guest with pseudo-hard-sphere potential and cucurbit[8]uril host models with varying polarity and polarizability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of water displacement in noncovalent binding has been debated in the fields of supramolecular chemistry and drug design. We use molecular dynamics simulations of idealized host-guest systems to address the long-standing controversy of whether water is merely a bystander or an actual driver of noncovalent binding in aqueous solution. To isolate hydration effects, we consider a pseudo-hard-sphere guest binding to a series of cucurbit[8]uril-based macrocyclic host models whose energetic interactions with water vary widely. The computed free energy cost of displacing water from binding sites ranges from 0 to +37&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, strongly influencing binding affinities. However, neither water density nor excess chemical potential reliably indicates the thermodynamic favorability of cavity water. These results support the concept that &#8220;unfavorable&#8221; binding site water contributes to high-affinity binding and resolve the paradox of stable but thermodynamically unfavorable cavity water. This work provides insights into the nature of the hydrophobic effect in molecular recognition and offers a framework for understanding the role of water in binding across various host-guest and protein-ligand systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multipoint Coordinative Capture of Olefinic Substrates Utilizing Metal&#8208;Carbon Bonds by Macrocyclic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a macrocyclic tetranuclear palladium complex, which has four coordination sites within its inner cavity as a host molecule. The complex captured squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with six C&#9552;C double bonds, through multipoint palladium&#8208;carbon bonds, and formed a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. The host also selectively captured methyl &#945;&#8208;linolenate over methyl oleate and methyl linoleate.








Abstract
Terpenoids and unsaturated fatty acids containing C&#9552;C double bonds are biologically and synthetically important compounds. The transformation of these substrates catalyzed by proteins relies on precise molecular capture. However, achieving precise molecular recognition of C&#9552;C double bonds using synthetically designed hosts remains a significant challenge. We now report a macrocyclic palladium tetranuclear complex that functions as a synthetic receptor featuring coordination sites within its inner cavity. This receptor selectively binds specific double bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates. Squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with chemically similar six isoprenoid units, was captured by the macrocyclic complex through the coordination of four out of the six C&#9552;C double bonds, leading to a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. Furthermore, the macrocyclic complex exhibited stronger binding affinity for methyl linolenate compared to methyl oleate or methyl linoleate through multipoint coordinative capture. This unprecedented approach to multipoint coordination of specific unsaturated bonds contrasts sharply with biological and traditional artificial receptors, which typically rely on intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic effects. By achieving precise capture and folding of flexible olefinic substrates, this study establishes a new paradigm for the design of artificial host molecules and a novel platform for enzyme&#8208;like reaction vessels.

         <title>Breaking the Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Direct Levulinate Hydrodeoxygenation to Pentanoic Biofuels over La&#8208;Modulated Ru&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts</title>

This work presents the vital roles of La modification in metal&#8208;zeolite bifunctional catalysts for breaking the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the direct hydrodeoxygenation of biomass&#8208;derived ethyl levulinate into pentanoate biofuels. Optimal La modulation can maximize the density of the active Br&#248;nsted acid sites for enhancing the activity, and attenuate the acid strength for efficiently suppressing the secondary reactions.








Abstract
Disentangling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates has been a great challenge in biomass valorization and related tandem catalysis, by virtue of involving a series of reactions in parallel and in cascade. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of La modulation for Ru&#8208;zeolite combinations in the case of direct HDO of neat ethyl levulinate (EL) into ethyl pentanoate (EP). An unprecedented EP yield of 80% and an EP turnover rate (TOR) of 224 molEP&#183;molRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, together with excellent stability, were obtained for the optimal Ru/2.8La&#8208;Y catalyst for the first time, compared to the current reported &#8220;performance ceiling&#8221; of EP yields of &lt;40% and EP TORs of &lt;120 molEP&#183;molmetal&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under similar conditions. Optimal La modulation could maximize the density of the active Br&#248;nsted acid sites and efficiently attenuate the acid strength, thus enhancing both activity and selectivity in the direct HDO of EL into EP while suppressing the further hydrolysis reactions that consume EP. This study provides an effective approach to regulate the acid properties of metal&#8208;zeolite bifunctional catalysts, in particular in mediation of compromise in acid density and acid strength factors, for breaking the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in biomass valorization and beyond.

         <title>EDTA&#8208;Mg Nano&#8208;Chelators Amplify Ferroptosis by Artificially Simulating the Epithelial&#8208;Mesenchymal Transition Process and Endogenous Iron Deprivation</title>

Based on metal chelation therapy, we utilize the chelation performance of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) for different divalent metal ions to achieve the precise regulation of the epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in tumors and simultaneously synergize ferroptosis and immunotherapy to effectively inhibit the growth and metastasis of tumors.








Abstract
Epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step in initiating tumor metastasis. Commonly, researchers focus on inhibiting EMT to prevent tumor metastasis. However, they ignore that tumor cells undergoing EMT are more vulnerable to disturbance from the external environment. Tumor cells in this period are a potential therapeutic target, yet precisely regulating the EMT of tumor cells remains a challenging problem to be solved. Here, based on metal chelation therapy, we propose a strategy of artificially mimicking EMT, integrating ferroptosis and immunotherapy to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. The prepared ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid&#8208;magnesium (EDTA&#8208;Mg), on the one hand, chelates Ca2+ on the surface of tumor cells to form EDTA&#8208;Ca, causing the dissociation of tumor cells. Meanwhile, E&#8208;cadherin is downregulated, while Vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP&#8208;2) are upregulated, indicating the occurrence of EMT. On the other hand, after EDTA&#8208;Ca is endocytosed by tumor cells, it deprives Fe in the lysosomes to form EDTA&#8208;Fe, which induces ferroptosis through a Fenton reaction. Ferroptosis, combined with the initially released Mg2+, synergistically amplifies the immune response, thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, such a strategy of artificially simulating EMT for tumor treatment has hitherto not been reported.

         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective hydrosilylation reaction of acyclic alkyl gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes was developed, giving various chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl silanes with vicinal carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers. A diverse array of stereospecific transformations were performed using these enriched silanes. Comprehensive mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, support Ni(I)&#8211;H mechanism. 








Abstract
The asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of aliphatic alkenes without auxiliary or stabilizing groups presents a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. We report herein the nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, which enables the generation of chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the simultaneous construction of carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers was achieved with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity using prochiral silanes. This method provides an efficient approach to access sp3&#8208;enriched C&#8208;stereogenic centers equipped with high&#8208;value difluoromethyl groups. The resulting enantioenriched silanes could undergo a range of stereospecific transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the detailed mechanism.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Access to (3,11)&#8208;Cyclotaxanes&#8212;Synthesis of 1&#8208;Hydroxytaxuspine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Belonging to the family of complex taxanes, 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C is a densely functionalized natural product. The synthesis was realized via a semisynthetic approach, starting from commercially available 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III. A late&#8208;stage photocyclization was utilized to install the characteristic transannular bond of complex taxanes, transforming the classical framework into the intricate cyclotaxane skeleton on gram&#8208;scale.








Abstract
Herein, we present the semisynthesis of complex taxane diterpenoid 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C. Starting from cheap and abundant 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III, a scalable and robust route was developed, enabling an unprecedented gram&#8208;scale access to the intricate (3,11)&#8208;cyclotaxane scaffold. In addition, this represents the first synthetic access to C1&#8208;hydroxylated cyclotaxanes. The natural product is synthesized in 17 steps, with the reactions being performed on decagram&#8208;scale up to an advanced intermediate, establishing the scalability of this approach.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of (&#8722;)&#8208;Sodagnitin E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Malabaricane triterpenoid sodagnitin E is a chromogen found in various toadstools. This work represents the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;sodagnitin E as well as the first total synthesis of any malabaricane natural product. A Mukaiyama aldol reaction was utilized to perform a convergent synthesis from two enantioselectively synthesized fragments. Additionally, a structural revision of the relative configuration of sodagnitin E is proposed.








Abstract
We report the total synthesis of malabaricane triterpene sodagnitin E, marking the first synthesis of any malabaricane natural product to date. The enantioselective synthesis of two key fragments, followed by their coupling via a Mukaiyama aldol reaction delivered the triterpene framework in a convergent synthesis. A thorough analysis of the synthetic material led to the elucidation of a previously unassigned stereocenter (C17) as well as the reassignment of the configuration at C27. This enabled the structural revision of the relative configuration at the central lactol moiety.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Crystalline Double&#8208;Layer Carbon Nitride Networks Stabilized in Bi7C10N18(N3(1&#8208;x)O3x)</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;pressure chemical reaction between Bi and various hydrogen&#8208;free C&#9472;N precursors induced by the infrared laser heating in a diamond anvil cell leads to the formation of a compound Bi7C10N18(N3(1&#8208;x)O3x), featuring double layers of poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine [C4N6x&#8208;]n and non&#8208;polymerized guanidinate anions CN35&#8208;. The unprecedented 2D&#8208;polymerized anionic C&#9472;N network represents the intermediate between highly charged CN35&#8208; guanidinate anions and fully condensed graphitic carbon nitride networks.








Abstract
Application of high&#8208;pressure conditions in chemical synthesis has proven to access a wide range of novel nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds and to overcome the stability of the dinitrogen molecule. In the present work, we report the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature (HPHT) synthesis of Bi7C10N18(N3(1&#8208;x)O3x), which features double&#8208;layers of poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine [C4N6x&#8208;]n and non&#8208;polymerized guanidinate anions CN35&#8208;. The structure model was determined by means of synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and is fully corroborated by theoretical calculations. The poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine illustrates an example of a 2D polymerized anionic C&#9472;N network and represents the first intermediate between highly charged CN35&#8722; anions and fully condensed graphitic carbon nitride networks achieved by HPHT conditions. This opens a pathway to a widely varied family of hydrogen&#8208;free nitridocarbonates, which has the potential to develop into an alternative synthesis route to classical polycondensation reactions.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Enabled Stable Oxygen Redox in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes via &#960;&#8208;Type Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial Li/Ni disordered via hydrothermal treatment is achieved in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials to trigger a robust &#960;&#8208;type interaction between metal and ligand. The reductive coupling (charge transfer from O 2p to Ni t2g) and induced symmetry breaking of NiO6 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, which avoids excessive irreversible oxygen release from non&#8208;bonding O 2p state.








Abstract
Effectively stabilizing oxygen redox is the most challenging task for the practical applications of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. However, how to accurately tune the oxygen energy level to achieve reversible redox remains puzzling so far. In this work, we achieve stable oxygen redox in layered Li&#8208;rich materials over the whole voltage range without irreversible O2 release by adjusting the interlayer metal cation environment adjacent to the ligand. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis of metal&#8208;ligand orbital combinations, we confirm the obvious charge transfer from O to Ni due to the &#960;&#8208;type interaction between Ni 3d spin&#8208;down t2g orbitals and O 2p orbitals. Furthermore, Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Ni coordination environment after Li extraction under the &#960;&#8208;type interaction, which enhances the intrinsic competition between anion and cation oxidation, keeping &#960;* state (from O 2p splitting) below the metal band to avoid over&#8208;oxidation. As a result, the modified material shows improved electrochemical performance and stable structural/interface evolution. This work provides new insights into the relationship between the adjacent metal environment and the ligand O redox reactions.

Two types of Ru configurations of single atoms anchored on graphene&#8208;like framework supporting WC1&#8208;x substrates with was constructed by simple Joule heating rapid carbonization for high&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The spatial distance between Ru&#8208;anchored active sites governed by Ru content plays a crucial role in modulating the electronic structure at the reactive center. This tailored electronic feature reduces the reaction energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determine step, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of HER.









Abstract
The correlation between metal loading and overall catalytic performance remains elusive for single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SACs), which hinders the oriented optimization of active site densities and scalable synthesis of them. To effectively address this issue, Ru single atoms with different loading are anchored on the graphene&#8208;like framework and tungsten carbide substrate (WC1&#8208;x) to investigate the synergistic effect among different local configurations. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the loading of Ru atoms critically governs the interatomic distance between adjacent metal active sites at second shell coordination. In situ Raman spectroscopy shows that WC1&#8208;x nanoparticles can break the hydrogen bond network by reorienting H2O molecule adsorption and promoting the availability of active H2O among electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the moderate distance between active sites could further lower the reaction barrier and enhance the catalytic activity. Consequently, the optimal sample Ru&#8208;WC1&#8208;x with 0.76&#160;wt% Ru loading exhibits a low overpotential of 7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and the anion exchange membrane electrolyzer to stably operate for 100&#160;h at 1&#160;A&#8901;cm&#8722;2. Such correlation of spatial effects between different active sites were universally demonstrated in similar systems anchored with either Pt, Ir, or Co elements.

Inspired by the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones on the stability and functionality of proteins, we present in this study the development of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) as chaperones for DNAzymes. Integration of TDF with DNAzymes significantly improves sensitivity and stability, facilitating precise and quantitative mapping of local trace metal ion concentrations on live neuronal cell membranes. This adaptable approach sets a foundation for developing sensitive nanodevices based on DNAzymes.








Abstract
The transient release of metal ions at neuronal cell membranes holds significant implications in neurophysiology and pathology. Consequently, there is a pressing need for sensitive methodologies capable of quantitatively mapping local metal ion concentrations in live cells, aiming to unravel potential mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. DNAzymes have emerged as versatile tools for metal ion detection in live cells, owing to their specificity and other inherent advantages. Efforts to broaden their utility have focused on enhancing the stability and sensitivity of DNAzymes. Inspired by the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones on the stability and functionality of proteins, we present in this study the development of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) as chaperones for DNAzymes, aiming at enhancing the stability and activity of DNAzymes. Integration of TDF with DNAzymes is shown to significantly enhance metal ion detection performance, resulting in elevated stability and a two&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity, attributed to alterations in the local net charge induced by TDF. In vitro investigations demonstrate that the nanodevice developed here faithfully maps Cu2+ concentrations within a range of 0&#8211;10&#160;&#181;M on the membrane of neuronal cells, meeting the requirements for Cu2+ sensing under both physiological and pathological conditions. This work presents an easily adaptable approach to enhance the performance of DNAzymes and lays the foundations for the development of other DNAzyme&#8208;based sensitive detection nanodevices.

         <title>Design of Fluorine&#8208;Free Weakly Coordinating Electrolyte Solvents with Enhanced Oxidative Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of silicon is systematically explored as a sustainable strategy to design weakly solvating electrolytes for lithium&#8208;based batteries. After identifying a promising molecular structure via computational screening, coordination spheres and their correlation with electrochemical key performance indicators are compared between electrolyte formulations, revealing that negative hyperconjugation enhances their oxidative stability.








Abstract
High concentrations of conducting salt in electrolyte formulations enhance the agglomeration of ionic species, which has been demonstrated to yield anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases and improved reversibility in several battery configurations. However, industrial application of these electrolytes may be limited due to high costs of electrolyte conducting salts. Here, weakly solvating electrolyte solvents with tailored coordination strength have been established as an approach to achieve ionic agglomeration at moderate conducting salt concentrations and without per&#8208;fluorinated diluents. However, the inevitable presence of uncoordinated solvent molecules in this electrolyte concept renders them susceptible to oxidative decomposition. Although previous efforts demonstrated fluorination as an effective design strategy to tailor the oxidative stability of weakly solvating electrolytes, the per&#8208;fluorinated solvents are toxic and harmful to the environment. Herein, the incorporation of silicon is evaluated as an eco&#8208;friendly approach to dispel electron density of the oxygen lone pair. Though steric demand of substituents is already sufficient to tailor the coordination strength, negative hyperconjugation effectively expands the oxidative stability limit of weakly solvating electrolytes. Combining ion agglomeration and intrinsic oxidative stability, the herein introduced weakly solvating electrolyte enables a notable improvement of reversibility under eco&#8208;friendly conditions, presenting a valid alternative to fluorinated electrolyte solvents.

         <title>Developing HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;Tag Chemical Inducers of Dimerization to Probe Receptor Oligomerization and Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling protein interactions is key to studying signaling. Antibody methods have limits, but chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) using HaloTags and SNAP&#8208;Tags offer precise control. We present CIDs to covalently link heteromers with varied linkers and a FRET&#8208;based sensor. Applied to different tagged cell surface receptors, this allows study of proximity&#8208;induced, ligand&#8208;independent&#160;signaling, including an inherent optical readout.








Abstract
Controlling protein&#8211;protein interactions is critical for dissecting signaling pathways, especially those initiated by ligand&#8208;receptor interactions, which alter receptor oligomerization and drive downstream signaling cascades. Traditional methods for driving protein&#8211;protein complexes use antibodies that face limitations in terms of stoichiometry, geometric rigidity, and antibody specificity. Chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) for fusion proteins such as HaloTag (Halo) and SNAP&#8208;Tags (SNAP) offer precise and covalent control of protein proximities, overcoming limitations of antibody&#8208;dependent methods. In this study, we expand the toolkit of Halo and SNAP CIDs with (1) benzylguanine (BG) and HaloTag ligand (HTL) crosslinkers featuring varying polyethylene glycol linker lengths and update this kit with (2) a FRET&#8208;based dimerizing sensor to induce and verify protein proximity. Here we establish our CIDs on extracellularly Halo&#8208; and SNAP&#8208;tagged TGF&#946;, BMP, neurotrophic factor, and metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby elucidating the signaling potential of ligand&#8208;independent dimerization in a heteromeric fashion.

         <title>Selective and Energy Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion through Anion Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed blended OH&#8722; and Cl&#8722; electrolyte to alter the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction microenvironment, achieving ethanol faradaic efficiency of 50% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The blended anions cooperatively promoted ethanol production by increasing *CO coverage and modulating the reactivity of key branching intermediate *CHCOH.








Abstract
Ethanol, with its high market value and stable global demand, stands out as an attractive product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, achieving high ethanol selectivity and energy efficiency at industrial current densities remains challenging. In this study, we employed a blended anion modulation strategy to enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion. The Cu2(OH)3F pre&#8208;catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiencies of 50% and 93% for ethanol and C2+, respectively, at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a blended electrolyte consisting of 2&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M KCl. Comprehensive electrochemical tests, combined with in situ characterizations and theoretical analysis, revealed that chloride and hydroxide increased *CO coverage for efficient C&#9472;C coupling.

&lt;p&gt;We employed blended OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; electrolyte to alter the electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction microenvironment, achieving ethanol faradaic efficiency of 50% at 700&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The blended anions cooperatively promoted ethanol production by increasing *CO coverage and modulating the reactivity of key branching intermediate *CHCOH.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol, with its high market value and stable global demand, stands out as an attractive product of electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. However, achieving high ethanol selectivity and energy efficiency at industrial current densities remains challenging. In this study, we employed a blended anion modulation strategy to enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion. The Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F pre-catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiencies of 50% and 93% for ethanol and C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, at 700&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a blended electrolyte consisting of 2&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M KCl. Comprehensive electrochemical tests, combined with in situ characterizations and theoretical analysis, revealed that chloride and hydroxide increased *CO coverage for efficient C&#9472;C coupling. Moreover, hydroxide stabilizes the *CHCOH intermediate through hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed hydroxide on the catalyst surface, while Cl synergistically enhances its reactivity by promoting water dissociation toward the ethanol pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orbital Coupling&#8208;Engineered Coordination&#8208;Unsaturated CuAg Nanochains Drives Spontaneous Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation and Zn&#8208;C2H2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs) is synthesized for ethylene electrocatalytic production, achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. The orbital coupling between the Cu0.5Ag CNCs catalyst and the C2H2 molecules is enhanced and forms a high *H demand surface, where the acetylene hydrogenation process occurs spontaneously without energy barrier. It provides a new way to realize the orbital coupling engineering of coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalysts.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) offers a mild and sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet it faces critical challenges including competitive C&#9472;C coupling for 1,3&#8208;butadiene due to insufficient proton supply and hydrogen evolution under high current densities. To address these limitations, we design a coordination&#8208;unsaturated CuAg bimetallic catalyst with cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs), which synergistically regulates proton dynamics, maintaining high activity from 0.1 to 0.6 A cm&#8722;2 and achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the introduction of Cu makes the d&#8208;band center in Cu0.5Ag CNCs upshift toward the Fermi level, strengthening orbital coupling with C2H2 and creating a high *H demand surface. In situ spectroscopic and density functional theory analyses demonstrate that coordination&#8208;unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag interfacial sites promote spontaneous C2H2 hydrogenation, especially bypassing formation barriers of *C2H2 and *C2H3. This thermodynamic superiority originates from sufficient proton supply and exothermic *H consumption for C2H2 hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst enables a Zn&#8208;C2H2 battery with a power density of 2.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, showcasing dual functionality in electrosynthesis and energy storage. Our work establishes a paradigm for coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalyst design through orbital coupling engineering, providing atomic&#8208;level insights into proton&#8208;mediated reaction control for sustainable chemical manufacturing.

Abstract
Side&#8208;on coordinated molecular hypofluorites FM(&#951;2&#8208;OF) (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) were prepared by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated alkaline earth metal atoms with diluted OF2 in cryogenic matrices. The structures parallel the non&#8208;VESPR structures of alkaline earth metal difluorides and dihydrides, such that FMg(&#951;2&#8208;OF) is planar, FCa(&#951;2&#8208;OF) is planar but with a shallow bending&#8208;potential curve, while FSr(&#951;2&#8208;OF) and FBa(&#951;2&#8208;OF) are non&#8208;planar. Bonding analyses show that the interactions between the metal center M2+ and the negatively charged ligands F&#8722; and OF&#8722; are mainly electrostatic. Moreover, for FMg(&#951;2&#8208;OF), donation of electron density from OF&#8722; to empty s and p orbitals of magnesium is involved. However, for the heavier alkaline earth metal compounds, the donation to empty d orbitals of the metal center becomes dominant in orbital interactions, which contributes to their non&#8208;planar structures.

         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted assembly strategy has been developed for the construction of high&#8208;nuclearity copper nanoclusters. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray scintillation properties of the high&#8208;nuclearity nanocluster are investigated for the first time, demonstrating their potential for advanced radiation detection applications.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;nuclearity, atomically precise copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters remains a formidable challenge due to their high reactivity and&#160;strong aggregation tendency. Here, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted assembly strategy that enables the ambient&#8208;condition synthesis of two robust copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the different core structures including [(C2)8@Cu50] (Cu50) and [(C2)10@Cu56] (Cu56). Both clusters feature distinctive metal shells stabilized by synergistic Cu&#9472;C/O coordination interactions and an extensive outer&#8208;layer hydrogen&#8208;bonding network between the hydroxyl groups of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol &#160;and CF3COO&#8722; ligands,&#160;enhancing molecular rigidity and inoxidizability. Notably, Cu50 displays strong yellow phosphorescence and prominent X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence (XEL). More significantly, it represents the first high&#8208;nuclearity copper nanocluster to be processed into a scintillator film, which exhibits promising X&#8208;ray imaging performance. The present work not only establishes a generalizable hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted assembly strategy for constructing stable, high&#8208;nuclearity copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters, but also demonstrates their practical applicability in X&#8208;ray scintillation, providing new insights into the synthetic design and functional diversification of nanocluster&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Induced Atomic Diffusion in a Molecular Metal Cluster Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the formation and dynamic behavior of atomic vacancy in an organometallic palladium cluster complex. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis and theoretical calculations of the Pd12 cluster [Pd12(C7H7)6][B(ArF)4]2 suggest that an atomic vacancy migrates rapidly at the surface of the metal cluster on the NMR timescale, leading to the vacancy&#8208;induced atomic diffusion in a molecule.








Abstract
The presence of atomic vacancies in a close&#8208;packed material is believed to allow the migration of atoms adjacent to the vacancies, which induces dynamics of atoms. However, it is not known whether atoms in discrete molecules can undergo vacancy&#8208;induced dynamics. We describe herein the generation of a close&#8208;packed Pd12 cluster complex [Pd12(C7H7)6][B(ArF)4]n (n&#160;=&#160;2, 3) with a Pd&#8208;atom vacancy, and the observation of the diffusion of Pd atoms. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis, X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretical calculations indicate that an atomic vacancy is located at the surface sites of the Pd12 core, and that it migrates rapidly on the NMR timescale. This means that all 11 palladium atoms at the surface undergo self&#8208;diffusion with a low energy barrier. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that atomic diffusion occurs within a molecule through the vacancy mechanism.

         <title>Unlocking Dual Recycling in Photo&#8208;Curable Polycyanurate Thermosets Derived from Bio&#8208;Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway recycling strategy for polycyanurate thermosets is presented. The thermosets are prepared by curing a bio&#8208;derived eugenol&#8208;based triazine monomer with various dithiols via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization. Recyclability is enabled through two distinct SNAr&#8208;based depolymerization approaches: selective monomer recovery and closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. The recycled materials retain their original performance.








Abstract
Polycyanurate thermosets are extensively utilized in high&#8208;performance applications due to their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, their inherently crosslinked nature has traditionally rendered them nonrecyclable, limiting their sustainability. Recent studies have demonstrated that these networks can undergo dynamic rearrangement under specific conditions, enabling reversibility. In this study, a bio&#8208;derived cyanurate monomer from eugenol was synthesized and polymerized via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization, yielding recyclable polycyanurate thermosets with robust material properties. The dynamic character of these networks was leveraged through nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) chemistry, unlocking two distinct recycling pathways: i) selective monomer recovery and ii) closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. Depolymerization in the presence of eugenol enabled the selective recovery of well&#8208;defined monomeric components, while phenol&#8208;mediated cleavage facilitated polymer breakdown into chemically recyclable intermediates, which were directly reassembled into reformed thermosets. Both recycling pathways resulted in regenerated polymers that retained their original thermal, mechanical, and thermomechanical properties, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of this approach. By establishing a controlled depolymerization and reassembly framework, this study introduces a sustainable design strategy for achieving closed&#8208;loop recycling in high&#8208;performance thermosets, providing a scalable pathway toward circular polymer materials.

         <title>Accelerating Responsive RNA Release Through Structural Optimization of Disulfide&#8208;Containing Acyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a redox&#8208;responsive strategy for precise RNA control via postsynthetic 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation. These introduced disulfide&#8208;containing acyl groups can be selectively cleaved upon exposure to both exogenous and endogenous glutathione (GSH), enabling traceless RNA release and functional recovery. This approach offers a versatile tool for modifying and manipulating RNAs of diverse lengths or origins.








Abstract
Chemical methods for modifying and manipulating RNA are crucial for advancing its biological studies and applications. While postsynthetic 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation has enabled on&#8208;demand RNA activation, its application to larger, biologically relevant RNAs remains challenging. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;responsive RNA modification via postsynthetic acylation to functionalize RNAs. Three strategies were developed to introduce multiple disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts at 2&#8242;&#8208;OH positions, temporarily blocking RNA function. Exposure to glutathione (GSH) can trigger the traceless release of RNA and restore its biological function. We demonstrate the versatility of this redox&#8208;responsive strategy with RNA constructs of varying lengths, including short synthetic RNA, single guide RNA (sgRNA) as well as longer messenger RNA (mRNA). Furthermore, these disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts respond to endogenous GSH, restoring mRNA translation without the need for cytotoxic exogenous stimuli. Taken together, these results offer a simple and generalizable method for modifying and modulating RNAs regardless of length or origin through structural optimization of acyl groups for facilitating RNA release, setting the stage for broad applicability.

         <title>From Corrosion to Creation: Interfacial De&#8208;Electronation Drives Hydrogenation&#8208;Energy Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transformative approach is proposed to redefine corrosion engineering, enabling sustainable energy production and the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals and metal&#8211;organic frameworks, while simultaneously addressing critical limitations such as slow reaction kinetics, energy loss, and challenges in hydrogen storage. 








Abstract
Metal corrosion, conventionally perceived as a destructive phenomenon driven by de&#8208;electronation, imposes significant economic burdens and safety hazards. To repurpose corrosion into a valuable resource, we demonstrate a macroscopic corrosion battery concept that harnesses galvanic corrosion to drive the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), high&#8208;value chemicals, and energy generation, challenging conventional corrosion mitigation paradigms. By spatially segregating the corrosion process, the system couples anodic metal de&#8208;electronation with MOF deposition while integrating diverse cathodic reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction, electrocatalytic hydrogenation, and hydrogen peroxide reduction with remarkable accelerated kinetics, thereby achieving universal MOFs and chemical synthesis with high electron and atom utilization efficiencies. The prototype system demonstrates concurrent production of p&#8208;aminophenol (14.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and zinc oxalate (86.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) while generating 34.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 of electrical power. Techno&#8208;economic analysis establishes the inaugural empirical validation of economic feasibility for corrosion&#8208;driven energy&#8208;matter symbiosis, highlighting its high gross profit. Transcending conventional corrosion engineering boundaries for inorganic synthesis, this methodology mechanistically deciphers MOF growth kinetics and advanced system design. By broadening the scope of corrosion utilization, this work enables a paradigm shift from damage mitigation to value creation, providing a blueprint for sustainable chemical&#8208;energy ecosystems.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Based on a Covalent Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A calix[4]resorcinarene&#8208;based molecular cage featuring a large [6&#160;+&#160;12] octahedral structure has been employed as a single&#8208;molecule junction. The connection between sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups and the gold electrodes and leads to a stable junction with a conductance of 10&#8722;3.5 G0.








Abstract
As the applications of molecular cages hinge on their properties, understanding the true nature of the cage structures is imperative. Single&#8208;molecule conductance technique offered a unique opportunity to explore the property of an individual cage structure, yet the undefined cage&#8208;electrode connection remains challenging. Herein, we designed a new single&#8208;molecule junction based on covalent organic cages with sulfur atoms on the edges as defined anchor groups. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method, the single&#8208;molecule conductance was found at 10&#8722;3.5 G&#8320;, indicating the formation of a stable junction by the cage. The investigation, combining control structures and theoretical studies, confirmed that the conductance signal originates from the connection between gold electrodes and sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups. This well&#8208;defined connection allowed us to analyze electron transport within the cage structure, providing new insights into the property investigation of functional cages.

&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the applications of molecular cages hinge on their properties, understanding the true nature of the cage structures is imperative. Single-molecule conductance technique offered a unique opportunity to explore the property of an individual cage structure, yet the undefined cage-electrode connection remains challenging. Herein, we designed a new single-molecule junction based on covalent organic cages with sulfur atoms on the edges as defined anchor groups. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method, the single-molecule conductance was found at 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3.5&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&#8320;, indicating the formation of a stable junction by the cage. The investigation, combining control structures and theoretical studies, confirmed that the conductance signal originates from the connection between gold electrodes and sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups. This well-defined connection allowed us to analyze electron transport within the cage structure, providing new insights into the property investigation of functional cages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low Molecular Weight Multistate Photoswitches Based on Simple Norbornadiene&#8208;Triazine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our new polyswitchable norbornadiene&#8208;triazine hybrids are promising candidates for molecular based data storage. These small, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecules can be both symmetric or contain different NBD chromophors and exhibit an unprecedently high variety of distinct switching states. By incorporating acid/base&#8208;responsive moieties, the number of achievable states can be doubled.








Abstract
We have synthesized and characterized a series of simple norbornadiene(NBD)&#8208;triazine architectures, including multistate photoswitches with unprecedentedly high information storage densities. The simple mono&#8208;NBDs served as suitable model systems to investigate the underlying absorption and switching characteristics. To increase the complexity stepwise, a bis&#8208;NBD derivative with a symmetric substitution pattern was investigated next. By combining different NBD substituents with varying electron demands, two asymmetric compounds, one bis&#8208;NBD and one tris&#8208;NBD, were prepared and investigated. In the case of the tris&#8208;NBD, the selective switching of the individual NBD chromophores is hampered by the too closely related optical properties of all three NBD units. On the other hand, the asymmetric photoswitch system containing two NBD&#8208;substituents fulfilled the requirements of a selectively addressable multistate system with an extremely high information storage density. Nearly all possible NBD/quadricyclane (QC) combinations could be realized here, including their reversible interconversion and the respective protonated forms. Quantum chemical calculations corroborated our experimental findings.

         <title>Dual Cofactor Co&#8208;Decorated Covalent Organic Framework as an Electron Transfer Regulator for Biomimetic Dioxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel dual cofactor construction strategy of COFs by simultaneously interfacing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) active site and heme as building blocks to duplicate the synergistically catalytic function of multiple active sites of the cytochrome P450 for selective O2 activation. This is the first case of introducing dual cofactor into COFs to echo the cytochrome P450 possessing outstanding biomimetic catalytic function.








Abstract
Mimicking the synergy of multiple active sites of oxygenase to achieve selective O2 activation for various oxidations is a very challenging but meaningful task. By introducing the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) active site dihydropyridine amido (DHPA) moiety and heme, a dual cofactor co&#8208;decorated covalent organic framework (COF) was obtained to duplicate the synergistically catalytic function of the cytochrome P450 for biomimetic O2 activation. Covalent co&#8208;decoration of dual cofactors in COFs ensures the rapid photogenerated electron transfer from DHPA to heme FeIII to generate FeII, selectively activating O2 to form FeIII&#8722;O2&#8226;&#8722; resembling the cytochrome P450 for improving the performance of alcohol oxidation, avoiding conventionally complex multistep cofactor shuttling and regeneration. Control experiments of a COF analogue containing heme but not DHPA suggested that this dual cofactor construction strategy renders COFs excellent activity and selectivity for O2 activation. As far as we know, this represents the first case of introducing dual cofactor into COFs to echo the cytochrome P450. The well&#8208;defined structural characters and the finely modified bioactive properties open a new avenue to develop novel COFs, which not only augment the diversity of the COF family but also broaden the application of COFs in the field of biomimetic catalysis.

         <title>Heterointerfacial Charge Modulation of p&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Frameworks on Graphene Achieving High&#8208;Performance Cl&#8722; Ion Storage with Ultralong Cycling Life</title>

A high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type COF/graphene hybrid electrode (TAPArGO) with strong interfacial &#960;&#8211;&#960; coupling and dual conductivity engineering is developed for efficient Cl&#8315; ion storage. The electrode exhibits outstanding energy output and ultralong cycling stability, offering new opportunities for next&#8208;generation energy storage and desalination technologies.








Abstract
The charge and ion transport dynamics, storage capacity, and cycling performance of Faradaic Cl&#8722; ion storage electrodes have recently constrained advancements in supercapacitor (SC) and capacitive deionization (CDI). Herein, a high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type COF (TAPA&#8208;COF)&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion storage material (TAPArGO) with exceptional cycling stability was synthesized via an in situ condensation reaction utilizing graphene as a conductive substrate. The interfacial coupling involving graphene and TAPA&#8208;COF increases the interfacial electron density, boosting local charge accumulation and Cl&#8722; ion storage capacity. Additionally, the dual conductive strategy of incorporating graphene and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization of TAPA&#8208;COF enhances the redox kinetics, while the triphenylamine N redox centers and flexible graphene network improve cycling stability. Consequently, the Cl&#8722; ion asymmetric SC employing the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode achieves a specific energy output of 52.4 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 950 W kg&#8722;1, with exciting cycling durability retaining 96.8% of the initial capacity after 100&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, the hybrid CDI system based on the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode demonstrates a specific adsorption capacity of 55.0 mg g&#8722;1, along with remarkable cycling desalination/regeneration ability (99.8% after 200 desalination/regeneration cycles). This study expands the application potential of COF&#8208;based materials for high&#8208;performance Cl&#8722; ion storage.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Plasmonic Hot Spot Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is used to investigate in situ turnover frequency of photon emission on a series of shell&#8208;isolated plasmonic nanoamplifier (AuNR@mSiO2). Turnover frequency heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images present the distinct distribution of plasmonic hot spots along a single nanoamplifier. This platform provides an intuitive insight and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects, offering a sight to construct efficient nanoarchitectures of plasmonic electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), an important optical property of noble metal nanomaterials, is extensively applied in electrochemistry. However, the specific LSPR effects on metallic nanoparticles are difficult to unravel and evaluate, owing to simultaneous factors like intrinsic electroactivity and surface interactions. Herein, we designed a series of shell&#8208;isolated nanostructures, with mesoporous silica shells and plasmonic Au Nanorod cores (AuNR@mSiO2), for precisely investigating both LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging was employed to monitor the in situ turnover frequency (TOF) of photon emissions on individual plasmonic nanoamplifiers to determine the dominant factors influencing LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. TOF heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images unveiled distinct hot spot distributions along the plasmonic nanostructures. Our approach provides insight into and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects during electrochemical reactions, thereby facilitating precise electrocatalyst design based on the physiochemical properties of LSPR.

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Confinement Enables Robust Deuterium Bonds for Highly Reversible Aluminum Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum confinement by leveraging D as a quantum bridge is engineered to tailor stronger intra&#8208; and intermolecular D&#8208;bonds, effectively suppressing water reactivity and achieving exceptional HER inhibition. The induced Al3+ solvation structures further inhibit the decomposition of water at the interface and improve Al redox reversibility.








Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) fundamentally limits aluminum electroreduction in aqueous electrolytes by dominating interfacial charge transfer. Here, we suppress HER by engineering deuterium bonds (D&#8208;bonds) through nuclear quantum effects, confining D between D&#8322;O and DMF molecules. This quantum confinement weakens hydrogen delocalization and restructures the Al3+ solvation sheath, reducing water activity kinetically and thermodynamically. The regulated electrolyte enables uniform aluminum nucleation and dense plating layers, achieving 569&#160;h (0.05&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and 379&#160;h (0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) cycling stability in the 2D2O/1DMF electrolyte, which outperforms traditional sulfate electrolytes by 3.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. Our work uniquely leverages nuclear quantum confinement to engineer robust D&#8208;bonds, simultaneously suppressing HER and enabling atomic&#8208;level control over aluminum ion solvation structures for unprecedented Al redox reversibility in sulfate electrolytes. This exemplification pushes the electrolyte engineering from extensive component adjustment to quantum precision engineering, which provides an innovative solution for the high&#8208;activity water&#8208;based battery system

         <title>Boosting Performance of Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc Ion Batteries via Zincophilic Solubilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a zincophilic solubilization strategy was proposed to break the concentration limit in Zn(Ac)2 hydrogel electrolytes. Based on the salting&#8208;out effect, this provides high mechanical durability for AZIBs, enabling in situ polyurea&#8208;based solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The assembled batteries have high platting/stripping reversibility and high capacity.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes hold great promise in tackling severe issues facing aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, to satisfy the quest of flexible and eco&#8208;friendly batteries, developing low&#8208;cost and high mechanical durability hydrogel electrolyte remains a challenge. Here, employing the zincophilic solubilizer urea, we break the classical concentration limits of the low&#8208;cost Zn(Ac)2 salt and introduce it into the hydrogel skeleton. The &#8220;salting out&#8221; effect give the polymer chain sediments a tighter bundle and twist effect. The as&#8208;formed hydrogel electrolyte can endure 557% high elongation and 3.7&#160;MPa compressive strength to resist repeated zinc plating/striping process and external physical stimuli. The in situ polyurea solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer leads to thermodynamically stable anode/electrolyte interface. Utilizing the hydrogel electrolyte, the zinc anode shows high reversibility, leading to an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.93% for 150 cycles on the Zn//Cu battery. When assembled with NH4V4O10 cathode (NVO), the full battery delivers a high capacity of 253.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 beyond 1000 cycles longevity at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1. The pouch battery also shows a high capacity of 280.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and operate steadily for 90.13% retention after 200 cycles, and maintained a stable voltage even experienced bending and folding.

         <title>NonCovalent Aggregation&#8208;Driven D&#8208;Band Engineering in Nickel Cocatalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent interactions in Ni(bpy)3Br2 aggregates induce spontaneous symmetry breaking, elevating the Ni d&#8208;band center. This electronic modulation lowers the energy barriers for CO2 activation and *COOH formation, significantly enhancing CO2 photoreduction kinetics with high CO selectivity. 








Abstract
Efficient CO2 activation remains a pivotal challenge in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, necessitating precise electronic modulation of catalytic centers to overcome kinetic limitations. In this work, we engineer Ni(bpy)3Br2 cocatalyst aggregates via noncovalent self&#8208;assembly and systematically unravel the role of aggregation in governing photocatalytic performance. A synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrates that symmetry disruption within the aggregates induces localized charge redistribution. Such a charge redistribution triggers a 0.6&#160;eV upshift in the Ni d&#8208;band center, which delivers lower Gibbs free energies for the formation of *CO2 and *COOH. The optimized aggregates achieve a record&#8208;high quantum yield of 26.84% at 450&#160;nm with 99.3% CO selectivity, representing the highest performance reported to date for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion systems. Importantly, the d&#8208;band center of the Ni sites can be precisely modulated by varying the aggregation degree of Ni(bpy)3Br2. This work not only advances a novel d&#8208;band center modulation strategy for electronic configuration engineering but also provides in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level insights into the aggregation&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;regulated d&#8208;band center.

         <title>Tuning Encodable Tetrazine Chemistry for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Bioorthogonal Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We expand the bioorthogonal chemistry toolkit by synthesizing and characterizing 29 tetrazine ncAAs and evaluating their genetic encoding into proteins. Site&#8208;specific incorporation was achieved, and tools to assess efficiency, fidelity, stability, and reactivity were applied. This roadmap enabled the design of tunable tetrazines and the fastest quantitative labeling at 10&#8310;&#160;M&#8315;&#185;s&#8315;&#185; without compromising stability.








Abstract
Using genetic code expansion (GCE) to encode bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a promising method for protein labeling, both in vitro and within cells. Here, we demonstrate that tetrazine (Tet) amino acids incorporated into proteins are highly tunable and have extraordinary potential for fast and quantitative bioorthogonal ligations. We describe the synthesis and characterization of reaction rates for 29 Tet amino acids (20 of which are new) and compare their encoding ability into proteins using evolved tRNA/RS pairs. For these systems, we characterized on&#8208;protein Tet stability, reaction rates, and ligation extents as the utility of a bioorthogonal labeling group depends on its stability and reactivity when encoded into proteins. By integrating data on encoding efficiency, selectivity, on&#8208;protein stability, and in&#8208;cell labeling for Tet tRNA/RS pairs, we developed the smallest, fastest, and most stable Tet to date. This was achieved by introducing fluorine substituents to Tet4, resulting in reaction rates at the 10&#8310;&#160;M&#8315;&#185;s&#8315;&#185; level while minimizing degradation. This study expands the toolbox of bioorthogonal reagents for Tet&#8208;sTCO&#8208;based, site&#8208;specific protein labeling and demonstrates that the Tet is a uniquely tunable, highly reactive, and encodable bioorthogonal functional group. These findings provide a foundation to further explore Tet encoding and reactivity.

Conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were synthesized for NIR&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM showed a CO evolution rate of 74.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, exceeding the performance of most NIR catalysts. PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM demonstrated unparalleled stability during cycling tests, yielding 344.1&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 CO in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction, demonstrating its potential for sustainable CO2 utilization.








Abstract
Current CO2 photocatalytic systems mainly work in ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) light regions, and the inability to utilize the abundant near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation or the low utilization rate is still a bottleneck for practical applications. We address this challenge through the strategic synthesis of metal&#8208;free conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM, to enhance the NIR absorption capabilities, achieving a CO production rate of ~74.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in gas&#8208;solid phase CO2 reduction, surpassing typical NIR&#8208;responsive catalysts. Meanwhile, PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can obtain a CO production rate of 344.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction. Infrared thermography reveals that the non&#8208;radiative attenuation of PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM leads to high photothermal temperature under NIR irradiation, which accounts for its reduction performance. Mechanistic studies combining fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and in situ infrared characterization elucidate the photocatalytic pathway and intermediate formation. This result indicates that PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can be a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for practical solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR Reveals Reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cell Wall Due to a Host&#8208;Defence Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the mode of action is critical to develop new antifungal drugs. Solid&#8208;state NMR was used to study the reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall by a host&#8208;defence peptide. We identified specific polysaccharides and amino acids that are affected by the peptide. Our studies also suggest a mechanism on how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane, which may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.








Abstract
The limited availability of antifungal drug treatments and the rising issue of drug resistance highlight the urgent need for new antifungal drugs to combat drug&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. The host&#8208;defence peptide cathelicidin&#8208;2 has demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on azole&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus but its mechanism of action remains elusive. We applied a tailored set 1H and 13C detected solid state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments to elucidate the cell wall composition of Aspergillus fumigatus and to shed light on the mechanism of action of the peptide within the cell wall. Our results revealed that presence of the peptide affects galactosaminogalactan, an important component involved in the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis, as well as other specific polysaccharides and amino acids within the mobile cell wall domain. At longer exposure times, the peptide also influences the rigid cell wall domains by enhancing water penetration into the hydrophobic rigid cell wall domain. The findings reveal how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane and may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Lewis Basicity in Oxide Lattice Oxygens: A Regulating Force for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis basicity of lattice oxygen is activated in our high entropy spinel oxide (LB&#8208;HEO). Through Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction, LB&#8208;HEO attracts acidic Li+, leading to more disorder and Li+ defects in the discharge product Li2O2 of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. This promotes Li+ diffusion in Li2O2 and interfacial electron transfer, eventually improving the decomposition kinetics during charging. It provides a new perspective on the regulation of Li+ behavior to achieve better electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) require fast oxygen conversion kinetics to achieve good cycling performance and high energy efficiency. In the text of catalysts for LOBs, the Lewis basicity of lattice oxygens (OL) in common transition metal oxides is often underestimated due to the weak electron donor characteristic of OL. In this work, a new spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxide with Lewis basicity (LB&#8208;HEO) was synthesized through a Joule&#8208;heating method. OL was activated by regulating the tetrahedral site&#8208;OL&#8208;octahedral site (MTd&#8208;OL&#8208;MOh) units in the spinel&#8208;type HEO, enhancing the LB. Used as a cathode catalyst for LOBs, LB&#8208;HEO could attract Li+ and increase the disorder in discharge product, lithium peroxide (Li2O2), promoting the delithiation process and the interfacial charge transfer at the LB&#8208;HEO|Li2O2 interface. The activation energy of interfacial charge transfer was significantly reduced from 63.5 to 22.4 kJ mol&#8722;1. As a result, a low charging overpotential of 0.97 V and a long cycling lifespan of 135 cycles at 100 mA g&#8722;1 were achieved with a capacity limitation of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. The strategy based on the regulation of Li+ behavior through its interaction with Lewis bases provides a promising prospect for the design of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Electronically Polarized Fe&#8208;N5 Catalysts Redirect Polymerization&#8208;Driven Phenolic Pollutant Removal Toward Sustainable Carbon Sequestration</title>

A long&#8208;range electronically polarized Fe&#8208;N5 catalyst is developed, enabling specific and efficient peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;catalyst complex generation. BPA removal is redirected by tailored PMS complexes from conventional radical&#8208;mediated mineralization pathways to interfacial polymerization. A 4&#8211;668 times higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal than reported for iron&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) is achieved, with sustainable practical wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration observed (&gt;1700&#160;h operation).








Abstract
A sustainable strategy for simultaneous pollutant removal and carbon sequestration is offered by the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;mediated electron transfer mechanism. However, it remains challenging to achieve catalysts with durable and high activity. A novel catalyst design strategy leveraging boron doping that induces long&#8208;range electronic polarization to precisely modulate PMS complexation dynamics on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is proposed in this study. It is demonstrated that B&#8208;doping induces asymmetric Fe&#8208;N5 coordination at the atomic iron centers (FeSA&#8208;BNC) while creating electron&#8208;enriched carbon auxiliary sites. The electron distribution is synergistically optimized by this dual&#8208;site configuration through lowering the d&#8208;band center and establishing a polarized charge transfer pathway. Complexes with enhanced oxidation potential are generated by the engineered FeSA&#8208;BNC/PMS, redirecting bisphenol A degradation from conventional radical&#8208;mediated mineralization to an interfacial polymerization pathway via outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer. Remarkably, &gt;3 times higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal activity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts and 4 orders of magnitude higher reactivity than conventional carbon nitride (CN) catalyst are exhibited by the optimized catalyst. Excellent operational stability (&gt;1700&#160;h continuous operation) with &gt;120&#160;L actual wastewater treatment capacity is demonstrated by practical implementation in a continuous&#8208;flow microreactor. This work advances electronic modulation strategies for sustainable water purification technologies.

The use of solution&#8208;processed amorphous zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrid (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films for direct X&#8208;ray detection is demonstrated. The amorphous films exhibit efficient molecular sensitization, with ZnBr42&#8722; species serving as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz&#8314; moieties as charge transporters. The resulting detectors achieve a detection sensitivity of 2165&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 at 20&#160;V&#160;mm&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 6.01&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) are emerging materials with significant potential for optoelectronic applications, including direct X&#8208;ray detectors. While 0D OMHH single crystals exhibit excellent X&#8208;ray detection properties, their scalability remains a significant challenge due to the time&#8208;intensive growth process and difficulty in producing large single crystals exceeding a few centimeters. This limitation hinders their practicality for large&#8208;area detector applications. Here, we report for the first time the development of amorphous 0D OMHH films via solution processing for efficient direct X&#8208;ray detection. By reacting a non&#8208;crystalline organic halide, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phosphonium bromide (TPPCarzBr), with zinc bromide (ZnBr2), we have successfully produced amorphous 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films with controlled thickness via facile solution processing. The organic cations (TPPCarz&#8314;) feature a lower bandgap than the ZnBr42&#8722; anions, enabling efficient molecular sensitization, where ZnBr42&#8722; anions serve as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz&#8314; cations as charge transporters. Direct X&#8208;ray detectors based on 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving a stable X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity of 2,165&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8315;1cm&#8315;2 at 20&#160;V&#160;mm&#8315;&#185; and a detection limit of 6.01&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8315;&#185;. The amorphous nature of these films enhances their processability, allowing for fabrication in various sizes and shapes, and making them highly adaptable for scalable detector applications.

         <title>A Bifunctional Organic Photocatalyst for Efficient Single&#8208;Electron and Energy Transfer Activation</title>

Thioaryl hydroxycoumarins are versatile, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for both single&#8208;electron (SET), and energy transfer (EnT) pathways, enabling radical and triplet energy transfer reactions with a single organic scaffold.








Abstract
Bifunctional photocatalysts capable of mediating both single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (EnT) processes are rare and typically metal based. Here, we present 3&#8208;thioaryl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, a new family of cost&#8208;effective organic photocatalysts that leverage a stabilized charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state to achieve both strong reducing power and efficient energy transfer. The spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO stabilizes the CT state, enhancing SET reactivity (E*red&#160;=&#160;&#8722;3.08&#160;V vs. SCE) while maintaining a sufficiently high triplet energy (ET&#160;=&#160;67 kcal mol&#8722;1) for EnT&#8208;driven transformations. This dual reactivity enables the activation of redox&#8208;inert substrates (Ered&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;2.8&#160;V vs. SCE) via SET reduction, generating radicals suitable for diverse C&#9472;S, C&#8208;&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations, alongside EnT&#8208;based processes such as E/Z olefin isomerization and [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloadditions. Mechanistic studies, supported by photophysical and theoretical analyses, confirmed the catalyst's bifunctionality.

         <title>Selection of Ribofuranose&#8208;Isomer Among Pentoses by Phosphorylation with Diamidophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate phosphorylates the four pentoses under mild aqueous conditions. Ribofuranosyl&#8208;cyclicphosphates are formed efficiently, while the other three pentoses react slowly to form furanosyl&#8208; and/or pyranosyl&#8208;forms. The selective formation of ribofuranosyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate occurs even when starting from a mixture of sugars suggesting an alternative pathway for abiotic synthesis of ribonucleotides in a prebiotic context.








Abstract
The unique structure&#8211;function relationship of the ribofuranose ring in RNA has inspired various chemical pathways to select for the ribofuranose form (over the ribopyranose form), especially in a prebiotic context. Herein we show that the reaction of diamidophosphate (DAP) with the four pentoses&#8212;ribose, arabinose, xylose, and lyxose&#8212;naturally selects the ribofuranose form more efficiently when compared to the other three pentoses. All four pentoses form the initial diamidophosphate&#8208;adduct; however, ribose undergoes rapid conversion to ribofuranose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while the other three pentoses show significant accumulation of the initially formed DAP&#8208;adducts and slow conversion to the cyclicphosphate products. Arabinose and xylose show a distribution between furanose&#8208; and pyranose&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while lyxose forms the furanose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and pyranose&#8208;2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products. This trend is also manifested when starting from a mixture of pentoses where ribofuranose 1,2&#8208;amidocyclicphosphate dominates the product distribution. Such selection for ribofuranose among pentoses by phosphorylation i) provides another venue of how a ribofuranose structure can selectively emerge through abiotic chemical reaction suitable for elaboration toward RNA and ii) adds to the body of experimental work addressing the chemical origin of RNA.

         <title>Entire Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;I Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entire near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) ECL enhancement strategy of gold nanoclusters (NCx, x represents the ligand of gold nanoclusters) is reported by regulating absorption wavelength of gold nanorods to precisely match ECL emission wavelength of gold nanoclusters (NCxRy, y represents the longitudinal plasmon resonance absorption wavelength of the gold nanorods), and the ECL intensity of NCxRy is 3&#8211;4 times higher than that of individual NCx.








Abstract
Herein, entire near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) enhancement of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) is achieved by continuously regulating the plasmon resonance absorption wavelength of gold nanorods (Au NRs) to precisely match ECL emission wavelength of Au NCs (abbreviated as Au NCs/Au NRs), which challenges the drawbacks of traditional single wavelength ECL enhancement strategy. Interestingly, within the range of 670&#8211;820&#160;nm, the ECL intensity of Au NCs/Au NRs is 3&#8211;4 times higher than that of individual Au NCs due to the acceleration of electron&#8208;hole recombination and radiation transition rate through high energy electromagnetic field. As a proof of concept, the Au NCs/Au NRs with the ECL emission of 670&#160;nm is employed as high&#8208;efficiency ECL emitter to achieve high&#8208;resolution ECL image and construct biosensor for realizing ultrasensitive detection of matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) related to liver failure. Significantly, the proposed ECL enhancement strategy effectively enhances the ECL emission of metal nanoclusters (M NCs) over a wide wavelength range and advances a new path for other tunable nanomaterials to enhance the ECL emission of M NCs, which is expected to be applied to in the field of multispectral ECL imaging, multimodal optoelectronic devices, and spectrum&#8208;resolved multiplexed biosensing systems.

As a proof of concept, the Au NCs/Au NRs with the ECL emission of 670&#160;nm is employed as high-efficiency ECL emitter to achieve high-resolution ECL image and construct biosensor for realizing ultrasensitive detection of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) related to liver failure. Significantly, the proposed ECL enhancement strategy effectively enhances the ECL emission of metal nanoclusters (M NCs) over a wide wavelength range and advances a new path for other tunable nanomaterials to enhance the ECL emission of M NCs, which is expected to be applied to in the field of multispectral ECL imaging, multimodal optoelectronic devices, and spectrum-resolved multiplexed biosensing systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Production of Ethylene from Bicarbonate Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report direct electroreduction of bicarbonate to C2+ products using Cu mesh catalysts. The effect of mesh thickness, pore size, catholyte composition, and thermal treatment was systematically studied. Our finding shows that thinner Cu mesh showed enhanced C2+ selectivity due to improved mass transport, while heat&#8208;treated meshes form oxide&#8208;derived surfaces that shift selectivity from hydrogen evolution to efficient eCO2R.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction directly from a reactive carbon solution (e.g., (bi)carbonate) provides a promising approach for integrating CO2 capture and conversion. Compared to CO2 conversion in gas&#8208;fed systems, this system typically suffers from low Faradaic efficiency (FE), especially for multicarbon (C2+) products. Here, we report an engineered material structuring to selectively produce C2+ products directly from a N2&#8208;saturated bicarbonate solution. Multiphysics modeling studies reveal the critical role of local current density distribution and the spatio&#8208;selective evolution of C2+ products, which is favored in thinner catalysts (240&#160;&#181;m thickness). By jointly tailoring catalyst configuration and mass transport in bicarbonate electroreduction, adjusting the thickness, porosity, and surface oxidation of copper (Cu) mesh catalysts, as well as catholyte composition, we achieved a maximum C2H4 FE of 39% and total C2+ FE over 55% at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a 240&#160;&#181;m thick Cu mesh. The system is also stable for over 160&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with maintained C2H4 FE over 20%. Our electrolysis system converts bicarbonate to C2+ with over 90% CO2 utilization efficiency, reducing regeneration and separation costs. Optimizing catalyst pore structure, and copper surface oxide is a key to maximizing C2H4 production from bicarbonate solutions.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Arsenium Ion Bond Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The release of ring strain in cyclo&#8208;Pn3 (Pn&#160;= P, As) ligands is exploited to achieve insertion of arsenium ions [R2As]+ (R&#160;=&#160;organic substituent) into non&#8208;polar bonds. This concept is utilized to access complexes bearing exotic cyclo&#8208;Pn3AsR2 ligands. Quantum crystallography and computational analysis shed light on the key energetic contributions unlocking this fundamental mode of reactivity.








Abstract
Although it marks a cornerstone of pnictogenium ion [R2Pn]+ reactivity, the insertion of arsenium ions [R2As]+ into non&#8208;polar bonds remains highly challenging. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed, which circumvents the limitations of insertion reactivity of [R2As]+ (e.g., formal redox state of&#160;+V at As) via alleviation of ring strain in the substrate. Thus, unlocking arsenium ion bond insertion delivers the ring&#8208;expanded complexes [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8208;Pn3AsCy2][TEF] ({LnM}&#160;=&#160;Cp&#8244;Ni, Pn&#160;= P (1); {LnM}&#160;=&#160;{CpMo(CO)2}, Pn&#160;= P (2), As (5); Cp&#8244;&#160;=&#160;1,2,4&#8208;tBu3C5H2, [TEF]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;). Computational analysis of the reaction mechanism and quantum crystallographic investigation of 1 highlight the release of ring strain as the crucial driving force for this reactivity. This rational is corroborated by the isolation of the arsenium ion coordinated [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;P2AsCy2)][TEF] (3) as well as the phosphenium ion inserted [{CpMo(CO)2}(&#951;3&#8208;As3PPh2)][TEF] (4).

         <title>Dynamically Dual&#8208;Center Coupled Synergistic Catalysis for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism with multi&#8208;pathway for thorough oxygen reduction process in alkaline medium is demonstrated. In situ synchrotron infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations collectively reveal that the Pt single sites optimize the electronic structure of the PdRh nanosheets, thereby enhancing the overall oxygen reduction efficiency on PdRh&#9472;Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) suffers from inherent kinetic limitations arising from the competitive adsorption behavior of *OOH intermediates and their divergent conversion pathways toward either the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant route or the 2e&#8315;&#8208;peroxide byproduct. Conventional single&#8208;component catalysts fundamentally lack temporal&#8208;spatial control to simultaneously accelerate O&#9472;O bond cleavage while suppressing *H2O2 desorption. To overcome this kinetic dilemma, herein, we propose a dynamically dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism enabled by precisely engineered PdRh&#9472;Pt nanosheet binary&#8208;component interfaces. Multidimensional in situ synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the activated 4e&#8315; pathway primarily occurs at PdRh sites. Additionally, Pt centers selectively reduce *OOH to *O and *H2O2, whereas neighboring PdRh sites facilitate ultrafast *H2O2 migration and dissociation, effectively complementing the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant pathway. Hence, the DCCS catalysis redirects traditionally divergent product pathways toward a singular target product. This interfacial kinetic synergy achieves ultrahigh 4e&#8315; kinetics, demonstrated by a six&#8208;fold increase of turnover frequency compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the derived rechargeable Zn&#8210;air batteries demonstrate exceptional stability over 200&#160;h, establishing a new design principle for breaking kinetics trade&#8208;offs in heterogeneous catalysis through molecularly scheduling reaction pathways.

A chiral fluorescent MOF with lock&#8208;and&#8208;key responsiveness to PEA enantiomers is reported. Integrated into a flexible sensor, it enables visual detection of enantiomeric excess. Leveraging PEA enantiomers as cryptographic keys, a quadruply encrypted barcode system is developed, representing a first demonstration of high&#8208;security chiral encryption.








Abstract
Increasing threats of data forgery breaches necessitate the development of advanced encryption strategies beyond traditional cryptographic methods. Fluorescence encryption has emerged as a promising alternative, yet current systems suffer from low security due to simple, reversible stimuli responses. Here, we introduce a novel lock&#8208;and&#8208;key encryption system using a chiral cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic framework (CDMOF), termed Zole@CDMOF (Zole&#160;=&#160;acetylated benzoimidazole), for enantioselective discrimination of phenylethylamine (PEA) enantiomers.Confined Zole serves as the lock, while PEA enantiomers act as the key, selectively triggering fluorescence turn&#8208;on via acetyl&#9472;O bond cleavage and restoring excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of deacetylated Zole. Mechanistic studies reveal that enantioselectivity arises from thermodynamic differences and distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between PEA enantiomers. To enhance practical application, Zole@CDMOF is fabricated into a flexible sensor via scotch tape strategy, enabling visual indexing of enantiomeric excess. Additionally, we propose a barcode chiral encryption model, establishing a quadruply encrypted system with ultra&#8208;high security&#8212;allowing only one out of approximately two million keys to decrypt. This study pioneers the first chiral cryptographic key in fluorescence encryption, paving the way for ultra&#8208;secure encryption, advanced chiral sensing, and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8211;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4.








Abstract
Rational design of water activation center to promote active hydrogen (*H) generation and stabilize Cu(I) species are significant for the formation of multicarbon (C2+) products over Cu&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, CeO2 nanograins and CuO nanothorns were selectively deposited on the edges of Cu2O cubes through the seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8211;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4. This work provides new insights into modulating *H absorption and stabilizing Cu(I) species for boosting CO2 to C2+ products.

         <title>A Multivalent Targeting Strategy for Developing Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Activated Tumor&#8208;Seeking Probe to Guide Precise Surgical Resection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ROS&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe based on FDA&#8208;approved dye was developed using a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. Benefiting from the robust tumor&#8208;targeting ability and efficient ROS response performance, the proposed probe enabled tumor detection across various mice models and allowed for precise delineation of tumor boundaries during surgical navigation, significantly reducing postoperative recurrence in situ. 








Abstract
Optical molecular imaging with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes provides a promising strategy for the visual detection of tumor tissues. However, conventional molecular probes often suffer from poor targeting specificity and low signal contrast during tumor detection. In this work, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe (termed MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2) based on a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. A bivalent biotin&#8208;targeting ligand was bonded to an ROS&#8208;responsive molecular scaffold to maximize receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, resulting in significantly stronger tumor affinity and selectivity of the probe. The optical signal of the proposed probe was initially masked and could be selectively activated by overexpressed ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment. This activation led to the specific release of the clinical dye methylene blue (MB), offering high&#8208;contrast NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging signals for precise tumor visualization. MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2 demonstrated strong tumor selectivity, enabling the detection of tumors in different mice models, including accurate identification of small tumors (&#8764;3&#160;mm). Consequently, the probe could delineate tumor boundaries during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery, significantly reducing postoperative tumor recurrence.

         <title>Ultrathin PtSe2 Nanowires in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, and expose abundant zigzag edges, which contribute to the higher catalytic activity for HER. The as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent HER activity at extremely low Pt loading of 4.684&#160;wt%, with an overpotential of 47&#160;mV@10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Platinum selenide (PtSe2) has shown great potential for application in electrocatalysis. One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures are particularly advantageous for enhancing catalytic performance, as they expose abundant active sites at the edges and enable rapid charge transport. However, the synthesis of 1D PtSe2 nanostructures for efficient electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of ultrathin (0.4&#8211;2.0&#160;nm) PtSe2 nanowires (NWs) using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a confined template via direct selenization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The atom&#8208;resolved electron microscope combined with spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, possessing zigzag edges and higher thermodynamical stability. Owing to the rich&#8208;edges with abundant unsaturated Pt atoms, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at an extremely low Pt loading of 4.684&#160;wt%, with an overpotential of 47&#160;mV@10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing 1D ultrathin NWs and offers the potential to achieve low&#8208;cost and efficient Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the future.

         <title>A Macrocycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Strategy for Interchangeable Screwdriver&#8208;Like on&#8208;Demand Post&#8208;Functionalization of Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform that can be varied for customized applications is achieved through macrocyclic host&#8211;guest interactions. Such a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based COF with introduction of variable functional guests following the working principle of an interchangeable screwdriver. Conceptually different from traditional covalent approach, this work presents interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COF for applications through host&#8211;guest interactions.








Abstract
Constructing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through post&#8208;functionalization constitutes one of the most important approaches to applications, but is frequently plagued by limited reaction types, tedious synthesis of different precursors, and time&#8208;consuming screening of synthetic parameters for COFs.

&lt;p&gt;Noncovalent post-functionalization on the same COF platform that can be varied for customized applications is achieved through macrocyclic host&#8211;guest interactions. Such a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated by pillar[5]arene-based COF with introduction of variable functional guests following the working principle of an interchangeable screwdriver. Conceptually different from traditional covalent approach, this work presents interchangeable post-functionalization of COF for applications through host&#8211;guest interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through post-functionalization constitutes one of the most important approaches to applications, but is frequently plagued by limited reaction types, tedious synthesis of different precursors, and time-consuming screening of synthetic parameters for COFs. Moreover, their functions are difficult to change once the functionalities are covalently attached to COF skeletons. Herein, we report a macrocycle-based supramolecular strategy for variable noncovalent post-functionalization on the same COF platform like an interchangeable screwdriver. As a proof of concept, pillar[5]arene (P5A) with electron-rich cavity is incorporated into COF as macrocycle host to anchor different electron-deficient guests of various functions. Such a design allows tunable post-functionalization of COF through host&#8211;guest interactions for customized utilities, which has been demonstrated by using a series of guests including organic salts for iodine capture and cyano-based ligands for metal ion separation.

This work establishes a general noncovalent approach to on-demand interchangeable post-functionalization of COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Twelvefold Dearomative Esterification of (6,6)Carbon Nanobelt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carbon nanobelt derivative bearing twelve ester groups has been successfully synthesized from fully conjugated (6,6)carbon nanobelt by the unique Mg&#8208;promoted dearomative esterification. This simple yet powerful method can modulate shape, solubility and host&#8211;guest property of the (6,6)carbon nanobelt. 








Abstract
Carbon nanobelts (CNBs), cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with belt&#8208;shaped topologies, have growing interest as structurally unique and optoelectronically promising nanocarbons. Yet, strategies for their direct and site&#8208;selective functionalization remain scarce. Here, we report a magnesium&#8208;mediated, multifold dearomative esterification of (6,6)CNB, enabling the installation of twelve ester groups in a single transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed regioselective dearomatization patterns, whereas mechanistic studies uncovered a radical&#8208;driven pathway involving oxyiminium intermediate generated in situ from alkyl chloroformates and amide solvents. Computational analysis further indicated that strain release in the CNB framework drives the high degree of functionalization. This methodology not only expands the synthetic toolbox for aromatic nanobelts but also allows tunable modulation of their host&#8211;guest properties via enhanced conformational flexibility.

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Activatable PROTAC Prodrug for Tumor Biomarker&#8208;Driven Near&#8208;Infrared Opto&#8208;Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) is developed to stepwisely activate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and proteolytic activity in the presence of tumor biomarker enzyme Cathepsin B (CatB) and NIR light. TAP represents the first tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC approach under a collaborative control by endogenous and exogenous triggers, holding great promise for precise spatiotemporal on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific protein degradation is crucial for successful cancer treatment by proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which however still remains challenging. Here, we report a tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) strategy for precise on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo. TAP is constructed by caging PROTAC with a tumor&#8208;homing cyclopeptide through a tandem&#8208;locking linker, which comprises a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) cleavable moiety, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) and a Cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable dipeptide substrate. The proteolytic activity of TAP is initially turned off but can be sequentially switched on by tumor biomarker enzyme CatB and NIR light. Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures that PROTAC exclusively degrade oncoprotein target in tumor. The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor&#8208;selective degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem&#8208;activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off&#8208;tumor toxicity of PROTAC.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Engineered Proton Transfer Pathways for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a rationally designed catalyst integrating Ni single atoms and NiO nanoclusters on porous carbon nanosheets for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis in solid electrolytes. This catalyst achieves 97% Faradaic efficiency and 356&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for pure H2O2 production. The study addresses a critical gap in elucidating proton transfer pathways in solid electrolytes during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte (SE) cells promise electrochemical synthesis of pure hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), yet the protonation mechanisms governing the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) remain unclear when using&#160;pure water as the proton source. Both Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (LH, surface *H&#8208;mediated) and Eley&#8211;Rideal (ER, water&#8208;derived proton&#8208;coupled) pathways are theoretically plausible, but their practical dominance under SE conditions lacks experimental validation. Herein, we designed a hierarchical Ni&#9472;N2&#9472;C&#9472;O single&#8208;atom/NiO nanocluster co&#8208;decorated porous carbon nanosheet catalyst (NiSA&#8208;NiO/pCNs) that achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a H2O2 partial current density of 356&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 (equivalent to 6.6&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 production rate) in a porous SE cell. Analysis of reaction intermediates and the local pH using in situ Raman spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect, and density functional theory simulations showed the critical role of NiO nanoclusters in tuning the protonation pathway: NiO activates the ER mechanism via fast proton transfer from water dissociation, whereas NiSA/pCNs without NiO preferentially follow the LH mechanism through surface&#8208;adsorbed *H intermediates from interfacial transferred proton. These findings establish a catalyst design principle for proton transfer control in solid&#8208;state H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Defect Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tandem CO2 Electroreduction and Carbonylation Reactions from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>

A three&#8208;system tandem approach&#8212;comprising a membrane separation CO&#8322; system, a CO&#8322; reduction reaction system, and a carbonylation reaction system&#8212;directly converts flue gas to high&#8208;value&#8208;added organic chemicals, establishing a practical paradigm for sustainable chemical manufacturing that simultaneously addresses challenges in carbon capture, renewable energy storage, and green synthesis of fine chemicals. 








Abstract
Tandem CO2 reduction with carbonylation reactions represents a promising approach to convert greenhouse gases into valuable chemicals. Herein, we propose a universal &#8220;N/O mixed pre&#8208;coordination pyrolysis&#8221; strategy to construct vacancy&#8208;defect single atom catalysts (Ni1&#8208;, Mn1&#8208;, Fe1&#8208;, Co1&#8208;, and Cu1&#8208;NC) with M&#8208;N3 coordination microenvironment. This vacancy&#8208;defect endows Ni1&#8208;NC with excellent performance for CO2 electroreduction, achieving a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% across a wide range of current densities up to 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The generated CO was directly fed to carbonylation reactions, producing organic chemicals with yields of up to 91.7% and leading to produce 1.13&#160;g of benzophenone in a single run. For the first time, the membrane separation CO2 system was integrated with tandem catalytic system, enabling direct utilization of flue gas for benzophenone synthesis with a 76.6% yield. This work offers a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly method for CO2 separation and utilization by feeding industrial waste gas to carbonylation reactions.

Herein, we propose a universal &#8220;N/O mixed pre-coordination pyrolysis&#8221; strategy to construct vacancy-defect single atom catalysts (Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-, Mn&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-, Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-, Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-, and Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NC) with M-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coordination microenvironment. This vacancy-defect endows Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NC with excellent performance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction, achieving a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% across a wide range of current densities up to 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The generated CO was directly fed to carbonylation reactions, producing organic chemicals with yields of up to 91.7% and leading to produce 1.13&#160;g of benzophenone in a single run. For the first time, the membrane separation CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system was integrated with tandem catalytic system, enabling direct utilization of flue gas for benzophenone synthesis with a 76.6% yield. This work offers a sustainable, eco-friendly method for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation and utilization by feeding industrial waste gas to carbonylation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn Alloy Hollow Microbox for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under cathodic potential, Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 hollow microboxes undergo in&#8208;situ reduction and reconstruction to form S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn alloy hollow microboxes, which greatly promote the electrochemical CO&#8322;RR to produce formate.








Abstract
The dynamic catalyst's restructuring creates a new catalytic surface that is essential for boosting the efficiency of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work, we synthesize Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 hollow microboxes using a coprecipitation method followed by a hydrothermal treatment. Based on a collection of in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations including in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, rapid freeze&#8208;quench (RFQ) 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we discover that the Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 (Ag@SnS2) hollow microboxes undergo dynamic reduction and reconstruction during the electrochemical CO2RR, leading to the in&#8208;situ formation of S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn alloy (S&#8208;Ag3Sn/Sn) hollow microboxes. This transformation results in a remarkable formate selectivity of 92.4% with a formate partial current density of 97.3 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE in an H&#8208;cell. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both S&#8208;doping and Ag&#8211;Sn alloying enhance the CO2 adsorption and improve the stability of *OCHO intermediate. This work offers a facile strategy for designing highly active and selective electrocatalyst for CO2RR.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adapting Lattice Respiration Enabled by Crystal Design and d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization Toward Highly Stable Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the dual considerations of crystal structure and electronic structure, we construct cathodes with &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration (SALR)&#8221; effect. The effect effectively addresses the poor cycle stability of transition metal&#8208;based RABs cathodes caused by the strong electrostatic interaction between high charge density Al3+ and host lattice. 








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the appealing three&#8208;electron transfer feature, low cost, and high safety. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Al3+ and host lattice induces severe lattice distortion and structural collapse, leading to poor cycle stability in RABs. Herein, we develop a new&#8208;type FeWO4 cathode with a comprehensive consideration of the crystal structure and electronic structure. The 3D open framework and strong W&#9472;O covalent network of the FeWO4 greatly improve the storage of high charge density Al3+. Moreover, the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen facilitates electron delocalization, which effectively weakens the interaction with the trivalent cation (Al3+). Importantly, combining in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that as&#8208;prepared cathode exhibits a &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration&#8221; (SALR) effect. Specifically, the reversible W&#8211;O bond elongation/compression (&#916;d&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.05&#160;&#197;) during cycling reduces lattice strain and confines volume expansion to less than 3%. As results, the FeWO4 cathode delivers a high capacity of 192&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and long cycle life of over 2300 cycles with quiet low capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle in RABs.

         <title>Deciphering Tryptophan Oxygenation: Key Modulators of 2&#8208;Oxindole Formation in MarE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that MarE, a heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenase, favors dioxygenation of &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan in the absence of ascorbate and demonstrates how structural and redox tuning shifts its reactivity toward selective monooxygenation, yielding a 2&#8208;oxindole scaffold. These findings offer new insights into enzyme&#8208;controlled indole oxidation in tryptophan&#8208;derived natural products.








Abstract
MarE, a heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenase with a histidyl axial ligation, catalyzes the monooxygenation of &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan to form a 2&#8208;oxindole scaffold central to maremycin biosynthesis. Although structurally similar to tryptophan 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (TDO), which initiates l&#8208;tryptophan catabolism via dioxygenation, MarE exhibits distinct reactivity modulated by ascorbate. While ascorbate has no effect on TDO, it promotes selective monooxygenation by MarE. In its absence, MarE favors dioxygenation and formation of pyrroloindoline products, revealing latent catalytic versatility. Active&#8208;site loop sequences differ between the two enzymes, SLGGR in MarE versus GTGGS in TDO, prompting loop&#8208;swapping experiments to probe structure&#8208;function relationships. Substituting GTGGS in TDO to MarE&#8208;like sequences (GTGGA or SLGGS) shifted reactivity toward monooxygenation and formation of C3&#8208;hydroxylated, non&#8208;oxindole products that underwent further cyclization into tricyclic structures. Conversely, replacing SLGGR in MarE with GTGGS resulted in enhanced C2,C3&#8208;dioxygenation nearly 4&#8208;fold. These results underscore the active&#8208;site loop as a key determinant of oxidation outcome, alongside the modulatory role of ascorbate. By revealing the true catalytic identity of MarE and delineating the roles of small&#8208;molecule effectors and loop architecture, this study advances mechanistic understanding and predictive capabilities within the oxygenase superfamily.

         <title>Stable Acrylamide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via Mannich Polymerization for Efficient Gold Recovery from Complex E&#8208;Waste Leachates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acrylamide&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized through a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization. The resulting frameworks feature irreversible linkages, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and dual C&#9552;O/N&#9472;H coordination sites, enabling exceptional stability and highly selective gold recovery from complex electronic waste leachates.








Abstract
Achieving both high stability and selectivity remains a critical challenge in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient gold recovery. Herein, we present a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization involving 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene, Meldrum's acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide&#8208;linked COFs (TFB&#8208;PD&#8208;M, TFB&#8208;ND&#8208;M, and TFB&#8208;AD&#8208;M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C&#9552;O and N&#9472;H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au3+ binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, TFB&#8208;AD&#8208;M achieves 98.5% selective Au3+ recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving both high stability and selectivity remains a critical challenge in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient gold recovery. Herein, we present a one-step Mannich-type three-component polymerization involving 1,3,5-triformylbenzene, Meldrum's acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide-linked COFs (TFB-PD-M, TFB-ND-M, and TFB-AD-M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;-conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C&#9552;O and N&#9472;H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, TFB-AD-M achieves 98.5% selective Au&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confining Asymmetrically Coordinated Cobalt Single&#8208;Atoms/Clusters on Holey MXene for Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dual&#8208;coordination microenvironment strategy, CoN1O2 single atoms and Co nanoclusters (NCs) were confined within highly graphitized carbon layers supported on holey MXene nanosheets. The Co NCs optimized the electronic structure of Co active centers, synergistically enhancing peroxymonosulfate adsorption and electron transfer efficiency. A nonradical electron transfer mechanism was proposed to drive the polymerization of bisphenol A.








Abstract
Developing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with asymmetric coordination configurations is essential for enhancing peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, precisely regulating the electronic structure and coordination environment of metal centers to further improve activation kinetics remains a key challenge. Herein, we designed asymmetric CoN1O2 single atoms (SAs) sites and Co nanoclusters (NCs) that were spatially confined in highly graphitized carbon layers and supported on holey MXene nanosheet (CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX) via a dual&#8208;coordination microenvironment strategy. The CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance on bisphenol A (BPA) removal, achieving a corrected rate constant (kvalue) of 2750 min&#8722;1 M&#8722;1 and a total organic carbon removal efficiency of 78.2%. Mechanistic studies revealed that BPA removal was dominated by a nonradical electron transfer process (ETP, &#8764;100%), which facilitated rapid polymerization of BPA. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that Co NCs synergistically enhanced the ability of asymmetric CoN1O2 SAs sites to adsorb and activate PMS, significantly accelerating interfacial charge transfer. Furthermore, a catalytic membrane fabricated by crosslinking of CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX and graphene achieved 100% BPA removal in single&#8208;pass mode with a hydraulic retention time of just 40&#160;ms over 24&#160;h of continuous operation. This work provides new insights into designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for pollutant removal via ETP&#8208;driven polymerization pathways.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereodivergent Semihydrogenation of Alkynes: Synthesis of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the synergistic catalysis of an 8&#8208;OIQ cobalt catalyst and CH3CN, a series of&#160;E&#8208; and&#160;Z&#8208;alkenes with high stereoselectivity could be synthesized in the semihydrogenation of internal alkynes. Mechanistic studies showed that the acetonitrile plays an important role in controlling isomerization and inhabiting over&#8208;hydrogenation during the conversion process.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes is one of the most efficient, sustainable, and environmental&#8208;friendly strategies for accessing stereoisomerically pure olefins. Herein, we report a tridentate nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand (8&#8208;OIQ) promoted cobalt&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent semihydrogenation of internal alkynes; a series of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;alkenes could be synthesized with high stereoselectivity. Besides, this protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and operates under mild reaction conditions (1&#160;bar H2, room temperature). A preliminary mechanistic study revealed that acetonitrile plays an important role in suppressing over&#8208;reduction and controlling the stereoselectivity in this transformation.

         <title>Sulfur Mediated Interfacial Proton&#8208;Directed Transfer Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia over Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts</title>

Sulfur&#8208;mediated electron redistribution and proton&#8208;directed transfer at the Cu&#8208;Co interface significantly boost electrocatalytic NO reduction to NH3 over the S&#8208;Cu@Co/C catalyst. The changes in the electronic structure of Cu and Co promote NO adsorption and water dissociation. Meanwhile, sulfur accelerates the transfer of protons generated at Co sites to Cu sites, thereby facilitating NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a sustainable strategy that simultaneously realizes the nitrogen cycle and resource integration. The key issue hindering the NORR efficiency is accelerating proton (*H) transfer to facilitate NO hydrogenation while inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we demonstrate an interface&#8208;engineered sulfur&#8208;mediated Cu@Co electrocatalyst (S&#8208;Cu@Co/C) that boosts NORR performance through dual modulation of electronic structure and proton transfer on active sites. A comprehensive program of experimental and theoretical calculations was employed to discover that sulfur incorporation induces electron redistribution in the Cu&#8211;Co interface, creating electron&#8208;rich sulfur and electron&#8208;deficient metals. This electronic configuration synergistically enhances NO adsorption on Cu sites and promotes water dissociation on Co sites. More critically, sulfur could direct the rapid transfer of *H from Co to Cu sites, thereby accelerating the NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER. Consequently, S&#8208;Cu@Co/C achieves an NH3 yield rate of 655.3 &#181;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.4% in an H&#8208;cell. Remarkably, the catalyst could maintain continuous electrolysis tests and steady NH3 yield up to 100&#160;h. This work provides innovative insights into the fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts via heteroatom&#8208;mediated interfacial engineering strategies.

         <title>Asymmetric, Corner&#8208;Sharing CuO5 and CuO6 Motifs in Cu&#8208;Based Metallic Perovskite Oxides Boosting Asymmetric C&#9472;C Coupling for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with asymmetric, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs were reported to promote asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; was the most effective Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalyst for C2+ production and performed comparably with or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides feature significant potential for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) but encounter insufficient C2+ selectivity primarily due to the inherent symmetric charge distribution at Cu sites hindering asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling. Here we report a unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with asymmetric, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs to boost asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst of La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, their ordered, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 pyramids and CuO6 octahedra feature localized charge density redistribution, creating abundant asymmetric Cu&#9472;Cu dual sites with distinct electronic structures and also strengthening Cu&#9472;O covalency. In CO2RR (in both alkaline and acidic media), La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; greatly promotes C2+ formation while producing negligible CH4, showing a Faradaic efficiency ratio (C2+ to CH4) of up to 180. Moreover, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, achieving a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 85.0% at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, together with well&#8208;boosted stability, outperforms previously reported Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalysts. Our experiments and theoretical calculations attribute the superb performance mainly to the following factors: the asymmetric CuO5&#9472;CuO6 sites promoting differentiated *CO adsorption/hydrogenation to favor asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling; the strengthened Cu&#9472;O covalency stabilizing the Cu sites. Extending this strategy to two additional pairs of Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides generates similarly successful results.

As a proof-of-concept catalyst, La&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; was the most effective Cu-based-perovskite catalyst for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; production and performed comparably with or better than most reported Cu-based catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cu-based perovskite oxides feature significant potential for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) but encounter insufficient C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity primarily due to the inherent symmetric charge distribution at Cu sites hindering asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling. Here we report a unique type of Cu-based metallic perovskite oxides with asymmetric, corner-sharing CuO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and CuO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; motifs to boost asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. For the proof-of-concept catalyst of La&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;, their ordered, corner-sharing CuO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; pyramids and CuO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra feature localized charge density redistribution, creating abundant asymmetric Cu&#9472;Cu dual sites with distinct electronic structures and also strengthening Cu&#9472;O covalency. In CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR (in both alkaline and acidic media), La&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; greatly promotes C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; formation while producing negligible CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, showing a Faradaic efficiency ratio (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) of up to 180. Moreover, La&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving a remarkable C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency of 85.0% at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, together with well-boosted stability, outperforms previously reported Cu-based-perovskite catalysts. Our experiments and theoretical calculations attribute the superb performance mainly to the following factors: the asymmetric CuO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;CuO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; sites promoting differentiated *CO adsorption/hydrogenation to favor asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling; the strengthened Cu&#9472;O covalency stabilizing the Cu sites. Extending this strategy to two additional pairs of Cu-based perovskite oxides generates similarly successful results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Atomically Precise Copper Cluster Nanoreactor for Efficient Catalysis in Chemical Fixation of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise I@Cu8 cluster with high thermal/chemical stability represents the first example of a cluster&#8208;based nanoreactor that demonstrates excellent catalytic activity in chemical fixation of both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols with CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations due to the unique substrate enrichment of well&#8208;defined nanocavities.








Abstract
Chemical fixation of CO2 with propargylic amines/alcohols into high value&#8208;added fine chemicals represents promising and practical routes for CO2 resource utilization, but it remains a great challenge to achieve low&#8208;concentration CO2 conversion in both reactions through one single catalytic system. Herein, a robust copper cluster [(C6H15NH)(Cu8L8I)] (I@Cu8) with nanosized cavities has been constructed. Importantly, the I@Cu8 cluster as a nanoreactor can efficiently catalyze the chemical conversion of both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols with CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, due to the unique substrate enrichment effect of its well&#8208;defined nanocavities. Catalytic mechanism investigation and DFT calculations illustrate that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the simultaneous activation of alkynyl (&#9472;C&#8801;CH) bonds and amino/hydroxyl (&#9472;NHR/&#9472;OH) groups in the I@Cu8 catalytic system, in which the I@Cu8&#8208;substrate intermediates have been confirmed through ESI&#8208;MS analysis. Impressively, this is the first example of a cluster&#8208;based nanoreactor catalyst for low&#8208;concentration CO2 cyclization reactions with both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols. This work provides a foundation for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 conversion into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Suppressing Halide Segregation of Wide Bandgap Perovskite by Interface Molecular Coordination for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pretreatment of the hole transport layer with p&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (PXA) effectively improves the crystallization quality of the bottom interface of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite, reduces interfacial defects, and suppresses bromine&#8211;iodine phase segregation, ultimately enabling the fabrication of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 28.65% under standard air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight.








Abstract
Hole transporting layers made by self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) are emerging as promising hole transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells, owing to their reduced parasitic absorption and effective carrier extraction. However, perovskite films grown on HTM substrates typically exhibit a high defect density, which adversely affects device performance. In this study, we investigated the film growth kinetics of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite on monolayer material substrates and uncovered a halide phase segregation in the initial nucleation stage during crystal growth kinetics at the interface, which brings small grain sizes and significant lattice strain within the perovskite film. To address this issue, we introduced a biphosphate&#8208;substituted molecule on the HTM surface to coordinate with PbBr2 that suppresses halide phase segregation, leading to improved crystallographic orientation and a reduction in defect density. As a result, the wide&#8208;bandgap (1.77&#160;eV) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.35&#160;V, while tandem devices reached an impressive efficiency of 28.65%.

         <title>A 3.8&#160;V Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery Enabled by a Conjugated Ladder Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a conjugated ladder polymer, poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), as an efficient anode material to store NR4+, and construct a record&#8208;high voltage 3.8&#160;V NR4+&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) by matching the BBL anode with a graphite cathode. The resultant DIB shows a maximum energy/power density up to 232&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1/6865&#160;W kg&#8722;1 based on graphite mass, superior rate performance, and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on nonmetal charge carriers like NH4+ recently have attracted intensive attention due to high safety, environmental friendliness, low cost, and fast kinetics. However, NH4+ electrolytes suffer from a narrow electrochemical potential window, making it challenging to construct high&#8208;voltage and energy&#8208;dense devices. Here we report a quaternary ammonium (NR4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) working at a high voltage of 3.8&#160;V, which was enabled by a conjugated ladder polymer poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) anode for NR4+ storage and a graphite cathode for anion uptake. The BBL functions as an efficient NR4+ host by carbonyl/enol transformation, delivering a high capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1, low average potential, high stability, and excellent rate performance. In the redox process, the electronic and ionic conductivities of BBL change periodically, accompanied by the formation of radical anion (&#9679;&#8722;) and diradical dianion (2&#9679;&#8722;). In combination with an anion&#8208;intercalation graphite cathode, the assembled graphite//BBL DIB exhibits a maximum energy/power density up to 232&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 6865&#160;W kg&#8722;1 based on mass of graphite, superior rate performance, and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of NR4+ as cation carrier and its efficient host, which will inspire novel designs for high&#8208;performance nonmetallic energy storage devices.

Porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing the formation of ammonia and hydrogen byproducts.








Abstract
Cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis from low&#8208;concentration NO is important but suffers from low Faraday efficiency and current density because of severe competitive hydrogen and ammonia evolution reactions. Here, porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Mechanistic studies reveal that porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing ammonia and hydrogen formation. This work paves the way for accessing low&#8208;concentration gaseous reactants for various catalytic reactions.

         <title>A Bioinspired Diazafluorenone Catalytic System for Aerobic Oxidative Deamination of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient biomimetic aerobic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;amino amides and benzylamines into &#945;&#8208;keto amides and aromatic aldehydes is enabled by 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), a new organocatalyst with a simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity.








Abstract
Copper amine oxidases (CAOs) catalyze aerobic oxidation of primary amines into carbonyl compounds, which is an important biological process as well as a useful transformation for organic synthesis. A new bioinspired organocatalyst, 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), has been discovered, which exhibits impressive characteristics, including simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity, enabling it to effectively mimic the function of copper amine oxidases. Oxidative deamination of &#945;&#8208;amino amides presents an attractive approach to access &#945;&#8208;keto amides; however, it is difficult to achieve due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric effect. The diazafluorenone displays high catalytic activity in this transformation, producing various biologically significant &#945;&#8208;keto amides in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the diazafluorenone catalyst is able to promote direct oxidation of benzylamines into aromatic aldehydes, instead of the generally formed product&#8208;reactant imines, which leads to no greater than 50% yields of the desired aldehydes. The current aerobic oxidative deamination proceeds via a pathway similar to the biological process, involving transamination, hydrolysis/aminolysis, and aerobic oxidation.

         <title>Probing Multilevel Chiroptical Activity in Organic Supramolecular Microcrystals for High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of chiroptical activity from chiral molecular monomers to dimers to supramolecular helices is tracked for exploring high&#8208;performance organic circularly polarized lasers. By virtue of the efficient coupling of multilevel chiroptical activity with high optical gain, the chiral organic supramolecular microcrystals exhibit circularly polarized laser outputs with dissymmetry factors up to &#8764;1.3 and quantum yields close to 100%.








Abstract
Chiral organic materials are rapidly emerging as a promising platform for circularly polarized lasing. However, the lag in mechanistic research has severely hindered the development of organic circularly polarized lasers. Here, we attempt to probe multilevel chiroptical activity in organic supramolecular microcrystals for exploring high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. The evolution of chiroptical activity is tracked spanning from chiral molecular monomers to dimers to supramolecular helices. The crucial roles of excimers and supramolecular helices in achieving high optical gain and large chiroptical activity are revealed. Accordingly, circularly polarized lasing with low thresholds and large dissymmetry factors is realized in the organic supramolecular microcrystals. Our work marks the beginning of mechanistic research on chirality induced circularly polarized lasing, which will initiate the rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.

         <title>Orthogonal Multiple Hydrogen Bonds of Nucleobases Enable Precise Tunability of DNA&#8208;Polymer Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple hydrogen bond (MHB) interactions for hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNA chains are highly selective and orthogonal, owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity. Orthogonal MHBs enable us to tailor DNA nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic domain, amplifying the production of diverse functional DNA nanostructures.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures manifest enhanced stability and chemical diversity for various applications such as sensing, imaging, and immune modulation. However, the functionality of the hydrophobic polymer in the core is often disregarded, leading to limited property tunability of DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures. Herein, we have successfully fabricated tunable DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures by harnessing orthogonal multiple hydrogen bonds (MHBs) within both the core and shell domains. Distinct DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures, consisting of hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNAs, have been rationally designed and successfully constructed. The DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures undergo the controlled morphological transformation triggered by hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and surface functionalization by hydrophilic DNA chains. Owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity, the robust MHB interactions for complementary DNAs and nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers are highly selective and orthogonal. Most significantly, the reported core&#8208;driven morphological transformation and surface functionalization of the shell layer are general to expand the structural and properties tunability of DNA nanostructures with different DNA sequences. This work provides an efficient and novel route to precisely modulating DNA&#8208;polymer core&#8208;shell nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic core through orthogonal MHBs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Blocking Strategy Boosts H2S Tolerance in Platinum&#8208;Based Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the S&#8208;contained poisoning intermediates formed on pure Pt could be limited on PtRu alloy to enhance the H2S tolerance in hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cells, which originates from the site&#8208;blocking effect and electronic tuning effect induced by Ru.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) show great potential for energy conversion, but their platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts are easily and irreversibly poisoned by trace impurities like H2S, causing performance degradation with unclear mechanisms. Here, combining in situ Raman spectroscopy with theoretical calculations, we found that on pure Pt surfaces, H2S dissociates into S* and HS* intermediates that occupy active sites of continuous Pt atoms in an acidic solution under 50&#160;ppm H2S/H2 atmosphere. However, on PtRu alloy surfaces, while *OH species were observed on Ru sites, no sulfur&#8208;containing species were detected on Pt sites. Comparative experiments revealed that the sulfur&#8208;related Raman peaks of PtRu exhibited a redshift compared to Pt, indicating that Ru alloying weakens the *S adsorption on Pt sites through electronic effects. These results demonstrate that Ru not only creates discontinuous Pt sites to block sulfur adsorption but also significantly weakens sulfur binding through electronic modulation. Based on these insights, small&#8208;sized site&#8208;blocking PtRu/C catalysts were developed, exhibiting only 9.2% activity decay after 700s in 50&#160;ppm H2S/H2 atmosphere, a 4.3&#8208;fold improvement over commercial Pt/C catalysts (39.3% decay). This work provides fundamental understanding of H2S poisoning mechanisms and practical guidelines for designing robust, poison&#8208;resistant catalysts.

         <title>Intermolecular Sp3C&#9472;H Metalation of Non&#8208;Nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted Bases Using Simple Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M&#9552;Al or Ga, X&#9552;Cl, Br or I) effect the sp3C&#9472;H metalation of a number of hindered bases, including the ubiquitous non&#8208;nucleophilic 2,6&#8208;ditertbutyl substituted pyridine/pyrimidines. Mechanistic studies indicate a frustrated Lewis pair mechanism requiring singly halide&#8208;bridged super&#8208;electrophilic M2X6 dimers for sufficiently low C&#9472;H metalation barriers.








Abstract
2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl substituted pyridines (tBu2&#8208;py) are widely used non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases. Their ubiquity is due to their highly hindered basic site and chemically robust nature. Herein we report that simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M&#9552;Al or Ga, X&#9552;Cl, Br or I) effect intermolecular sp3C&#9472;H metalation of tBu2&#8208;py bases under mild conditions. The sp3C&#9472;H metalated products can be converted in situ into &#9472;BPin, &#9472;iodo, &#9472;bromo and &#9472;hydroxy derivatives for further elaboration. Mechanistic investigations indicate that: i) a frustrated Lewis pair effects sp3C&#9472;H heterolysis to form the C&#9472;M bond and a protonated pyridine; ii) C&#9472;H metalation requires singly halide&#8208;bridged super&#8208;electrophilic M2X6 dimers for sufficiently low barriers. Finally, sp3C&#9472;H metalation using M2X6 is not limited to tBu2&#8208;py bases. Thus, it is important to be aware of this facile sp3C&#9472;H functionalisation when using a range of non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases.

         <title>Is the Smallest Molecular Trefoil Knot Actually the Tightest One?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a modular self&#8208;assembly strategy has enabled the successful synthesis of a new family of molecular trefoil knots with varied backbone&#8208;atom numbers. An interesting odd&#8208;even effect of alkyl chain linkers on their tightness was demonstrated, which not only provides key insights into size&#8208;tightness relationships but also guides further development of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials. 








Abstract
Tightness engineering has evolved as an efficient strategy for the design of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials with desired properties and functions since tightness is a primary parameter that determines the property of a knotted strand. However, as an attractive topic that inspires mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and biologists, whether the smallest knot is exactly the tightest one remains unaddressed experimentally. To tackle this challenge, a series of organic trefoil knots with the backbone&#8208;atom as short as 70 have been successfully synthesized by developing a new modular self&#8208;assembly approach in this study. To our great surprise, with the help of gradient tandem mass spectrometry, the quantitative tightness evaluation suggested that the molecular trefoil knot with a backbone crossing ratio (BCR) of 24.0 is even tighter than the one with a BCR of 23.3 (i.e., the smallest organic trefoil knot with the shortest ropelength synthesized so far), thus demonstrating an unexpected yet interesting odd&#8208;even effect to enhance the understanding of the tightness regulation of molecular knots.

         <title>Engineering Neural Stem Cells with Micropatches for Improved Therapy of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional micropatches are fabricated through microcontact printing techniques and are adhered to the membrane of neural stem cells through tuning material&#8211;cell interaction. The micropatches on the membrane can move together with implanted neural stem cells and sustainedly release retinoic acid to promote the neuronal differentiation of stem cells and thus improve their therapeutic performance in repairing traumatic brain injury.








Abstract
Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) holds promise for repairing traumatic brain injury (TBI) but their therapeutic performance is hindered due to the low efficient differentiation into neurons. Direct injection of differentiation modulators to the lesion site has limited improvement to neuronal differentiation as they tend to diffuse or be degraded. In the present study, we report a simple and versatile strategy to engineer the NSCs with a micropatch to improve their therapeutic performance in TBI treatment. The micropatches are fabricated through microcontact printing technique and can adhere to the membrane with negligible detachment or internalization within 14 days after surface modification. The micropatches on the cell membrane can move together with stem cells and sustainedly release retinoic acid, a neuronal differentiation modulator, to regulate the surrounding microenvironment of NSCs, improving their neuronal differentiation rate from 28.0% to 54.2%. The micropatch&#8208;engineered NSCs can be implanted into the injured brain tissue through a minimally invasive microinjection approach and show outperformance in repairing damaged neural tissue of TBI mice compared to normal stem cells. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway to engineer stem cells and holds great potential in nerve regeneration and neurodegenerative disease treatment.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis From CO2 and Nitrate via Porphyrin and Metalloporphyrin MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PMOF) and Cu&#8208;metallated PMOF for adaptive electrocatalytic urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;), addressing concentration&#8208;dependent challenges. PMOF facilitates&#160;*HNO2&#8208;*CO2 coupling under concentrated NO3&#8722;, while Cu&#8208;porphyrin MOF (Cu&#8208;PMOF) promotes&#160;*NO&#8208;*CO coupling in dilute conditions, with theoretical calculations and in situ studies revealing distinct C&#8208;N coupling pathways for sustainable urea production.








Abstract
Traditional urea synthesis via the Bosch&#8211;Meiser process suffers from high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Electrocatalytic urea production from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) under ambient conditions offers a sustainable alternative, yet challenges persist due to variable NO3&#8722; concentrations and competing side reactions. Herein, we propose porphyrin metal&#8208;organic framework (PMOF) and Cu&#8208;porphyrin MOF (Cu&#8208;PMOF) catalysts for NO3&#8722; concentration&#8208;adaptive urea synthesis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that PMOF weakly adsorbs *NO2 via hydrogen bonding, favoring its coupling with *CO2, while Cu&#8208;PMOF strongly binds *NO2 at Cu sites, facilitating spontaneous *NO/*CO coupling to form *OCNO intermediates under dilute NO3&#8722; conditions. Experimentally, PMOF achieves a urea yield of 28.6&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 23.1% in 0.1&#160;M NO3&#8722;, whereas Cu&#8208;PMOF outperforms in 0.05&#160;M NO3&#8722; with a yield of 25.5&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and FE of 52.7%. In situ spectroscopy and mechanistic study confirm distinct pathways: PMOF relies on stepwise coupling of *HNO2 with *CO2, while Cu&#8208;PMOF enables consecutive *NO&#8208;*CO coupling. This work highlights adaptive electrocatalyst design for efficient C&#8208;N coupling, advancing sustainable urea synthesis.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with a yield of 25.5&#160;&#181;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and FE of 52.7%. In situ spectroscopy and mechanistic study confirm distinct pathways: PMOF relies on stepwise coupling of *HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while Cu-PMOF enables consecutive *NO-*CO coupling.

         <title>Scalable Hyperpolarized MRI Enabled by Ace&#8208;SABRE of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ace&#8208;SABRE overcomes previous biocompatibility challenges associated with the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) hyperpolarization technique. The employed acetone&#8211;water mixtures greatly simplify separation of the hyperpolarized compound (e.g., pyruvate) from solvents and catalysts delivering a biocompatible injectable. Ace&#8208;SABRE retains high polarization during processing and enables effective metabolic characterization&#160;in vivo.








Abstract
Hyperpolarized (HP) MRI using [1&#8211;13C]pyruvate is emerging as a promising molecular imaging approach. Among hyperpolarization methods, Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is attractive because SABRE polarizes the substrates directly in room&#8208;temperature solutions avoiding complex hardware. Most SABRE experiments have historically been performed in methanol, a relatively toxic and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;remove solvent. Here we demonstrate the use of a 80/20 acetone/water (A/W) solvent system (Ace&#8208;SABRE) to provide hyperpolarized [1&#8211;13C]pyruvate with up to 17% polarization, then implement a solvent processing protocol to achieve injectable solutions retaining 74% of the initial polarization, and lastly we demonstrate HP in vivo spectroscopy and imaging using the Ace&#8208;SABRE platform to showcase metabolic tracking in a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor as well as HP&#8208;MRI, both in direct comparison to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) experiments. The Ace&#8208;SABRE technique promises faster adoption of SABRE hyperpolarization in biological experiments, overall lowering the barriers to entry for HP&#8208;NMR and HP&#8208;MRI.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Reconstruction of Cation&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched Ni@Ni2P Particles in Hollow N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers&#8208;encapsulated defective Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP particles are rationally synthesized for efficient catalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, where the in situ electrochemical reconstruction induces the formation of new active Ni(OH)2 species. 








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions is promising to promote the artificial nitrogen cycling. Despite the development of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts, their incident in situ electrochemical reconstruction always leads to the ambiguity of veritable active sites and reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report an approach to encapsulate Ni@Ni2P particles with cationic Ni vacancies in hollow N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (designated Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs) for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and have investigated their surface reconstruction and reaction mechanisms using various in situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations. Specially, the regulation of cationic Ni vacancy concentration in the three defective Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs catalysts leads to the 3.92&#8208;fold NH3 yield rate difference at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus RHE. During the electrocatalytic reaction process, new amorphous Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH species form on the surface of Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs and the stable amorphous Ni(OH)2 species benefits the generation of more active hydrogen (*H) for hydrogenation with NO3&#8722;. This is further verified by the different reaction rate&#8208;determining steps on the pristine and reconstructed defective catalysts. Integration of the optimized defective catalyst as cathode into a stable aqueous Zn&#8211;NO3&#8211;battery provides high power density and Faraday efficiency for NH3.

         <title>Regulate the Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gap by Spatially Separating HOMO and LUMO for High Performance Organic Photovoltaic Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor with both small &#8710;EST and high performance is challenging. To address this, YDF, YTF, and YTF&#8208;H were synthesized. YDF&#8208;based device achieved a high PCE of 20.04% via partial orbital separation. YTF's spatially separated HOMO and LUMO indeed lead to a much reduced &#8710;EST caused by decreasing S1 but also caused strong S1&#8208;S0 couplings. These results indicate the ideal scenario would be to elevate the T1 state, thereby mitigating the energy gap law.








Abstract
Reducing the single&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;EST) for organic photovoltaic (OPV) molecules has been proposed to be able to reduce the nonradiative recombination by tuning the low&#8208;lying triplet state (T1) and/or the excited state (S1), thus reducing the energy loss (Eloss) and increasing the open&#8208;circuit voltage in their devices. However, how to design the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) with small &#8710;EST and high performance is challenging. Aiming to address this issue, YDF, YTF, and YTF&#8208;H were synthesized. Among them, a device based on YDF with partially spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) exhibits a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.04%, which is one of the most efficient efficiencies for binary systems. For YTF and YTF&#8208;H, their completely spatially separated HOMO and LUMO indeed lead to a much reduced &#8710;EST caused by the low&#8208;lying S1 state, together with excellent charge mobility and light absorption, required for higher performance OPV. But their low S1 state causes several non&#8208;radiative recombinations due to strong S1&#8208;S0 coupling (PCE&#160;&lt;&#160;1.5%). These results indicate that future designs to have high performance molecules with small &#8710;EST should avoid the sharp decrease in S1, and the ideal scenario would be to elevate the T1 state, thereby mitigating the energy gap law.

         <title>Design Strategy for Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes: Regulated Active Groups Enable High Capacity and Voltage in Aqueous and Seawater Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heteroaromatic organic small&#8208;molecule (DPPZ&#8208;CN) exhibits strong intermolecular interactions and high reactivity. When DPPZ&#8208;CN is used as the cathode material in aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the Al//DPPZ&#8208;CN battery demonstrates exceptional capacity, voltage plateau, and lifespan, even maintaining superior electrochemical performance in seawater, which highlights its potential for challenging environments.

Organic materials demonstrate significant potential as electrodes for aqueous batteries, owing to their high theoretical capacity, structurally tunable frameworks, and sustainable material accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule organic electrode materials enable better active&#8208;site accessibility but remain challenged by the dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, which deteriorates cycling stability, and poor conductivity due to limited conjugation. Here, we designed an organic small&#8208;molecule cathode material (DPPZ&#8208;CN) featuring functional pyridine, pyrazine, and cyano groups. Its highly conjugated fused N&#8208;heteroaromatic structure provides strong intermolecular interactions and high reactivity, resulting in improved stability, capacity, and conductivity. The electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano group further modulates electron delocalization and molecular orbitals, enhancing electronic conductivity and operating voltage. Through combined theoretical and experimental studies, including operando synchrotron FT&#8208;IR, in situ Raman, ex situ XPS, and 1H NMR, we demonstrate that DPPZ&#8208;CN facilitates efficient dual&#8208;cation storage (Al3+/H+), thereby reducing Al3+ cation repulsion and induced structural distortion. As a result, the Al//DPPZ&#8208;CN battery exhibits outstanding capacity, a well&#8208;defined voltage plateau, and an extended lifespan in organic aluminum batteries with aqueous and seawater electrolytes, highlighting its potential for operation in challenging environments.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Ratchet Mechanism Accelerates Regioselective Metal&#8208;Cation Exchange in a Heterobimetallic Helicate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates form with high diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity via single&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly or self&#8208;sorting. White&#8208;light exposure autonomously operates one helicate as a molecular ratchet, promoting the selective formation of an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium structure. This ratchet mechanism furthermore accelerates regioselective metal&#8208;cation exchange from a homometallic to a heterometallic helicate.








Abstract
Molecular machines rely on their capacity to exploit non&#8208;equilibrium processes to perform work. However, the development of these non&#8208;equilibrium processes, such as molecular ratchets, is still in its early stages. Here, we report a diazocine&#8208;containing ligand (L) harbouring two distinct chelating coordination sites that can self&#8208;sort into dinuclear homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates ([FeII2L](OTf)4, [CoII2L](OTf)4, [ZnII2L](OTf)4, [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4, [ZnIICoIIL](OTf)4) with precisely controlled metal cation distribution. The photoisomerisation of the helicates operates via a molecular ratchet mechanism, resulting in metastable diastereomers that shift the system from thermodynamic equilibrium. Continuous white&#8208;light irradiation autonomously drives this ratchet process, selectively enriching an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pseudo&#8208;mesocate structure. Crucially, the ratchet mechanism can significantly accelerate metal&#8208;cation exchange from the [ZnII2L](OTf)4 helicate to the [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4 helicate. Thus, the system operates in a manner reminiscent of a &#8220;claw machine&#8221;, selectively seizing FeII ions when subjected to a precisely controllable external stimulus. These findings lay the foundation for creating adaptive and reconfigurable supramolecular structures that use non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena on a molecular level.

         <title>Structural Differentiation of Homologous Anisodimensional Frameworks Driven by Site&#8208;Selective Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report for the first time a site&#8208;selective polymerization strategy enabling the dimensional differentiation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from identical building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. The modulator plays a dual regulatory role by enhancing the reaction reversibility and regulating the conformational flexibility of monomers, leading to the formation of 2D and 3D COFs with distinct photocatalytic performances.








Abstract
Theoretically, distinguished from the dimensional isomers in reticular chemistry, structures with different dimensions can also be formed by site&#8208;selective polymerization using identical building blocks bearing a high density of reactive sites. Unfortunately, the spatial confinement imposes significant challenges for molecular building blocks to achieve dimensional differentiation via their intrinsic site&#8208;selective reactivity. In this work, we first report the dimensional differentiation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) driven by site&#8208;selective polymerization of identical molecular building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. This unique phenomenon was demonstrated for the first time to originate from the role of aniline in enhancing the reversibility of the reaction system and modulating the conformational flexibility of the monomers. We systematically elucidated the mechanism underlying this dimensional differentiation and successfully demonstrated the generality of the synthetic strategy. Moreover, the residual benzaldehyde in the frameworks generated via the site&#8208;selective polymerization of the building blocks can serve as exciton acceptors, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work not only offers a novel strategy for regulating the dimensionality of COFs but also provides a valuable reference for precisely controlling the conformational flexibility of building blocks to enable topological transformations.

         <title>Local Electric Field Microenvironment&#8208;Induced Dynamic Spatial Confinement to Stabilize I+ Toward High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading and Stable Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A local electric field (LEF) microenvironment is induced by the abundant polyquaternary ammonium cations in polydimethylammonium iodide (PDDA&#8208;I), which effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl&#8722;) on the cathode.This design dynamically coordinates the dense ligand sites around I+, ensuring the stable conversion of I+ ion even under high iodine mass loading conditions.








Abstract
Four&#8208;electron iodine conversion chemistry (I&#8722;/I2/I+) endows zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with competitive energy density. The stability of I+ conversion relies on its interaction with sufficient nucleophilic species (e.g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;). However, under high iodine loading, nucleophilic species fail to afford sufficient coordination strength and number within thick iodine cathode to stabilize I+, thus compromising the high&#8208;voltage plateau and capacity. Here, we effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl&#8722;) on the cathode by &#9472;C&#9472;N+&#8208;induced localized electric field (LEF) microenvironment in polyquaternary ammonium iodide (PDDA&#8208;I). Spatial confinement maximizes Cl&#8722; concentration on the cathode ensuring highly reversible I0/I+ conversion, even in the low&#8208;concentrated ZnCl2 addition and high iodine loading. Importantly, the dynamically regulated Cl&#8722; maintains a balance with iodine species at the &#9472;C&#9472;N+ sites during cycling, effectively limiting the shuttling effect of polyiodides. Consequently, even adopting a high iodine loading of 16.03&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the PDDA&#8208;I still maintains a distinct four&#8208;electron&#8208;conversion dual voltage plateau with a remarkable capacity of 4.97 mAh cm&#8722;2. An impressive lifespan of 10&#160;000 cycles is achieved at 12.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with a capacity decay of 0.0012% per cycle, exceeding conventional iodine cathodes by 20&#8208;fold. This work provides an important reference for high&#8208;performance four&#8208;electron conversion zinc&#8211;iodine batteries at high iodine loading.

         <title>Stepwise Post&#8208;Modification of Pyridine&#8208;Imine COFs for Enhanced Hydrolytic Stability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;condensation reaction of bifunctional monomers containing both amino and acetal groups yielded COF&#8208;LIFM7. Via subsequent amidation and N&#8208;oxidation modifications, the pore polarity and hydrophilicity of the post&#8208;modified COFs were progressively enhanced, consequently leading to a significant increase in proton conductivity. 








Abstract
Emerging as a type of promising material for proton conduction, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) assembled from dynamic imine bonds face a challenge of surmounting hydrolytic instability to achieve long&#8208;term performance in humid environments. In this work, we report a post&#8208;synthetic strategy to simultaneously enhance the hydrolytic stability and hydrophilicity of a pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;LIFM7, without compromising its crystallinity and porosity. A bifunctional monomer containing amino and acetal groups was employed to construct the primary framework, which was subsequently modified via amide formation and pyridine N&#8208;oxidation to yield COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide and COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide&#8208;N+O&#8722;. These stepwise modifications increased the polarity and hydrogen&#8208;binding sites within COF pores to improve water affinity, leading to a three&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in the proton conductivity for COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide&#8208;N+O&#8722;, reaching 1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 95% relative humidity and 70&#160;&#176;C. This study highlights a generalizable post&#8208;synthetic approach for tuning the pore chemistry of COFs to achieve high performance in proton&#8208;conducting applications under humid conditions.

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>
