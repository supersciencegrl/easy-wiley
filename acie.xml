         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 with CeO2 Catalyst for Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) into urea by photocatalytic reaction under mild conditions is considered to be a more environmentally friendly and promising alternative strategies. However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of inert gas on photocatalysts has become the main challenge that hinder the advancement of this technique. Herein, we have successfully established mesoporous CeO2&#8208;x nanorods with adjustable oxygen vacancy concentration by heat treatment in Ar/H2 (90%:10%) atmosphere, enhancing the targeted adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 by introducing oxygen vacancies. Particularly, CeO2&#8208;500 (CeO2 nanorods heated treatment at 500 &#176;C) revealed high photocatalytic activity toward the C&#8208;N coupling reaction for urea synthesis with a remarkable urea yield rate of 15.5 &#956;g/h. Besides, both aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy were used to research the atomic surface structure of CeO2&#8208;500 at high resolution and to monitor the key intermediate precursors generated. The reaction mechanism of photocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments. We hope this work provides important inspiration and guiding significance towards highly efficient photocatalytic synthesis of urea.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Allylation of Ketones with Allenylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a regiodivergent and enantioselective allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes through copper catalysis. With the combination of CuOAc, a Josiphos&#8208;type bidentate phosphine ligand and PhSiH3, allyl addition to a variety of ketones furnishes branched products in excellent enantioselectivities. The regioselectivity is completely reversed by employing the P&#8208;stereogenic ligand BenzP*, affording the linear products with excellent enantioselectivities and good Z&#8208;selectivities. The linear Z&#8208;product could be converted to E&#8208;product via a catalytic geometric isomerization of the Z&#8208;alkene group. The silyl group in the products could provide a handle for downstream elaboration.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Proton&#8208;coupled Electron Transfer via Fe&#8208;P Atomic Pair for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalytic activity, but poor kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps still limit the overall performance toward the industrial scale. Here, we constructed a Fe&#8208;P atom paired catalyst onto nitrogen doped graphitic layer (Fe1/PNG) to accelerate PCET step. Fe1/PNG delivers an industrial CO current of 1 A with FECO over 90% at 2.5 V in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly, overperforming the CO current of Fe1/NG by more than 300%. We also decrypted the synergistic effects of the P atom in the Fe&#8208;P atom pair using operando techniques and density functional theory, revealing that the P atom provides additional adsorption sites for accelerating water dissociation, boosting the hydrogenation of CO2, and enhancing the activity of CO2 reduction. This atom&#8208;pair catalytic strategy can modulate multiple reactants and intermediates to break through the inherent limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Ligand Exchange Dynamics on Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Reversible Sorting and Hybridization of Miktoarm Star Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise synthesis of miktoarm star polymers (MSPs) remains one of the great challenges in synthetic chemistry due to the difficulty in locating appropriate structural templates and polymer grafting/growing strategies with high selectivity and efficiency. Herein, ~ 2 nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), constructed from the coordination of isophthalic acid (IPA) and Cu2+, are applied as templates for the precise synthesis of 24&#8208;arm MSPs for their unique logarithmic ligand exchange dynamics. Six different polymers are prepared with IPA as an end group and they further coordinated with Cu2+ to afford corresponding 24&#8208;arm star homo&#8208;polymers, respectively. MSPs can be obtained by mixing targeted homo&#8208;arm star polymers in solutions upon thermal annealing. The compositions of MSPs can be facilely and precisely tuned via the recipe of the inputted star polymer mixtures. Interestingly, the obtained MSPs can be sorted into homo&#8208;arm star polymers through a typical solvent extraction protocol. The hybridization and sorting process can be reversibly conducted via the cycle of thermal annealing and solvent treatment. The complex coordination framework not only opens new avenues for the facile and precise synthesis of MSPs and MOPs with hybrid functionalities, but also provides the capability to design sustainable polymer systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid, Selective Extraction of Silver from Complex Water Matrices with a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework/Oligomer Composite Constructed via Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Every year vast quantities of silver are lost in various waste streams; this, combined with its limited, diminishing supply and rising demand, makes silver recovery of increasing importance. Thus, herein, we report a controllable, green process to produce a host of highly porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)/oligomer composites using supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2) as a medium. One resulting composite, referred to as MIL&#8208;127/Poly&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine (PoPD), has an excellent Ag+ adsorption capacity, removal efficiency (&gt;99%) and provides rapid Ag+ extraction in as little as 5 min from complex liquid matrices. Notably, the composite can also reduce sliver concentrations below the levels (&lt;0.1 ppm) established by the United States&#160;Environmental Protection Agency. Using theoretical simulations, we find that there are spatially ordered polymeric units inside the MOF that promotes the complexation of Ag+ over other common competing ions. Moreover, the oligomer is able to reduce silver to its metallic state, also providing antibacterial properties.</dc:description>

         <title>NADH Photosynthesis System with Affordable Electron Supply and Inhibited NADH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthesis offers a green approach for the recycling of nicotinamide cofactors primarily NADH in bio&#8208;redox reactions. Herein, we report an NADH photosynthesis system where the biomass derivatives oxidation is designed as an electron supply module (ESM) to afford electrons and the superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascades catalysis is designed as reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Glucose as the electron donor guarantees the reaction sustainability accompanied with oxidative products of gluconic acid and formic acid. Meanwhile, enzyme cascades of SOD/CAT greatly eliminate ROS, leading to a ~2.00&#8208;fold elevation of NADH yield (61.1% vs. 30.7%). The initial reaction rate and turnover frequency (TOF) increased by 2.50 times and 2.54 times, respectively, compared with those systems without REM. Our study establishes a novel and efficient platform for NADH photosynthesis coupled to biomass&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia via Tuning of N&#8208;Intermediate Adsorption on a Zn&#8208;Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;powered electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8208;) to ammonia (NH3) has garnered significant interest as an eco&#8208;friendly and promising substitute for the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, the sluggish kinetics hinders its application at a large scale. Herein, we first calculated the N&#8208;containing species (*NO3 and *NO2) binding energy and the free energy of the hydrogen evolution reaction over Cu with different metal dopants, and it was shown that Zn was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we designed and synthesized Zn&#8208;doped Cu nanosheets, and the as&#8208;prepared catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3. The maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of NH3 could reach 98.4% with an outstanding yield rate of 5.8 mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is among the best results up to date. The catalyst also had excellent cycling stability. Meanwhile, it also presented a FE exceeding 90% across a wide potential range and NO3&#8208; concentration range. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Zn doping could modulate intermediates adsorption strength, enhance NO2&#8208; conversion, change the *NO adsorption configuration to a bridge adsorption, and decrease the energy barrier, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.</dc:description>

However, the sluggish kinetics hinders its application at a large scale. Herein, we first calculated the N-containing species (*NO3 and *NO2) binding energy and the free energy of the hydrogen evolution reaction over Cu with different metal dopants, and it was shown that Zn was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we designed and synthesized Zn-doped Cu nanosheets, and the as-prepared catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in NO3--to-NH3. The maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of NH3 could reach 98.4% with an outstanding yield rate of 5.8 mol g-1 h-1, which is among the best results up to date. The catalyst also had excellent cycling stability. Meanwhile, it also presented a FE exceeding 90% across a wide potential range and NO3- concentration range. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Zn doping could modulate intermediates adsorption strength, enhance NO2- conversion, change the *NO adsorption configuration to a bridge adsorption, and decrease the energy barrier, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3--to-NH3.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic ipso&#8208;Nitration of Organosilanes Enabled by Electrophilic N&#8208;Nitrosaccharin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deploying N&#8208;nitrosaccharin reagents in combination with Lewis acid activation enables the facile, regio&#8208; and chemoselective nitration of (het)aryl silanes, allowing the introduction of nitro group under unprecedently mild conditions suitable for the late&#8208;stage nitration of complex and polyfunctionalized molecules. Theoretical and experimental mechanistic investigations formulate a plausible mechanism involving a &#8220;Wheland transition state&#8221;.







Abstract
Nitroaromatic compounds represent one of the essential classes of molecules that are widely used as feedstock for the synthesis of intermediates, the preparation of nitro&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials on both laboratory and industrial scales. We herein disclose the efficient, mild, and catalytic ipso&#8208;nitration of organotrimethylsilanes, enabled by an electrophilic N&#8208;nitrosaccharin reagent and allows chemoselective nitration under mild reaction conditions, while exhibiting remarkable substrate generality and functional group compatibility. Additionally, the reaction conditions proved to be orthogonal to other common functionalities, allowing programming of molecular complexity via successive transformations or late&#8208;stage nitration. Detailed mechanistic investigation by experimental and computational approaches strongly supported a classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism, which was found to proceed through a highly ordered transition state.

         <title>Highly Efficient Decomposition of Perfluorocarbons for over 1000 Hours via Active Site Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga assists the defluorination of Al&#8722;F over a Ga/&#952;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst. Al&#8722;OH reacts with CF4 to form Al&#8722;F, resulting in fluorine poisoning on the Al active sites. Adsorption of F at the Al active site is strong and limits the regeneration of the Al&#8722;OH site. However, Ga exhibits weaker adsorption of F and the resulting Ga&#8722;F can easily hydrolyze to Ga&#8722;OH, which can assist the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites through a dehydration&#8208;like process.







Abstract
Tetrafluoromethane (CF4), the simplest perfluorocarbon (PFC), has the potential to exacerbate global warming. Catalytic hydrolysis is a viable method to degrade CF4, but fluorine poisoning severely restricts both the catalytic performance and catalyst lifetime. In this study, Ga is introduced to effectively assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites, leading to highly efficient CF4 decomposition at 600&#8201;&#176;C with a catalytic lifetime exceeding 1,000&#8197;hours. 27Al and 71Ga magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) showed that the introduced Ga exists as tetracoordinated Ga sites (GaIV), which readily dissociate water to form Ga&#8722;OH. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density function theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that Ga&#8722;OH assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites via a dehydration&#8208;like process. As a result, the Ga/Al2O3 catalyst achieved 100&#8201;% CF4 decomposition keeping an ultra&#8208;long catalytic lifetime and outperforming reported results. This work proposes a new approach for efficient and long&#8208;term CF4 decomposition by promoting the regeneration of active sites.

         <title>A Cationic Metal Glue Strategy for Expanding Paramagnetic Hetero&#8208;Multinuclear Metal&#8208;Oxo Clusters within Polyoxometalate Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; for increasing the size and nuclearity of hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters is demonstrated by using lacunary&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) as rigid multidentate ligands. The method enabled the expansion of {FeMn4} to {(FeMn4)Mn2Ln2(FeMn4)} oxo clusters (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, and Lu), which are the largest among previously reported paramagnetic hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters in POMs.







Abstract
Precise structural design of large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters is crucial for controlling their large spin ground states and multielectron redox properties for application as a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM), molecular magnetic refrigeration, and efficient redox catalyst. However, it is difficult to synthesize large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal oxo clusters as designed because the final structures are unpredictable when employing conventional one&#8208;step condensation reaction of metal cations and ligands. Herein, we report a &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; for increasing the size and nuclearity of hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters by using lacunary&#8208;type anionic molecular metal oxides (polyoxometalates, POMs) as rigid multidentate ligands. The employed method enabled the synthesis of {(FeMn4)Mn2Ln2(FeMn4)} oxo clusters (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, and Lu), which are the largest among previously reported paramagnetic hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters in POMs and showed unique SMM properties. These clusters were synthesized by conjugating {FeMn4} oxo clusters with Mn and Ln cations as glues in a predictable way, indicating that the &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; would be a powerful tool to construct desired large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal clusters precisely and effectively.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells with 2D Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) carbides Ti3C2Clx Nano&#8208;MXene and o&#8208;TB&#8208;GDY NanoGDY are successfully employed to passivate the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. Due to significantly inhibited non&#8208;radiative recombination, enhanced energy band alignment, and improved charge&#8208;carrier extraction, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p devices obtain a high efficiency of 24.86&#8201;% with improved long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Passivating the interfaces between the perovskite and charge transport layers is crucial for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here we report a dual&#8208;interface engineering approach to improving the performance of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3&#8208;based PSCs by incorporating Ti3C2Clx Nano&#8208;MXene and o&#8208;TB&#8208;GDY nanographdiyne (NanoGDY) into the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and perovskite/ hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. The dual&#8208;interface passivation simultaneously suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and promotes carrier extraction by forming the Pb&#8722;Cl chemical bond and strong coordination of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation with undercoordinated Pb defects. The resulting perovskite film has an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;s and an enlarged crystal size exceeding 2.5&#8197;&#956;m. A maximum PCE of 24.86&#8201;% is realized, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.20&#8197;V. Unencapsulated cells retain 92&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1464&#8197;hours in ambient air and 80&#8201;% after 1002&#8197;hours of thermal stability test at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

Here we report a dual-interface engineering approach to improving the performance of FA&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(I&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based PSCs by incorporating Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; Nano-MXene and o-TB-GDY nanographdiyne (NanoGDY) into the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and perovskite/ hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. The dual-interface passivation simultaneously suppresses non-radiative recombination and promotes carrier extraction by forming the Pb&#8722;Cl chemical bond and strong coordination of &#960;-electron conjugation with undercoordinated Pb defects. The resulting perovskite film has an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;s and an enlarged crystal size exceeding 2.5&#8197;&#956;m. A maximum PCE of 24.86&#8201;% is realized, with an open-circuit voltage of 1.20&#8197;V. Unencapsulated cells retain 92&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1464&#8197;hours in ambient air and 80&#8201;% after 1002&#8197;hours of thermal stability test at 85&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a high&#8208;quality SnO2 layer with decreased adsorbed oxygen (Ochem) active sites and oxygen vacancies (Ovac) was fabricated on a flexible substrate by introducing TiCl4 into the SnO2 bulk layer. The first evidence of flexible perovskite cells working at low temperature was demonstrated, with efficiency as high as 23.7&#8201;% based on an improved SnO2 layer.







Abstract
Photovoltaic technology with low weight, high specific power in cold environments, and compatibility with flexible fabrication is highly desired for near&#8208;space vehicles and polar region applications. Herein, we demonstrate efficient low&#8208;temperature flexible perovskite solar cells by improving the interfacial contact between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer. We find that the adsorbed oxygen active sites and oxygen vacancies of flexible tin oxide (SnO2) ETL layer can be effectively decreased by incorporating a trace amount of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The effective defects elimination at the interfacial increases the electron mobility of flexible SnO2 layer, regulates band alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface, induces larger perovskite crystal growth, and improves charge collection efficiency in a complete solar cell. Correspondingly, the improved interfacial contact transforms into high&#8208;performance solar cells under one&#8208;sun illumination (AM 1.5G) with efficiencies up to 23.7&#8201;% at 218&#8197;K, which might open up a new era of application of this emerging flexible photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.

         <title>Bifunctional Near&#8208;Neutral Electrolyte Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed KBi/KF (KBi=potassium borate) electrolyte enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at near&#8208;neutral pH via: 1) stabilizing the interfacial pH by forming the BF2(OH)2&#8722; anion; and, 2) activating the interfacial water by F&#8208;containing species.







Abstract
Performance of electrocatalytic reactions depends on not only the composition and structure of the active sites, but also their local environment, including the surrounding electrolyte. In this work, we demonstrate that BF2(OH)2&#8722; anion is the key fluoroborate species formed in the mixed KBi/KF (KBi=potassium borate) electrolyte to enhance the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at near&#8208;neutral pH. Through a combination of electrokinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies, we show that the mixed KBi/KF electrolyte promotes the OER via two pathways: 1) stabilizing the interfacial pH during the proton&#8208;producing reaction with its high buffering capacity; and 2) activating the interfacial water via strong hydrogen bonds with F&#8208;containing species. With the KBi/KF electrolyte, electrodeposited Co(OH)2 is able to achieve 100&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.74&#8197;V, which is among the highest reported activities with earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts at near neutral conditions. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging electrolyte&#8208;engineering for improving the electrochemical performance of the OER.

         <title>Deciphering the Primary Role of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X Hydrogen Bonding in Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X (X=N or C) hydrogen bonding interactions play a directing role in gold catalysis. DFT calculations on the free energy profile of the experimentally studied multicomponent A3&#8208;coupling reaction and topological analysis of the intermediates and transition states provide direct evidences.







Abstract
Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X (X=N or C) hydrogen bonding is gaining increasing interest, both in the study of its intrinsic nature and in their operability in different fields. While the role of these interactions has been studied in the stabilization of gold(I) complexes, their role during the minimum free energy reaction pathway of a given catalytic process remains unexplored. We report herein that complex [Au(C&#8801;CPh)(pip)] (pip=piperidine) catalyses the A3&#8208;coupling reaction for the synthesis of propargylamines, thanks to the ability of Au(I) to promote weak hydrogen bonding interactions with the reactants along the free energy profile. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that these Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X interactions play a directing role in the catalysed A3&#8208;coupling. Topological non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), interaction region indicator (IRI) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis in real space of the electron density provide a description of these interactions accurately.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Biocatalysis by Unspecific Peroxygenases with Genetically Encoded Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have recently gained attraction as versatile oxyfunctionalization catalysts. One shortcoming, however, is their susceptibility towards the co&#8208;substrate hydrogen peroxide. As a solution, the concept of light&#8208;dependent UPO biocatalysis with genetically encoded flavin&#8208;containing photosensitizer proteins for in situ hydrogen peroxide production is introduced.







Abstract
Fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have gained substantial attention for their versatile oxyfunctionalization chemistry paired with impressive catalytic capabilities. A major drawback, however, remains their sensitivity towards their co&#8208;substrate hydrogen peroxide, necessitating the use of smart in situ hydrogen peroxide generation methods to enable efficient catalysis setups. Herein, we introduce flavin&#8208;containing protein photosensitizers as a new general tool for light&#8208;controlled in situ hydrogen peroxide production. By genetically fusing flavin binding fluorescent proteins and UPOs, we have created two virtually self&#8208;sufficient photo&#8208;enzymes (PhotUPO). Subsequent testing of a versatile substrate panel with the two divergent PhotUPOs revealed two stereoselective conversions. The catalytic performance of the fusion protein was optimized through enzyme and substrate loading variation, enabling up to 24300 turnover numbers (TONs) for the sulfoxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide. The PhotUPO concept was upscaled to a 100&#8197;mg substrate preparative scale, enabling the extraction of enantiomerically pure alcohol products.

         <title>A Screening Protocol for Exploring Loop Length Requirements for the Formation of a Three Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine+ Base&#8208;Paired i&#8208;Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interactive protocol for the identification of minimal sequence requirements for i&#8208;Motif (iM) folding was developed. It allowed the resolution by NMR of the simplest intra&#8208;molecular iM with an odd number of cytosine&#8208;cytosine+ (CC+) base pairs. The experimental design revealed the minimal number of nucleotides in the loops&#8211;2 and 3 in the minor and major groove, respectively&#8211;with a preference for the 5&#8242; localization of the outmost CC+ base pair.







Abstract
DNA sequences containing at least four runs of repetitive cytosines can fold into tetra&#8208;helical structures called i&#8208;Motifs (iMs). The interest in these DNA secondary structures is increasing due to their therapeutical and technological applications. Still, limited knowledge of their folding requirements is currently available. We developed a novel step&#8208;by&#8208;step pipeline for the systematic screening of putative iM&#8208;forming model sequences.

     alt="A Screening Protocol for Exploring Loop Length Requirements for the Formation of a Three Cytosine-Cytosine+ Base-Paired i-Motif"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interactive protocol for the identification of minimal sequence requirements for i-Motif (iM) folding was developed. It allowed the resolution by NMR of the simplest intra-molecular iM with an odd number of cytosine-cytosine&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (CC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) base pairs. The experimental design revealed the minimal number of nucleotides in the loops&#8211;2 and 3 in the minor and major groove, respectively&#8211;with a preference for the 5&#8242; localization of the outmost CC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; base pair.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA sequences containing at least four runs of repetitive cytosines can fold into tetra-helical structures called i-Motifs (iMs). The interest in these DNA secondary structures is increasing due to their therapeutical and technological applications. Still, limited knowledge of their folding requirements is currently available. We developed a novel step-by-step pipeline for the systematic screening of putative iM-forming model sequences. Focusing on structures comprising only three cytosine-cytosine&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; base pairs, we investigated what the minimal lengths of the loops required for formation of an intra-molecular iM are. Our data indicate that two and three nucleotides are required to connect the strands through the minor and majorgrooves of the iM, respectively. Additionally, they highlight an asymmetric behavior according to the distribution of the cytosines. Specifically, no sequence containing a single cytosine in the first and third run was able to fold into intra-molecular iMs with the same stability of those formed when the first and the third run comprise two cytosines. This knowledge represents a step forward toward the development of prediction tools for the proper identification of biologically functional iMs, as well as for the rational design of these secondary structures as technological devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanostructure Explains the Behavior of Slippery Covalently Attached Liquid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slippery covalently&#8208;attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) are highly slippery towards liquid droplets, but an understanding of the underpinning mechanism is lacking. This study establishes that a combination of layer uniformity and layer mobility determines optimal SCALS performance. These findings provide insights into SCALS synthesis and nanostructure, enabling rational design of these highly anti&#8208;adhesive surfaces.







Abstract
Slippery covalently&#8208;attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH, &lt;5&#176;) and nanoscale thickness display impressive anti&#8208;adhesive properties, similar to lubricant&#8208;infused surfaces. Their efficacy is generally attributed to the liquid&#8208;like mobility of the constituent tethered chains. However, the precise physico&#8208;chemical properties that facilitate this mobility are unknown, hindering rational design.
This work quantifies the chain length, grafting density, and microviscosity of a range of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) SCALS, elucidating the nanostructure responsible for their properties. Three prominent methods are used to produce SCALS, with characterization carried out via single&#8208;molecule force measurements, neutron reflectometry, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. CO2 snow&#8208;jet cleaning was also shown to reduce the CAH of SCALS via a modification of their grafting density. SCALS behavior can be predicted by reduced grafting density, &#931;, with the lowest water CAH achieved at &#931;&#8776;2. This study provides the first direct examination of SCALS grafting density, chain length, and microviscosity and supports the hypothesis that SCALS properties stem from a balance of layer uniformity and mobility.

         <title>Potential Controllable Redox Couple for Mild and Efficient Lithium Recovery from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from their tunable electron affinities and tailored potential, PAHs were used to extract active lithium from spent batteries without discharging. Furthermore, the reducing Li&#8208;PAHs solution can be used for direct regeneration of spent cathodes and pre&#8208;lithiation of anodes, which has great prospects in the sustainable development of the battery recycling industry.







Abstract
The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is dialectically accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries. It is an urgent priority to develop green and efficient battery recycling strategies for helping ease resources and environmental pressures at the current stage. Here, we propose a mild and efficient lithium extracting strategy based on potential controllable redox couples. Active lithium in the spent battery without discharging is extracted using a series of tailored aprotic solutions comprised of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers. This ensures a safe yet efficient recycling process with nearly &#8776;100&#8201;% lithium recovery. We further investigate the Li+&#8208;electron concerted redox reactions and the effect of solvation structure on kinetics during the extraction, and broaden the applicability of the Li&#8208;PAHs solution. This work can stimulate new inspiration for designing novel solutions to meet efficient and sustainable demands in recycling batteries.

         <title>Comprehensive Comparisons between Directing and Alternating Current Electrolysis in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to DC electrolysis, alternating current (AC) features polarity reversal and periodic variation, and will provide more chances and potentials for organic synthesis. This minireview delineates the unfolding landscape of recent progress in AC&#8208;driven organic transformations and endeavors to dissect disparities between DC and AC electrolytic patterns from their physical principles, reaction features and selectivity control.







Abstract
Organic electrosynthesis has consistently aroused significant interest within both academic and industrial spheres. Despite the considerable progress achieved in this field, the majority of electrochemical transformations have been conducted through the utilization of direct&#8208;current (DC) electricity. In contrast, the application of alternating current (AC), characterized by its polarity&#8208;alternating nature, remains in its infancy within the sphere of organic synthesis, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive theoretical framework. This minireview offers an overview of recent advancements in AC&#8208;driven organic transformations and seeks to elucidate the differences between DC and AC electrolytic methodologies by probing into their underlying physical principles. These differences encompass the ability of AC to preclude the deposition of metal catalysts, the precision in modulating oxidation and reduction intensities, and the mitigation of mass transfer processes.

         <title>Synchronous Switching of Dielectric Constant and Photoluminescence in Cyanidonitridorhenate&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular hybrid materials based on tetracyanidonitridorhenate(V) ions bearing diamine ligands exhibit a thermal phase transition related to a change from an ordered to a disordered state of the organic counter&#8208;ions. This leads to a thermal switching of the dielectric constant and the emission features connected with the photoluminescence of the Re(V) complexes.







Abstract
Switching of multiple physical properties by external stimuli in dynamic materials enables applications in, e.g., smart sensors, biomedical tools, as well as data&#8208;storage devices. Among stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, inorganic&#8208;organic molecular hybrids exhibiting thermal order&#8208;disorder phase transitions were tested as promising molecular switches of electrical characteristics, including dielectric constant. We aimed at broadening the multifunctional potential of such hybrid materials towards the switching of not only electrical but also other physical properties, e.g., light emission. We report two ionic salts based on luminescent tetracyanidonitridorhenate(V) anions bearing two different diamine ligands, 1,2&#8208;diaminoethane (1) and 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane (2), both crystallizing with polar N&#8208;methyl&#8208;dabconium cations. They exhibit an order&#8208;disorder phase transition related to the heating&#8208;induced turning&#8208;on of the rotation of polar cations. This leads to a unique synchronous switching of the dielectric constant as well as metal&#8208;complex&#8208;centered photoluminescence, as demonstrated by changes in, e.g., emission lifetime. The roles of organic cations, non&#8208;trivial Re(V) complexes, and their interaction in achieving the coupled thermal switching of electrical and optical properties are discussed utilizing experimental and theoretical approaches.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular hybrid materials based on tetracyanidonitridorhenate(V) ions bearing diamine ligands exhibit a thermal phase transition related to a change from an ordered to a disordered state of the organic counter-ions. This leads to a thermal switching of the dielectric constant and the emission features connected with the photoluminescence of the Re(V) complexes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching of multiple physical properties by external stimuli in dynamic materials enables applications in, e.g., smart sensors, biomedical tools, as well as data-storage devices. Among stimuli-responsive materials, inorganic-organic molecular hybrids exhibiting thermal order-disorder phase transitions were tested as promising molecular switches of electrical characteristics, including dielectric constant. We aimed at broadening the multifunctional potential of such hybrid materials towards the switching of not only electrical but also other physical properties, e.g., light emission. We report two ionic salts based on luminescent tetracyanidonitridorhenate(V) anions bearing two different diamine ligands, 1,2-diaminoethane (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and 1,3-diaminopropane (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), both crystallizing with polar &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-dabconium cations. They exhibit an order-disorder phase transition related to the heating-induced turning-on of the rotation of polar cations. This leads to a unique synchronous switching of the dielectric constant as well as metal-complex-centered photoluminescence, as demonstrated by changes in, e.g., emission lifetime. The roles of organic cations, non-trivial Re(V) complexes, and their interaction in achieving the coupled thermal switching of electrical and optical properties are discussed utilizing experimental and theoretical approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Activated Self&#8208;Immolation of Hydrogels via Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a hydrogel system that self&#8208;destroys after mechanical activation via the combination of a mechano&#8211;to&#8211;chemo signal translation and a chemical signal amplifier module to trigger many chain breaks following one single mechano event. Self&#8208;regulating soft robotic elements and mechano&#8208;induced debonding in adhesives can be realized.







Abstract
Cellular organisms possess intricate mechano&#8208;adaptive systems that enable them to sense forces and process them with (bio)chemical circuits for functional adaptation. Inspired by such processes, this study introduces a hydrogel system capable of mechanically activated and chemically transduced self&#8208;destruction. Our judiciously designed hydrogels can mechanically generate radicals that are processed and amplified in a self&#8208;propagating radical de&#8208;crosslinking reaction, ultimately leading to mechanically triggered self&#8208;immolation. We put such systems to work in mechano&#8208;induced debonding, and in a bilayer actuator, where swelling&#8208;induced bending generates sufficient force for selective degradation of one layer, leading to autonomous self&#8208;regulation associated with unbending. Our work helps define design criteria for molecularly controlled adaptive and self&#8208;regulating materials with embodied mechano&#8208;chemical information processing, and showcases their potential for adhesives and soft robotics.

         <title>A Supramolecular Naphthalene Diimide Radical Anion with Efficient NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion for E. coli&#8208;Responsive Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular naphthalene diimide radical anion with efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion is generated through E.&#8197;coli&#8208;induced in situ reduction. It exhibits unexpectedly strong absorption at 1104&#8197;nm and remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency. Therefore, excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal antimicrobial activity is demonstrated. This work opens a new avenue for constructing NIR&#8208;II dyes on the basis of limited &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures.







Abstract
We report a supramolecular naphthalene diimide (NDI) radical anion with efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion for E.&#8197;coli&#8208;responsive photothermal therapy. The supramolecular radical anion (NDI&#8208;2CB[7])&#8901;&#8722;, which is obtained from the E.&#8197;coli&#8208;induced in situ reduction of NDI&#8208;2CB[7] neutral complex, formed by the host&#8211;guest interaction between an NDI derivative and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), exhibits unexpectedly strong NIR&#8208;II absorption and remarkable photothermal conversion capacity in aqueous solution. The NIR&#8208;II absorption is caused by the self&#8208;assembly of NDI radical anions to form supramolecular dimer radicals in aqueous solution, which is supported by theoretically predicted spectra. The (NDI&#8208;2CB[7])&#8901;&#8722; demonstrates excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal antimicrobial activity (&gt;99&#8201;%). This work provides a new approach for constructing NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and non&#8208;contact treatments for bacterial infections.

         <title>Hybrid Vesicles Enable Mechano&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a strategy that enables the development of a mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogel capable of on&#8208;demand degradation. Phospholipid&#8208;block copolymer hybrid vesicles embedded in a hydrogel matrix can act as signal transducers, releasing encapsulated compounds that control the hydrogel network when an external compressive stress is applied. This generalizable approach holds promise for the creation of diverse functional hydrogels.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels are intriguing biomimetic materials. Previous efforts to develop mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels have mostly relied on chemical modifications of the hydrogel structures. Here, we present a simple, generalizable strategy that confers mechano&#8208;responsive behavior on hydrogels. Our approach involves embedding hybrid vesicles, composed of phospholipids and amphiphilic block copolymers, within the hydrogel matrix to act as signal transducers. Under mechanical stress, these vesicles undergo deformation and rupture, releasing encapsulated compounds that can control the hydrogel network. To demonstrate this concept, we embedded vesicles containing ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, into a calcium&#8208;crosslinked alginate hydrogel. When compressed, the released EGTA sequesters calcium ions and degrades the hydrogel. This study provides a novel method for engineering mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels that may be useful in various biomedical applications.

         <title>Regulating Relative Nitrogen Locations of Diazine Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relative nitrogen locations of diazine rings on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are finely tailored to maximize the photocatalytic performance for producing H2O2 with O2 and pure water. Benefiting from effective electron&#8208;hole separation, low charge transfer resistance, and reactive sites for the direct 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway, the pyridazine&#8208;based COF exhibits an excellent H2O2 production rate of 7327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising candidates for the overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the effects of the relative nitrogen locations remain obscured and photocatalytic performances of COFs need to be further improved. Herein, a collection of COFs functionalized by various diazines including pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine have been judiciously designed and synthesized for photogeneration of H2O2 without sacrificial agents. Compared with pyrimidine and pyrazine, pyridazine embedded in TpDz tends to stabilize endoperoxide intermediate species, leading toward the more efficient direct 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. Benefiting from the effective electron&#8208;hole separation, low charge transfer resistance, and high&#8208;efficiency ORR pathway, an excellent production rate of 7327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) value of 0.62&#8201;% has been achieved by TpDz, which ranks one of the best COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work might shed fresh light on the rational design of functional COFs targeting photocatalysts in H2O2 production.

         <title>2D Plasmonic Molecules via Hydrogen Bond Interaction between Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly symmetric 2D plasmonic molecules were assembled through hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (donor and acceptor). Polymer interaction and solvation were found to compete with each other during the colloidal self&#8208;assembly process, which can be used to precisely control the coordination number. The nanostructures rearrange themselves from 3D to 2D when being cast onto a substrate.







Abstract
The use of macromolecular design features to regulate non&#8208;covalent bonding on the nanoscale is a young and emerging fabrication strategy for advanced nanostructures. For the first time, we describe a self&#8208;assembly method to create a series of 2D plasmonic molecules (PMs) using hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor). Due to the nature of hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, we found that polymer interaction and solvation compete with each other during the self&#8208;assembly process, which turns out to be the most important condition for controlling the coordination number of PMs. We have conducted an extensive study on the solvent effect, which has helped us to design and fabricate a series of precise PMs with high symmetry.

         <title>Enhanced Active Sites and Stability in Nano&#8208;MOFs for Electrochemical Energy Storage through Dual Regulation by Tannic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilized the rich chemical properties of TA to achieve functionalization of nano&#8208;MOFs through acid&#8208;etching and further chelation strategies. The results indicated that the functionalization effect of TA on MOFs is both universal and targeted.







Abstract
The limited active sites and poor acid&#8208;alkaline solution stability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), significantly limit their wider application. In this study, the acid property of tannic acid (TA) was used as an etchant to etch the surface&#8208;active sites. Subsequently, the further chelation of the protonated TA with the exposed metal active site can effectively protect the metal ions. Meanwhile, the TA provided a large amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can greatly improve the stability of imidazolate&#8208;coordinated MOFs. The electrochemical test results indicated that the MOFs composite materials synthesized using this scheme had high specific capacitance and stability. And the mechanism of its electrochemical reaction process was explored through in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and theoretical calculations. In addition, the same treatment was carried out through a series of carboxyl&#8208;coordinated MOFs, which further confirmed the principle of this scheme to obtain a higher active site and stability. This paper explains the mechanism of functionalization of nano&#8208;MOFs by polyphenolic compounds, providing new ideas for the research of nano&#8208;MOFs.

         <title>Directing (110) Oriented Lithium Deposition through High&#8208;flux Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(110) orientated lithium (Li) deposition is achieved via high&#8208;flux solid electrolyte interphase. Bravais rule and Curie&#8208;Wulff principle clarify Li electrocrystallization process. Long&#8208;term Li deposition regulation ability is realized. Planar and dendrite&#8208;free (110) orientated Li enables Li||LiFePO4, Li||NCM811 cells in practical conditions dramatically improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Controlling lithium (Li) electrocrystallization with preferred orientation is a promising strategy to realize highly reversible Li metal batteries (LMBs) but lack of facile regulation methods. Herein, we report a high&#8208;flux solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) strategy to direct (110) preferred Li deposition even on (200)&#8208;orientated Li substrate. Bravais rule and Curie&#8208;Wulff principle are expanded in Li electrocrystallization process to decouple the relationship between SEI engineering and preferred crystal orientation. Multi&#8208;spectroscopic techniques combined with dynamics analysis reveal that the high&#8208;flux CF3Si(CH3)3 (F3) induced SEI (F3&#8208;SEI) with high LiF and &#8722;Si(CH3)3 contents can ingeniously accelerate Li+ transport dynamics and ensure the sufficient Li+ concentration below SEI to direct Li (110) orientation. The induced Li (110) can in turn further promote the surface migration of Li atoms to avoid tip aggregation, resulting in a planar, dendrite&#8208;free morphology of Li. As a result, our F3&#8208;SEI enables ultra&#8208;long stability of Li||Li symmetrical cells for more than 336&#8197;days. Furthermore, F3&#8208;SEI modified Li can significantly enhance the cycle life of Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM811 coin and pouch full cells in practical conditions. Our crystallographic strategy for Li dendrite suppression paves a path to achieve reliable LMBs and may provide guidance for the preferred orientation of other metal crystals.

         <title>Annulation&#8208;Induced Hidden Reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual hidden reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole backbone was unveiled that involves the elusive N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reaction. This reactivity allows access to a novel class of unsymmetrically substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines (dpa), which were used to prepare unsymmetrical boron aza&#8208;dipyridylmethene fluorescent dyes suitable for intracellular selective lipid droplet imaging studies.







Abstract
Triazoles are an important class of compounds with widespread applications. Functionalization of the triazole backbone is thus of significant interest. In comparison to 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, C&#8722;H activation&#8208;functionalization of the congeners 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is surprisingly underdeveloped. Indeed, no such C&#8722;H activation&#8208;functionalization has been reported for 4&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazole cores. Furthermore, although denitrogenative ring&#8208;opening of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles is well&#8208;explored, 1,2,4&#8208;triazole/triazolium substrates have not been known to exhibit N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reactivity so far. In this work, we unveiled an unusual hidden reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole backbone involving the elusive N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reaction. This new reactivity was induced by a Satoh&#8208;Miura&#8208;type C&#8722;H activation&#8208;annulation at the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole motif appended with a pyridine directing group. This unique reaction allowed ready access to a novel class of unsymmetrically substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines, with one pyridine ring fully&#8208;substituted with alkyl groups. The unsymmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines were utilized to access unsymmetrical boron&#8208;aza&#8208;dipyridylmethene fluorescent dyes. Empowered with desirable optical/physical properties such as large Stokes shifts and suitable hydrophobicity arising from optimal alkyl chain length at the fully&#8208;substituted pyridine&#8208;ring, these dyes were used for intracellular lipid droplet&#8208;selective imaging studies, which provided useful information toward designing suitable lipid droplet&#8208;selective imaging probes for biomedical applications.

This unique reaction allowed ready access to a novel class of unsymmetrically substituted 2,2&#8242;-dipyridylamines, with one pyridine ring fully-substituted with alkyl groups. The unsymmetrical 2,2&#8242;-dipyridylamines were utilized to access unsymmetrical boron-aza-dipyridylmethene fluorescent dyes. Empowered with desirable optical/physical properties such as large Stokes shifts and suitable hydrophobicity arising from optimal alkyl chain length at the fully-substituted pyridine-ring, these dyes were used for intracellular lipid droplet-selective imaging studies, which provided useful information toward designing suitable lipid droplet-selective imaging probes for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Narrowband Pure Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Ir(III) Complexes for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode (OLED) with External Quantum Efficiency Over 16&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
By linking the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene group to the diarylboron&#8208;substituted isoquinolinyl moiety, two Ir(III) complexes were successfully obtained to show narrowband pure near&#8208;infrared emissions peaking around 730&#8197;nm with high photoluminescence efficiencies. Moreover, they could show impressively high electroluminescent performance in solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode with external quantum efficiency up to 16.43&#8201;%.







Abstract
Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters have significant applications in medical and optoelectronic fields, but the development stays a great challenge due to the energy gap law. Here, we report two NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes which display emission peaks around 730&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum of only 43&#8197;nm. Therefore, pure NIR luminescence can be obtained without having a very long emission wavelength, thus alleviating the restriction of the energy gap law, and obtaining impressively high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 0.70. More importantly, the pure NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) fabricated by the solution&#8208;processed mothed shows outstanding device performance with the highest external quantum efficiency of 16.43&#8201;%, which sets a new record for solution&#8208;processed NIR&#8208;OLEDs based on different emitters. This work sheds light on the development of Ir(III) complexes with narrowband emissions as highly efficient pure NIR&#8208;emitters.

         <title>Efficient and Direct Functionalization of Allylic sp3 C&#8722;H Bonds with Concomitant CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct, efficient, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic functionalization of allylic C&#8722;H bonds integrated with CO2 reduction to syngas, over SiO2&#8208;supported single Ni atom&#8208;decorated CdS quantum dots (QDs), is reported for the first time. Such a protocol not only bypasses additional oxidant/reductant and pre&#8208;functionalization to afford a broad range of allylic C&#8722;C products with moderate to excellent yields, but also efficiently produces tunable syngas.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction integrated with C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming organic synthesis represents a substantially untapped opportunity to simultaneously tackle carbon neutrality and create an atom&#8208;/redox&#8208;economical chemical synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the first cooperative photoredox catalysis of efficient and tunable CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with direct alkylation/arylation of unactivated allylic sp3 C&#8722;H bonds for accessing allylic C&#8722;C products, over SiO2&#8208;supported single Ni atoms&#8208;decorated CdS quantum dots (QDs). Our protocol not only bypasses additional oxidant/reductant and pre&#8208;functionalization of organic substrates, affording a broad of allylic C&#8722;C products with moderate to excellent yields, but also produces syngas with tunable CO/H2 ratios (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8211;5&#8201;:&#8201;1). Such win&#8208;win coupling catalysis highlights the high atom&#8208;, step&#8208; and redox&#8208;economy, and good durability, illuminating the tantalizing possibility of a renewable sunlight&#8208;driven chemical feedstocks manufacturing industry.

         <title>Diaryl Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers Enhance Synergistic Catalysis in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diaryl dihydrophenazine&#8208;based porous organic polymers display extraordinary activities toward visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The enhanced activity and stability of the porous organic polymers over small molecular counterparts leads to a more than 30&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and enables catalyst recovery and reuse.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as a novel class of porous materials that are synthesized by the polymerization of various organic monomers with different geometries and topologies. The molecular tunability of organic building blocks allows the incorporation of functional units for photocatalytic organic transformations. Here, we report the synthesis of two POP&#8208;based photocatalysts via homopolymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized diaryl dihydrophenazine (DADHP) monomer (POP1) and copolymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized DADHP and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine monomers (POP2). The fluorescence lifetimes of DADHP units in the POPs significantly increased, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances over homogeneous controls. POP1 is highly effective in catalysing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8722;N bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon coordination with Ni2+ ions, POP2&#8208;Ni shows strong synergy between photocatalytic and Ni catalytic cycles due to the confinement effect within the POP framework, leading to high efficiency in energy, electron, and organic radical transfer. POP2&#8208;Ni displays excellent activity in catalysing C&#8722;P bond forming reactions between diarylphosphine oxides and aryl iodides. They increased the photocatalytic activities by more than 30&#8208;fold in C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These POP catalysts were readily recovered via centrifugal separation and reused in six catalytic cycles without loss of activities. Thus, photosensitizer&#8208;based POPs provide a promising platform for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <dc:description>
Integrating bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down supramolecular methods enables substantial increases in the luminescence dissymmetry factor and the photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
In the dynamic domain of chiroptical technologies, it is imperative to engineer emitters endowed with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. This research demonstrates an advancement by employing a combined top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up strategy for the simultaneous amplification of photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum). Square&#8208;planar Pt(II) complexes form helical assemblies, driven by torsional strain induced by bis(nonyl) chains. Integration of chiral anions leads these assemblies to prefer distinct helical sense. This arrangement activates the metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) transition that is CPL&#8208;active, with &#934; and |glum| observing an upswing contingent on the charge number and aryl substituents in chiral anions. Utilizing the soft&#8208;lithographic micromolding in capillaries technique, we could fabricate exquisitely&#8208;ordered, one&#8208;dimensional co&#8208;assemblies to achieve the metrics to &#934; of 0.32 and |glum| of 0.13. Finally, our spectroscopic research elucidates the underlying mechanism for the dual amplification, making a significant stride in the advancement of CPL&#8208;active emitters.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) microcavities featuring distinguishable sharp peaks in a broadband exhibit enormous advantages in the field of miniaturized photonic barcodes. However, such kind of barcodes developed hitherto are primarily based on microcavities wherein multiple gain medias were blended into a single matrix, thus resulting in the limited and indistinguishable coding elements. Here, a surface tension assisted heterogeneous assembly strategy is proposed to construct the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple spatial colors along its circular direction. Through precisely regulating the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strength, full&#8208;color microrings covering the entire visible range were effectively acquired, which exhibit a series of sharp and recognizable peaks and allow for the effective construction of high&#8208;quality photonic barcodes. Notably, the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple coding elements were finally acquired through heterogeneous nucleation and growth controlled by the directional diffusion between the hetero&#8208;emulsion droplets, thus remarkably promoting the security strength and coding capacity of the barcodes. The results would be useful to fabricate new types of organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.

         <title>The S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Is Critical for Substrate Selectivity and Can Be Targeted with Covalent Inhibitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;peptide screening for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro was performed to select suitable residues for the S1&#8242;&#8211;S4&#8242; sites of Mpro. The Ala&#8722;Ile&#8722;Phe (AIF) motif was chosen as the scaffold for discovering inhibitors that target the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket. Warhead screening and structure&#8211;activity relationship studies revealed a covalent inhibitor, D&#8208;4&#8211;77, with an &#945;&#8208;bromoacetamide warhead that exhibited potent inhibitory activity in vitro.







Abstract
The main protease (Mpro) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is a well&#8208;characterized target for antiviral drug discovery. To date, most antiviral drug discovery efforts have focused on the S4&#8211;S1&#8242; pocket of Mpro; however, it is still unclear whether the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket per se can serve as a new site for drug discovery. In this study, the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket of Mpro was found to differentially recognize viral peptidyl substrates. For instance, S3&#8242; in Mpro strongly favors Phe or Trp, and S1&#8242; favors Ala. The peptidyl inhibitor D&#8208;4&#8211;77, which possesses an &#945;&#8208;bromoacetamide warhead, was discovered to be a promising inhibitor of Mpro, with an IC50 of 0.95&#8197;&#956;M and an antiviral EC50 of 0.49&#8197;&#956;M. The Mpro/inhibitor co&#8208;crystal structure confirmed the binding mode of the inhibitor to the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket and revealed a covalent mechanism. In addition, D&#8208;4&#8211;77 functions as an immune protectant and suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro&#8208;induced antagonism of the host NF&#8208;&#954;B innate immune response. These findings indicate that the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro is druggable, and that inhibiting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro can simultaneously protect human innate immunity and inhibit virion assembly.

         <title>Enhanced Li+ Diffusion and Lattice oxygen Stability by the High Entropy Effect in Disordered&#8208;Rocksalts Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalt oxides (DRXs) are a promising new class of cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their natural abundance, low cost and great electrochemical performance. High entropy strategy in Mn&#8208;based DRXs appears to be an effective strategy for improving the rate capability, but it suffers from challenges including capacity degradation. The present paper reports a new group of high entropy DRXs (HE DRX) based on Ni2+&#8208;Nb5+ pair; the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of DRXs with an increasing transition metal (TM) species are systematically investigated. An explanation is proposed for how the crystal field stability energy determines that HE DRX could exist in single Rocksalt solid solution structures. We further reveal that the charge compensation mechanism in HE DRX is the result of various TM synergistic effect. More importantly, through various in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ techniques and theoretical calculation, the effective integration of more TM cation species within the HE DRX framework promotes better Li+ diffusion and improves lattice oxygen stability, consequently increasing capacity upon cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Polysulfide Solvation Structure with Electrode Kinetics towards Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising due to ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their cycling lifespan is crucially affected by the electrode kinetics of lithium polysulfides. Herein, the polysulfide solvation structure is correlated with polysulfide electrode kinetics towards long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries. The solvation structure derived from strong solvating power electrolyte induces fast anode kinetics and rapid anode failure, while that derived from weak solvating power electrolyte causes sluggish cathode kinetics and rapid capacity loss. By contrast, the solvation structure derived from medium solvating power electrolyte balances cathode and anode kinetics and improves the cycling performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. Li&#8211;S coin cells with ultra&#8208;thin Li anodes and high&#8208;S&#8208;loading cathodes deliver 146 cycles and a 338 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cell undergoes stable 30 cycles. This work clarifies the relationship between polysulfide solvation structure and electrode kinetics and inspires rational electrolyte design for long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Five&#8208;Component Radical Relay Aminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical relay five&#8208;component double aminocarbonylation reaction of alkenes is described for direct access to valuable &#947;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with good yields and selectivities. Crucial was the identification of distinct dual roles of the amine coupling partners, which sequentially act as electron donors for the formation of photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with radical precursors and then as a CO acceptor to form carbamoyl radicals.







Abstract
Radical single carbonylation reactions with CO constitute a direct and robust strategy toward various carbonyl compounds from readily available chemicals, and have been extensively studied over the past decades. However, realizing highly selective catalytic systems for controlled radical double carbonylation reactions has remained a substantial challenge, particularly for the more advanced multicomponent variants, despite their great potential value. Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical relay five&#8208;component radical double aminocarbonylation reaction of unactivated alkenes using CO under metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol provides direct access to valuable &#947;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with good yields and high chemoselectivity. Crucial was the identification of distinct dual roles of amine coupling partners, sequentially acting as electron donors for the formation of photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with radical precursors and then as a CO acceptor via nitrogen radical cations to form carbamoyl radicals. Cross&#8208;coupling of carbamoyl radicals with the acyl radicals that are formed in an alkene&#8208;based relay process affords double aminocarbonylation products.

         <dc:description>
An amplifier module (AMP) was introduced to boost the signal of the DNA&#8208;based three&#8208;input &#8220;AND&#8221; logic circuit. Three microRNAs abnormally expressed in cancer cells were used as inputs, and all DNA logic circuit and amplifier elements were encapsulated in a ZIF&#8208;8 nano&#8208;carrier, which was then camouflaged with cancer cell membranes for the accurate identification of specific tumor subtypes in vivo.







Abstract
DNA logic circuits (DLC) enable the accurate identification of specific cell types, such as cancer cells, but they face the challenges of weak output signals and a lack of competent platforms that can efficiently deliver DLC components to the target site in the living body. To address these issues, we rationally introduced a cascaded biological amplifier module based on the Primer Exchange Reaction inspired by electronic circuit amplifier devices. As a paradigm, three abnormally expressed Hela cell microRNAs (&#8208;30a, &#8208;17, and &#8208;21) were chosen as &#8220;AND&#8221; gate inputs. DLC response to these inputs was boosted by the amplifier markedly enhancing the output signal. More importantly, the encapsulation of DLC and amplifier components into ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles resulted in their efficient delivery to the target site, successfully distinguishing the Hela tumor subtype from other tumors in vivo. Thus, we envision that this strategy has great potential for clinical cancer diagnosis.

To address these issues, we rationally introduced a cascaded biological amplifier module based on the Primer Exchange Reaction inspired by electronic circuit amplifier devices. As a paradigm, three abnormally expressed Hela cell microRNAs (-30a, -17, and -21) were chosen as &#8220;AND&#8221; gate inputs. DLC response to these inputs was boosted by the amplifier markedly enhancing the output signal. More importantly, the encapsulation of DLC and amplifier components into ZIF-8 nanoparticles resulted in their efficient delivery to the target site, successfully distinguishing the Hela tumor subtype from other tumors in vivo.

         <title>Urea Functionalized Fe4L6 Cages for Supramolecular Gold Catalyst Encapsulation to Control Substrate Activation Modes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excellent catalytic performances of enzymes in terms of activity and selectivity are an inspiration for synthetic chemists and this has resulted in the development of synthetic containers for supramolecular catalysis. In such containers the local environment and pre&#8208;organization of catalysts and substrates leads to control of activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Herein we report a supramolecular strategy to encapsulate single catalysts in a urea functionalized Fe4L6 cage, which can co&#8208;encapsulate a functionalized urea&#8208;substrate via hydrogen bonding. Distinguished selectivity is obtained imposed by the cage as site isolation is only allowing catalysis via &#960; activation of the substrate and as a result the selectivity is independent of catalyst concentration. The encapsulated catalyst is more active than the free analogue, an effect that can be ascribed to transition state stabilization rather than substrate pre&#8208;organization, as revealed by the MM kinetic data. The simple strategy reported here is expected to be of general use in many reactions for which the catalyst can be functionalized with a sulfonate group required for encapsulation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multidimensional Approach to Modulating Ionizable Lipids for High&#8208;Performing and Organ&#8208;Selective mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has enabled a successful clinical application of mRNA vaccines. However, disclosure of design principles for the core component&#8722;ionizable lipids (ILs), improving the delivery efficacy and organ targeting of LNPs, remains a formidable challenge. Here, we reported a powerful strategy to modulate ILs in one&#8208;step chemistry using the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) under mild conditions. A large IL library of new structures was established simply and efficiently through a multidimensional approach, allowing us to identify the top&#8208;performing ILs in delivering mRNA via the formulated LNPs. Adjusting the skeleton of ILs has transformed the organ&#8208;specific and robust transfection in mRNA delivery from the liver to the spleen following different administration routes. Of note, a series of isomeric ILs were prepared and we found that the isomers mattered greatly in the performance of LNPs for mRNA delivery. Furthermore, owing to the bis&#8208;amide bonds formed in the Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction, the ILs within LNPs may form hydrogen bonding intermolecularly, facilitating the colloidal stabilization of LNPs. This work provides clues to the rapid discovery and rational design of IL candidates, assisting the application of mRNA therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel PyBox catalysts promote nucleophilic cyclopropanation reactions using CH2Cl2 as a methylene source and Mn as a stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope includes a broad range of alkenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, including esters, amides, ketones, nitriles, sulfones, phosphonate esters, trifluoromethyl groups, and electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Enantioselective cyclopropanations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters have been developed using chiral PyBox ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a (PyBox)Ni=CH2 species, which adds to the alkene by a stepwise [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8211;C reductive elimination mechanism. DFT models provide a rationale for the nucleophilic character of the nickel carbene and the sense of enantioinduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Low&#8208;Valence Single Atoms by Constructing Metalloid Tungsten Carbide Supports for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing novel single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supports to modulate the electronic structure is crucial to optimize the catalytic activity, but rather challenging. Herein, a general strategy is proposed to utilize the metalloid properties of supports to trap and stabilize single&#8208;atoms with low&#8208;valence states. A series of single&#8208;atoms supported on the surface of tungsten carbide (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a facile pyrolysis method. Benefiting from the metalloid properties of WCx, the single&#8208;atoms exhibit weak coordination with surface W and C atoms, resulting in the formation of low&#8208;valence active centers similar to metals. The unique metal&#8208;metal interaction effectively stabilizes the low&#8208;valence single atoms on the WCx surface and improves the electronic orbital energy level distribution of the active sites. As expected, the representative Ru&#8208;WCx exhibits superior mass activities of 7.84 and 62.52 A mgRu&#8208;1 for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER), respectively. In&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis demonstrates that an ideal dual&#8208;sites cooperative mechanism achieves a suitable adsorption balance of Had and OHad, resulting in an energetically favorable Vollmer step. This work offers new guidance for the precise construction of highly active SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;encapsulating Cofactor and Enzymes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Multienzyme Cascade Reactions with Cofactor Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Use of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for enzyme immobilization faces challenges in improving enzyme activity recovery and assembling cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme systems. Herein, we report a polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach (PAEA) that enables two cascades with four oxidoreductases and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) cofactors co&#8208;encapsulated in BioHOF&#8208;1 with excellent cargo loading and over 100%&#160;cascade activities. The key role of the polyelectrolyte is to coat enzymes and tether NAD(P)H, thus interacting with HOF monomers in place of enzymes, avoiding enzymes from destruction by HOF monomers. The versatility&#160;and efficiency of PAEA are further illustrated by an HOF&#8208;101&#8208;based bio&#8208;nanoreactor. Moreover, the immobilization by PAEA makes enzymes and NAD(P)H display excellent stability and recyclability. This work has demonstrated a facile and versatile PAEA for fabricating cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade nanoreactors with HOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Absolute CO2/Xe Separation in Ultramicropore&#160;MOF for Anesthetic Gases Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xe is an ideal anesthetic gas, but it has not been widely used in practice due to its high cost and low output. Closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling is an economically viable method to ensure adequate supply in medical use. Herein, we design an innovative way to recover Xe by using a stable fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni to eliminate CO2 from moist exhaled anesthetic gases. Unlike other Xe recovery MOFs with low Xe/CO2 selectivity (less than 10), NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve absolute molecular sieve separation of CO2/Xe with excellent CO2 selectivity (825). Mixed&#8208;gas breakthrough experiments assert the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni as a molecular sieve adsorbent for the effective and energy&#8208;efficient removal of carbon dioxide with 99.16% Xe recovery. Absolute CO2/Xe separation in NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni makes closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling can be easily realized, demonstrating the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni for important anesthetic gas regeneration under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteomics&#8208;Based Discovery of First&#8208;in&#8208;Class Chemical Probes for Programmed Cell Death Protein 2 (PDCD2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical probes are essential tools for understanding biological systems and for credentialing potential biomedical targets. Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2) is a member of the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl&#8208;2) family of proteins, which are critical regulators of apoptosis. Here we report the discovery and characterization of 10e, a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule degrader of PDCD2. We discovered PDCD2 degrader by serendipity using a chemical proteomics approach in contrast to the conventional approach for making bivalent degraders starting from a known binding ligand targeting the protein of interest. Using 10e as a pharmacological probe, we demonstrate that PDCD2 functions as a critical regulator of cell growth by modulating the progression of the cell cycle in T lymphoblasts. Our work provides a useful pharmacological probe for investigating PDCD2 function and highlights using chemical proteomics to discover selective small molecule degraders of unanticipated targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Four &#8211; Electron Oxidative Addition of an N=N Double Bond at a Chromium Metallocyclopropene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral chromium alkyne complex supported by a bidentate phosphinimide ligand and its reactivity with azobenzene. Characterization of the former by structural and computational methods reveals an unprecedented extent of alkyne activation by a formal chromium(II) center, suggesting that this complex is best described as a chromium(IV)&#8208;metallocyclopropene. Exposure of this compound to an azobenzene derivative results in the formation of a chromium(VI) diimido complex, which constitutes a rare 4&#8208;electron oxidative addition of an N=N double bond. The isolation of a chromium(IV)&#8208;hydrazido intermediate enabled mechanistic investigations of this challenging bond cleavage process. This work substantiates the notion that terminal phosphinimide ligands can engender first&#8208;row transition metal ions with exceptional reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Transfer&#8208;Based High&#8208;Capacity Organic Lithium&#8208;Iodine (Chlorine) Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion&#8208;type batteries apply the principle that more charge transfer is preferable. The underutilized electron transfer mode within two undermines the electrochemical performance of halogen batteries. Here, we realised a three&#8208;electron transfer lithium&#8211;halogen battery based on I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0 couples by using a common commercial electrolyte saturated with Cl&#8722; anions. The resulting Li||tetrabutylammonium triiodide (TBAI3) cell exhibits three distinct discharging plateaus at 2.97, 3.40, and 3.85 V. Moreover, it has a high capacity of 631 mAh g&#8722;1I (265 mAh g&#8722;1electrode, based on entire mass loading) and record&#8208;high energy density of up to 2013 Wh kg&#8722;1I (845 Wh kg&#8722;1electrode). To support these findings, experimental characterisations and density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the redox chemistry involved in this novel interhalogen strategy. We believe our paradigm presented here has a foreseeable inspiring effect on other halogen batteries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pursuit.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Formal [1,3]&#8208;Aryl Shift within Molecular Bows</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, we present a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach to facilitate  the  consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows (MBs) that integrate 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties. By introducing ring strain into MB through tethering the bow&#8208;limb, we can harness the intrinsic mechanical forces to drive multistep aryl shifts from para&#8208; to meta&#8208; to ortho&#8208;position.Through exercise of precise intramolecular strain, the seemingly impractical [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift was realized, resulting in the formation of ortho&#8208;disubstituted products. The solvent and temperature play a crucial role in the occurrence of the [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift.The free energy calculations with inclusion of solvation support a feasible mechanism, which entails multistep carbocation rearrangements, for the formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift. By exploring the application of molecular strain in synthetic chemistry, this research offers a promising direction for developing new tools and strategies towards precision organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of electrocatalysts is essential to achieve desirable performance of electrochemical synthesis process. Heterostructured catalysts have thus attracted widespread attention due to their multifunctional intrinsic properties, and diverse catalytic applications with corresponding outstanding activities. Here, we report an in&#8208;situ restoration strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Such Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets exhibit excellent activity and selectivity towards reversible electrochemical reforming of ethylamine and acetonitrile. In the acetonitrile reduction process, Pd acts as reaction center, while Ni(OH)2 provide proton hydrogen through promoting the dissociation of water. Also ethylamine oxidation process can be achieved on the surface of the heterostructured nanosheets with abundant Ni(II) defects. More importantly, an electrolytic cell driven by solar cells was successfully constructed to realize ethylamine&#8208;acetonitrile reversible reforming. This work demonstrates the importance of heterostructure engineering in the rational synthesis of multifunctional catalysts towards electrochemical synthesis of fine chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Germanium(II) Halide with Strong Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral germanium halide is synthesized, which exhibits strong nonlinear chiroptical property. The second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism of the chiral germanium halide can reach 0.48, which is the highest value among lead&#8208;free chiral metal halides. Moreover, a large effective second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of 0.86&#8197;pm/V and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 38.46&#8197;GW/cm2 are also obtained.







Abstract
Due to the pronounced anisotropic response to circularly polarized light, chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have been regarded as promising candidates for the application in nonlinear chiroptics, especially for the second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) effect. However, designing novel lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides with large anisotropy factors and high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT) of SHG&#8208;CD remains challenging. Herein, we develop the first chiral hybrid germanium halide, (R/S&#8208;NEA)3Ge2I7&#8901;H2O (R/S&#8208;NGI), and systematically investigated its linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. S&#8208;NGI and R&#8208;NGI exhibit large anisotropy factors (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.45 and 0.48, respectively, along with a high LDT of 38.46&#8197;GW/cm2; these anisotropy factors were the highest values among the reported lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides.

     alt="Chiral Hybrid Germanium(II) Halide with Strong Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chiral germanium halide is synthesized, which exhibits strong nonlinear chiroptical property. The second-harmonic generation circular dichroism of the chiral germanium halide can reach 0.48, which is the highest value among lead-free chiral metal halides. Moreover, a large effective second-order nonlinear optical coefficient of 0.86&#8197;pm/V and a high laser-induced damage threshold of 38.46&#8197;GW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are also obtained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the pronounced anisotropic response to circularly polarized light, chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have been regarded as promising candidates for the application in nonlinear chiroptics, especially for the second-harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG-CD) effect. However, designing novel lead-free chiral hybrid metal halides with large anisotropy factors and high laser-induced damage thresholds (LDT) of SHG-CD remains challenging. Herein, we develop the first chiral hybrid germanium halide, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-NEA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-NGI), and systematically investigated its linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-NGI and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-NGI exhibit large anisotropy factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SHG-CD&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.45 and 0.48, respectively, along with a high LDT of 38.46&#8197;GW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; these anisotropy factors were the highest values among the reported lead-free chiral hybrid metal halides. Moreover, the effective second-order nonlinear optical coefficient of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-NGI could reach up to 0.86&#8197;pm/V, which was 2.9 times higher than that of commercial Y-cut quartz. Our findings facilitate a new avenue toward lead-free chiral hybrid metal halides, and their implementation in nonlinear chiroptical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Free D&#246;tz&#8208;Type Aminobenzannulation Reaction via 1,1&#8208;Dipoles Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal free D&#246;tz&#8208;type Aminobenzannulation reaction via 1,1&#8208;dipoles cross&#8208;coupling is achieved. 100 examples including anilines, fused aryl amines and fused heteroaryl amines were synthesized through this versatile and practical strategy with broad substrate scope. Experimental and computational evidence confirms the key intermediate ketenimine, elucidates the reaction mechanism, and demonstrates the chemoselectivity in this approach.







Abstract
Aryl amines are of constant interest in organic synthesis owing to their ubiquity in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials. However, C&#8722;H amination or pre&#8208;functionalization frequently results in uncontrollable site selectivity, over activation and the generation of inseparable mixtures of regio&#8208;isomers. Here we present a novel metal free D&#246;tz&#8208;type aminobenzannulation reaction that circumvents the selectivity issues inherent in aromatic chemistry, as well as the use of stoichiometric unstable organolithium reagents and toxic chromium complexes. The concept of utilizing readily available isocyanides and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) carbonates to achieve 1,1&#8208;dipoles cross&#8208;coupling to construct ketenimine is the key to success, which has been experimentally and computationally verified. The tandem 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/aromatization process offers a versatile method for synthesizing functionalized anilines, fused aryl amines and fused heteroaryl amines.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Effect in a Covalent&#8211;Organic Framework with Imidazole Groups Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent effect plays an important role in catalytic reaction, but there is little research and attention on it in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, we report a stable covalent&#8208;organic framework (denoted as PcNi&#8208;im) with imidazole groups as a new electrocatalyst for eCO2RR to CO. Interestingly, compared with neutral conditions, PcNi&#8208;im not only showed high Faraday efficiency of CO product (~100%) under acidic conditions (pH &#8776; 1), but also the partial current density was increased from 258 to 320 mA cm&#8211;2. No obvious degradation was observed over 10 hours of continuous operation at the current density of 250 mA cm&#8722;2. The mechanism study shows that the imidazole group on the framework can be protonated to form an imidazole cation in acidic media, hence reducing the surface work function and charge density of the active metal center. As a result, CO poisoning effect is weakened and the key intermediate *COOH is also stabilized, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity Control in the Direct CO Esterification over Pd@UiO&#8208;66: The Pd Location Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selectivity control of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite toward dimethyl oxalate (DMO) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC) remains a grand challenge. Herein, Pd NPs are incorporated into isoreticular metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = &#8208;H, &#8208;NO2, &#8208;NH2), affording Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X, which unexpectedly exhibit high selectivity (up to 99%) to DMC and regulated activity in the direct CO esterification. In sharp contrast, the Pd NPs supported on the MOF, yielding Pd/UiO&#8208;66, displays high selectivity (89%) to DMO as always reported with Pd NPs. Both experimental and DFT calculation results prove that the Pd location relative to UiO&#8208;66 gives rise to discriminated microenvironment of different amounts of interface between Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and Pd NPs in Pd@UiO&#8208;66 and Pd/UiO&#8208;66, resulting in their distinctly different selectivity. This is an unprecedented finding on the production of DMC by Pd NPs, which was previously achieved by Pd(II) only, in the direct CO esterification.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Hydrophobicity&#8208;Induced Electro&#8208;Kinetic Retardation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electro&#8208;kinetic retardation strategy was developed to promote CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon products. Slow reaction kinetics induced by the strong hydrophobicity of the ionomer prolongs the *CO intermediate residence on Cu surfaces, increasing the probability of C&#8722;C coupling. As a result, a multi&#8208;carbon product Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;90&#8201;% was achieved at a partial current density of 223&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Advancing the performance of the Cu&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is crucial for its practical applications. Still, the wettable pristine Cu surface often suffers from low exposure to CO2, reducing the Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and current densities for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. Recent studies have proposed that increasing surface availability for CO2 by cation&#8208;exchange ionomers can enhance the C2+ product formation rates. However, due to the rapid formation and consumption of *CO, such promotion in reaction kinetics can shorten the residence of *CO whose adsorption determines C2+ selectivity, and thus the resulting C2+ FEs remain low. Herein, we discover that the electro&#8208;kinetic retardation caused by the strong hydrophobicity of quaternary ammonium group&#8208;functionalized polynorbornene ionomers can greatly prolong the *CO residence on Cu. This unconventional electro&#8208;kinetic effect is demonstrated by the increased Tafel slopes and the decreased sensitivity of *CO coverage change to potentials. As a result, the strongly hydrophobic Cu electrodes exhibit C2+ Faradaic efficiencies of &#8776;90&#8201;% at a partial current density of 223&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, more than twice of bare or hydrophilic Cu surfaces.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Polyanionic Electrolytes for Highly Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in situ formation of the high&#8208;performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8722;COO&#8722;, the affinity of Zn2+ ions to alginate acid induces a well&#8208;aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. The SEI also regulates the desolvation structure of Zn2+ and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) lattice planes.







Abstract
For zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), the non&#8208;uniform Zn plating/stripping results in a high polarization and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), hindering the large&#8208;scale application of ZIBs. Here, inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in situ formation of the high&#8208;performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8722;COO&#8722;, the affinity of Zn2+ ions to alginate acid induces a well&#8208;aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. This SEI regulates the desolvation structure of Zn2+ and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) crystal planes. Even under high depth of discharge conditions (DOD), the SA&#8208;coated Zn anode still maintains a stable Zn stripping/plating behavior with a low potential difference (0.114&#8197;V). According to the classical nucleation theory, the nucleation energy for SA&#8208;coated Zn is 97&#8201;% less than that of bare Zn, resulting in a faster nucleation rate.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in situ formation of the high-performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8722;COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the affinity of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to alginate acid induces a well-aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. The SEI also regulates the desolvation structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) lattice planes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), the non-uniform Zn plating/stripping results in a high polarization and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), hindering the large-scale application of ZIBs. Here, inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in situ formation of the high-performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8722;COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the affinity of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to alginate acid induces a well-aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. This SEI regulates the desolvation structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) crystal planes. Even under high depth of discharge conditions (DOD), the SA-coated Zn anode still maintains a stable Zn stripping/plating behavior with a low potential difference (0.114&#8197;V). According to the classical nucleation theory, the nucleation energy for SA-coated Zn is 97&#8201;% less than that of bare Zn, resulting in a faster nucleation rate. The Zn||Cu cell assembled with the SA-coated electrode exhibits an outstanding average CE of 99.8&#8201;% over 1,400 cycles. The design is successfully demonstrated in pouch cells, where the SA-coated Zn exhibits capacity retention of 96.9&#8201;% compared to 59.1&#8201;% for bare Zn anode, even under the high cathode mass loading (&amp;gt;10&#8197;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Metals in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) facilitates exceptional gas&#8208;phase catalytic activity, stabilization of solution&#8208;inaccessible catalysts, and fundamental insight into pertinent reaction mechanisms. MOFs present an ideal porous, crystalline, and chemically mutable matrix for such species. Herein we examine synthesis techniques and applications for the matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide uniquely tunable, periodic platforms for site&#8208;isolation of reactive low&#8208;valent metal complexes of relevance in modern catalysis, adsorptive applications, and fundamental structural studies. Strategies for integrating such species in MOFs include post&#8208;synthetic metalation, encapsulation and direct synthesis using low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes as building blocks. These approaches have each proven effective in enhancing catalytic activity, modulating product distributions (i.e., by improving catalytic selectivity), and providing valuable mechanistic insights. In this minireview, we explore these different strategies, as applied to isolate low&#8208;valent species within MOFs, with a particular focus on examples that leverage the unique crystallinity, permanent porosity and chemical mutability of MOFs to achieve deep structural insights that lead to new paradigms in the field of hybrid catalysis.

         <title>Hollow STW&#8208;Type Zeolite Single Crystals with Aluminum Gradient for Highly Selective Production of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol&#8208;Toluene Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical hollow single crystal STW&#8208;type zeolite is directly prepared in an alkalinous fluoride medium and exhibits excellent catalytic performance in toluene methylation reactions to p&#8208;xylene.







Abstract
Zeolites with uniform micropores are important shape&#8208;selective catalysts. However, the external acid sites of zeolites have a negative impact on shape&#8208;selective catalysis, and the microporosity may lead to serious diffusion limitation. Herein, we report on the direct synthesis of hierarchical hollow STW&#8208;type zeolite single crystals with a siliceous exterior. In an alkalinous fluoride medium, the nucleation of highly siliceous STW zeolites takes place first, and the nanocrystals are preferentially aligned on the outer surface of the gel agglomerates to grow into single crystalline shells upon crystallization. The lagged crystallization of the internal Al&#8208;rich amorphous gels onto the inner surface of nanocrystalline zeolite shells leads to the formation of hollow cavities in the core of the zeolite crystals. The hollow zeolite single crystals possess a low&#8208;to&#8208;high aluminum gradient from the surface to the core, resulting in an intrinsic inert external surface, and exhibit superior catalytic performance in toluene methylation reactions.

         <title>Bismuth in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Access to a Bowl&#8208;Type Macrocycle and a Barrel&#8208;Type Heptanuclear Complex Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi&#8722;C bonds in a dinuclear organometallic bismuth(III) compound with a thioxanthene linker are highly susceptible to transformations in the realm of dynamic covalent chemistry. Control of the reactions is obtained through template strategies, solvent effects, and the utilization of catalysts. This grants access to novel macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type compounds, including a well&#8208;defined heptanuclear cationic complex.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) is a powerful and widely applied tool in modern synthetic chemistry, which is based on the reversible cleavage and formation of covalent bonds. One of the inherent strengths of this approach is the perspective to reversibly generate in an operationally simple approach novel structural motifs that are difficult or impossible to access with more traditional methods and require multiple bond cleaving and bond forming steps. To date, these fundamentally important synthetic and conceptual challenges in the context of DCvC have predominantly been tackled by exploiting compounds of lighter p&#8208;block elements, even though heavier p&#8208;block elements show low bond dissociation energies and appear to be ideally suited for this approach. Here we show that a dinuclear organometallic bismuth compound, containing BiMe2 groups that are connected by a thioxanthene linker, readily undergoes selective and reversible cleavage of its Bi&#8722;C bonds upon exposure to external stimuli. The exploitation of DCvC in the field of organometallic heavy p&#8208;block chemistry grants access to unprecedented macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type oligonuclear compounds.

         <title>Photoactivatable Carbo&#8208; and Silicon&#8208;Rhodamines and Their Application in MINFLUX Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical nanoscopy of cells expressing Vimentin&#8208;HaloTag fusion proteins and labeled with photoactivatable fluorescent dyes is demonstrated in 2D and 3D modes on a commercial MINFLUX (minimal fluxes) setup. The dye synthesis and properties, photoactivation rates, labeling procedures, detection efficiencies, and other parameters related to the practical use of the probes are reported and discussed.







Abstract
New photoactivatable fluorescent dyes (rhodamine, carbo&#8208; and silicon&#8208;rhodamines [SiR]) with emission ranging from green to far red have been prepared, and their photophysical properties studied. The photocleavable 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl unit with an alpha&#8208;carboxyl group as a branching point and additional functionality was attached to a polycyclic and lipophilic fluorescent dye. The photoactivatable probes having the HaloTagTM amine (O2) ligand bound with a dye core were obtained and applied for live&#8208;cell staining in stable cell lines incorporating Vimentin (VIM) or Nuclear Pore Complex Protein NUP96 fused with the HaloTag. The probes were applied in 2D (VIM, NUP96) and 3D (VIM) MINFLUX nanoscopy, as well as in superresolution fluorescence microscopy with single fluorophore activation (VIM, live&#8208;cell labeling). Images of VIM and NUPs labeled with different dyes were acquired and their apparent dimensions and shapes assessed on a lower single&#8208;digit nanometer scale. Applicability and performance of the photoactivatable dye derivatives were evaluated in terms of photoactivation rate, labeling and detection efficiency, number of detected photons per molecule and other parameters related to MINFLUX nanoscopy.

The probes were applied in 2D (VIM, NUP96) and 3D (VIM) MINFLUX nanoscopy, as well as in superresolution fluorescence microscopy with single fluorophore activation (VIM, live-cell labeling). Images of VIM and NUPs labeled with different dyes were acquired and their apparent dimensions and shapes assessed on a lower single-digit nanometer scale. Applicability and performance of the photoactivatable dye derivatives were evaluated in terms of photoactivation rate, labeling and detection efficiency, number of detected photons per molecule and other parameters related to MINFLUX nanoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zwitterionic Polymeric Sulfur Ylides with Minimal Charge Separation Open a New Generation of Antifouling and Bactericidal Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stronger together: Unlike most zwitterionic materials, including polybetaines, sulfur ylides exhibit minimal charge separation. We show that poly(sulfur ylides) effectively inhibit the adhesion of biomolecules and pathogenic bacteria. Notably, we show that polymeric sulfur ylides create a toxic environment for bacterial cells that surpass the initial hydration barrier while remaining non&#8208;toxic to mammalian cells.







Abstract
Zwitterionic polymers are widely employed hydrophilic building blocks for antifouling coatings with numerous applications across a wide range of fields, including but not limited to biomedical science, drug delivery and nanotechnology. Zwitterionic polymers are considered as an attractive alternative to polyethylene glycol because of their biocompatibility and effectiveness to prevent&#160;formation of biofilms. To this end, zwitterionic polymers are classified in two categories, namely polybetaines and polyampholytes. Yet, despite a fundamental interest to drive the development of new antifouling materials, the chemical composition of zwitterionic polymer remains severely limited. Here, we show that poly(sulfur ylides) that&#160;belong&#160;to the largely overlooked class of poly(ylides),&#160;effectively prevent the&#160;formation of biofilms from pathogenic bacteria. While surface energy analysis reveals strong hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor capabilities of poly(sulfur ylide), membrane damage of pathogenic bacteria induced by poly(sulfur ylides) indicates toxicity towards bacteria while not affecting eucaryotic cells. Such synergistic effect of poly(sulfur ylides) offers distinct advantages over polyethylene glycol when designing new antifouling materials. We expect that our findings will pave the way for the development of a range of ylide&#8208;based materials with antifouling properties that have yet to be explored, opening up new directions at the interface of chemistry, biology, and material science.

         <title>Back Cover: Promoter&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Cyclic Mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic oligosaccharides such as cyclodextrins are extensively employed as carriers for drug delivery owing to their remarkable host properties and excellent biocompatibility. In their Research Article (e202307851), You Yang et&#8197;al. present a promoted&#8208;controlled cycloglycosylation approach for the synthesis of a series of cyclic mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer. The cyclic mannosides of various sizes were demonstrated by NMR and computational studies to adopt different conformational states and shapes.

         <title>Inside Cover: Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ active repair and detection of hydrogen via ammonium persulfate (APS) and rotational Raman spectroscopy facilitates the responsible use of non&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes. The bridged heterodinuclear photocatalyst RuPtI2 used in photocatalytic hydrogen production can now be repaired via the simple addition of ammonium persulfate, as reported by Sven Rau, Boris Mizaikoff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202306287). Along with the innovative in situ detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy the applicability of active repair mechanisms for a wide range of reductive catalysts is demonstrated.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs), which transport small molecules, proteins, and nucleotides within a lipid bilayer, serve as communication facilitators. Toshiyuki Wakimoto et&#8197;al. revealed in their Research Article (e202307304) that MVs&#8208;mediated interbacterial communication triggers silent secondary metabolite production in various bacteria. Particularly striking is the competitive interaction between Burkholderia multivorans and Xenorhabdus innexi, involving the exchange of their respective MVs and the MVs&#8208;induced&#160;secondary metabolites.

         <title>Cover Picture: Fast and Non&#8208;equilibrium Uptake of Hydrogen by Pd Icosahedral Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium icosahedral nanocrystals, a type of multiply&#8208;twinned nanocrystals, are found to enable facile and fast hydrogen absorption. In their Research Article (e202306906), Manos Mavrikakis, Younan Xia et&#8197;al. demonstrate that, upon absorbing hydrogen, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide the particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of high&#8208;energy phase boundaries is no longer favored. Meanwhile, the presence of tensile strain accelerates the kinetics of hydrogen absorption due to the increase in lattice spacing. Notably, the as&#8208;obtained PdHx nanocrystals with controllable compositions also show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward formic acid oxidation, which can also be attributed to the tensile strain.

         <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing and Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated State Induced by Space Intramolecular Charge Transfer in a Parallel Geometry Carbazole&#8208;Bodipy Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) based on through bond charge transfer (TBCT) features is a formidable challenge due to the criteria of orthogonal donor&#8208;acceptor geometry. Herein, we propose using parallel (face&#8208;to&#8208;face) conformation carbazole&#8208;bodipy donor&#8208;acceptor dyads (BCZ&#8208;1 and BCZ&#8208;2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916; = 61%) and long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (&#964;T = 186 &#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyads compared to BCZ&#8208;3 (&#934;&#916; = 0.4%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor&#8208;acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ&#8208;1 (&#964;CSS = 24 ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Unstrained Heterocycles Using Cobalt Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt catalysts promote highly enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans using vinylidenes. The products are acyclic organozinc compounds that can be functionalized with an electrophile. The proposed mechanism involves the generation of a cobalt vinylidene species that adds to the alkene by a [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition pathway. Ring&#8208;opening then occurs via outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by coordination of a ZnX2 Lewis acid to the alkoxide leaving group. DFT models reveal that competing inner&#8208;sphere syn &#946;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;O elimination pathways are suppressed by the geometric constraints of the metallacycle intermediate. These models rationalize the observed stereochemical outcome of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Multiple Phosphorescence from Functionalized Corannulenes: Temperature Sensing and Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Corannulene&#8208;derived materials have been extensively explored in energy storage and solar cells, but, however, are rarely documented as emitters in light&#8208;emitting sensors and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), due to low exciton utilization. Here, we report a family of multi&#8208;donor and acceptor (multi&#8208;D&#8208;A) motifs, TCzPhCor, TDMACPhCor, and TPXZPhCor, using corannulene as the acceptor and carbazole (Cz), 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;dimethylacridine (DMAC), and phenoxazine (PXZ) as the donor, respectively. By decorating corannulene with different donors, multiple phosphorescence is realized. Theoretical and photophysical investigations reveal that TCzPhCor shows room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from the lowest&#8208;lying T1; however, for TDMACPhCor, dual RTP originating from a higher&#8208;lying T1 (T1H) and a lower&#8208;lying T1 (T1L) can be observed, while for TPXZPhCor, T1H&#8208;dominated RTP occurs resulting from a stabilized high&#8208;energy T1 geometry. Benefiting from the high&#8208;temperature sensitivity of TPXZPhCor, high color&#8208;resolution temperature sensing is achieved. Besides, due to degenerate S1 and T1H states of TPXZPhCor, the first corannulene&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is investigated. The afterglow OLED with TPXZPhCor shows a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) and a luminance (Lmax) of 3.3% and 5167 cd m&#8208;2, respectively, which is one of the most efficient afterglow RTP OLEDs reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional conductive covalent organic framework with anisotropic charge transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with efficient charge transport is of high immense interest for application in opto&#8208;electronic devices. To enhance COF charge transport properties, electroactive building blocks and dopants can be used to induce extended conduction channels. However, understanding their intricate interplay remains challenging. We designed and synthesized a tailor&#8208;made COF structure with electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) core units and planar dioxin (D) linkages, denoted as HD&#8208;COF. With the support of theoretical calculations, we found that the HAT units in the HD&#8208;COF induce strong, eclipsed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The unique stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages leads to efficient anisotropic charge transport. We fabricated HD&#8208;COF films to minimize the grain boundary effect of bulk COFs, which resulted in enhanced conductivity. As a result, the HD&#8208;COF films showed an electrical conductivity as high as 1.25 S cm&#8722;1 after doping with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Oximesulfonylation of Alkenes Using Sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of oxime ethers as bifunctional reagents remains unknown. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy that enables oximesulfonylation of olefins using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents under metal&#8208;free photochemical conditions. Via concomitant C&#8208;S and C&#8208;C bond formation, the process permits incorporation of oxime and sulfonyl groups into olefins in a complete atom&#8208;economic fashion, providing rapid access to multi&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl oxime ethers with good yields and stereoselectivity. The method is amenable to functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and is shown to be scalable. A radical chain mechanism initiated via photochemical Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mediated N&#8208;O bond cleavage is suggested for the process, based on our results on mechanistic investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane over Au1Ag Single&#8208;atom Alloy Modified ZnO with Oxygen and Water Vapor: Synergy of Gold and Silver</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H dissociation and C&#8211;C coupling are two key steps in converting CH4 into multi&#8208;carbon compounds. Here we report a synergy of Au and Ag to greatly promote C2H6 formation over Au1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticles (Au1Ag NPs)&#8208;modified ZnO catalyst via photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (POCM) with O2 and H2O. Atomic dispersed Au in Au1Ag NPs effectively promotes the dissociation of O2 and H2O into *OOH, promoting C&#8211;H activation of CH4 on the photogenerated O&#8210; to form *CH3. Electron&#8208;deficient Au single atoms, as hopping ladders, also facilitate the migration of electron donor *CH3 from ZnO to Au1Ag NPs. Finally, *CH3 coupling can readily occur on Ag atoms of Au1Ag NPs. An excellent C2H6 yield of 14.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (79% selectivity) with apparent quantum yield (14.6% at 350 nm) is obtained via POCM with O2 and H2O, which is at least 2 times of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic system. The bimetallic synergistic strategy offers guidance for the future catalysts design for POCM with O2 and H2O.</dc:description>

However, proteomic coverage for trace samples is constrained by adsorption loss during repeated elution at sample pretreatment. Here, we demonstrated superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles functionalized with molecular glues (MGs) to enrich proteins in trace human biofluid. We showed high protein binding (&gt;95%) and recovery (~90%) rates by anchor&#8208;nanoparticles. We further proposed a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) method that enabled unbiased protein capture, protein digestion and pure peptides elution in one single tube. We demonstrated SWAP to quantify over 2500 protein groups with 100 HEK 293T cells. We adopted SWAP to profile proteomics with trace aqueous humor samples from cataract (n=15) and wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (n=8) patients, and quantified ~1400 proteins from 5 &#956;l aqueous humor. SWAP simplifies sample preparation steps, minimizes adsorption loss and improves protein coverage for label&#8208;free proteomics with previous trace samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Chemical Regulation of Reactive X Species for Versatile Disease Treatments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive X species (RXS), encompassing elements such as O, N, C, S, Se, Cl, Br, I, and H, play vital roles in cell biology and physiological function, impacting cellular signal transduction, metabolic regulation and disease processes. The redox unbalance of RXS is firmly implicated in an assortment of physiological and pathological disorders, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the intricate nature and multifactorial dependence of RXS pose challenges in comprehending and precisely modulating their biological behavior. Nanomaterials with distinct characteristics and biofunctions offer promising avenues for generating or scavenging RXS to maintain redox homeostasis and advance disease therapy. This minireview provides a tutorial summary of the relevant chemistry and specific mechanisms governing different RXS, focusing on cellular metabolic regulation, stress responses, and the role of nanomedicine in RXS generation and elimination. The challenges associated with chemically regulating RXS for diverse disease treatments are further discussed along with the future prospects, aiming to facilitate the clinical translation of RXS&#8208;based nanomedicine and open new avenues for improved therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motion in the solid state is typically precluded by the highly dense environment, and only molecules with a limited range of sizes show such dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the solid&#8208;state rotational motion of two giant molecules, i.e., triptycene and pentiptycene, by encapsulating a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I) complex in the crystalline media. To date, triptycene is the largest molecule (surface area: 245 &#197;2; volume: 219 &#197;3) for which rotation has been reported in the solid state, with the largest rotational diameter among reported solid&#8208;state molecular rotors (9.5 &#197;). However, the pentiptycene rotator that is the subject of this study (surface area: 392 &#197;2; volume: 361 &#197;3; rotational diameter: 13.0 &#197;) surpasses this record. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of both the developed rotors revealed that these possess sufficient free volume around the rotator. The molecular motion in the solid state was confirmed using variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state 2H spin&#8208;echo NMR studies. The triptycene rotor exhibited three&#8208;fold rotation, while temperature&#8208;dependent changes of the rotational angle were observed for the pentiptycene rotor.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Memristor Based on Bistable [2]Catenanes: Toward High&#8208;Density and Non&#8208;Volatile Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ever&#8208;increasing demand for data storage and neuromorphic computing calls for innovative, high&#8208;density solutions, such as resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM). However, the integration of resistive switching and rectification at nanoscale remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we introduce a bistable [2]catenane&#8208;based supramolecular junction that simultaneously functions as a resistive switch and a diode. All supramolecular junctions are highly stable and reproducible over thousands of resistive switching cycles, because the nano&#8208;confinement of two mechanically interlocked rings can stabilize the radical states of pyridinium moieties under ambient conditions. The successful realization of supramolecular junctions in functionality with a thickness of approximately 2 nm presents a promising avenue for the development of molecule&#8208;scale based RRAM for a better solution of high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development and implementation of more efficient and sustainable technologies is key to delivering our net&#8208;zero targets. Here we review how engineered enzymes, with a focus on those developed using directed evolution, can be deployed to improve the sustainability of numerous processes and help to conserve our environment. Efficient and robust biocatalysts have been engineered to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and have been embedded into new efficient metabolic CO2 fixation pathways. Enzymes have been refined for bioremediation, enhancing their ability to degrade toxic and harmful pollutants. Biocatalytic recycling is gaining momentum, with engineered cutinases and PETases developed for the depolymerization of the abundant plastic, PET. Finally, biocatalytic approaches for accessing petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks and chemicals are expanding, using optimized enzymes to convert plant biomass into biofuels or other high value products. Through these examples, we hope to illustrate how enzyme engineering and biocatalysis can contribute to the development of more environmentally sustainable approaches, in order to protect our planet.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Anionic Organic Frameworks with Solid&#8208;State Cation Conduction for Charge Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, with the general formula of A4&#8208;Zn&#8208;DOBDP (wherein A is Li+ or Na+, and DOBDP6&#8208; is the 2,5&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediphosphate ligand) is prepared and characterized for energy storage applications. With four alkali cations per formula unit, the A4&#8208;Zn&#8208;DOBDP MOF is found to be the first example of non&#8208;solvated cation conducting MOF with measured conductivities of 5.4 &#215; 10&#8208;8 S cm&#8208;1 and 3.4 &#215; 10&#8208;8 S cm&#8208;1 for Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8208; phases, indicating phase and composition effects of Li+ and Na+ shuttling through the channels. Three orders of magnitude increase in ionic conductivity is further attained upon solvation with propylene carbonate, placing this system among the best MOF ionic conductors at room temperature.

The significance of this research extends from the development of a new family of electroactive phosphonate&#8208;based MOFs with inherent ionic conductivity and reversible cation storage, to providing elementary insights into the development of highly sought yet still evasive MOFs with mixed&#8208;ion and electron conduction for energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra Robust and Highly Efficient Flexible Organic Solar Cells with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency Realized by Incorporating a Linker Dimerized Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker dimer acceptor (DOY&#8208;TVT) was designed and synthesized. When incorporation of the DOY&#8208;TVT in D18:N3 system, the ductility and morphological stability of ternary blend films was successfully improved. A stabilized PCE of 18.06&#8201;% was obtained for flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) with ultrahigh mechanical robustness by incorporating DOY&#8208;TVT. Impressively, the optimal f&#8208;OSCs retain 97&#8201;% of the initial PCE even after 3000 bending cycles.







Abstract
The wearable application of flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) necessitates high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness. However, photoactive films based on efficient non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) are typically brittle, leading to poor mechanical stability in devices. In this study, we achieved a remarkable PCE of 18.06&#8201;% in f&#8208;OSCs while maintaining ultrahigh mechanical robustness (with a crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of higher than 11&#8201;%) by incorporating a linker dimerized acceptor (DOY&#8208;TVT). Compared to binary blends, ternary systems exhibit reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, suppressed crystallization and diffusion of NF&#8208;SMAs, and improved load distribution across the chain networks, enabling the dissipation of the load energy. Thus, the ternary f&#8208;OSCs developed in this study achieved, high PCE and stability, surpassing binary OSCs. Moreover, the developed f&#8208;OSCs retained 97&#8201;% of the initial PCE even after 3000 bending cycles, indicating excellent mechanical stability (9.1&#8201;% higher than binary systems). Furthermore, the rigid device with inverted structure based on the optimal active layer exhibited a substantial increase in efficiency retention, with 89.6&#8201;% after 865&#8197;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 93&#8201;% after more than 1300&#8197;h of shelf storage at 25&#8201;&#176;C.

     alt="Ultra Robust and Highly Efficient Flexible Organic Solar Cells with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency Realized by Incorporating a Linker Dimerized Acceptor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A linker dimer acceptor (&lt;b&gt;DOY-TVT&lt;/b&gt;) was designed and synthesized. When incorporation of the &lt;b&gt;DOY-TVT&lt;/b&gt; in D18:N3 system, the ductility and morphological stability of ternary blend films was successfully improved. A stabilized PCE of 18.06&#8201;% was obtained for flexible organic solar cells (f-OSCs) with ultrahigh mechanical robustness by incorporating &lt;b&gt;DOY-TVT&lt;/b&gt;. Impressively, the optimal f-OSCs retain 97&#8201;% of the initial PCE even after 3000 bending cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wearable application of flexible organic solar cells (f-OSCs) necessitates high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness. However, photoactive films based on efficient non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) are typically brittle, leading to poor mechanical stability in devices. In this study, we achieved a remarkable PCE of 18.06&#8201;% in f-OSCs while maintaining ultrahigh mechanical robustness (with a crack-onset strain (COS) of higher than 11&#8201;%) by incorporating a linker dimerized acceptor (DOY-TVT). Compared to binary blends, ternary systems exhibit reduced non-radiative recombination, suppressed crystallization and diffusion of NF-SMAs, and improved load distribution across the chain networks, enabling the dissipation of the load energy. Thus, the ternary f-OSCs developed in this study achieved, high PCE and stability, surpassing binary OSCs. Moreover, the developed f-OSCs retained 97&#8201;% of the initial PCE even after 3000 bending cycles, indicating excellent mechanical stability (9.1&#8201;% higher than binary systems). Furthermore, the rigid device with inverted structure based on the optimal active layer exhibited a substantial increase in efficiency retention, with 89.6&#8201;% after 865&#8197;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 93&#8201;% after more than 1300&#8197;h of shelf storage at 25&#8201;&#176;C. These findings highlight the potential of the linker oligomer acceptor for realizing high-performing f-OSCs with ultrahigh mechanical robustness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Smart Emulsions Stabilized by a Multi&#8208;headgroup Surfactant Tolerant to High Concentrations of Acids and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;headgroup surfactant was synthesized that can be transformed among cationic (di&#8208;UAPAc), zwitterionic and bola structures by pH trigger. In strong acidity, di&#8208;UAPAc co&#8208;stabilizes OID emulsions in combination with silica particles which convert to Pickering emulsions upon addition of high concentration of salts.







Abstract
Retaining emulsions stable at high acidity and salinity is still a great challenge. Here, we report a novel multi&#8208;headgroup surfactant (C3H7&#8722;NH+(C10COOH)2, di&#8208;UAPAc) which can be reversibly transformed among cationic, anionic and zwitterionic forms upon pH variation. Stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion (OID) emulsions in strong acidity (pH=2) can be co&#8208;stabilized by low concentrations of di&#8208;UAPAc and silica nanoparticles. High salinity at pH=2 improves the adsorption of di&#8208;UAPAc on silica particles through hydrogen bonding, resulting in the transformation of OID emulsions into Pickering emulsions. Moreover, emulsification/demulsification and interconversion between OID and Pickering emulsions together with control of the viscosity and droplet size can be triggered by pH. The present work provides a new protocol for designing surfactants for various applications in harsh aqueous media, such as strong acidity and high salinity, involved in oil recovery and sewerage treatments.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(Hetero)arylethylamines: Modern Strategies and Advances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progresses made in the catalytic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines, which have become widespread scaffolds in drug discovery. During the past decade, this field of research has expanded tremendously thanks to the development of enabling technologies such as C&#8722;H activation, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and organocatalysis, whose illustrative examples will be highlighted.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;(Hetero)arylethylamines appear in a myriad of pharmaceuticals due to their broad spectrum of biological properties, making them prime candidates for drug discovery. Conventional methods for their preparation often require engineered substrates that limit the flexibility of the synthetic routes and the diversity of compounds that can be accessed. Consequently, methods that provide rapid and versatile access to those scaffolds remain limited. To overcome these challenges, synthetic chemists have designed innovative and modular strategies to access the &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamine motif, paving the way for their more extensive use in future pharmaceuticals. This review outlines recent progresses in the synthesis of (hetero)arylethylamines and emphasizes how these innovations have enabled new levels of molecular complexity, selectivity, and practicality.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Site&#8208;Switchable Hydroarylation of Alkenes Controlled by Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed remote site&#8208;switchable hydroarylation of alkenes controlled by two different ligands was reported. The protocol enables access to the products functionalized at the subterminal methylene and terminal methyl positions on an alkyl chain in good results. The results of the control experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the reaction involves a chain&#8208;walking process and the modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8208;type mechanism.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed remote site&#8208;switchable hydroarylation of alkenes was reported, delivering the products functionalized at the subterminal methylene and terminal methyl positions on an alkyl chain controlled by two different ligands, respectively, in good yields and with good to excellent site&#8208;selectivities. The catalytic system showed good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope, including unactivated and activated alkenes. More importantly, the regioconvergent transformations of mixtures of isomeric alkenes were also successfully realized. The results of the mechanistic studies demonstrate that the reaction undergoes a chain&#8208;walking process to give an [Ar&#8722;Ir&#8722;H] complex of terminal alkene. The subsequent processes proceed through the modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8208;type mechanism via the migratory insertion of terminal alkene into the Ir&#8722;C bond followed by C&#8722;H reductive elimination to afford the hydrofunctionalization products site&#8208;selectively.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Trehalose Additive for Reversible Zinc Anodes with Improved Stability and Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trehalose (THL) is reported as electrolyte additive for the stabilization of zinc anodes. THL breaks the H&#8208;bond network of water and improves the interfacial reaction kinetics, realizing a stable and flat Zn deposition with exposure of the (002) plane. A highly reversible Zn anode was obtained, exhibiting a high CE of 99.8&#8201;% for 3000 cycles in Zn/Cu cells and a stable cycling for 1500&#8197;h under 9.0&#8201;% DOD in Zn symmetric cells.







Abstract
The moderate reversibility of Zn anodes, as a long&#8208;standing challenge in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, promotes the exploration of suitable electrolyte additives continuously. It is crucial to establish the absolute predominance of smooth deposition within multiple interfacial reactions for stable zinc anodes, including suppressing side parasitic reactions and facilitating Zn plating process. Trehalose catches our attention due to the reported mechanisms in sustaining biological stabilization. In this work, the inter&#8208;disciplinary application of trehalose is reported in the electrolyte modification for the first time. The pivotal roles of trehalose in suppressed hydrogen evolution and accelerated Zn deposition have been investigated based on the principles of thermodynamics as well as reaction kinetics. The electrodeposit changes from random accumulation of flakes to dense bulk with (002)&#8208;plane exposure due to the unlocked crystal&#8208;face oriented deposition with trehalose addition. As a result, the highly reversible Zn anode is obtained, exhibiting a high average CE of 99.8&#8201;% in the Zn/Cu cell and stable cycling over 1500&#8197;h under 9.0&#8201;% depth of discharge in the Zn symmetric cell. The designing principles and mechanism analysis in this study could serve as a source of inspiration in exploring novel additives for advanced Zn anodes.

         <dc:description>
Carbonate hydrogenation to formate is a promising route to convert captured carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals.

The catalytic properties of nickel can be greatly changed through the regulation of the electronic structure by the support, which makes it possible to improve the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Carbonate hydrogenation to formate is a promising route to convert captured carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals, thus reducing carbon emissions and creating a revenue return. Developing inexpensive catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability remains challenging. We report a supported non&#8208;noble metal catalyst, Ni/TiO2, with great selectivity over 96&#8201;% and excellent stability in catalyzing the conversion of carbonate into formate in aqueous solution. Ni0 and Ni2+ species are both observed in Ni/TiO2 catalysts, and the synergistic effect of these two Ni components leads to high activity and high selectivity of carbonate hydrogenation to formate.

&lt;p&gt;Carbonate hydrogenation to formate is a promising route to convert captured carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals, thus reducing carbon emissions and creating a revenue return. Developing inexpensive catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability remains challenging. We report a supported non-noble metal catalyst, Ni/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with great selectivity over 96&#8201;% and excellent stability in catalyzing the conversion of carbonate into formate in aqueous solution. Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species are both observed in Ni/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts, and the synergistic effect of these two Ni components leads to high activity and high selectivity of carbonate hydrogenation to formate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Selective Ionic Crosslinking Provides Stretchable Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) have been developed through the implementation of size&#8208;selective ionic crosslinking. The resulting OMIECs exhibit remarkable mechanical properties and high conductivity. These materials were utilized to fabricate stretchable thermoelectric generators, demonstrating excellent heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity efficiency and high stability in humid environments.







Abstract
Mechanically compliant conductors are of utmost importance for the emerging fields of soft electronics and robotics. However, the development of intrinsically deformable organic conductors remains a challenge due to the trade&#8208;off between mechanical performance and charge mobility. In this study, we report a solution to this issue based on size&#8208;selective ionic crosslinking. This rationally designed crosslinking mediated by length&#8208;regulated oligo(ethylene glycol) pendant groups and metal ions simultaneously improved the softness and toughness and ensured excellent mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductivity in poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate composite materials. Moreover, the added ions remarkably promoted accumulation of charge carriers in response to temperature gradient, thus offering a viable approach to stretchable thermoelectric generators with enhanced stability against humidity.

         <title>Biaxially&#8208;Strained Phthalocyanine at Polyoxometalate@Carbon Nanotube Heterostructure Boosts Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) with unique FeN4 site has attracted increasing interests as a promising non&#8208;precious catalyst. However, the plane symmetric structure endows FePc with undesired catalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel one&#8208;dimensional heterostructured ORR catalyst by coupling FePc at polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanotubes (FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NTs) using host&#8208;guest chemistry. The encapsulation of polyoxometalates can induce a local tensile strain of single&#8208;walled NTs to strengthen the interactions with FePc. Both the strain and curvature effects of {PW12}@NT scaffold tune the geometric structure and electronic localization of FeN4 centers to enhance the ORR catalytic performance. As expected, such a heterostructured FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NT electrocatalyst exhibits prominent durability, methanol tolerance, and ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90 V and a low Tafel slope of 30.9 mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline medium. Besides, the assembled zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrates an ultrahigh power density of 280 mW cm&#8722;2, excellent charge/discharge ability and long&#8208;term stability over 500 h, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 cathode. This study offers a new strategy to design novel heterostructured catalysts and opens a new avenue to regulate the electrocatalytic performance of phthalocyanine molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aqueous Redox Flow Battery Using CO2 as an Active Material with a Homogeneous Ir Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the application of CO2 as an energy storage material, a H2 storage system has been proposed based on the interconversion of CO2 and formic acid (or formate). However, energy losses are inevitable in the conversion of electrical energy to H2 as chemical energy (~70% electrical efficiency) and H2 to electrical energy (~40% electrical efficiency). To overcome these significant energy losses, we developed a system based on the interconversion of CO2 and formate for the direct storage and generation of electricity. In this paper, we report an aqueous redox flow battery system using homogeneous Ir catalysts with CO2&#8211;formate redox pair. The system exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5 mAh (1.5 Ah L&#8208;1), capacity decay of 0.2% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. During charging&#8211;discharging, in situ fluorescence X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy based on an online setup indicated that the active species was in a high valence state of Ir4+.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Driven, Switchable Catalysis Based on Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the phosphorylation regulation of reactive sites of natural enzymes, this work focuses on the de novo design of peptide&#8208;based enzyme mimetics with switchable catalytic activity. The zipper&#8208;like four&#8208;ligand structure on the peptide/Cu assemblies is the catalytically active center, imparting these enzyme mimetics with remarkable activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Covalent regulatory systems of enzymes are widely used to modulate biological enzyme activities. Inspired by the regulation of reactive&#8208;site phosphorylation in organisms, we developed peptide&#8208;based catecholase mimetics with switchable catalytic activity and high selectivity through the co&#8208;assembly of nanofibers comprising peptides and copper ions (Cu2+). Through careful design and modification of the peptide backbone structure based on the change in the free energy of the system, we identified the peptide with the most effective reversible catalytic activity. Kinase/phosphatase switches were used to control the reversible transition of nanofiber formation and depolymerization, as well as to modulate the active&#8208;site microenvironment. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly processes of nanofibers were simulated using coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirmed the coordination of the peptide and Cu2+, forming a zipper&#8208;like four&#8208;ligand structure at the catalytically active center of the nanofibers. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic mechanism. This study opens novel avenues for designing biomimetic enzymes with ordered structures and dynamic catalytic activities.

         <title>Creating an amyloid &#8216;kaleidoscope&#8217; using short iodinated peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid fibrils formed by peptides with different sequences exhibit diversified morphologies, material properties and activities, making them valuable for developing functional bionanomaterials. However, the molecular understanding underlying the structural diversity of peptide fibrillar assembly at atomic level is still lacking. In this study, by using cryogenic electron microscopy, we first revealed the structural basis underlying the highly reversible assembly of 1GFGGNDNFG9 (referred to as hnRAC1) peptide fibril. Furthermore, by installing iodine at different sites of hnRAC1, we generated a collection of peptide fibrils with distinct thermostability. By determining the atomic structures of the iodinated fibrils, we discovered that iodination at different sites of the peptide facilitates the formation of diverse halogen bonds and triggers the assembly of entirely different structures of iodinated fibrils. Finally, based on this structural knowledge, we designed an iodinated peptide that assembles into new atomic structures of fibrils, exhibiting superior thermostability, that aligned with our design. Our work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the atomic&#8208;level processes underlying the formation of diverse peptide fibril structures, and paves the way for creating an amyloid &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221; by employing various modifications and peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune the atomic structure and properties of fibrillar nanostructures.</dc:description>

Our work provides an in-depth understanding of the atomic-level processes underlying the formation of diverse peptide fibril structures, and paves the way for creating an amyloid &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221; by employing various modifications and peptide sequences to fine-tune the atomic structure and properties of fibrillar nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemodivergent Staudinger Reactions of Secondary Phosphine Oxides and Application to the Total Synthesis of LL&#8211;D05139&#946; Potassium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented chemodivergent Staudinger reactions of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) have been developed. Reagent&#8208;controlled 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;nitrogen atom exclusions from azides have been achieved. Conversion of a chiral SPO to a phosphinic amide was stereoretentive, and the potassium salt of natural product LL&#8208;D05139&#946; was synthesized for the first time.







Abstract
Unprecedented Staudinger reaction modes of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) and organic azides are herein disclosed. By the application of various additives, selective nitrogen atom exclusion from the azide group has been achieved. Chlorotrimethylsilane mediates a stereoretentive Staudinger reaction with a 2&#8208;N exclusion which provides a valuable method for the synthesis of phosphinic amides and can be considered complementary to the stereoinvertive Atherton&#8211;Todd reaction. Alternatively, a 1&#8208;N exclusion pathway is promoted by acetic acid to provide the corresponding diazo compound. The effectiveness of this protocol has been further demonstrated by the total synthesis of the diazo&#8208;containing natural product LL&#8208;D05139&#946;, which was prepared as a potassium salt for the first time in 6&#8197;steps and 26.5&#8201;% overall yield.

         <title>Noncovalent Modification of Cycloparaphenylene by Catenane Formation Using an Active Metal Template Strategy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane, which consists of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle, has been synthesized by an active metal template strategy. Catalytic C&#8722;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation at the bipyridine macrocycle moiety illustrated the efficient post&#8208;functionalization of the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane. The structural and photophysical properties of the Ag complex of [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane were also studied.







Abstract
The active metal template (AMT) strategy is a powerful tool for the formation of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) such as rotaxanes and catenanes, allowing the synthesis of a variety of MIMs, including &#960;&#8208;conjugated and multicomponent macrocycles. Cycloparaphenylene (CPP) is an emerging molecule characterized by its cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and unique properties. Therefore, diverse modifications of CPPs are necessary for its wide application. However, most CPP modifications require early stage functionalization and the direct modification of CPPs is very limited. Herein, we report the synthesis of a catenane consisting of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle as a new CPP analogue that contains a reliable synthetic scaffold enabling diverse and concise post&#8208;modification. Following the AMT strategy, the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane was successfully synthesized through Ni&#8208;mediated aryl&#8208;aryl coupling. Catalytic C&#8722;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation of the bipyridine macrocycle moiety, an effective post&#8208;functionalization method, were also demonstrated with the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed that the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane forms a tridentated complex with an Ag ion inside the CPP ring. This interaction significantly enhances the phosphorescence lifetime through improved intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Quantum Nuclear Delocalization and its Rovibrational Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protons microsolvated by helium atoms, HHe+n, offer fascinating insights into rovibrational excitations of polyatomic van der Waals complexes subject to pronounced quantum nuclear delocalization effects. Using quasi&#8208;exact calculations, we unveil for HHe3+ how different vibrational excitations modify in characteristic ways the torus&#8208;like quantum delocalization of one He around the quasi&#8208;linear HHe2+ core known from the quantum ground state.

 chomophore, but freely orbits the central proton, forming a three&#8208;dimensional torus around the 
 chromophore. This quantum delocalization is observed for all vibrational states, the type of vibrational excitation being reflected in the topology of the nodal surfaces in the nuclear densities, showing, for example, that intramolecular bending involves excitation along the circumference of the torus.

         <title>Selectivity Control of the Ligand Exchange at Carbon in &#945;&#8208;Metallated Ylides as a Route to Ketenyl Anions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonylation of metallated ylides was found to result in competing phosphine versus metal salt elimination. The selectivity can effectively be controlled to enable selective isolation of the tosyl&#8208;substituted ketenyl anion. Its cryptand complex featured the &#8220;naked&#8221; ketenyl anion [Ts&#8722;C=C=O]&#8722; in the solid state, which exhibited an only slightly bent S&#8722;C&#8722;C linkage indicating a pronounced ynolate character.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Metallated ylides have recently been reported to undergo phosphine by CO exchange at the ylidic carbon atom to form isolable ketenyl anions. Systematic studies on the tosyl&#8208;substituted yldiides, R3P=C(M)Ts (M=Li, Na, K), now reveal that carbonylation may lead to a competing metal salt (MTs) elimination. This side&#8208;reaction can be controlled by the choice of phosphine, metal cation, solvent and co&#8208;ligands, thus enabling the selective isolation of the ketenyl anion [Ts&#8722;CCO]M (2&#8208;M). Complexation of 2&#8208;Na by crown ether or cryptand allowed structure elucidation of the first free ketenyl anion [Ts&#8722;CCO]&#8722;, which showed an almost linear Ts&#8722;C&#8722;C linkage indicative for a pronounced ynolate character. However, DFT studies support a high charge at the ketenyl carbon atom, which is reflected in the selective carbon&#8208;centered reactivity. Overall, the present study provides important information on the selectivity control of ketenyl anion formation which will be crucial for future applications.

         <title>Photoluminescence of Mn2+ in the Borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4] : Mn2+&#8212;A Tool to Detect Weak Coordination Behavior of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The luminescence of Mn2+ is strongly affected by the ligand field. Usually only the metal&#8208;ligand distance is considered a tool to tune the ligand field strength in phosphors. Using Zn[B2(SO4)4] as a host, we show that electronic effects are an important alternative and lead to unusual orange luminescence of Mn2+.







Abstract
The impact of the surrounding ligand field is successfully exploited in the case of Eu2+ to tune the emission characteristics of inorganic photoactive materials with potential application in, e.g., phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;wLEDs). However, the photoluminescence of Mn2+ related to intraconfigurational 3d5&#8211;3d5 transitions is also strongly dependent on local ligand field effects and has been underestimated in this regard so far. In this work, we want to revive the idea how to electronically tune the emission color of a transition metal ion in inorganic hosts by unusual electronic effects in the metal&#8208;ligand bond. The concept is explicitly demonstrated for the weakly coordinating layer&#8208;like borosulfate ligand in the Mn2+&#8208;containing solid solutions Zn1&#8208;xMnx[B2(SO4)4] (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.10). Zn[B2(SO4)4]:Mn2+ shows orange narrow&#8208;band luminescence at 590&#8197;nm, which is an unusually short wavelength for octahedrally coordinated Mn2+ and indicates an uncommonly weak ligand field. On the other hand, the analysis of the interelectronic Racah repulsion parameters reveals ionic Mn&#8722;O bonds with values close to the Racah parameters of the free Mn2+ ion.

     alt="Photoluminescence of Mn2+ in the Borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4] : Mn2+&#8212;A Tool to Detect Weak Coordination Behavior of Ligands"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The luminescence of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is strongly affected by the ligand field. Usually only the metal-ligand distance is considered a tool to tune the ligand field strength in phosphors. Using Zn[B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] as a host, we show that electronic effects are an important alternative and lead to unusual orange luminescence of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of the surrounding ligand field is successfully exploited in the case of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to tune the emission characteristics of inorganic photoactive materials with potential application in, e.g., phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-wLEDs). However, the photoluminescence of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; related to intraconfigurational 3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; transitions is also strongly dependent on local ligand field effects and has been underestimated in this regard so far. In this work, we want to revive the idea how to electronically tune the emission color of a transition metal ion in inorganic hosts by unusual electronic effects in the metal-ligand bond. The concept is explicitly demonstrated for the weakly coordinating layer-like borosulfate ligand in the Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-containing solid solutions Zn&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.10). Zn[B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]:Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; shows orange narrow-band luminescence at 590&#8197;nm, which is an unusually short wavelength for octahedrally coordinated Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and indicates an uncommonly weak ligand field. On the other hand, the analysis of the interelectronic Racah repulsion parameters reveals ionic Mn&#8722;O bonds with values close to the Racah parameters of the free Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Overall, this strategy demonstrates that electronic control of the metal-ligand bond can be a tool to make Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; a potent alternative emitter to Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for inorganic phosphors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Environment&#8208;Responsive Peptide Dimers Bind and Stabilize Double&#8208;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA shows immense biomedical potential but applications are limited by its instability and poor cellular uptake. Herein, we present a general approach of reversibly binding peptide dimers that stabilize double&#8208;stranded RNA, protect it against degradation by nucleases and enhance cellular RNA uptake. Under reducing conditions peptide dimers monomerize thereby triggering a controlled release of RNA.







Abstract
Double&#8208;stranded RNAs (dsRNA) possess immense potential for biomedical applications. However, their therapeutic utility is limited by low stability and poor cellular uptake. Different strategies have been explored to enhance the stability of dsRNA, including the incorporation of modified nucleotides, and the use of diverse carrier systems. Nevertheless, these have not resulted in a broadly applicable approach thereby preventing the wide&#8208;spread application of dsRNA for therapeutic purposes. Herein, we report the design of dimeric stapled peptides based on the RNA&#8208;binding protein TAV2b. These dimers are obtained via disulfide formation and mimic the natural TAV2b assembly. They bind and stabilize dsRNA in the presence of serum, protecting it from degradation. In addition, peptide binding also promotes cellular uptake of dsRNA. Importantly, peptide dimers monomerize under reducing conditions which results in a loss of RNA binding. These findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;based RNA binders for the stabilization and protection of dsRNA, representing an appealing strategy towards the environment&#8208;triggered release of RNA. This can broaden the applicability of dsRNA, such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), for therapeutic applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diradicals based on the Blatter units and connected by acetylene and alkene spacers have been prepared. All the molecules show sizably large diradical character and low energy singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps. Their photo&#8208;physical properties concerning their lowest energy excited state have been studied in detail by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy. We have fully identified the main optical absorption band and full absence of emission from the lowest energy excited state. A computational study has been also carried out that has helped to identify the presence of a conical intersection between the lowest energy excited state and the ground state which produces a highly efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion of the absorbed radiation. Furthermore, an outstanding photo&#8208;thermal conversion near 80% has been confirmed, close to the highest in the diradicaloid field. For the first time, stable diradicals are applied to photo&#8208;thermal therapy of tumor cells with good stability and satisfactory performance at near&#8208;infrared region.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Cascade of Tumor&#8208;specific Immune Response in
vivo via Chemoenzymatic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring the highly dynamic and complex immune response remains a great challenge owing to the lack of reliable and specific approaches. Here, we develop a strategy to monitor the cascade of tumor immune response through the cooperation of pore&#8208;forming alginate gel with chemoenzymatic proximity&#8208;labeling. The macroporous gel that containing tumor&#8208;associated antigen, adjuvant and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine is used to recruit the endogenous DCs and promote their maturation in vivo. The mature DCs are then modified with GDP&#8208;fucose&#8208;fucosyltransferase (GDP&#8208;Fuc&#8208;Fuct) via the self&#8208;catalysis of fucosyltransferase (Fuct). After the migration of the obtained Fuct&#8208;DCs to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs), the molecular recognition mediated interaction of DCs and T cells leads to the successful decoration of T cells with GDP&#8208;Fuc&#8208;azide through the Fuct catalyzed proximity&#8208;labeling. As a result, the activated tumor&#8208;specific T cells can be identified via the bioorthogonal labeling in dLNs as well as tumors, pioneering an avenue for the study of tumor immune mechanism in situ.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Understanding the Formation Mechanism and OER Catalytic Mechanism of Hydroxides by In Situ and Operando Techniques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and affordable electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant barrier that needs to be overcome for the practical applications of hydrogen production via water electrolysis, transforming CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Recently, hydroxides have shown promise as electrocatalysts for OER. In situ or operando techniques are particularly indispensable for monitoring the key intermediates together with understanding the reaction process, which is extremely important for revealing the formation/OER catalytic mechanism of hydroxides and preparing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for OER. However, there is a lack of comprehensive discussion on the current status and challenges of studying these mechanisms using in situ or operando techniques, which hinders our ability to identify and address the obstacles present in this field. This review offers an overview of in situ or operando techniques, outlining their capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages. Recent findings related to the formation mechanism and OER catalytic mechanism of hydroxides revealed by in situ or operando techniques are also discussed in detail. Additionally, some current challenges in this field are concluded and appropriate solution strategies are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of Rhizonin Biosynthesis Reveals Origin of Pharmacophoric Furylalanine Moieties in Diverse Cyclopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhizonin A and B are hepatotoxic cyclopeptides produced by bacterial endosymbionts (Mycetohabitans endofungorum) of the fungus Rhizopus microsporus. Their toxicity critically depends on the presence of 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, which also occur in pharmaceutically relevant cyclopeptides of the endolide and bingchamide families. The biosynthesis and incorporation of Fua by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), however, has remained elusive. By genome sequencing and gene inactivation we elucidated the gene cluster responsible for rhizonin biosynthesis. A suite of isotope labeling experiments identified tyrosine and l&#8208;DOPA as Fua precursors and provided the first mechanistic insights. Bioinformatics, mutational analysis and heterologous reconstitution identified dioxygenase RhzB as necessary and sufficient for Fua formation. RhzB is a novel type of heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenases (HDAO) that enabled the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster through genome mining.</dc:description>

         <title>Flux&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Y2Ti2O5S2 for Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting is an ideal means of producing hydrogen in a sustainable manner, and developing highly efficient photocatalysts is a vital aspect of realizing this process. The photocatalyst Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) is capable of absorbing at wavelengths up to 650 nm and exhibits outstanding thermal and chemical durability compared with other oxysulfides. However, the photocatalytic performance of YTOS synthesized using the conventional solid&#8208;state reaction (SSR) process is limited owing to the large particle sizes and structural defects associated with this synthetic method. Herein, we report the synthesis of YTOS particles by a flux&#8208;assisted technique. The enhanced mass transfer efficiency in the flux significantly reduced the preparation time compared with the SSR method. In addition, the resulting YTOS showed improved photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution activity when loaded with Rh and Co3O4 co&#8208;catalysts, respectively. These improvements are attributed to the reduced particle size and enhanced crystallinity of the material as well as the slower decay of photogenerated carriers on a nanosecond to sub&#8208;microsecond time range. Further optimization of this flux&#8208;assisted method together with suitable surface modification is expected to produce high&#8208;quality YTOS crystals with superior photocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Spleen SORT LNP Generated in situ CAR T Cells Extend Survival in a Mouse Model of Lymphoreplete B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy is revolutionizing treatment for patients suffering from B&#8208;cell lymphoma (BL). However, the current method of CAR T cell production is complicated and expensive, requiring collection of patient blood to enrich the T cell population, ex vivo engineering/activation, and quality assessment before the patient can receive the treatment. Herein we leverage Spleen Selective ORgan Targeted (SORT) Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) to produce CAR T cells in situ and bypass the extensive and laborious process currently used. Optimized Spleen SORT LNPs containing 10% 18:1 PA transfected CD3+, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells in wild&#8208;type mice. Spleen SORT LNPs delivered Cre recombinase mRNA and CAR encoding mRNA to T cells in reporter mice and in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model (respectively) after intravenous injection without the need for active targeting ligands. Moreover, in situ CAR T cells increased the overall survival of mice with a less aggressive form of B cell lymphoma. In addition, in situ transfected CAR T cells reduced tumor metastasis to the liver by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Overall, these results offer a promising alternative method for CAR T cell production with pre&#8208;clinical potential to treat hematological malignancies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the first gold&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes using organohalides as non&#8208;prefunctionalized coupling partners. The mechanism of the reaction involves an oxidative addition/&#960;&#8208;activation mechanism in contrast to the migratory insertion/cis&#8208;trans isomerization pathway that is predominantly observed with other transition metals yielding products with anti&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic insights include several control experiments, NMR studies, HR&#8208;MSMS analyses, and DFT calculations that strongly support the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A photocatalytic self&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition of vinyldiazo compounds is described, which provides cyclopentene derivatives with conservation of one diazo functional group. Experimental insights and density functional theory indicate that the reaction is triggered by an unusual single electron oxidation of vinyldiazo compounds, while the photolysis for the generation of free carbene species is not involved. The synthetic applications of the resulting cyclopentenyl &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds were demonstrated based on the rich chemistry of the diazo functional group.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Thermo&#8208;Driven Azoarene&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Molecular Switch in Liquid Crystal Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chiral optical active materials with switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals remains a challenge. Here an azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch, (S, R, S)&#8208;switch 1 and its contrast (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, are designed and prepared with (R)&#8208;binaphthyl azo group as a chiral photosensitive moiety and two (S) or (R)&#8208;binaphthyl fluorescent molecules with opposite or same handedness as chiral fluorescent moieties. Both two switches exhibit reversible trans/cis isomerization irradiated by 365 nm UV light and 520 nm green light in solvent and liquid crystal (LC) media. In contrast with the control (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, when switch 1 is doped into nematic LCs, the polarization inversion and switching&#8208;off of the CPL signals are achieved in the resultant helical superstructure upon the irradiations of 365 nm UV and 520 nm green light, respectively. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of the system is basically unchanged during this switching process. In particular, these variations of the CPL signals could be recovered after heating, realizing the true sense of CPL reversible switching. Taking advantage of the unique CPL switching, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for &#8220;a dual&#8208;optical information encryption system&#8221; based on the above CPL active material is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable One&#8208;Step Assembly of Uniform Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer &#160;Cylindrical Micelles via&#160;Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Process and Their Applications as Tougheners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of uniform cylindrical nanoobjects from soft materials has attracted tremendous research attention from both fundamental research and practical application points of view but also posed outstanding challenges to their preparation. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step method to assemble cylindrical micelles (CMs) with highly controllable lengths from a single liquid crystalline block copolymer via an in&#8208;situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. By adjusting the assembly conditions, the lengths of the CMs are controlled from hundreds of nanometers to microns. Several influencing factors are systematically investigated to comprehensively understand the process. Particularly, the solvent quality is found determinative to either enhance or suppress the nucleation process to produce shorter and longer CMs, respectively. Taking advantage of this strategy, the lengths of CMs can be nicely controlled in a wide concentration range over four magnitudes. Lastly, CMs are produced on decent scales and applied as additives to dramatically toughen glassy plastic matrix, revealing an unprecedented length&#8208;dependent toughening effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Cosmosporasides Reveals the Assembly Line for Fungal Hybrid Terpenoid Saccharides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fungal hybrid terpenoid saccharides constitute a new and growing family of natural products with significant biomedical and agricultural activities. One of the most representative families is cosmosporasides, which feature&#160;hybrid degree of oxidized terpenoid units and saccharide moieties, however, the assembly line of these building blocks is elusive to date. Herein, a cos cluster from Fusarium orthoceras was discovered for the synthesis of cosmosporaside C (1) by genome mining. A UbiA family intramembrane prenyltransferase (UbiA&#8208;type PT), a multifunctional cytochrome P450, an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;hydrolase, an acetyltransferase, a dimethylallyl transferase (DMAT&#8208;type PT) and a glycosyltransferase, function cooperatively in the assembly of the scaffold of 1 using primary central metabolites. In addition, the absolute configurations of C&#8208;4, C&#8208;6 and C&#8208;7 of 1 are also established. Our work importantly clarifies the unexpected functions of UbiA&#8208;type and DMAT&#8208;type PTs and provides an example for understanding the synthetic logic of hybrid terpenoid saccharides in fungi.</dc:description>

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Pore Engineering of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Weak Interaction&#8208;Triggered Multi&#8208;Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerged as one type of promising crystalline materials, but their narrow pore engineering is severely impeded by the weak reversibility of carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction, leading to the less exploration of their ultramicroporous structures and properties. Herein, we developed a single aromatic ring&#8208;based tetratopic monomer, tetramethylpyrazine, which enables smoothly conducting Knoevenegal condensation at its four arylmethly carbon atoms with linear aromatic dialdehyde monomers upon the self&#8208;catalyzed activation of pyridine nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers in the presence of organic anhydride, leading to the formation of two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. Both of them were crystallized in orthorhombic lattices, and layered in AA stacking fashions along the vertical directions. They exhibit high surface areas and well&#8208;tailored ultramicropore sizes up to 0.5 nm. The unique cross&#8208;linking mode at two pairs of para&#8208;positions of each pyrazine unit through carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds render them with p&#8208;extended conjugation over the in&#8208;plane backbones and substantial semiconducting characters. The resultant COFs can be well&#8208;dispersed in water to form the stable submicroparticles with negative charges (zeta potentials: ~ &#8208;30 mV), and exhibiting tunable aggregation behaviors through protonation/deprotonation. As a consequence, they exhibit the pore size&#8208;dependent colorimetric responses to various anions with different pKa in high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Reversible Homogeneous Catalysis of the Electrochemical H2 Evolution and Oxidation: Role of Proton Relays and Local Concentration Effects

Analytical treatment allows determining all thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen mediated by DuBois/Shaw nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant bases. This analysis shed light on the key activity descriptors responsible for reversible vs. bidirectional catalysis and paves the way towards rational optimization of such molecular catalysts







Abstract
Nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant amines form a unique series of catalysts (so&#8208;called DuBois&#8217; catalysts) capable of bidirectional/reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen. This unique behaviour is directly linked to the presence of proton relays installed close to the metal center. We report here for the arginine derivative [Ni(P2CyN2Arg)2]6+ on a mechanistic model and its kinetic treatment that may apply to all DuBois&#8217; catalysts and show that it allows for a good fit of experimental data measured at different pH values, catalyst concentrations and partial hydrogen pressures. The bidirectionality of catalysis results from balanced equilibria related to hydrogen uptake/evolution on one side and (metal)&#8208;hydride installation/capture on the other side, both controlled by concentration effects resulting from the presence of proton relays and connected by two square schemes corresponding to proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. We show that the catalytic bias is controlled by the kinetic of the H2 uptake/evolution step. Reversibility does not require that the energy landscape be flat, with redox transitions occurring at potentials up to 250&#8197;mV away for the equilibrium potential, although such large deviations from a flat energy landscape can negatively impacts the rate of catalysis when coupled with slow interfacial electron transfer kinetics.

         <title>Coupling Benzylamine Oxidation with CO2 Photoconversion to Ethanol over a Black Phosphorus and Bismuth Tungstate S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction for efficient ethanol production is challenging. A 2D/2D S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction comprised of black phosphorus and bismuth tungstate (BP/BWO) was constructed for CO2 reduction, coupled with benzylamine (BA) oxidation to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BDA). The catalyst generates ethanol with high yield and selectivity. This work provides insight into heterogeneous photocatalysts based on cooperative photoredox systems.







Abstract
Photoconversion of CO2 and H2O into ethanol is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the production of ethanol with high activity and selectivity is challenging owing to the less efficient reduction half&#8208;reaction involving multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), a slow C&#8722;C coupling process, and sluggish water oxidation half&#8208;reaction. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction consisting of black phosphorus and Bi2WO6 (BP/BWO) was constructed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupling with benzylamine (BA) oxidation. The as&#8208;prepared BP/BWO catalyst exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance toward CO2 reduction, with a yield of 61.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethanol (selectivity of 91&#8201;%).In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that S&#8208;scheme heterojunction can effectively promote photogenerated carrier separation via the Bi&#8722;O&#8722;P bridge to accelerate the PCET process. Meanwhile, electron&#8208;rich BP acts as the active site and plays a vital role in the process of C&#8722;C coupling. In addition, the substitution of BA oxidation for H2O oxidation can further enhance the photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction to C2H5OH. This work opens a new horizon for exploring novel heterogeneous photocatalysts in CO2 photoconversion to C2H5OH based on cooperative photoredox systems.

A glycoproteomics platform, Click&#8208;iG, is reported that integrates metabolic labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars, an optimized MS method, and a tailored version of pGlyco3 software to enable simultaneous enrichment and profiling of three types of intact glycopeptides: N&#8208;linked, mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;linked, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated glycopeptides.







Abstract
Proteins are ubiquitously modified with glycans of varied chemical structures through distinct glycosidic linkages, making the landscape of protein glycosylation challenging to map. Profiling of intact glycopeptides with mass spectrometry (MS) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for revealing matched information of the glycosylation sites and attached glycans (i.e., intact glycosites), but is largely limited to individual glycosylation types. Herein, we describe Click&#8208;iG, which integrates metabolic labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars, an optimized MS method, and a tailored version of pGlyco3 software to enable simultaneous enrichment and profiling of three types of intact glycopeptides: N&#8208;linked, mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;linked, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated glycopeptides. We demonstrate the utility of Click&#8208;iG by the identification of thousands of intact glycosites in cell lines and living mice. From the mouse lung, heart, and spleen, a total of 2053 intact N&#8208;glycosites, 262 intact O&#8208;GalNAc glycosites, and 1947 O&#8208;GlcNAcylation sites were identified. Click&#8208;iG&#8208;enabled comprehensive coverage of the protein glycosylation landscape lays the foundation for interrogating crosstalk between different glycosylation pathways.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Cyclic Peptide Assembly to Form Higher&#8208;Order Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical cyclic peptides constructed by dynamic covalent chemistry provide a platform for the investigation of naturally occurring chirality inversion, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, and hierarchical assembly. The insertion of a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. The reversibility can be tuned by changing the pH value without producing other chemical waste except water.







Abstract
Chirality correction, asymmetry, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism and hierarchical assemblies are fundamental phenomena in nature. They are geometrically related and may impact the biological roles of a protein or other supermolecules. It is challenging to study those behaviors within an artificial system due to the complexity of displaying these features. Herein, we design an alternating D,L peptide to recreate and validate the naturally occurring chirality inversion prior to cyclization in water. The resulting asymmetrical cyclic peptide containing a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring provides an excellent platform to study the ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, thermostability and dynamic assembly of the nanostructures.

     alt="Dynamic Control of Cyclic Peptide Assembly to Form Higher-Order Assemblies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetrical cyclic peptides constructed by dynamic covalent chemistry provide a platform for the investigation of naturally occurring chirality inversion, ring-chain tautomerism, and hierarchical assembly. The insertion of a 4-imidazolidinone ring promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. The reversibility can be tuned by changing the pH value without producing other chemical waste except water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality correction, asymmetry, ring-chain tautomerism and hierarchical assemblies are fundamental phenomena in nature. They are geometrically related and may impact the biological roles of a protein or other supermolecules. It is challenging to study those behaviors within an artificial system due to the complexity of displaying these features. Herein, we design an alternating D,L peptide to recreate and validate the naturally occurring chirality inversion prior to cyclization in water. The resulting asymmetrical cyclic peptide containing a 4-imidazolidinone ring provides an excellent platform to study the ring-chain tautomerism, thermostability and dynamic assembly of the nanostructures. Different from traditional cyclic D,L peptides, the formation of 4-imidazolidinone promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. Analysis of the nanostructures confirmed the left-handedness, representing chirality induced self-assembly. This proves that a rationally designed peptide can mimic multiple natural phenomena and could promote the development of functional biomaterials, catalysts, antibiotics, and supermolecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanisms of Cysteine&#8208;Lysine Covalent Linkage&#8212;The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species and Competition with Disulfide Bonds
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual &#8220;NOS&#8221; bond with a bridging oxygen atom can form under oxidising conditions between a cysteine and a lysine residue. Now the reaction mechanisms for the formation of single and double NOS bonds in proteins have been computationally investigated. More than 30 reactions were considered for oxidation pathways involving different reactive oxygen species, providing a comprehensive overview of cysteine oxidation pathways.







Abstract
Recently, a new naturally occurring covalent linkage was characterised, involving a cysteine and a lysine, bridged through an oxygen atom. The latter was dubbed as the NOS bond, reflecting the individual atoms involved in this uncommon bond which finds little parallel in lab chemistry. It is found to form under oxidising conditions and is reversible upon addition of reducing agents. Further studies have identified the bond in crystal structures across a variety of systems and organisms, potentially playing an important role in regulation, cellular defense and replication. Not only that, double NOS bonds have been identified and even found to be competitive in relation to the formation of disulfide bonds. This raises several questions about how this exotic bond comes to be, what are the intermediates involved in its formation and how it competes with other pathways of sulfide oxidation. With this objective in mind, we revisited our first proposed mechanism for the reaction with model electronic structure calculations, adding information about the reactivity with alternative reactive oxygen species and other potential competing products of oxidation. We present a network with more than 30 reactions which provides one of the most encompassing pictures for cysteine oxidation pathways to date.

         <title>Cl2&#8901;&#8722; Mediates Direct and Selective Conversion of Inert C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds into Aldehydes/Ketones</title>

A thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine polymer facilitates effective conversion of O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH&#8594;Cl&#8901;&#8594;Cl2.&#8722; in the aqueous phase. Cl2.&#8722;, with a longer lifetime, transfers into organic phase and activates C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates by successive hydrogen abstraction and chlorination. These unstable intermediates hydrolyze into either aldehydes or ketones with higher selectivity than that of benzyl dichloride.







Abstract
Developing new reactive pathway to activate inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds for valuable oxygenated products remains a challenge. We prepared a series of triazine conjugated organic polymers to photoactivate C&#8722;H into aldehyde/ketone via O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH&#8594;Cl&#8901;&#8594;Cl2&#8901;&#8722;. Experiment results showed Cl2&#8901;&#8722; could successively activate C(sp3)&#8722;H more effectively than Cl&#8901; to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates, increasing the kinetic rate ratio of dichlorination to monochlorination by a factor of 2,000 and thus breaking traditional dichlorination kinetic constraints. These active intermediates were hydrolyzed into aldehydes or ketones easily, when compared with typical stable dichlorinated complexes, avoiding chlorinated by&#8208;product generation. Moreover, an integrated two&#8208;phase system in an acid solution strengthened the Cl2&#8901;&#8722; mediated process and inhibited product overoxidation, where the conversion rate of toluene reached 16.94&#8197;mmol/g/h and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was 99.5&#8201;%. This work presents a facile and efficient approach for selective conversion of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using Cl2&#8901;&#8722;.

         <title>Compartmentalized Polyampholyte Microgels by Depletion Flocculation and Coacervation of Nanogels in Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel step&#8208;by&#8208;step approach for the synthesis of polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8722;C) was developed by incorporating nanogels into microgels via droplet&#8208;based microfluidics yielding different internal morphologies including phase&#8208;separated coacervates, statistically distributed coacervates and core&#8211;shell like arrangements by variation of synthesis parameters such as nanogel concentration, ionic strength and pH value.







Abstract
In pH&#8208;responsive drug carriers, the distribution of charges has been proven to affect delivery efficiency but is difficult to control and verify. Herein, we fabricate polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8722;C) and show that the arrangement of the nanogels (NG) can easily be manipulated by adapting synthesis conditions. Positively and negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive NG are synthesized by precipitation polymerization and labelled with different fluorescent dyes. The obtained NG are integrated into microgel (MG) networks by subsequent inverse emulsion polymerization in droplet&#8208;based microfluidics. By confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we verify that depending on NG concentration, pH value and ionic strength, NiM&#8722;C with different NG arrangements are obtained, including Janus&#8208;like phase&#8208;separation of NG, statistical distribution of NG, and core&#8211;shell arrangements. Our approach is a major step towards uptake and release of oppositely charged (drug) molecules.

         <title>Fast and Tunable Phosphorescence from Organic Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>

The photoluminescence mechanism of crystalline diphosphonium iodide salts strongly depends on anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the case of iodide&#8211;&#960; charge transfer combined with electrostatically controlled packing effects, high quantum yields (&#934;em up to 0.75) and fast radiative rate constants (kr of up to 2.77&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) of phosphorescence have been realized at room temperature, which are exceptionally rare for metal&#8208;free systems.







Abstract
Crystalline diphosphonium iodides [MeR2P&#8208;spacer&#8208;R2Me]I with phenylene (1, 2), naphthalene (3, 4), biphenyl (5) and anthracene (6) as aromatic spacers, are photoemissive under ambient conditions. The emission colors (&#955;em values from 550 to 880&#8197;nm) and intensities (&#934;em reaching 0.75) are defined by the composition and substitution geometry of the central conjugated chromophore motif, and the anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Time&#8208;resolved and variable&#8208;temperature luminescence studies suggest phosphorescence for all the titled compounds, which demonstrate observed lifetimes of 0.46&#8211;92.23&#8197;&#956;s at 297&#8197;K. Radiative rate constants kr as high as 2.8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 deduced for salts 1&#8211;3 were assigned to strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhanced by an external heavy atom effect arising from the anion&#8208;&#960; charge&#8208;transfer character of the triplet excited state. These rates of anomalously fast metal&#8208;free phosphorescence are comparable to those of transition metal complexes and organic luminophores that utilize triplet excitons via a thermally activated delayed fluorescence mechanism, making such ionic luminophores a new paradigm for the design of photofunctional and responsive molecular materials.

The emission colors (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; values from 550 to 880&#8197;nm) and intensities (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; reaching 0.75) are defined by the composition and substitution geometry of the central conjugated chromophore motif, and the anion-&#960; interactions. Time-resolved and variable-temperature luminescence studies suggest phosphorescence for all the titled compounds, which demonstrate observed lifetimes of 0.46&#8211;92.23&#8197;&#956;s at 297&#8197;K. Radiative rate constants &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; as high as 2.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; deduced for salts &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; were assigned to strong spin-orbit coupling enhanced by an external heavy atom effect arising from the anion-&#960; charge-transfer character of the triplet excited state. These rates of anomalously fast metal-free phosphorescence are comparable to those of transition metal complexes and organic luminophores that utilize triplet excitons via a thermally activated delayed fluorescence mechanism, making such ionic luminophores a new paradigm for the design of photofunctional and responsive molecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Spatial Charge Separation in a Niobium and Tantalum Nitride Core&#8208;Shell Photoanode: In Situ Interface Bonding for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electron/hole separation and collection has been achieved by in situ interface bonding of an ultrathin high&#8208;crystallinity Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell and conductive NbNx nanorod core. The photoanode attains a photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V RHE with a Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) has emerged as a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the inefficient electron&#8208;hole separation remains a bottleneck that impedes its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a core&#8211;shell nanoarray photoanode of NbNx&#8208;nanorod@Ta3N5 ultrathin layer enhances light harvesting and forms a spatial charge&#8208;transfer channel, which leads to the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. Consequently, an impressive photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE is obtained with an ultrathin Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm, accompanied by excellent stability and a low onset potential (0.46&#8197;VRHE). Mechanistic studies reveal the enhanced performance is attributed to the high&#8208;conductivity NbNx core, high&#8208;crystalline Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell, and the intimate Ta&#8722;N&#8722;Nb interface bonds, which accelerate the charge&#8208;separation capability of the core&#8211;shell photoanode. This study demonstrates the key roles of nanostructure design in improving the efficiency of PEC devices.

         <title>Bilayer&#8208;Coating Strategy for Hydrophobic Nanoparticles Providing Colloidal Stability, Functionality, and Surface Protection in Biological Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the surface of oleate&#8208;coated hydrophobic particles to render them stable in aqueous biological environments is often challenging. We present a one&#8208;step reaction, to form a bilayer consisting of oleate and dodecylamine moieties, which provides excellent stability and versatility as it allows further functionalization via carbodiimide chemistry.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of nanoparticles is a key step on the pathway from particle design towards applications in biologically relevant environments. Here, a bilayer&#8208;based strategy for the surface modification of hydrophobic nanoparticles is introduced that leads to excellent colloidal stability in aqueous environments and good protection against disintegration, while permitting surface functionalization via simple carbodiimide chemistry. We have demonstrated the excellent potential of this strategy using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), initially coated with oleate and therefore dispersible only in organic solvents. The hydrophobic oleate capping is maintained and a bilayer is formed upon addition of excess oleate. The bilayer approach renders protection towards luminescence loss by water quenching, while the incorporation of additional molecules containing amino functions yields colloidal stability and facilitates the introduction of functionality. The biological relevance of the approach was confirmed with the use of two model dyes, a photosensitizer and a nitric oxide (NO) probe that, when attached to the surface of the UCNPs, retained their functionality to produce singlet oxygen and detect intracellular NO, respectively. We present a simple and fast strategy to protect and functionalize inorganic nanoparticles in biological media, which is important for controlled surface engineering of nanosized materials for theranostic applications.

         <title>Crystal Structure and NMR of an &#945;,&#948;&#8208;Peptide Foldamer Helix Shows Side&#8208;Chains are Well Placed for Bifunctional Catalysis: Application as a Minimalist Aldolase Mimic

         <dc:description>
A new catalytic foldamer constructed of &#945;&#8208; and bespoke &#948;&#8208;residues forms a helix which is not only stabilized by intramolecular H&#8208;bonds, but also by apolar interactions not observed in foldamer secondary structures until now. The resulting scaffold gives a useful juxtaposition of functionality and leads to bifunctional catalysis as demonstrated through an aldolase&#8208;like process.







Abstract
We report the first NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) structures of an unusual 13/11&#8208;helix (alternating i,&#8201;i+1 {NH&#8722;O=C} and i,&#8201;i+3 {C=O&#8722;H&#8722;N} H&#8208;bonds) formed by a heteromeric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 sequence of &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;amino acids, and demonstrate the application of this framework towards catalysis. Whilst intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) are the clear driver of helix formation in this system, we also observe an apolar interaction between the ethyl residue of one &#948;&#8208;amino acid and the cyclohexyl group of the next &#948;&#8208;residue in the sequence that seems to stabilize one type of helix over another. To the best of our knowledge this type of additional stabilization leading to a specific helical preference has not been observed before. Critically, the helix type realized places the &#945;&#8208;residue functionalities in positions proximal enough to engage in bifunctional catalysis as demonstrated in the application of our system as a minimalist aldolase mimic.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Kernelled AgCu Nanoclusters with Golden Ratio Geometry and Promising Photothermal Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver copper nanocluster with a golden ratio pentangle structure is prepared. It shows promising photothermal conversion. It is a novel alloy nanocluster with a sandwich&#8208;like kernel (diameter&#8776;0.9&#8197;nm and length&#8776;0.25&#8197;nm), and gives insight into the relationship between structure and photothermal properties.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters have recently attracted extensive interest from the scientific community. However, unlike carbon&#8208;based materials and metal nanocrystals, they rarely exhibit a sheet kernel structure, probably owing to the instability caused by the high exposure of metal atoms (particularly in the relatively less noble Ag or Cu nanoclusters) in such a structure. Herein, we synthesized a novel AgCu nanocluster with a sandwich&#8208;like kernel (diameter&#8776;0.9&#8197;nm and length&#8776;0.25&#8197;nm) by introducing the furfuryl mercaptan ligand (FUR) and the alloying strategy. Interestingly, the kernel consists of a centered silver atom and two planar Ag10 pentacle units with completely mirrored symmetry after a rotation of 36 degrees. The two Ag10 pentacles and some extended structures show an unreported golden ratio geometry, and the two inner five&#8208;membered rings and the centered Ag atom form an unanticipated full&#8208;metal ferrocene&#8208;like structure. The featured kernel structure causes the dominant radial direction transition of excitation electrons, as determined via time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which affords the protruding absorption at 612&#8197;nm and contributes to the promising photothermal conversion efficiency of 67.6&#8201;% of the as&#8208;obtained nanocluster, having important implications for structure&#8208;property correlation and the development of nanocluser&#8208;based photothermal materials.

The featured kernel structure causes the dominant radial direction transition of excitation electrons, as determined via time-dependent density functional theory calculations, which affords the protruding absorption at 612&#8197;nm and contributes to the promising photothermal conversion efficiency of 67.6&#8201;% of the as-obtained nanocluster, having important implications for structure-property correlation and the development of nanocluser-based photothermal materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Platinum Hybrids for Covalent Binding of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Structural Basis and Application to Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

A novel class of G4&#8208;targeting organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, designed to covalently bind to the G4 binding site, could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway, induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and stimulate potent immunotherapy in vivo. This study highlights the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent binding in G4&#8208;targeting drug design.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been revived as promising therapeutic targets with the development of immunotherapy, but the G4&#8208;mediated immune response remains unclear. We designed a novel class of G4&#8208;binding organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, with spatial matching for G4 binding and G4 DNA reactivity for binding site locking. The solution structure of L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;MYT1L G4 demonstrated the effectiveness of the covalent binding and revealed the covalent binding&#8208;guided dynamic balance, accompanied by the destruction of the A5&#8208;T17 base pairs to achieve the covalent binding of the platinum unit to N7 of the G6 residue. Furthermore, L1&#8208;cispt&#8208; and L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;mediated genomic dysfunction could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). The use of L1&#8208;cispt/L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;treated dying cells as therapeutic vaccines stimulated a robust immune response and effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent locking in G4&#8208;trageting drug design and their potential in immunotherapy.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Polycondensation for Bio&#8208;based Adaptable and Degradable Phenolic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lignin and synthetic phenolic polymers are difficult to degrade and reprocess. Through thiol&#8208;aldehyde polycondensation, degradable and reprocessable phenolic polymers with tensile strength up to 64&#8197;MPa were prepared from bioderived phenolic compounds. The developed method is promising for facile preparation of macromolecular antioxidants and dynamic networks.







Abstract
Designing sustainable materials with tunable mechanical properties, intrinsic degradability, and recyclability from renewable biomass through a mild process has become vital in polymer science. Traditional phenolic resins are generally considered to be not degradable or recyclable. Here we report the design and synthesis of linear and network structured phenolic polymers using facile polycondensation between natural aldehyde&#8208;bearing phenolic compounds and polymercaptans. Linear phenolic products are amorphous with Tg between &#8722;9&#8201;&#176;C and 12&#8201;&#176;C. Cross&#8208;linked networks from vanillin and its di&#8208;aldehyde derivative exhibited excellent mechanical strength between 6&#8211;64&#8197;MPa. The connecting dithioacetals are associatively adaptable strong bonds and susceptible to degradation in oxidative conditions to regenerate vanillin. These results highlight the potential of biobased sustainable phenolic polymers with recyclability and selective degradation, as a complement to the traditional phenol&#8208;formaldehyde resins.

         <title>Infrared Multiphoton Dissociation Enables Top&#8208;Down Characterization of Membrane Protein Complexes and G Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Top&#8208;down mass spectrometry using infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) of native membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) provides good sequence coverage from native protein ions. We observe successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids, specifically within transmembrane helices, enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are challenging to analyze by native mass spectrometry (MS) as their hydrophobic nature typically requires stabilization in detergent micelles that are removed prior to analysis via collisional activation. There is however a practical limit to the amount of energy which can be applied, which often precludes subsequent characterization by top&#8208;down MS. To overcome this barrier, we have applied a modified Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer coupled to an infrared laser within a high&#8208;pressure linear ion trap. We show how tuning the intensity and time of incident photons enables liberation of membrane proteins from detergent micelles. Specifically, we relate the ease of micelle removal to the infrared absorption of detergents in both condensed and gas phases. Top&#8208;down MS via infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), results in good sequence coverage enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes. By contrasting and comparing the fragmentation patterns of the ammonia channel with two class A GPCRs, we identify successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids within transmembrane domains. Using gas&#8208;phase molecular dynamics simulations, we show that areas prone to fragmentation maintain aspects of protein structure at increasing temperatures. Altogether, we propose a rationale to explain why and where in the protein fragment ions are generated.

         <title>Highly Cooperative CO2 Adsorption via a Cation Crowding Mechanism on a Cesium&#8208;Exchanged Phillipsite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cooperative CO2 adsorption on a flexible cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite, a channel&#8208;based small&#8208;pore zeolite, is operated by an unprecedented adsorption phenomenon: structural breathing (the narrow&#8208;to&#8208;wide pore) is associated with the crowding and dispersal of large Cs+ ions, depending on the CO2 pressure, termed the &#8216;cation crowding&#8217; mechanism.







Abstract
An understanding of the CO2 adsorption mechanisms on small&#8208;pore zeolites is of practical importance in the development of more efficient adsorbents for the separation of CO2 from N2 or CH4. Here we report that the CO2 isotherms at 25&#8211;75&#8201;&#176;C on cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 2.5 (Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5) are characterized by a rectilinear step shape: limited uptake at low CO2 pressure (PCO2) is followed by highly cooperative uptake at a critical pressure, above which adsorption rapidly approaches capacity (2.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1). Structural analysis reveals that this isotherm behavior is attributed to the high concentration and large size of Cs+ ions in dehydrated Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5. This results in Cs+ cation crowding and subsequent dispersal at a critical loading of CO2, which allows the PHI framework to relax to its wide pore form and enables its pores to fill with CO2 over a very narrow range of PCO2. Such a highly cooperative phenomenon has not been observed for other zeolites.

         <title>Pathway Control of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Supramolecular Polymers by Incorporating Donor&#8208;Acceptor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor functionality has been incorporated into the &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomeric structure to program self&#8208;assembly pathways, directing the formation of parallel&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as metastable species and slip&#8208;stacked ones as the thermodynamically stable species.







Abstract
Controlling the nanoscale orientation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains challenging due to the complexity of multiple energy landscapes involved in the supramolecular assembly process. In this study, we have developed an effective strategy for programming the pathways of &#960;&#8208;conjugated supramolecular polymers, by incorporating both electron&#8208;rich methoxy&#8208; or methanthiol&#8208;benzene as donor unit and electron&#8208;poor cyano&#8208;vinylenes as acceptor units on the monomeric structure. It leads to the formation of parallel&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as the metastable species through homomeric donor/acceptor packing, which convert to slip&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as the thermodynamically stable species facilitated by heteromeric donor&#8208;acceptor packing. By further investigating the external seed&#8208;induced kinetic&#8208;to&#8208;thermodynamic transformation behaviors, our findings suggest that the donor&#8208;acceptor functionality on the seed structure is crucial for accelerating pathway conversion. This is achieved by eliminating the initial lag phase in the supramolecular polymerization process. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into designing molecular structures that control aggregation pathways of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Vinylogous Urethane Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed&#8208;loop recycling of vinylogous urethane vitrimers made from acetoacetate&#8208;terminated polyethyleneglycol and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine is presented. Treatment with water allows the selective and quantitative recovery of the monomers, even from mixed waste streams. The modular synthetic approach allows the synthesis of materials that cover a broad range of mechanical properties and that are easy to reprocess.







Abstract
Devising energy&#8208;efficient strategies for the depolymerization of plastics and the recovery of their structural components in high yield and purity is key to a circular plastics economy. Here, we report a case study in which we demonstrate that vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers synthesized from bis&#8208;polyethylene glycol acetoacetates (aPEG) and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine can be degraded by water at moderate temperature with almost quantitative recovery (&#8776;98&#8201;%) of aPEG. The rate of depolymerization can be controlled by the temperature, amount of water, molecular weight of aPEG, and composition of the starting material. These last two parameters also allow one to tailor the mechanical properties of the final materials, and this was used to access soft, tough, and brittle vitrimers, respectively. The straightforward preparation and depolymerization of the aPEG&#8208;based VU vitrimers are interesting elements for the design of polymer materials with enhanced closed&#8208;loop recycling characteristics.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Phosphido Catalysis: Enantioselective Addition of Phosphines to Cyclopropenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes that occurs at ambient temperature is reported. It proceeds through a copper&#8208;phosphido intermediate while various cyclopropylphosphines can now be accessed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) process. Experimental studies and DFT calculations provide mechanistic insight.







Abstract
We describe a copper catalyst that promotes the addition of phosphines to cyclopropenes at ambient temperature. A range of cyclopropylphosphines bearing different steric and electronic properties can now be accessed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DyKAT) process. A combined experimental and theoretical mechanistic study supports an elementary step featuring insertion of a CuI&#8208;phosphido into a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. Density functional theory calculations reveal migratory insertion as the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, followed by a syn&#8208;protodemetalation.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Cluster&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Framework for Polysulfide Conversion and Guest&#8211;Host Recognition in Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>

Polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF)&#8208;based battery separator as an ideal lightweight barrier (ca. 0.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was first directly involved in the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (Li&#8722;S) system to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect through supramolecularly recognizing polysulfide guests and then catalyzing their conversion while simultaneously accelerating Li+ ions diffusion.







Abstract
Developing polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF) still remains challenging due to an extremely difficult task in rationally interconnecting two dissimilar building blocks. Here we report an unprecedented POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF crystalline structure produced through the self&#8208;assembly process of a Krebs&#8208;type POM, [Zn2(WO2)2(SbW9O33)2]10&#8722;, and two &#946;&#8208;CD units. The as&#8208;prepared POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF&#8208;based battery separator can be applied as a lightweight barrier (approximately 0.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to mitigate the polysulfide shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The designed Li&#8722;S batteries equipped with the POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF modified separator exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, attributed to fast Li+ diffusion through the supramolecular channel of &#946;&#8208;CD, efficient polysulfide&#8208;capture ability by the dynamic host&#8211;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD, and improved sulfur redox kinetics by the bidirectional catalysis of POM cluster. This research provides a broad perspective for the development of multifunctional supramolecular POM frameworks and their applications in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>In Vivo Metabolic Imaging of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate&#8208;d3 Hyperpolarized By Reversible Exchange With Parahydrogen
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast, low&#8208;cost parahydrogen&#8208;hyperpolarization via Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) enables in vivo metabolic magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate the first in vivo application of SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 in a purified, aqueous solution with &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;%, obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering. This achievement paves the way for affordable and widespread metabolic imaging applications.







Abstract
Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate is becoming a non&#8208;invasive technique for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring response to treatment in cancer and other diseases. The clinically established method for producing HP pyruvate, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, however, is rather complex and slow. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;cost method based on fast chemical exchange. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate not only in vivo utility, but also metabolic MRI with SABRE. We present a novel routine to produce aqueous HP [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 for injection in 6&#8197;minutes. The injected solution was sterile, non&#8208;toxic, pH neutral and contained &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;% (residual 250&#8197;mM methanol and 20&#8197;&#956;M catalyst). It was obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering, which we detail in this manuscript. This achievement makes HP pyruvate MRI available to a wide biomedical community for fast metabolic imaging of living organisms.

We demonstrate the first in vivo application of SABRE-hyperpolarized [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate-d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a purified, aqueous solution with &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate-d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;%, obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering. This achievement paves the way for affordable and widespread metabolic imaging applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate is becoming a non-invasive technique for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring response to treatment in cancer and other diseases. The clinically established method for producing HP pyruvate, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, however, is rather complex and slow. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an ultra-fast and low-cost method based on fast chemical exchange. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate not only in vivo utility, but also metabolic MRI with SABRE. We present a novel routine to produce aqueous HP [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate-d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for injection in 6&#8197;minutes. The injected solution was sterile, non-toxic, pH neutral and contained &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]pyruvate-d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;% (residual 250&#8197;mM methanol and 20&#8197;&#956;M catalyst). It was obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering, which we detail in this manuscript. This achievement makes HP pyruvate MRI available to a wide biomedical community for fast metabolic imaging of living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Targeting Singlet Oxygen Battery for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Deep&#8208;Tissue Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeting CARG&#8208;1O2 was designed as a &#8220;singlet oxygen battery&#8221; for the efficient treatment of MRSA deep&#8208;tissue infections. CARG&#8208;Py was able to store singlet oxygen by pre&#8208;irradiation and produce singlet oxygen over a time course of approximately 30min. CARG&#8208;1O2 potently combats biofilm&#8208;associated infections and disrupts MRSA biofilms, and it exerted a beneficial therapeutic impact in a MRSA&#8208;induced model of pneumonia.







Abstract
Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is dependent on externally applied light and oxygen, and the depth of penetration of these factors can be insufficient for the treatment of deep infections. The short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also limit the antibacterial efficiency of PDT. Herein, we designed a targeting singlet oxygen delivery system, CARG&#8208;Py, for irradiation&#8208;free and oxygen&#8208;free PDT. This system was converted to the &#8220;singlet oxygen battery&#8221; CARG&#8208;1O2 and released singlet oxygen without external irradiation or oxygen. CARG&#8208;1O2 is composed of pyridones coupled to a targeting peptide that improves the utilization of singlet oxygen in deep multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections. CARG&#8208;1O2 was shown to damage DNA, protein, and membranes by increasing the level of reactive oxygen inside bacteria; the attacking of multiple biomolecular sites caused the death of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An in vivo study in a MRSA&#8208;infected mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated the potential of CARG&#8208;1O2 for the efficient treatment of deep infections. This work provides a new strategy to improve traditional PDT for irradiation&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;free treatment of deep infections while improving convenience of PDT.

         <title>Atomically Precise Copper Nanoclusters for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 towards Hydrocarbons via Breaking the Coordination Symmetry of Cu Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the coordination symmetry of Cu site in atomically precise Cu6 cluster forms Cu&#8208;S2N1 site, which rank the dx2&#8208;y2 orbital as the highest occupied d orbital to favor the specific coordination between C atom of CO2 and Cu&#8722;S2N1 site. This binding mode is conductive to the generation of *COOH instead of *OCHO, thereby switching the product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons.







Abstract
We propose an effective highest occupied d&#8208;orbital modulation strategy engendered by breaking the coordination symmetry of sites in the atomically precise Cu nanocluster (NC) to switch the product of CO2 electroreduction from HCOOH/CO to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons. An atomically well&#8208;defined Cu6 NC with symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 active sites (named Cu6(MBD)6, MBD=2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole) was designed and synthesized by a judicious choice of ligand containing both S and N coordination atoms. Different from the previously reported high HCOOH selectivity of Cu NCs with Cu&#8722;S3 sites, the Cu6(MBD)6 with Cu&#8722;S2N1 coordination structure shows a high Faradaic efficiency toward hydrocarbons of 65.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (including 42.5&#8201;% CH4 and 23&#8201;% C2H4), with the hydrocarbons partial current density of &#8722;183.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 sites can rearrange the Cu 3d orbitals with 
 as the highest occupied d&#8208;orbital, thus favoring the generation of key intermediate *COOH instead of *OCHO to favor *CO formation, followed by hydrogenation and/or C&#8722;C coupling to produce hydrocarbons. This is the first attempt to regulate the coordination mode of Cu atom in Cu NCs for hydrocarbons generation, and provides new inspiration for designing atomically precise NCs for efficient CO2RR towards highly&#8208;valued products.

         <title>Nonclassical Crystallization Causes Dendritic and Band&#8208;Like Microscale Patterns in Inorganic Precipitates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic experiments yield compositionally pure Ni(OH)2 membranes that show internal microscale structures such as parallel bands, dendritic trees, and disorganized spots. These light&#8208;scattering patterns result from nonclassical crystallization and nanoparticle aggregation. The particles form in the flowing NiCl2 solution and self&#8208;organize aggregation zones&#8212;that for band patterns&#8212;move over the membrane surface in the upstream direction.







Abstract
The self&#8208;organization of complex solids can create patterns extending hierarchically from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. A frequently studied model is the chemical garden system which consists of life&#8208;like precipitate shapes. In this study, we examine the thin walls of chemical gardens using microfluidic devices that yield linear Ni(OH)2 precipitate membranes. We observe distinct light&#8208;scattering patterns within the compositionally pure membranes, including disorganized spots, dendrites, and parallel bands. The bands are tilted with respect to the membrane axis and their spacing (20&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;m) increases with increasing flow rates. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the bands consist of submicron particles embedded in a denser material and these particles are also found in the reactant stream. We propose that dendrites and bands arise from the attachment of solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles. The bands are generated by particle&#8208;aggregation zones moving upstream along the slowly advancing membrane surface. The speed of the aggregation zones is proportional to the band distance and defines the system's dispersion relation. This speed&#8208;wavelength dependence and the flow&#8208;opposing motion of the aggregation zones are likely caused by low particle concentrations in the wake of the zones that only slowly recover due to Brownian motion and particle nucleation.

         <title>Defluorinative Multi&#8208;Functionalization of Fluoroaryl Sulfoxides Enabled by Fluorine&#8208;Assisted Temporary Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential reactivities of fluoroaryl sulfoxides have been unlocked by precisely constructing and elaborating their temporarily dearomatized intermediates via a robust [5,5]&#8208;sulfonium&#8208;rearrangement&#8208;triggered dearomatization/rearomatization process. Impressively, fluorine has shown its irreplaceable role for the success of the reaction.







Abstract
Owing to its unique physical properties, fluorine is often used to open up new reaction channels. In this report, we establish a cooperation of [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement and fluorine&#8208;assisted temporary dearomatization for arene multi&#8208;functionalization. Specifically, the [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement of fluoroaryl sulfoxides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles generates an intriguing dearomatized sulfonium species which is short&#8208;lived but exhibits unusually high electrophilicity and thus can be instantly trapped by nucleophiles and dienes at a remarkably low temperature (&#8722;95&#8201;&#176;C) to produce four types of valuable multi&#8208;functionalized benzenes, respectively, involving appealing processes of defluorination, desulfurization, and sulfur shift. Mechanistic studies indicate that the use of fluorine on arenes not only circumvents the generally inevitable [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement but also impedes the undesired rearomatization process, thus provides a precious space for constructing and elaborating the temporarily dearomatized fluorinated sulfonium species.

&lt;p&gt;The potential reactivities of fluoroaryl sulfoxides have been unlocked by precisely constructing and elaborating their temporarily dearomatized intermediates via a robust [5,5]-sulfonium-rearrangement-triggered dearomatization/rearomatization process. Impressively, fluorine has shown its irreplaceable role for the success of the reaction.

         <title>A Generic Platform for Upcycling Polystyrene to Aryl Ketones and Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochemical degradation utilizing AlCl3 recovers benzene from polystyrene in quantitative yields. The subsequent addition of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chlorides to the same reactor produces aryl ketones and sulfides in moderate to high yields. The one&#8208;pot cascade degradation&#8211;upcycling reactions present an effective strategy for converting polystyrene to valuable chemicals, including benzophenone, acetophenone, and diphenyl sulfide.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) is one of the least recycled large&#8208;volume commodity plastics due to bulkiness of foam products and associated contaminants. PS recycling is also severely hampered by the lack of financial incentive, limited versatility, and poor selectivity of existing methods. To this end, herein we report a thermochemical recycling strategy of &#8220;degradation&#8208;upcycling&#8221; to synthesize a library of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals from PS wastes with high versatility and selectivity. Two cascade reactions are selected to first degrade PS to benzene under mild temperatures, followed by the derivatization thereof utilizing a variety of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chloride additives. To demonstrate the versatility, nine ketones and sulfides of cosmetic and pharmaceutical relevance were prepared, including propiophenone, benzophenone, and diphenyl sulfide. The approach is also amenable to sophisticated upcycling reaction designs and can produce desired products stepwise. The facile and versatile approach will provide a scalable and profitable methodology for upcycling PS waste into value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Type&#8208;II Red Phosphorus: Wavy Packing of Twisted Pentagonal Tubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of type&#8208;II red phosphorus is investigated by various structural characterizations, including 3D electron diffraction, atomic&#8208;resolution STEM imaging, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. A triclinic unit cell with a large volume containing around 250 phosphorus atoms is identified via 3D electron diffraction. The twisted wavy tubular motif, a new variation of building blocks in phosphorus, is also revealed via STEM.







Abstract
Elemental phosphorus exhibits fascinating structural varieties and versatile properties. The unique nature of phosphorus bonds can lead to the formation of extremely complex structures, and detailed structural information on some phosphorus polymorphs is yet to be investigated. In this study, we investigated an unidentified crystalline phase of phosphorus, type&#8208;II red phosphorus (RP), by combining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural characterization techniques. Electron diffraction tomography, atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy were concurrently used to elucidate the hidden structural motifs and their packing in type&#8208;II RP. Electron diffraction tomography, performed using individual crystalline nanowires, was used to identify a triclinic unit cell with volume of 5330&#8197;&#197;3, which is the largest unit cell for elemental phosphorus crystals up to now and contains approximately 250 phosphorus atoms. Atomic&#8208;resolution STEM imaging, which was performed along different crystal&#8208;zone axes, confirmed that the twisted wavy tubular motif is the basic building block of type&#8208;II RP. Our study discovered and presented a new variation of building blocks in phosphorus, and it provides insights to clarify the complexities observed in phosphorus as well as other relevant systems.

         <title>MET&#8208;Activating Ubiquitin Multimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomeric small protein ligands, referred to as U&#8208;body constructs, were developed from ubiquitin and macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores via genetic implantation (lasso&#8208;grafting) and spacer optimization, showing antagonist or &#8220;enhancer&#8221; activity for a receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Subsequently, multimeric U&#8208;body&#8208;based proteins, U&#8208;bodies, were constructed, exhibiting potent agonist activity for MET.







Abstract
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U&#8208;bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET and are derived from MET&#8208;binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U&#8208;body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso&#8208;grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U&#8208;body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U&#8208;body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF&#8208;induced MET&#8208;phosphorylation. Their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U&#8208;bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation&#8208;promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso&#8208;grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein&#8208;based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.

         <title>[2+2+1+1] Cycloaddition for de novo Synthesis of Densely Functionalized Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized phenols can be easily obtained through formal [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of two different alkynes and two molecules of CO. The new benzannulation strategy allows efficient regioselective installation of up to five different substituents on a phenol ring. The resulting phenols have a substitution pattern different from and complementary to those obtained from D&#246;tz and Danheiser benzannulations.







Abstract
A unique benzannulation strategy for regioselective de novo synthesis of densely functionalized phenols is described. Through metal&#8208;mediated formal [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of two different alkynes and two molecules of CO, a series of densely functionalized phenols were obtained. The benzannulation strategy allows efficient regioselective installation up to five different substituents on a phenol ring. The resulting phenols have a substitution pattern different from those obtained from D&#246;tz and Danheiser benzannulations.

         <title>Cooperative Lewis Acid&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium&#8208;Aryloxide Catalysis: Pyrazolone Addition to Nitroolefins as Entry to Diaminoamides</title>

Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. A polyfunctional CuII&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8208;aryloxide catalyst which enables their addition to nitroolefins with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol is presented. DFT studies show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The products were used to form bioactive compounds, pyrazolidinones and &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides.







Abstract
Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Their asymmetric synthesis is thus widely studied. Still, a generally highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition to nitroolefins providing products with adjacent stereocenters is elusive. In this article, a new polyfunctional CuII&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8208;aryloxide catalyst is presented which enables this reaction type with high stereocontrol. DFT studies revealed that the triazolium stabilizes the transition state by hydrogen bonding between C(5)&#8722;H and the nitroolefin and verify a cooperative mode of activation. Moreover, they show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage/pore structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, by which stereocontrol is achieved. Control catalyst systems confirm the crucial role of the triazolium, aryloxide and CuII, requiring a sophisticated structural orchestration for high efficiency. The addition products were used to form pyrazolidinones by chemoselective C=N reduction. These heterocycles are shown to be valuable precursors toward &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides by chemoselective nitro and N&#8722;N bond reductions. Morphological profiling using the Cell painting assay identified biological activities for the pyrazolidinones and suggest modulation of DNA synthesis as a potential mode of action. One product showed biological similarity to Camptothecin, a lead structure for cancer therapy.

         <title>Redox Reorganization: Aluminium Promoted 1,5&#8208;Hydride Shifts Allow the Controlled Synthesis of Multisubstituted Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of multisubstituted cyclohexenes has been achieved from tetrahydropyrans (easily accessible via many synthetic approaches). The process operates via a tandem 1,5&#8208;hydride shift&#8211;aldol condensation mediated by simple aluminium reagents (e.g. Al2O3), enabling the synthesis of cyclohexenes (&gt;40 examples) bearing substituents at each position around the cyclohexene ring with high levels of chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of cyclohexenes has been achieved from easily accessible tetrahydropyrans via a tandem 1,5&#8208;hydride shift&#8211;aldol condensation. We discovered that readily available aluminium reagents, e.g. Al2O3 or Al(OtBu)3 are essential for this process, promoting the 1,5&#8208;hydride shift with complete regio&#8208; and enantiospecificity (in stark contrast to results obtained under basic conditions). The mild conditions, coupled with multiple methods available to access the tetrahydropyran starting materials makes this a versatile method with exceptional functional group tolerance. A wide range of cyclohexenes (&gt;40 examples) have been prepared, many in enantiopure form, showing our ability to selectively install a substituent at each position around the newly forged cyclohexene ring. Experimental and computational studies revealed that aluminium serves a dual role in facilitating the hydride shift, activating both the alkoxide nucleophile and the electrophilic carbonyl group.

         <title>Cooperative Network Formation via Two&#8208;Colour Light&#8208;Activated &#955;&#8208;Orthogonal Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterotelechelic dilinker enables the generation of a polymer network exclusively via dual&#8208;colour irradiation. In contrast, single&#8208;colour irradiation results in polymer functionalization.







Abstract
Independently addressing photoreactive sites within one molecule with two colours of light is a formidable challenge. Here, we combine two sequence independent &#955;&#8208;orthogonal chromophores in one heterotelechelic dilinker molecule, to exploit their disparate reactivity utilizing the same reaction partner, a maleimide&#8208;containing polymer. We demonstrate that polymer network formation only proceeds if two colours of light are employed. Upon single colour irradiation, linker&#8208;decorated post&#8208;functionalized polymers are generated at either wavelength and in either sequence. Network formation, however, is only achieved by sequential or simultaneous two colour irradiation. The herein introduced photoreactive system demonstrates the power of wavelength orthogonal chemistry in macromolecular synthesis.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2 Electrolysis to Formic Acid over a Wide Potential Window: An Electrocatalyst Comprised of Indium Nanoparticles on Chitosan&#8208;Derived Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium nanoparticles on chitosan&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped defective graphene (In/N&#8208;dG) create bifunctional active centers that integrate chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic capabilities for CO2 electrolysis. The electrocatalyst demonstrated outstanding performance for the CO2 reduction reaction with a nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward HCOOH across a wide potential window and with high current density.







Abstract
Realizing industrial&#8208;scale production of HCOOH from the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is very important, but the current density as well as the electrochemical potential window are still limited to date. Herein, we achieved this by integration of chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic capabilities for the CO2RR via anchoring In nanoparticles (NPs) on biomass&#8208;derived substrates to create In/X&#8722;C (X=N, P, B) bifunctional active centers. The In NPs/chitosan&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped defective graphene (In/N&#8208;dG) catalyst had outstanding performance for the CO2RR with a nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH across a wide potential window. Particularly, at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 high current density, the FE of HCOOH was as high as 96.0&#8201;%, and the reduction potential was as low as &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs RHE. When using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), a pure HCOOH solution could be obtained at the cathode without further separation and purification. The FE of HCOOH was still up to 93.3&#8201;% at 0.52&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the HCOOH production rate could reach 9.051&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our results suggested that the defects and multilayer structure in In/N&#8208;dG could not only enhance CO2 chemical adsorption capability, but also trigger the formation of an electron&#8208;rich catalytic environment around In sites to promote the generation of HCOOH.

         <title>Nucleophilic Attack at Pentaarsaferrocene [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)]&#8212;The Way to Larger Polyarsenide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective way for the nucleophilic substitution of the cyclo&#8208;As5 ligand in [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) was found, resulting in first As5R entities. By the reduction of I, an access to the dianionic compound [(Cp*Fe)2{&#956;&#8208;&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;As10}]2&#8722; (4), and by using As&#8208;based nucleophiles, the straightforward formation of tetramers representing the largest polyarsenide&#8208;containing (As20) molecular complexes could be achieved.







Abstract
By the reaction of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp*=C5Me5) with main group nucleophiles, unique functionalized products with &#951;4&#8208;coordinated polyarsenide (Asn) units (n=5, 6, 20) are obtained. With carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles such as MeLi or KBn (Bn=CH2Ph), the anionic organo&#8208;substituted polyarsenide complexes, [Li(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As5Me)] (1&#8201;a) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe{&#951;4&#8208;As5(CH2Ph)}] (1&#8201;b), are accessible. The use of KAsPh2 leads to a selective and controlled extension of the As5 unit and the formation of the monoanionic compound [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6Ph2)] (2). When I is reacted with [M]As(SiMe3)2 (M=Li&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF; K), the formation of the largest known anionic polyarsenide unit in [M&#8242;(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(Cp*Fe)4{&#956;5&#8208;&#951;4:&#951;4:&#951;3:&#951;3:&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;As20}] (3) occurred (M&#8242;=Li (3&#8201;a), K (3&#8201;b)).

&lt;p&gt;A selective way for the nucleophilic substitution of the &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-As&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand in [Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-As&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) was found, resulting in first As&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;R entities.

         <title>Relaxing Wrinkles in Jammed Interfacial Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autonomous stress&#8208;relaxation by dynamic jammed assemblies of nanoparticles and lipids at the interface was demonstrated. Such a lipid&#8208;based self&#8208;relaxing system may find applications in soft robots, medical and materials applications.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent bonding has emerged as a mean by which stresses in a network can be relaxed. Here, the strength of the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles at the interface between two immiscible liquids affect the same results in jammed assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants. Beyond a critical degree of overcrowding induced by the compression of jammed interfacial assemblies, the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles (NPs) can be broken, resulting in a desorption of the NPs from the interface. This reduces the areal density of nanoparticle surfactants at the interface, allowing the assemblies to relax, not to a fluid state but rather another jammed state. The relaxation of the wrinkles caused by the compression reflects the tendency of these assemblies to eliminate areas of high curvature, favoring a more planar geometry. This enabled the generation of giant vesicular and multivesicular structures from these assemblies.

         <title>Gallium Triggers Ferroptosis through a Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga&#8208;1 anchors to mitochondria by binding to the membrane phospholipids and results in the dysfunction of the electron transfer chain as well as iron release, eventually triggering ferroptosis. In addition, Ga&#8208;1 inhibits protein disulfide isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum, breaking the antioxidant glutathione system. Both actions synergistically induce ferroptosis. In addition, exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid enhances ferroptosis.







Abstract
The gallium ion (Ga3+) has long been believed to disrupt ferric homeostasis in the body by competing with iron cofactors in metalloproteins, ultimately leading to cell death. This study revealed that through an indirect pathway, gallium can trigger ferroptosis, a type of non&#8208;apoptotic cell death regulated by iron. This is exemplified by the gallium complex of the salen ligand (Ga&#8208;1); we found that Ga&#8208;1 acts as an effective anion transporter that can affect the pH gradient and change membrane permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of ferrous iron from the electron transfer chain (ETC). In addition, Ga&#8208;1 also targeted protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, preventing the repair of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system and thus enforcing ferroptosis. Finally, a combination treatment of Ga&#8208;1 and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which enhances lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, showed a synergistic therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo. This study provided us with a strategy to synergistically induce Ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby enhancing the anti&#8208;neoplastic effect.

         <title>Atomic Insights into Synergistic Nitroarene Hydrogenation over Nanodiamond&#8208;Supported Pt1&#8722;Fe1 Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method was developed for Pt1&#8722;Fe1/nanodiamond dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst construction. Synergistic chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes was achieved, whereby hydrogen is activated on the Pt1&#8722;Fe1 dual site and nitro group is preferentially adsorbed at the Fe1 site. The activation energy is decreased, resulting in an appreciable catalytic performance (3.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency, ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, and a scope of 24 substrates).







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts is of extreme significance in heterogeneous catalysis, but a great challenge lies in the precise construction of uniform dual&#8208;metal sites. Here, we develop a novel method for constructing Pt1&#8722;Fe1/ND dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, by anchoring Pt single atoms on Fe1&#8722;N4 sites decorating a nanodiamond (ND) surface. Using this catalyst, the synergy of nitroarenes selective hydrogenation is revealed. In detail, hydrogen is activated on the Pt1&#8722;Fe1 dual site and the nitro group is strongly adsorbed on the Fe1 site via a vertical configuration for subsequent hydrogenation. Such synergistic effect decreases the activation energy and results in an unprecedented catalytic performance (3.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency, ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, 24 types of substrates). Our findings advance the applications of dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts in selective hydrogenations and open up a new way to explore the nature of synergistic catalysis at the atomic level.

The chiral hybrid antimony halides R&#8208;/S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 have excitation&#8208;dependent emission originating from the synergistic effects of ligand and self&#8208;trapped excitons, and exhibit reversible structural transformation between non&#8208;emissive R&#8208;/S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF upon exposure to DMF and heat. CPL switch, chiral optical logic gate and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications have been investigated based on the multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials are ideal for information anti&#8208;countering applications, but the best&#8208;performing materials have not yet been identified. This work presents enantiomorphic hybrid antimony halides R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (1) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (2) showing mirror&#8208;imaged CPL activity with a dissymmetry factor of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;3. Interestingly, the DMF&#8208;induced structural transformation is realized to obtain non&#8208;emissive R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (3) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (4) upon exposure to DMF vapor. The transformation process is reversed upon heating. DFT calculations showed that the DMF&#8208;induced&#8208;quenched&#8208;luminescence is attributed to the intersection of the ground and excited state curves on the configuration coordinates. Unexpectedly, the nanocrystals of the chiral antimony halides 1 and 2 were prepared and indicate the excellent solution process performance. The reversible PL and CPL switching gives the system applications in information technology, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption&#8208;decryption, and logic gates.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Units as Photocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Co&#8208;Por&#8208;COFs) were prepared with different donor building units. Their photophysical studies indicated that the Co&#8208;Por&#8208;COFs with higher charge&#8208;carrier density and longer conjugation length led to a more efficient charge separation with a reduced exciton binding energy, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction into CO.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a promising platform for photocatalysts. Their crystalline porous nature allows comprehensive mechanistic studies of photocatalysis, which have revealed that their general photophysical parameters, such as light absorption ability, electronic band structure, and charge separation efficiency, can be conveniently tailored by structural modifications. However, further understanding of the relationship between structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity is required from the viewpoint of charge&#8208;carrier transport, because the charge&#8208;carrier property is closely related to alleviation of the excitonic effect. In the present study, COFs composed of a fixed cobalt (Co) porphyrin (Por) centered tetraamine as an acceptor unit with differently conjugated di&#8208;carbaldehyde based donor units, such as benzodithiophene (BDT), thienothiophene (TT), or phenyl (TA), were synthesized to form Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT, Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT, or Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity for reducing carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide was in the order of Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT&gt;Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT&gt;Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA. The results indicated that the excitonic effect, associated with their charge&#8208;carrier densities and &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, was a significant factor in photocatalysis performance.

         <title>Trimming Crystallizable Fragment (Fc) Glycans Enables the Direct Enzymatic Transfer of Biomacromolecules to Antibodies as Therapeutics
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the complexity of crystallizable fragment glycans dramatically increased the efficiency of the conjugation of large payloads to antibodies via fucosyltransferase&#8208;mediated unnatural fucosylation. An anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and anti&#8208;cluster of differentiation 3 bispecific antibody was synthesized which enabled the recruitment and activation of endogenous cytolytic T lymphocyte cells for tumor killing within organoids.







Abstract
Glycoengineering has provided powerful tools to construct site&#8208;specific antibody conjugates. However, only small&#8208;molecule payloads can be directly transferred to native or engineered antibodies using existing glycoengineering strategies. Herein, we demonstrate that reducing the complexity of crystallizable fragment (Fc) glycans could dramatically boost the chemoenzymatic modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) via an engineered fucosyltransferase. In this platform, antibodies with Fc glycans engineered to a simple N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) disaccharide are successfully conjugated to biomacromolecules, such as oligonucleotides and nanobodies, in a single step within hours. Accordingly, we synthesized an antibody&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) bispecific antibody and used it to selectively destroy patient&#8208;derived cancer organoids by reactivating endogenous T lymphocyte cells (T cells) inside the organoid. Our results highlight that this platform is a general approach to construct antibody&#8208;biomacromolecule conjugates with translational values.

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics from Metallacages for Mimicking Light&#8208;Harvesting Antenna</title>

A series of covalent organic cages with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized metallacages. These covalent cages performed well as energy donors for the construction of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems for the photocatalytic dehalogenation reaction.







Abstract
A series of covalent organic cages built from fluorophores capable of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized M2(LA)3(LB)2&#8208;type metallacages, simultaneously taking advantage of the synthetic accessibility and well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of metallacages, the good chemical stability of the covalent cages as well as the bright emission of AIE fluorophores. Moreover, the covalent cages could be further post&#8208;synthetically modified into an amide&#8208;functionalized cage with a higher quantum yield. Furthermore, these presented covalent cages proved to be good energy donors and were used to construct light&#8208;harvesting systems employing Nile Red as an energy acceptor. These light&#8208;harvesting systems displayed efficient energy transfer and relatively high antenna effect, which enabled their use as efficient photocatalysts for a dehalogenation reaction. This research provides a new avenue for the development of luminescent covalent cages for light&#8208;harvesting and photocatalysis.

         <title>Eliminating Concentration Polarization with Cationic Covalent Organic Polymer to Promote Effective Overpotential of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle the concentration polarization and drive the equilibrium of the nitrogen reduction reaction in the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a 24&#8208;fold improvement generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction offers a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is currently restricted by low effective overpotential due to the concentration polarization, which arises from accumulated products, ammonium, at the reaction interface. Here, a novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle this challenge.

&lt;p&gt;A novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle the concentration polarization and drive the equilibrium of the nitrogen reduction reaction in the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a 24-fold improvement generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction offers a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber-Bosch process. However, it is currently restricted by low effective overpotential due to the concentration polarization, which arises from accumulated products, ammonium, at the reaction interface. Here, a novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle this challenge. The whole network exhibits strong positive charge and effectively repels the positively charged ammonium, enabling an ultra-low interfacial product concentration, and successfully driving the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a continuous high-level reaction rate. As expected, when this tailored microenvironment is coupled with a transition metal-based catalyst, a 24-fold improvement is generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%) as compared with the bare one. The proposed strategy underscores the importance of optimizing dynamic processes as a means of improving overall performance in electrochemical syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unidirectional Sidechain Engineering to Construct Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Acceptors for 19.23&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Low Energy Loss and Efficient Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptor is developed using unidirectional sidechain engineering. Thanks to the low energy loss and efficient charge transfer properties, the corresponding organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest values among annealing&#8208;free devices.







Abstract
Achieving both high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) to boost power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) is a major challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs), wherein high energy loss (Eloss) and inefficient charge transfer usually take place. Here, three new Y&#8208;series acceptors of mono&#8208;asymmetric asy&#8208;YC11 and dual&#8208;asymmetric bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC9 and bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 are developed. They share the same asymmetric D1AD2 (D1=thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene and D2=selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) fused&#8208;core but have different unidirectional sidechain on D1 side, allowing fine&#8208;tuned molecular properties, such as intermolecular interaction, packing pattern, and crystallinity. Among the binary blends, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 one has better morphology with appropriate phase separation and higher order packing than the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;asy&#8208;YC9 and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC11 ones. Therefore, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs offer a higher PCE of 17.16&#8201;% with both high Voc and Jsc, due to the reduced Eloss and efficient charge transfer properties. Inspired by the high Voc and strong NIR&#8208;absorption, bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 is introduced into efficient binary PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO to construct ternary OSCs. Thanks to the broadened absorption, optimized morphology, and furtherly minimized Eloss, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs achieve a champion PCE of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among these annealing&#8208;free devices. Our developed unidirectional sidechain engineering for constructing bi&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptors provides an approach to boost PCE of OSCs.

         <title>Epoxy&#8208;rich Fe Single Atom Sites Boost Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe single atom catalysts with sulfur and epoxy groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions. The presence of sulfur and epoxy groups modulates the electronic structure of Fe centers, while the epoxy groups also participate in the reduction reaction through reversible cleavage, lowering the energy barrier by functioning as an anchor site for OH* intermediates.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for energy conversion and storage devices. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88&#8197;V), Fe single atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89&#8197;V) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The spectroscopic measurements reveal that the presence of sulfur group induces the formation of epoxy groups near the FeN4S2 centers, which not only modulate the electronic structure of Fe single atoms but also participate the catalytic process to improve the kinetics. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate&#8208;limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.

         <title>Discovery of Two&#8208;dimensional Hexagonal MBene HfBO and Exploration on its Potential for Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of DFT calculations and experiments were used to discover a large class of exfoliable h&#8208;MAB phases and their derivative h&#8208;MBenes. A representative 2D h&#8208;MBene, HfBO, was successfully synthesized by selectively etching the In layers from Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO was demonstrated to show lithium&#8208;ion storage performance for the first time.







Abstract
The practical applications of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal borides (MBenes) have been severely hindered by the lack of accessible MBenes because of the difficulties in the selective etching of traditional ternary MAB phases with orthorhombic symmetry (ort&#8208;MAB). Here, we discover a family of ternary hexagonal MAB (h&#8208;MAB) phases and 2D hexagonal MBenes (h&#8208;MBenes) by ab initio predictions and experiments. Calculations suggest that the ternary h&#8208;MAB phases are more suitable precursors for MBenes than the ort&#8208;MAB phases. Based on the prediction, we report the experimental synthesis of h&#8208;MBene HfBO by selective removal of In from h&#8208;MAB Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO delivered a specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, demonstrating the potential for energy&#8208;storage applications. The discovery of this h&#8208;MBene HfBO added a new member to the growing family of 2D materials and provided opportunities for a wide range of novel applications.

Abstract
This report unveils an advancement in the formation of a Lewis superacid (LSA) and an organic superbase by the geometrical deformation of an organoboron species towards a T&#8208;shaped geometry. The boron dication [2]2+ supported by an amido diphosphine pincer ligand features both a large fluoride ion affinity (FIA&gt;SbF5) and hydride ion affinity (HIA&gt;B(C6F5)3), which qualifies it as both a hard and soft LSA. The unusual Lewis acidic properties of [2]2+ are further showcased by its ability to abstract hydride and fluoride from Et3SiH and AgSbF6 respectively, and effectively catalyze the hydrodefluorination, defluorination/arylation, as well as reduction of carbonyl compounds. One and two&#8208;electron reduction of [2]2+ affords stable boron radical cation [2]&#8901;+ and borylene 2, respectively. The former species has an extremely high spin density of 0.798e at the boron atom, whereas the latter compound has been demonstrated to be a strong organic base (calcd. pKBH+ (MeCN)=47.4) by both theoretical and experimental assessment. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong ability of geometric constraining to empower the central boron atom.

         <title>Synergistic Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Active Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Cage for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stable CoII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages are efficient catalysts for photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 in pure water and O2 or air atmospheres. The metal&#8208;nonmetal active site operates synergistically during photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis and the reaction substrate can more fully contact the catalytically active site through host&#8211;guest chemistry of cages, ultimately achieving a high H2O2 production rate.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potential clean method, but the long distance between the oxidation and reduction sites in photocatalysts hinders the rapid transfer of photogenerated charges, limiting the improvement of its performance. Here, a metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst, Co14(L&#8722;CH3)24, is constructed by directly coordinating metal sites (Co sites) used for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with non&#8208;metallic sites (imidazole sites of ligands) used for the H2O oxidation reaction (WOR), which shortens the transport path of photogenerated electrons and holes, and improves the transport efficiency of charges and activity of the photocatalyst. Therefore, it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst with a rate of as high as 146.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2O2 production under O2&#8208;saturated pure water without sacrificial agents. Significantly, the combination of photocatalytic experiments and theoretical calculations proves that the functionalized modification of ligands is more conducive to adsorbing key intermediates (*OH for WOR and *HOOH for ORR), resulting in better performance. This work proposed a new catalytic strategy for the first time; i.e., to build a synergistic metal&#8208;nonmetal active site in the crystalline catalyst and use the host&#8211;guest chemistry inherent in the metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC)to increase the contact between the substrate and the catalytically active site, and finally achieve efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>A Fully Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework with Oxidative and Reductive Sites for Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline network is constructed by incorporating rhenium complexes and triazine ring structures as catalytic sites via robust &#8722;C=C&#8722; bonding. Appreciable charge&#8208;separation and transfer efficiency drive both the photocatalytic oxidative and reductive reactions in the conversion of CO2 to CO with H2O, and without any additional sacrificial agents or photosensitizers.







Abstract
Constructing a powerful photocatalytic system that can achieve the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction half&#8208;reaction and the water (H2O) oxidation half&#8208;reaction simultaneously is a very challenging but meaningful task. Herein, a porous material with a crystalline topological network, named viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re, was rationally synthesized by incorporating rhenium complexes as reductive sites and triazine ring structures as oxidative sites via robust &#8722;C=C&#8722; bond linkages. The charge&#8208;separation ability of viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re is promoted by low polarized &#960;&#8208;bridges between rhenium complexes and triazine ring units, and the efficient charge&#8208;separation enables the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs, followed by an intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer process, to form photogenerated electrons involved in CO2 reduction and photogenerated holes that participate in H2O oxidation simultaneously. The viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re shows the highest catalytic photocatalytic carbon monoxide (CO) production rate (190.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with about 100&#8201;% selectivity) and oxygen (O2) evolution (90.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) among all the porous catalysts in CO2 reduction with H2O as sacrificial agents. Therefore, a powerful photocatalytic system was successfully achieved, and this catalytic system exhibited excellent stability in the catalysis process for 50&#8197;hours. The structure&#8211;function relationship was confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

         <dc:description>
A straightforward method of controlled partial linker thermolysis allows the microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) photocatalyst UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to expand its porosity with a tailored pore environment. The resulting material accommodates single&#8208;site Cu species, shows significant mesoporosity and enhanced charge photogeneration. It has excellent performance in photocatalytic reactions for the functionalization of terminal alkynes.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with expanding porosity and tailored pore environments are intriguing for catalytic applications. We report herein a straightforward method of controlled partial linker thermolysis to introduce desirable mesopores into mono&#8208;ligand MOFs, which is different from the classical thermolyzing method that starts from mixed&#8208;linker MOFs. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, after partial ligand thermolysis, exhibits significant mesoporosity, retained crystal structure, improved charge photogeneration and abundant anchoring sites, which is ideal to explore single&#8208;site photocatalysis. Atomically dispersed Cu is then accommodated in the tailored pore. The resulting single&#8208;site Cu catalyst exhibits excellent performance for photocatalytic alkylation and oxidation coupling for the functionalization of terminal alkynes. The study highlights the advantage of controlled partial linker thermolysis to synthesize hierarchical MOFs to achieve the advanced single&#8208;site photocatalysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis effects in electrochemical CO2 reduction were investigated through an isotopic labelling strategy involving the co&#8208;reduction of 13CO2/12CO mixtures. The results provide evidence that tandem catalysis does indeed occur in neutral electrolyte but is curtailed under acidic conditions. This is due to Cu becoming less effective at utilizing tandem&#8208;supplied CO in the presence of hydronium ions.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) in acidic media with Cu&#8208;based catalysts tends to suffer from lowered selectivity towards multicarbon products. This could in principle be mitigated using tandem catalysis, whereby the *CO coverage on Cu is increased by introducing a CO generating catalyst (e.g. Ag) in close proximity. Although this has seen significant success in neutral/alkaline media, here we report that such a strategy becomes impeded in acidic electrolyte. This was investigated through the co&#8208;reduction of 13CO2/12CO mixtures using a series of Cu and CuAg catalysts. These experiments provide strong evidence for the occurrence of tandem catalysis in neutral media and its curtailment under acidic conditions. Density functional theory simulations suggest that the presence of H3O+ weakens the *CO binding energy of Cu, preventing effective utilization of tandem&#8208;supplied CO. Our findings also provide other unanticipated insights into the tandem catalysis reaction pathway and important design considerations for effective CO2R in acidic media.

         <title>Catalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation with Polyhydride Ni/Ga Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>

The bimetallic cluster [Ni3(GaTMP)7] reversibly forms di&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and hexahydride species under hydrogen pressure in solution, that were characterized by low temperature COSY and ROESY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. The work conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal main&#8208;group bimetallic clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.







Abstract
The bimetallic, decanuclear Ni3Ga7&#8208;cluster of the formula [Ni3(GaTMP)3(&#956;2&#8208;GaTMP)3(&#956;3&#8208;GaTMP)] (1, TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyl) reacts reversibly with dihydrogen under the formation of a series of (poly&#8208;)hydride clusters 2. Low&#8208;temperature 2D NMR experiments at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C show that 2 consist of a mixture of a di&#8208; (2Di), tetra&#8208; (2Tetra) and hexahydride species (2Hexa). The structures of 2Di and 2Tetra are assessed by a combination of 2D NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The cooperation of both metals is essential for the high hydrogen uptake of the cluster. Polyhydrides 2 are catalytically active in the semihydrogenation of 4&#8208;octyne to 4&#8208;octene with good selectivity. The example is the first of its kind and conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal/main group metal clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.

         <title>Fast Polysulfide Conversion Catalysis and Reversible Anode Operation by A Single Cathode Modifier in Li&#8208;Metal Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functionalities were enabled by a single cathode modifier: i)&#8197;for the cathode, it can work as an effective catalyst to promote cathode reaction kinetics; ii)&#8197;for the anode, trace amounts of dissolved In and Se ions are incorporated as LiInS2 and LiInSe2 in the anode solid electrolyte interface to facilitate reversible Li deposition/stripping.







Abstract
The two major issues confronting the commercialization of rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur electrochemical reactions on the cathode and inadequate lithium deposition/stripping reversibility on the anode. They are commonly mitigated with additives designed specifically for the anode and the cathode individually. Here, we report the use of a single cathode modifier, In2Se3, which can effectively catalyse the polysulfide reactions on the cathode, and also improve the reversibility of Li deposition and removal on the anode through a LiInS2/LiInSe2 containing solid electrolyte interface formed in situ by the Se and In ions dissolved in the electrolyte. The amounts of dissolved Se and In are small relative to the amount of In2Se3 administered. The benefits of using this single modification approach were verified in Li&#8208;metal anode&#8208;free Li&#8722;S batteries with a Li2S loading of 4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low electrolyte/Li2S ratio of 7.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. The resulting battery showed 60&#8201;% capacity retention after 160&#8197;cycles at the 0.2&#8197;C rate and an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.27&#8201;%, comparing very well with recent studies using separate electrode modifiers.

         <title>The Keto&#8208;Switched Photocatalysis of Reconstructed Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local reconstruction of imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) unlocks visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photocatalytic H2 evolution. The keto units in skeletal building blocks are active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons are emitted to Pt nanoparticles across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer for reduction of protons to H2. A new benchmark H2 production rate of 53&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved over &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
The keto&#8208;switched photocatalysis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient H2 evolution was reported for the first time by engineering, at a molecular level, the local structure and component of the skeletal building blocks. A series of imine&#8208;linked BT&#8208;COFs were synthesized by the Schiff&#8208;base reaction of 1, 3, 5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde with diamines to demonstrate the structural reconstruction of enol to keto configurations by alkaline catalysis. The keto groups of the skeletal building blocks served as active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons were provided to Pt nanoparticles (NPs) across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer. The characterization results, together with density functional theory calculations, indicated clearly that the formation of keto&#8208;injectors not only made the conduction band level more negative, but also led to an inhomogeneous charge distribution in the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular building blocks to form a strong intramolecular built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, visible&#8208;light photocatalysis of TP&#8208;COFs&#8208;1 with one keto group in the skeletal building blocks was successfully enabled and achieved an impressive H2 evolution rate as high as 0.96&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Also, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of the reconstructed BT&#8208;COFs&#8208;2 and &#8208;3 with two and three keto&#8208;injectors were significantly enhanced by alkaline post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Linkage Microenvironment of Azoles&#8208;Related Covalent Organic Frameworks Precisely Regulates Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable covalent organic framework (COF) platform with three azole&#8208;related linkages was prepared through linker exchange reactions. The linkage microenvironment changes the photoelectric properties and photocatalytic performance. The thiazole linkage was more favorable than the oxazole and imidazole linkages for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production.







Abstract
Artificial H2O2 photosynthesis by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts is promising for wastewater treatment. The effect of linkage chemistry of COFs as functional basis to photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalysis remains a significant challenge. In this study, three kinds of azoles&#8208;linked COFs including thiazole&#8208;linked TZ&#8208;COF, oxazole&#8208;linked OZ&#8208;COF and imidazole&#8208;linked IZ&#8208;COF were successfully synthesized. More accessible channels of charge transfer were constructed in TZ&#8208;COF via the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure between thiazole linkage and pyrene linker, leading to efficient suppression of photoexcited charge recombination. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental studies, demonstrating that the thiazole linkage is more favorable for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production than that of the oxazole and imidazole linkages. The real active sites in COFs located at the benzene ring fragment between pyrene unit and azole linkage.

         <title>Triazinium Ligation: Bioorthogonal Reaction of N1&#8208;Alkyl 1,2,4&#8208;Triazinium Salts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe N1&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated 1,2,4&#8208;triazinium salts as new bioorthogonal reagents. These heterodienes are stable under biological conditions and react selectively and at high rates with strained alkynes such as BCN, allowing efficient modification of biomolecules. The unique ionic character makes the compounds more water soluble and cell permeable. These features enable efficient labeling of intracellular targets in living cells.







Abstract
The development of reagents that can selectively react in complex biological media is an important challenge. Here we show that N1&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines yields the corresponding triazinium salts, which are three orders of magnitude more reactive in reactions with strained alkynes than the parent 1,2,4&#8208;triazines. This powerful bioorthogonal ligation enables efficient modification of peptides and proteins. The positively charged N1&#8208;alkyl triazinium salts exhibit favorable cell permeability, which makes them superior for intracellular fluorescent labeling applications when compared to analogous 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Due to their high reactivity, stability, synthetic accessibility and improved water solubility, the new ionic heterodienes represent a valuable addition to the repertoire of existing modern bioorthogonal reagents.

         <title>Rethinking Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The German Chemical Society (GDCh) Board of Directors chose the motto &#8220;Rethinking Chemistry&#8221; last year to address challenges connected to climate change, loss of natural resources, and geopolitical conflicts as the guiding principle of all our endeavors and actions. Rethinking Chemistry indicates the Board's desire to encourage scientists to approach chemistry in a new way, with a focus on reconsidering the field from many different angles. By taking a holistic approach, the Board intends to foster innovative, sustainable, and effective ways to use chemistry.
Rethinking Chemistry is also the motto of the GDCh Science Forum Chemistry (WiFo) 2023, and a Special Collection on the homepage of Angewandte Chemie is dedicated to this event and its motto. Rethinking Chemistry means something different in each area of chemistry, and the WiFo 2023 as well as this Special Collection of Angewandte Chemie showcase its many facets.

         <title>Inside Cover: Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Polycondensation for Bio&#8208;based Adaptable and Degradable Phenolic Polymers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 36/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiol&#8211;aldehyde polycondensation was developed for the polymerization of phenolic compounds. In their Research Article (e202305677), Shichao Xu, Liang Yuan et&#8197;al. found several catalysts for making linear and network&#8208;structured phenolic polymers from plant&#8208;derived monomers. Since the repeating units are connected via dynamic dithioacetal groups, the cross&#8208;linked networks can be reprocessed and oxidatively degraded by DMSO to recover the monomers for reuse.

         <dc:description>
Harvesting organic phosphorescence is essential for many fields in energy and materials sciences related to light generation. In their Research Article (e202305108), Andreas Steffen, Andrey Belyaev, Pi&#8208;Tai Chou, Igor&#8197;O. Koshevoy et&#8197;al. show that the anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in crystalline diphosphonium iodides induce unusually fast room temperature triplet emission, which is associated with the external heavy atom effect and anion&#8211;&#960; charge&#8208;transfer character of the excited states. This makes ionic luminophores a new design strategy beyond transition metals and organic delayed fluorophores.

A helical catalyst that is constructed from &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;amino acids: In their Research Article (e202305326), Alexander J.&#8197;A. Cobb et&#8197;al. present a foldamer helix whereby the catalytic functionalities are positioned in such a way that they can be exploited for bifunctional catalysis. The stability of the helix and the modularity of the system (represented by the jigsaw pieces) means that different &#945;&#8208;amino acids can be used whilst maintaining the same helix type. The foldamer catalyst described acts as an aldolase (where a molecule is essentially split into two as depicted by the graphic).

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated Photocatalysis for Lignocellulosic Biomass Conversion into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals and Hydrogen: Facts, Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>

This review discusses recent developments in the chemistry of photocatalytic biomass conversion into chemicals and fuels, emphasizing the role of experimental factors and materials design. A critical technological analysis to facilitate the scaling up of this technology is provided based on the reported research studies and industrial need.







Abstract
Photocatalytic biomass conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels is considered one of the hottest ongoing research and industrial topics toward sustainable development. In short, this process can cleave C&#946;&#8722;O/C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bonds in lignin to aromatic platform chemicals, and further conversion of the polysaccharides to other platform chemicals and H2. From the chemistry point of view, the optimization of the unique cooperative interplay of radical oxidation species (which are activated via molecular oxygen species, ROSs) and substrate&#8208;derived radical intermediates by appropriate control of their type and/or yield is key to the selective production of desired products. Technically, several challenges have been raised that face successful real&#8208;world applications. This review aims to discuss the recently reported mechanistic pathways toward selective biomass conversion through the optimization of ROSs behavior and materials/system design. On top of that, through a SWOT analysis, we critically discussed this technology from both chemistry and technological viewpoints to help the scientists and engineers bridge the gap between lab&#8208;scale and large&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Modern Strategies for Carbon Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of carbon isotope labeling has recently explored new alternative avenues for better dealing with the hurdles of radiochemistry. This review focuses on the emerging opportunities provided by carbon isotope exchange (CIE) technologies. By dramatically reducing the number of steps and radioactive waste generated in preparation of tracers, CIE has great potential for accelerating clinical development of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
In contrast to stable and natural abundant carbon&#8208;12, the synthesis of organic molecules with carbon (radio)isotopes must be conceived and optimized in order to navigate through the hurdles of radiochemical requirements, such as high costs of the starting materials, harsh conditions and radioactive waste generation. In addition, it must initiate from the small cohort of available C&#8208;labeled building blocks. For long time, multi&#8208;step approaches have represented the sole available patterns. On the other side, the development of chemical reactions based on the reversible cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds might offer new opportunities and reshape retrosynthetic analysis in radiosynthesis. This review aims to provide a short survey on the recently emerged carbon isotope exchange technologies that provide effective opportunity for late&#8208;stage labeling. At present, such strategies have relied on the use of primary and easily accessible radiolabeled C1&#8208;building blocks, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and cyanides, while the activation principles have been based on thermal, photocatalytic, metal&#8208;catalyzed and biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Stabilizing Liquids Using Interfacial Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing liquids based on supramolecular assembly (non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions) has attracted significant interest, due to the increasing demand for soft, liquid&#8208;based devices. Recent advances in structuring liquids based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions are highlighted and a perspective is provided on future directions to inspire further studies on structured liquids based on supramolecular assembly.







Abstract
Stabilizing liquids based on supramolecular assembly (non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions) has attracted significant interest, due to the increasing demand for soft, liquid&#8208;based devices where the shape of the liquid is far from the equilibrium spherical shape. The components comprising these interfacial assemblies must have sufficient binding energies to the interface to prevent their ejection from the interface when the assemblies are compressed. Here, we highlight recent advances in structuring liquids based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions. We describe some of the progress made that reveals structure&#8211;property relationships. In addition to treating advances, we discuss some of the limitations and provide a perspective on future directions to inspire further studies on structured liquids based on supramolecular assembly.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;Based Mesoionic Carbenes and Anionic Dicarbenes: Pushing the Limit of Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoionic carbenes (iMICs) and anionic dicarbenes (ADCs) are readily accessible by the deprotonation of C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts, which are prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). The implications of iMICs as potent &#963;&#8208;donor ligands in organometallic catalysis and ADCs as unique building&#8208;blocks in accessing conceptually new main&#8208;group heterocycles with an annulated C4E2 ring are showcased.







Abstract
Classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) featuring the carbene center at the C2&#8208;position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework (i.e. C2&#8208;carbenes) are well acknowledged as very versatile neutral ligands in molecular as well as in materials sciences. The efficiency and success of NHCs in diverse areas is essentially attributed to their persuasive stereoelectronics, in particular the potent &#963;&#8208;donor property. The NHCs with the carbene center at the unusual C4 (or C5) position, the so&#8208;called abnormal NHCs (aNHCs) or mesoionic carbenes (iMICs), are however superior &#963;&#8208;donors than C2&#8208;carbenes. Hence, iMICs have substantial potential in sustainable synthesis and catalysis. The main obstacle in this direction is rather demanding synthetic accessibility of iMICs. The aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances, particularly by the author's research group, in accessing stable iMICs, quantifying their properties, and exploring their applications in synthesis and catalysis. In addition, the synthetic viability and use of vicinal C4,C5&#8208;anionic dicarbenes (ADCs), also based on an 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework, are presented. As will be apparent on following pages, iMICs and ADCs hold potentials in pushing the limit of classical NHCs by enabling access to conceptually new main&#8208;group heterocycles, radicals, molecular catalysts, ligands sets, and more.

         <title>Unravelling the Superiority of Nonbenzenoid Acepleiadylene as a Building Block for Organic Semiconducting Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonbenzenoid acepleiadylene (APD) has been explored as a new building block to construct organic electronic material (APD&#8208;IID), which exhibits higher hole mobility than its pyrene&#8208;based isomers because of the stronger intermolecular interaction induced by the unique charge&#8208;separated character. These results demonstrate the superiority of nonbenzenoid arenes in the future development of organic semiconducting materials.







Abstract
Acepleiadylene (APD), a nonbenzenoid isomer of pyrene, exhibits a unique charge&#8208;separated character with a large molecular dipole and a small optical gap. However, APD has never been explored in optoelectronic materials to take advantage of these appealing properties. Here, we employ APD as a building block in organic semiconducting materials for the first time, and unravel the superiority of nonbenzenoid APD in electronic applications. We have synthesized an APD derivative (APD&#8208;IID) with APD as the terminal donor moieties and isoindigo (IID) as the acceptor core. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that APD&#8208;IID has an obvious charge&#8208;separated structure and enhanced intermolecular interactions as compared with its pyrene&#8208;based isomers. As a result, APD&#8208;IID displays significantly higher hole mobilities than those of the pyrene&#8208;based counterparts. These results imply the advantages of employing APD in semiconducting materials and great potential of nonbenzenoid polycyclic arenes for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a Bond&#8208;Localized C2h Structure and a Challenge for Computational Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a computational challenge. Highly correlated methods and popular DFT functionals predict a bond&#8208;delocalized D2h symmetry, but excellent agreement between experimental and computed proton chemical shifts suggests a true C2h geometry.







Abstract
Whether tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a symmetric D2h structure or a bond&#8208;alternating C2h structure remains a standing puzzle. Close agreement between experimental and computed proton chemical shifts based on minima structures optimized at the M06&#8208;2X, &#969;B97X&#8208;D, and M11 levels confirm a bond&#8208;localized C2h symmetry, which is consistent with the expected strong antiaromaticity of TtB&#8208;s&#8208;indacene.

&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, which is consistent with the expected strong antiaromaticity of T&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;B-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Endocyclic 1&#8208;Azaallyl Anions: Concise Synthesis of Unprotected Enantioenriched cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diarylpiperidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized from readily available piperidines in only three operations. The key step is a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and endocyclic 1&#8208;azallyl anions, elusive intermediates derived from the in situ deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction can be achieved enantioselectively with a chiral mono&#8208;phosphine ligand.







Abstract
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized through an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions. These intermediates are generated in situ by the deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines, precursors that are readily prepared in two operations from simple piperidines. An asymmetric version of this reaction with (2R, 3R)&#8208;iPr&#8208;BI&#8208;DIME as the ligand provides products in moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions.

         <title>A Porous Crystalline Nitrone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, has been synthesized for the first time via polycondensation reaction. The sorption analyses of COF&#8208;115 revealed a porosity of 1387&#8197;m2/g, and a superior potential for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications compared to their imine&#8208;based analogs. Finally, COF&#8208;115 was found to undergo a photochemical rearrangement to the corresponding amide&#8208;linked material.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, by combining N, N&#8242;, N&#8242;, N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1, 1, 2, 2&#8208;tetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;4, 1&#8208;diyl))tetrakis(hydroxylamine) and terephthaladehyde via a polycondensation reaction. The formation of the nitrone functionality was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 13C multi cross&#8208;polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy of the 13C&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled COF&#8208;115 and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. The permanent porosity of COF&#8208;115 was evaluated through low&#8208;pressure N2, CO2, and H2 sorption experiments. Water vapor and carbon dioxide sorption analysis of COF&#8208;115 and the isoreticular imine&#8208;linked COF indicated a superior potential of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications. Density functional theory calculations provided valuable insights into the difference between the adsorption properties of these COFs. Lastly, photoinduced rearrangement of COF&#8208;115 to the associated amide&#8208;linked material was successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Chiral PSiSi&#8208;Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Silylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chiral pincer silyl ligand is developed, which enables an Iridium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation reaction. Key to the success of this transformation is the use of a novel chiral PSiSi&#8208;ligand, which facilitates the C&#8722;H silylation process with high chemical, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control via a multi&#8208;coordinated silyl iridium complex.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation offers an efficient approach for the rapid construction of chiral organosilicon compounds, but remains a significant challenge. Herein, a new type of chiral silyl ligand is developed, which enables the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation reaction of 2&#8208;arylisoquinolines. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, and remarkable yield with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee), delivering enantioenriched axially chiral silane platform molecules with facile convertibility. Key to the success of this unprecedented transformation relies on a novel chiral PSiSi&#8208;ligand, which facilitates the intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation process with perfect chem&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control via a multi&#8208;coordinated silyl iridium complex.

         <title>Autohydrolysis of Diglycine&#8208;Activated Succinic Esters Boosts Cellular Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxy&#8208;terminal diglycine&#8208;modified succinate compounds undergo autohydrolysis at physiological pH. This process converts supramolecular assemblies from nanofibers to nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. This approach also restores drug efficacy, promoting effective intracellular therapeutics.







Abstract
Rapid cellular uptake of synthetic molecules remains a challenge, and the motif frequently employed to generate prodrugs, succinic ester, unfortunately lowers the efficacy of the desired drugs due to their slow ester hydrolysis and low cell entry. Here we show that succinic ester&#8208;containing diglycine drastically boosts the cellular uptake of supramolecular assemblies or prodrugs. Specifically, autohydrolysis of the diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters turns the nanofibers of the conjugates of succinic ester and self&#8208;assembling motif into nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. The autohydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters and drug conjugates also restores the efficacy of the drugs. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggests that a &#8220;U&#8208;turn&#8221; of diglycine favors intramolecular hydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters to promote autohydrolysis. As an example of rapid autohydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters for instant cellular uptake, this work illustrates a nonenzymatic bond cleavage approach to develop effective therapeutics for intracellular targeting.

An electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand is effective at stabilizing high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates involved in the water oxidation reaction. UV/Vis, XAS, EPR, electrochemical and kinetic measurements, allow a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species that participates in O&#8722;O bond formation with higher reactivity and shorter lifetime to be tracked in a real catalytic water oxidation reaction.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species are appealing for conducting O&#8722;O bond formation for water oxidation reactions. However, their high reactivity poses a great challenge to the dissection of their chemical transformations. Herein, we introduce an electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand, 2&#8208;[(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;6&#8208;yl]propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol to stabilize such fleeting intermediates. Advanced spectroscopies and electrochemical studies demonstrate a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species formation in water. Combining kinetic and oxygen isotope labelling experiments and organic reactions indicates that the FeV(O) species is responsible for O&#8722;O bond formation via water nucleophilic attack under the real catalytic water oxidation conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;cis Disubstituted Cycloalkanes by Convergent NiH Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiH&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) of easily accessible racemic and isomeric mixture of cycloalkenes and a NiH&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization transformation of prochiral cyclic alkenes are reported. This migratory hydroalkylation process produces enantioenriched thermodynamically disfavored 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes with excellent levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enantioenriched multi&#8208;substituted cycloalkanes constitute an essential class of compounds in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Here we report an NiH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric migratory hydroalkylation process for the efficient and selective construction of such compounds. Through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT), easily accessible racemic and isomeric mixtures of cycloalkenes could be directly utilized as starting materials, convergently producing thermo&#8208;dynamically disfavored chiral 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes bearing vicinal stereocenters with high levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In addition, prochiral cyclic alkenes can be also employed, and deliver chiral 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes through desymmetrization process.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8722;H Bond Cyclopropenylation with Cyclopropenium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules enables the installation of cyclopropene rings with excellent efficiency, thus reaching an uncharted cyclopropenylated chemical space. The cyclopropene ring generally improves the metabolic stability of the cyclopropenylated drug molecules and serves as a unique scaffold to access broad range of medically&#8208;relevant motifs.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and chemoselective late&#8208;stage (hetero)aryl C&#8722;H bond cyclopropenylation with cyclopropenium cations (CPCs). The process is fast, operationally simple and shows an excellent functional group tolerance in densely&#8208;functionalized drug molecules, natural products, agrochemicals and fluorescent dyes. Moreover, we discovered that the installation of the cyclopropene ring in drug molecules could not only be used to shield against metabolic instability but also as a synthetic tool to reach medicinally&#8208;relevant sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds exploiting the highly&#8208;strained nature of the cyclopropene ring with known transformations.

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8722;H Carbonylation of Light and Heavy Hydrocarbons with Carbon Monoxide via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalysis in Flow
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient C&#8722;H functionalization process, enabling the regioselective installation of carbonyls in light and heavy hydrocarbons by using inexpensive carbon monoxide. Safe processing of hazardous CO and flammable alkanes is ensured in flow, with high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics. Our method demonstrates the valorization of gaseous reagents, coupling light alkanes, CO, and an olefin as a terminal radical trap.







Abstract
Despite their abundance in organic molecules, considerable limitations still exist in synthetic methods that target the direct C&#8722;H functionalization at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. This is even more the case for light alkanes, which bear some of the strongest C&#8722;H bonds known in Nature, requiring extreme activation conditions that are not tolerant to most organic molecules. To bypass these issues, synthetic chemists rely on prefunctionalized alkyl halides or organometallic coupling partners. However, new synthetic methods that target regioselectively C&#8722;H bonds in a variety of different organic scaffolds would be of great added value, not only for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active molecules but also for the catalytic upgrading of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks. Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)&#8722;H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO). Flow technology was deemed crucial to enable high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics, needed to outpace deleterious reaction pathways, but also to leverage a scalable and safe process.

         <title>In situ Generated Iridium Nanoparticles as Hydride Donors in Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions with Deuterium and Tritium Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the synergistic approach of in situ generated iridium nanoparticles in photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization hydrogen isotope exchange with deuterium and tritium gas.







Abstract
We have studied the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reaction with deuterium or tritium gas as isotope sources and in situ formed transition metal nanoparticles as hydrogen atom transfer pre&#8208;catalysts. By this means we have found synergistic reactivities applying two different HIE mechanisms, namely photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization HIE leading to the synthesis of highly deuterated complex molecules. Finally, we adopted these findings successfully to tritium chemistry.

         <title>Overlooked Formation of Carbonate Radical Anions in the Oxidation of Iron(II) by Oxygen in the Presence of Bicarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3.&#8722;) in the oxidation of FeII by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;) is shown. The results highlight the importance of considering the formation of CO3.&#8722; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon and show that the presence of bicarbonate dramatically changes the mechanism and kinetics of the reaction of Fe(H2O)62++O2 under physiological and environmental conditions.







Abstract
Iron(II), (Fe(H2O)62+, (FeII) participates in many reactions of natural and biological importance. It is critically important to understand the rates and the mechanism of FeII oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen, O2, under environmental conditions containing bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;), which exists up to millimolar concentrations. In the absence and presence of HCO3&#8722;, the formation of reactive oxygen species (O2&#8901;&#8722;, H2O2, and HO&#8901;) in FeII oxidation by O2 has been suggested. In contrast, our study demonstrates for the first time the rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#8901;&#8722;) in the oxidation of FeII by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate, HCO3&#8722;. The rate of the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; may be expressed as d[CO3&#8901;&#8722;]/dt=[FeII[[O2][HCO3&#8722;]2. The formation of reactive species was investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gas chromatographic techniques. The study presented herein provides new insights into the reaction mechanism of FeII oxidation by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate and highlights the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon.

         <title>Strong and Ultra&#8208;tough Ionic Hydrogel Based on Hyperbranched Macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker: Influence of Topological Structure on Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of hydrogels often suffers from their inherent limitation of poor mechanical properties. Here, a carboxyl&#8208;functionalized and acryloyl&#8208;terminated hyperbranched polycaprolactone (PCL) was synthesized and used as a macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker to fabricate a super strong and ultra&#8208;tough ionic hydrogel. The terminal acryloyl groups of hyperbranched PCL are chemically incorporated into the network to form covalent cross&#8208;links, which contribute to robust networks. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic domains formed by the spontaneous aggregation of PCL chains and coordination bonds between Fe3+ and COO&#8211; groups serve as dynamic non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links, which enhance the energy dissipation ability. Especially, the influence of the hyperbranched topological structure of PCL on hydrogel properties has been well investigated, exhibiting superior strengthening and toughening effects compared to the linear one. Moreover, the hyperbranched PCL cross&#8208;linker also endowed the ionic hydrogel with higher sensitivity than the linear one when used as a strain sensor. As a result, this well&#8208;designed ionic hydrogel possesses high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and well ionic conductivity, exhibiting potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Olefin Based Crystalline Schlenk Hydrocarbon Diradicals with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular approach for the synthesis of isolable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradicals from m&#8208;phenylene bridged electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;triazaalkenes as synthons is reported. EPR spectroscopy confirms their diradical nature and triplet electronic structure by revealing a half&#8208;field signal. A computational analysis confirms the triplet state to be the ground state. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the modular methodology, the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;m&#8208;phenylene was further utilized as a coupling unit between two alkene motifs. The steric conjunction of the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl groups substantially twists the substituents at the nonbonding electron bearing centers relative to the central coupling m&#8208;phenylene motif. As a result, the spin delocalization is decreased and the exchange coupling between the two unpaired spins, hence, significantly reduced. Notably, after 108 years of Schlenk&#8217;s m&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl) synthesis as diradical, for the first time we were able to isolate its derivative with the same spacer, i.e. m&#8208;phenylene, between two radical centers in a crystalline form.</dc:description>

However, scalable anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with desirable properties are still lacking, which greatly hampers the commercialization of this technology. Herein, we propose a series of novel multiblock AEMs based on ether&#8208;free poly(biphenyl ammonium&#8208;b&#8208;biphenyl phenyl)s (PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPPs) that are suitable for use in high performance AEMFC and AEMWE systems because of their well&#8208;formed microphase separation structures. The developed AEMs achieved outstanding OH&#8208; conductivity (162.2 mS cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C) with a low swelling ratio, good alkaline stability, and excellent mechanical durability (tensile strength &gt; 31 MPa and elongation at break &gt; 147% after treatment in 2 M NaOH at 80 &#176;C for 3750 h). A PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPP&#8208;based AEMFC demonstrated a remarkable peak power density of 2.41 W cm&#8208;2 and in&#8208;situ durability for 330 h under 0.6 A cm&#8208;2 at 70 &#176;C. An AEMWE device showed a promising performance (6.25 A cm&#8208;2 at 2 V, 80 &#176;C) and outstanding in&#8208;situ durability for 3250 h with a low voltage decay rate (&lt;28 &#956;V h&#8208;1). The newly developed PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPP AEMs thus show great application prospects for energy conversion devices.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Potassium&#8208;Modified Nickel&#8208;Zinc Carbide Boosts Production of Higher Alcohols beyond CH4 in CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied in the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4, but selective and efficient synthesis of higher alcohols (C2+OH) from CO2 hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based catalyst is still challenging due to successive hydrogenation of C1 intermediates leading to methanation. Herein, we report an unprecedented synthesis of C2+OH from CO2 hydrogenation over K&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;Zn bimetal catalyst with promising activity and selectivity. Systematic experiments (including XRD, in situ spectroscopic characterizations) and computational studies reveal the in situ generation of an active K&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;Zn carbide (K&#8208;Ni3Zn1C0.7) by carburization of Zn&#8208;incorporated Ni0, which can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption and the surface coverage of alkyl intermediates, and boost the C&#8208;C coupling to C2+OH rather than conventional CH4. This work opens a new catalyst avenue for the CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH, and also provides an insightful example for the rational design of selective and efficient Ni&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to multiple carbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Air&#8208;Stable Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanoparticles for Anti&#8208;Stokes Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Image contrast is often limited by background autofluorescence in steady&#8208;state bioimaging microscopy. Upconversion bioimaging can overcome this by shifting the emission lifetime and wavelength beyond the autofluorescence window. Here we demonstrate the first example of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based lifetime imaging microscopy. A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on TTA&#8208;UC chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8208;inorganic host has been synthesized. The NPs exhibit bright UC emission (400&#8208;500 nm) in aerated aqueous media with a UC lifetime of ~1 &#956;s, excellent colloidal stability and little cytotoxicity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging using these NPs shows that the long&#8208;lived anti&#8208;Stokes emission is easily discriminable from typical autofluorescence. Moreover, fluctuations in the UC lifetime can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure. Our TTA&#8208;UC NPs are highly promising stains for lifetime imaging microscopy, affording excellent image contrast and potential for oxygen mapping that is ripe for further exploitation.</dc:description>

         <title>An RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzyme That Requires an Organic Solvent to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering functional nucleic acids active under unusual conditions will not only reveal the hidden talents of nucleic acids but also lay groundwork for pursuing them for unique applications. Although many DNAzymes have been derived to catalyze diverse chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, no prior study has been set up to purposely derive DNAzymes that require an organic solvent to function. Herein, we utilized in vitro selection to isolate RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool that were &#8220;compelled&#8221; to accept 35% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent, via counter selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by positive selection in the same solution containing 35% DMSO. This experiment indeed led to the discovery of a new DNAzyme that requires 35% DMSO for its catalytic activity but exhibits drastically reduced activity without DMSO. This DNAzyme also requires divalent metal ions for catalysis and uses monovalent ions for activity enhancement. A minimized, more efficient DNAzyme was also derived. This work demonstrates that highly functional organic solvent&#8208;dependent DNAzymes can be isolated from random&#8208;sequence DNA libraries via forced in vitro selection, thus expanding the capability and potential utility of DNA as enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Molecular Structure and Confining Environment of an Organometallic Catalyst Heterogenized within Amorphous Porous Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activity of multifunctional, microporous materials is directly linked to the spatial arrangement of their structural building blocks. Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic&#8208;level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non&#8208;crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh&#8208;based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine&#8208;based porous polymers is obtained. Small but significant differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multitargeting prodrugs that release oxaliplatin, doxorubicin and gemcitabine are potent inhibitors of tumor growth and effective inducers of immunogenic cell death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multitargeting prodrug (2) that releases in cancer cells gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin in their active form is a potent cytotoxic agent with nM IC50s; is highly selective to cancer cells with mean selectivity indices to human (136) and murine (320) cancer cells. It effectively induces release of DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells facilitating more efficient phagocytosis by J774 macrophages than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration. The viability of CT26 cells co&#8208;cultured with J774 macrophages and treated with 2 was reduced by 32% compared to the non&#8208;treated, suggesting a synergistic antiproliferative effect between the chemical and immune reactions. 2 inhibited in vivo tumor growth in two murine models (LLC and CT26) better than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration with significantly lower body weight loss. Mice inoculated with CT26 cells treated with 2 showed 80% tumor reduction in a re&#8208;challenge study compared to 73% induced by doxorubicin.</dc:description>
