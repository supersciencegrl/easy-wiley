         <title>Stereoselective Photoredox Catalyzed (3+3) Dipolar Cycloaddition of Nitrone with Aryl Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrated the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction is revealed to take place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three&#8208;electron type nucleophilic substitution&#8208;triggered cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening and a diastereoselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeded under mild conditions with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well&#8208;developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional group compatibility. A mechanism involving aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy Toward pH&#8208;Resistant Phenolic Fluorophores for High&#8208;Fidelity Sensing and Bioimaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl alcohol&#8208;type or phenolic fluorophores offer diverse opportunities for developing bioimaging agents and fluorescence probes. Due to the inherently acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH&#8208;dependent emission signals. Therefore, except for developing pH probes, the pH&#8208;dependent nature of phenolic fluorophores should be considered in bioimaging applications but has been neglected. Here we show that a simple structural remedy converts conventional phenolic fluorophores into pH&#8208;resistant derivatives, which also offer &#8220;medium&#8208;resistant&#8221; emission properties. The structural modification involves a single&#8208;step introduction of a hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor such as morpholine nearby the phenolic hydroxyl group, which also leads to emission bathochromic shift, increased Stokes shift, enhanced photo&#8208;stability and stronger emission for several dyes. The strategy greatly expands the current fluorophores&#8217; repertoire for reliable bioimaging applications, as demonstrated here with ratiometric imaging of cells and tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost the Electrocatalytic Water Splitting&#160; of Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a Ni3N/NiO Heterojunction at Industrial Current&#160;Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient and stable hydrogen production catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (EWS) at industrial current densities remains a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a heterostructure&#8208;induced&#8208;strategy to optimize the metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) and the EWS activity of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO. Density function theory (DFT) calculations firstly predicted that the Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures can improve the structural stability, electronic distributions, and orbital coupling of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO, compared to Ru&#8208;Ni3N and Ru&#8208;NiO, which accordingly decreases energy barriers and increases the electroactivity for EWS. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO catalyst with 2D Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures nanosheet array, uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles, and strong MSI, was successfully constructed in the experiment, which owns an excellent HER and OER activity with overpotentials of 190 mV and 385 mV at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO&#8208;based EWS device can realize an industrial current density (1000 mA cm&#8722;2) at 1.74 V and 1.80 V under alkaline pure water and seawater conditions, respectively. Additionally, it also achieves a high durability of 1000 h (@ 500 mA cm&#8722;2) in alkaline pure water.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular and Practical 1,2&#8208;Aryl(alkenyl) Heteroatom Functionalization of Alkenes through Iron/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapidly synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Enhanced Generation and Epoxidation of Ethylene in Tandem CO2 Electrolysis toward Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indirect electro&#8208;epoxidation of ethylene (C2H4), produced from CO2 electroreduction (CO2R), holds immense promise for CO2 upcycling to valuable ethylene oxide (EO). However, this process currently faces mediocre Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to sluggish formation and rapid dissociation of active species, as well as reductive deactivation of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts during the conversion of C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4, respectively. Herein, we report a bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy designed to concurrently promote both C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversions, thereby improving EO generation, using single&#8208;atom Pt on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) and Br&#8722;&#8208;beared porous Cu2O as anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations including synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption, operando infrared spectroscopy, and quasi&#8208;in situ Raman spectroscopy/electron paramagnetic resonance with theoretical calculations reveal that the favorable Br2/HBrO generation over Pt1/NCNT with optimal intermediates binding facilitates C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion with a high FE of 92.2%, and concomitantly, the Br&#8722; with strong nucleophilicity protects active Cu+ species in Cu2O effectively for improved CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with a FE of 66.9% at 800 mA cm&#8722;2, superior to those in traditional chloride&#8208;mediated case. Consequently, a single&#8208;pass FE high to 41.1% for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion can be achieved in a tandem system.</dc:description>

         <title>Dithienoazepine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes: Janus&#8208;Faced Effects of a Thiophene&#8208;Fused Structure on Antiaromatic Azepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here disclose that the incorporation of thiophene rings into a seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine in a fused fashion produces a useful antiaromatic core for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. In contrast to dibenzazepine derivatives with bent structures, dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives with electron&#8208;accepting groups adopt flat conformations in the ground state. The dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives exhibited broad absorption spectra that cover the visible region as well as sharp emission bands in the NIR region, which are considerably red&#8208;shifted relative to those of the dibenzo&#8208;fused congeners. Theoretical study revealed two contradictory effects of the less&#8208;aromatic thiophene&#8208;fused structure, i.e., the enhancement of the antiaromaticity of the adjacent azepine ring and the relief of the antiaromaticity through the contribution of a quinoidal resonance form. The combination of the dithienoazepine core with cationic electron&#8208;accepting groups produced a NIR fluorescent dye with an emission at 878 nm in solution.</dc:description>

The combination of the dithienoazepine core with cationic electron-accepting groups produced a NIR fluorescent dye with an emission at 878 nm in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Negative Electrostatic Pore Environments in a Scalable, Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (MOF&#8208;303) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation. This material exhibits not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes, but also top&#8208;tier C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities at ambient conditions. &#65279;Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that multiple N/O sites on pore channels can build a negative electro&#8208;environment to provide stronger interactions with C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for ternary mixtures, affording one of the highest C2H4 productivity of 1.35 mmol g&#8722;1. This material is highly stable and can be easily synthesized at kilogram&#8208;scale from cheap raw materials using a water&#8208;based green synthesis. The benchmark combination of excellent separation properties with high stability and low cost in scalable MOF&#8208;303 has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct selectivity control in solar&#8208;driven bio&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acid conversion: a comparison of Pt nanoparticles and atomically dispersed Pt on CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic lignocellulose conversion is a promising strategy for the sustainable production of high&#8208;value chemicals, but selectivity control remains a challenging goal in this field. Here, we report efficient and selective conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids to tartaric acid derivatives, &#945;&#8208;keto acids, and H2 using Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. Pt nanoparticles on CdS selectively produce tartaric acid derivatives via C&#8208;C coupling, while atomically dispersed Pt on CdS switches product selectivity to oxidation reaction to produce &#945;&#8208;keto acids. The atomically dispersed Pt species stabilized by Pt&#8208;S bonds promote the activation of hydroxyl group and thus switch product selectivity from tartaric acid derivatives to &#945;&#8208;keto acids. A broad range of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids was applied for preparing the corresponding tartaric acid derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids over the two Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. This work highlights the unique performance of metal sulfides in coupling reactions and demonstrates a strategy for rationally tuning product selectivity by engineering the interaction between metal sulfide and cocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Assembly of Cu Nanoclusters with Enhanced Electrochemcial Excitation and Radiative Transition for Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper   nanoclusters (CuNCs) are emerging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters with unique molecule&#8208;like electronic structures, high abundance, and low cost. However, the synthesis of CuNCs with high ECL efficiency and stability in a scalable manner remains challenging. Here, we report a facile gram&#8208;scale approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled CuNCs (CuNCsAssy) induced by ligands with exceptionally boosted anodic ECL and stability. Compared to the disordered aggregates that are inactive in ECL, the CuNCsAssy shows a record anodic ECL efficiency for CuNCs (10%, wavelength&#8208;corrected, relative to Ru(bpy)3Cl2/tripropylamine). Mechanism studies revealed the unusual dual functions of ligands in simultaneously facilitating electrochemical excitation and radiative transition. Moreover, the assembly addressed the limitation of poor stability of conventional CuNCs. As a proof of concept, an ECL biosensor for alkaline phosphatase detection was successfully constructed with an ultralow limit of detection of 8.1&#215;10&#8208;6 U/L.</dc:description>

         <title>Sabatier Relations in Electrocatalysts Based on High&#8208;entropy Alloys with Wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band Centers for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is a promising &#8220;beyond Li&#8208;ion&#8221; technology with ultrahigh theoretical energy density (3457 Wh kg&#8208;1), while currently impeded by the sluggish cathodic kinetics of the reversible gas&#8208;solid reaction between O2 and Li2O2. Despite many catalysts are developed for accelerating the conversion process, the lack of design guidance for achieving high performance makes catalysts exploring aleatory. The Sabatier principle is an acknowledged theory connecting the scaling relationship with heterogenous catalytic activity, providing a tradeoff strategy for the topmost performance. Herein, a series of catalysts with wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers (i.e., wide range of adsorption strength) are elaborately constructed via high&#8208;entropy strategy, enabling an in&#8208;depth study of the Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for LOBs. A volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity emerges. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that a moderate d&#8208;band center with appropriate adsorption strength propels the catalysts up to the top. As a demonstration of concept, the LOB using FeCoNiMnPtIr as catalyst provides an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of over 80%, and works steadily for 2000 h with a high fixed specific capacity of 4000 mAh g&#8208;1. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle as a guidance for designing advanced heterogenous catalysts assembled in LOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;encapsulating Cofactor and Enzymes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Multienzyme Cascade Reactions with Cofactor Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach that confines a cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is presented. The system features excellent cargo loading, cascade activity recovery, and cofactor recycling capabilities. The success of the approach depends on the polyelectrolyte interacting with the HOF monomers in place of enzymes and anchoring cofactors and enzymes within the HOFs.







Abstract
Use of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for enzyme immobilization faces challenges in the improvement of enzyme activity recovery and the assembly of cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme systems. Herein, we report a polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach (PAEA) that enables two cascades with four oxidoreductases and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) cofactors co&#8208;encapsulated in BioHOF&#8208;1 with excellent cargo loading and over 100&#8201;% cascade activity. The key role of the polyelectrolyte is to coat enzymes and tether NAD(P)H, thus interacting with HOF monomers in place of enzymes, avoiding the destruction of enzymes by HOF monomers. The versatility and efficiency of PAEA are further illustrated by an HOF&#8208;101&#8208;based bio&#8208;nanoreactor. Moreover, the immobilization by PAEA makes enzymes and NAD(P)H display excellent stability and recyclability. This study has demonstrated a facile and versatile PAEA for fabricating cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade nanoreactors with HOFs.

         <title>Electrochemical Nanoreactor Provides a Comprehensive View of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Cancer&#8208;drug Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transducing the tightly&#8208;channeled catalytic activity of &#8220;nanoconfined&#8221; enzyme cascades into electrical current affords a powerful and novel way to observe specific enzyme reactions, directly and in real time. Here, the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221; is used to extract detailed kinetic and mechanistic information on the inhibitory action of a high&#8208;profile cancer drug that inhibits a common cancer&#8208;associated variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1).







Abstract
The ability to control enzyme cascades entrapped in a nanoporous electrode material (the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221;, e&#8208;Leaf) has been exploited to gain detailed kinetic insight into the mechanism of an anti&#8208;cancer drug. Ivosidenib, used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, acts on a common cancer&#8208;linked variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1 R132H) inhibiting its &#8220;gain&#8208;of&#8208;function&#8221; activity&#8212;the undesired reduction of 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) to the oncometabolite 2&#8208;hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The e&#8208;Leaf quantifies the kinetics of IDH1 R132H inhibition across a wide and continuous range of conditions, efficiently revealing factors underlying the inhibitor residence time. Selective inhibition of IDH1 R132H by Ivosidenib and another inhibitor, Novartis 224, is readily resolved as a two&#8208;stage process whereby initial rapid non&#8208;inhibitory binding is followed by a slower step to give the inhibitory complex.

&lt;p&gt;Transducing the tightly-channeled catalytic activity of &#8220;nanoconfined&#8221; enzyme cascades into electrical current affords a powerful and novel way to observe specific enzyme reactions, directly and in real time. Here, the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221; is used to extract detailed kinetic and mechanistic information on the inhibitory action of a high-profile cancer drug that inhibits a common cancer-associated variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to control enzyme cascades entrapped in a nanoporous electrode material (the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221;, e-Leaf) has been exploited to gain detailed kinetic insight into the mechanism of an anti-cancer drug. Ivosidenib, used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, acts on a common cancer-linked variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1 R132H) inhibiting its &#8220;gain-of-function&#8221; activity&#8212;the undesired reduction of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The e-Leaf quantifies the kinetics of IDH1 R132H inhibition across a wide and continuous range of conditions, efficiently revealing factors underlying the inhibitor residence time. Selective inhibition of IDH1 R132H by Ivosidenib and another inhibitor, Novartis 224, is readily resolved as a two-stage process whereby initial rapid non-inhibitory binding is followed by a slower step to give the inhibitory complex. These kinetic features are likely present in other allosteric inhibitors of IDH1/2.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation Allows Protecting Group&#8208;Free and Stereoselective O&#8208;Glycosylation of Carboxylic Acids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids was reported. This transformation, which employs bench&#8208;stable allyl glycosyl sulfones as donors, occurs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions with visible light irradiation. Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities.







Abstract
Here we report a simple and general method to achieve fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids, employing bench&#8208;stable allyl glycosyl sulfones as donors. Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities. Both the donor activation stage and the glycosidic bond forming stage of the process are compatible with free hydroxyl groups, thereby allowing for the use of fully unprotected glycosyl donors. This transformation is stereoconvergent, occurs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions at ambient temperature with visible light (455&#8197;nm) irradiation, and displays remarkable scope with respect to both reaction partners. Many natural products and commercial drugs, including an acid derived from the complex anticancer agent taxol, were efficiently glycosylated. Experimental studies provide insights into the origin of the stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Along the Nonpolar Axis in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
So far, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has been discussed based on the classical explanation that photocurrent originates from macroscopic polarization. Herein, we report the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs. The light polarization dependence is consistent with the shift current mechanism, which possesses effective features, such as ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature.







Abstract
The origin of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was considered as a built&#8208;in electric field formed by the macroscopic polarization of materials. Alternatively, the &#8220;shift current mechanism&#8221; has been gradually accepted as the more appropriate description of the BPVE. This mechanism implies that the photocurrent generated by the BPVE is a topological current featuring an ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature, which is very attractive for photodetector applications. Meanwhile, the origin of the BPVE in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has not been discussed and is still widely accepted as the classical mechanism without any experimental evidence. Herein, we observed the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs, which is inconsistent with the classical explanation. Furthermore, based on the nonlinear optical tensor correlation, we substantiated that the BPVE in OIHPs is originated in the shift current mechanism.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of the Ser&#8208;Phosphorylation Pattern on the DNA&#8208;Binding Activity of Max Transcription Factor Using Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared by a practical strategy to probe the impact of Ser phosphorylation. The phosphorylation pattern was found to play a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but did not significant affect sequence specificity. The insight gained on the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation sheds light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified transcription factors (TFs) is a powerful method to investigate how post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) influence TF&#8208;DNA interactions and impact gene expression. Among these TFs, Max plays a pivotal role in controlling the expression of 15&#8201;% of the genome. The activity of Max is regulated by PTMs; Ser&#8208;phosphorylation at the N&#8208;terminus is considered one of the key regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we developed a practical synthetic strategy to prepare homogeneous full&#8208;length Max for the first time, to explore the impact of Max phosphorylation. We prepared a focused library of eight Max variants, with distinct modification patterns, including mono&#8208;phosphorylated, and doubly phosphorylated analogues at Ser2/Ser11 as well as fluorescently labeled variants through native chemical ligation. Through comprehensive DNA binding analyses, we discovered that the phosphorylation position plays a crucial role in the DNA&#8208;binding activity of Max. Furthermore, in vitro high&#8208;throughput analysis using DNA microarrays revealed that the N&#8208;terminus phosphorylation pattern does not interfere with the DNA sequence specificity of Max. Our work provides insights into the regulatory role of Max&#8242;s phosphorylation on the DNA interactions and sequence specificity, shedding light on how PTMs influence TF function.

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H Amidation for the Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A camphorsulfonic acid&#8208;based directing group was designed for the Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation of &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, allowing the synthesis of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic studies provided insights into the matched/mismatched effect observed in the C&#8722;H amidation of &#945;&#8208;secondary amines.







Abstract
Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are privileged scaffolds among bioactive natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ligands for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis and organocatalysts. Despite this interest, the construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine motifs still remains a challenge. To address this, an iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation reaction was developed. This method relies on the design of a new, cheap and cleavable exo&#8208;protecting/directing group derived from camphorsulfonic acid, which is directly installed from easily accessible precursors, and furnishes scalemic free 1,2&#8208;diamines upon cleavage of both nitrogen substituents. It was found applicable to both &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, for which a two&#8208;step protocol involving intermolecular olefin hydroamination and C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation was developed. Kinetic and computational studies provided insights into the observed reactivity difference between pairs of diastereoisomeric substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of C60/[10]CPP&#8208;Catenanes by Regioselective, Nanocapsule&#8208;Templated Bingel Bis&#8208;Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of three approaches (tether, nanohoop template &amp; supramolecular shadow mask) enabled the itero&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of [2]catenanes via bis&#8208;addition of bis&#8208;bromomalonates to the complex C60&#8834;[10]CPP. The use of a &#8220;traceless&#8221; nanocapsule shadow mask was key for obtaining 87&#8201;% selectivity for the &#8220;in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242; product, where the formation of a total of 22 isomers is theoretically possible.







Abstract
The addition of two unsymmetric malonate esters to the Buckminster fullerene C60 can lead to 22 spectroscopically distinguishable isomeric products and therefore represents a formidable synthesis challenge. In this work, we achieve 87&#8201;% selectivity for the formation of a single (in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3) isomer by combining three approaches: (i) we use a starting material, in which the two malonates are covalently connected (tether approach); (ii) we form the strong supramolecular complex of C60 with the shape&#8208;persistent [10]CPP macrocycle (template approach) and (iii) we embed this complex further within a self&#8208;assembled nanocapsule (shadow mask approach). Variation of the spacer chain shed light on the limitations of the approach and the ring dynamics in the unusual [2]catenanes were studied in silico with atomistic resolution. This work significantly widens the scope of mechanically interlocked architectures comprising cycloparaphenylenes (CPP).

     alt="Synthesis of C60/[10]CPP-Catenanes by Regioselective, Nanocapsule-Templated Bingel Bis-Addition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of three approaches (tether, nanohoop template &amp; supramolecular shadow mask) enabled the itero- and regioselective synthesis of [2]catenanes via bis-addition of bis-bromomalonates to the complex C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&#8834;[10]CPP. The use of a &#8220;traceless&#8221; nanocapsule shadow mask was key for obtaining 87&#8201;% selectivity for the &#8220;&lt;i&gt;in,out-trans&lt;/i&gt;-3&#8242;&#8242; product, where the formation of a total of 22 isomers is theoretically possible.

         <title>Selectivity Control in the Direct CO Esterification over Pd@UiO&#8208;66: The Pd Location Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Pd nanoparticles into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibits high selectivity for dimethyl carbonate (DMC), while Pd nanoparticles on MOFs and other supports give high selectivity for dimethyl oxalate (DMO) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite. The Lewis acid microenvironment surrounding Pd NPs is responsible for the reversed product selectivity.







Abstract
The selectivity control of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite toward dimethyl oxalate (DMO) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC) remains a grand challenge. Herein, Pd NPs are incorporated into isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X=&#8208;H, &#8208;NO2, &#8208;NH2), affording Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X, which unexpectedly exhibit high selectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to DMC and regulated activity in the direct CO esterification. In sharp contrast, the Pd NPs supported on the MOF, yielding Pd/UiO&#8208;66, displays high selectivity (89&#8201;%) to DMO as always reported with Pd NPs. Both experimental and DFT calculation results prove that the Pd location relative to UiO&#8208;66 gives rise to discriminated microenvironment of different amounts of interface between Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and Pd NPs in Pd@UiO&#8208;66 and Pd/UiO&#8208;66, resulting in their distinctly different selectivity. This is an unprecedented finding on the production of DMC by Pd NPs, which was previously achieved by Pd(II) only, in the direct CO esterification.

         <title>Flux&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Y2Ti2O5S2 for Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) were synthesized in a flux environment. Significantly reduced particle sizes and enhanced photocatalytic performance were observed, indicating the utility of flux&#8208;assisted methods in the preparation of oxysulfide photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is an ideal means of producing hydrogen in a sustainable manner, and developing highly efficient photocatalysts is a vital aspect of realizing this process. The photocatalyst Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) is capable of absorbing at wavelengths up to 650&#8197;nm and exhibits outstanding thermal and chemical durability compared with other oxysulfides. However, the photocatalytic performance of YTOS synthesized using the conventional solid&#8208;state reaction (SSR) process is limited owing to the large particle sizes and structural defects associated with this synthetic method. Herein, we report the synthesis of YTOS particles by a flux&#8208;assisted technique. The enhanced mass transfer efficiency in the flux significantly reduced the preparation time compared with the SSR method. In addition, the resulting YTOS showed improved photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution activity when loaded with Rh and Co3O4 co&#8208;catalysts, respectively. These improvements are attributed to the reduced particle size and enhanced crystallinity of the material as well as the slower decay of photogenerated carriers on a nanosecond to sub&#8208;microsecond time range. Further optimization of this flux&#8208;assisted method together with suitable surface modification is expected to produce high&#8208;quality YTOS crystals with superior photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Absolute CO2/Xenon Separation in Ultramicropore MOF for Anesthetic Gases Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery device is highly needed to guarantee sufficient supply for clinical anesthetic purposes. Herein, an innovative way to recover Xe in exhaled anesthetic gases by using hydrolytically stable NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni MOF is reported. The unprecedented CO2/Xe selectivity (825) of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve 99.16&#8201;% Xe recovery in exhaled gases, making it an ideal adsorbent for actual Xe anesthesia gas regeneration.







Abstract
Xe is an ideal anesthetic gas, but it has not been widely used in practice due to its high cost and low output. Closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling is an economically viable method to ensure adequate supply in medical use. Herein, we design an innovative way to recover Xe by using a stable fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni to eliminate CO2 from moist exhaled anesthetic gases. Unlike other Xe recovery MOFs with low Xe/CO2 selectivity (less than 10), NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve absolute molecular sieve separation of CO2/Xe with excellent CO2 selectivity (825). Mixed&#8208;gas breakthrough experiments assert the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni as a molecular sieve adsorbent for the effective and energy&#8208;efficient removal of carbon dioxide with 99.16&#8201;% Xe recovery. Absolute CO2/Xe separation in NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni makes closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling can be easily realized, demonstrating the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni for important anesthetic gas regeneration under ambient conditions.

         <title>Supramolecular Memristor Based on Bistable [2]Catenanes: Toward High&#8208;Density and Non&#8208;Volatile Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular memristors have been successfully fabricated through the introduction of a bistable [2]catenane, which can stablize charge injection effciently. The AuTS&#8208;S&#8208;C3&#8208;SO3&#8722;Na+//[2]catenane//Ga2O3/EGaIn junctions serve as both resistive switches and diodes. The non&#8208;volatile memristors undergo repeated switching cycles of over 1000&#8197;times and a retention time exceeding 500&#8197;seconds under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for data storage and neuromorphic computing calls for innovative, high&#8208;density solutions, such as resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM). However, the integration of resistive switching and rectification at the nanoscale remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we introduce a bistable [2]catenane&#8208;based supramolecular junction that simultaneously functions as a resistive switch and a diode. All supramolecular junctions are highly stable and reproducible over thousands of resistive switching cycles, because the nano&#8208;confinement of two mechanically interlocked rings can stabilize the radical states of pyridinium moieties under ambient conditions. The successful realization of supramolecular junctions in functionality with a thickness of approximately 2&#8197;nm presents a promising avenue for the development of molecule&#8208;scale based RRAM for a better solution to high density and energy efficiency.

         <title>Combinatorial Screening of Water/Proton Permeation of Self&#8208;Assembled Pillar[5]arene Artificial Water Channel Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary combinations of pillararenes libraries have been used to construct selective artificial water channels that present increased water transport activities across lipid bilayers compared to their components A&#8211;D. These channels are capable of transporting water at a rate that is one order of magnitude below that of the natural aquaporins.







Abstract
Artificial water channels (AWCs) that selectively transport water and reject ions through bilayer membranes have potential to act as synthetic Aquaporins (AQPs). AWCs can have a similar osmotic permeability, better stability, with simpler manufacture on a larger&#8208;scale and have higher functional density and surface permeability when inserted into the membrane. Here, we report the screening of combinatorial libraries of symmetrical and unsymmetrical rim&#8208;functionalized PAs A&#8211;D that are able to transport ca. 107&#8211;108 water molecules/s/channel, which is within 1 order of magnitude of AQPs&#8217; and show total ion and proton rejection. Among the four channels, C and D are 3&#8211;4&#8197;times more water permeable than A and B when inserted in bilayer membranes. The binary combinations of A&#8211;D with different molar ratios could be expressed as an independent (linear ABA), a recessive (inhibition AB, AC, DB, ACA), or a dominant (amplification, DBD) behavior of the water net permeation events.

         <title>Biaxially&#8208;Strained Phthalocyanine at Polyoxometalate@Carbon Nanotube Heterostructure Boosts Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is a promising non&#8208;precious molecular catalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To enhance its catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability, a host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to fabricate one&#8208;dimensional ternary heterostructure of FePc&#8208;polyoxometalate@carbon nanotubes. The polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated nanotubes are able to tune the structure and ORR performances of FeN4 centers.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) with unique FeN4 site has attracted increasing interests as a promising non&#8208;precious catalyst. However, the plane symmetric structure endows FePc with undesired catalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel one&#8208;dimensional heterostructured ORR catalyst by coupling FePc at polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanotubes (FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NTs) using host&#8208;guest chemistry. The encapsulation of polyoxometalates can induce a local tensile strain of single&#8208;walled NTs to strengthen the interactions with FePc. Both the strain and curvature effects of {PW12}@NT scaffold tune the geometric structure and electronic localization of FeN4 centers to enhance the ORR catalytic performance. As expected, such a heterostructured FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NT electrocatalyst exhibits prominent durability, methanol tolerance, and ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#8197;V and a low Tafel slope of 30.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline medium. Besides, the assembled zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrates an ultrahigh power density of 280&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, excellent charge/discharge ability and long&#8208;term stability over 500&#8197;h, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 cathode. This study offers a new strategy to design novel heterostructured catalysts and opens a new avenue to regulate the electrocatalytic performance of phthalocyanine molecules.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Oriented Design Based on Elementary Reactions (CODER) for Triarylamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the application of computational tools to the rational design of catalysts has received considerable attention, but progress has been limited by the reliance on databases and because mechanistic data have been almost neglected. Herein, we report a new strategy for catalyst design, designated catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER), which fully utilizes mechanistic data, combines the strengths of computational tools and researcher experience. CODER enabled the development of extremely efficient Pd catalysts for C&#8211;N coupling, which markedly improved the efficiency of the synthesis of widely used triarylamine optoelectronic materials by enhancing the turnover numbers (up to 340000) to 1&#8210;3 orders of magnitude towards literature values.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Stacking and Aggregation Optimization of Photoactive Layer through Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer is a critical but challenging issue in developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Herein, two structurally similar analogues of anthra[2,3&#8208;b:6,7&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (ADT) and naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (NDT) are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;&#8208;stacking of photoactive layer. We clarify that the perpendicular arrangements of NDT can enlarge the molecular packing space and improve the face&#8208;on stacking of Y6 during the film formation, favoring a more compact and ordered long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction after the removal of NDT under thermal annealing. The edge&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked herringbone&#8208;arrangement of ADT along with its non&#8208;volatilization under thermal annealing can induce the coexistence of face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on stacking of blend film. As a result, the NDT treatment shows encouraging effect in improving the photovoltaic performance of devices based on various systems. Particularly, a remarkable PCE of 18.85% is achieved in the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device treated by NDT additive, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 16.41% for the control device. This work offers a promising strategy to regulate the molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer towards significantly improved performance and stability of organic solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite widespread use of the deuterium isotope effect, selective deuterium labeling of chemical molecules remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D2O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition&#8208;metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D&#8208;incorporation (D&#8208;inc, up to &gt; 99%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiment and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation. Notably, this method proved to be a powerful tool for late&#8208;stage deuteration of biorelevant compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>An Unlocked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Zn&#8208;MOF on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient catalytic sites for O2 reduction to H2O2, while ensuring the fast injection of energetic electrons into these sites, is crucial for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis but remains challenging. Herein, we report    a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two&#8208;dimensional conductive Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in oC), in which the catalytic capability of Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing&#8208;induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn&#8208;O4) in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron&#8208;rich state due to the annealing&#8208;induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key   *OOH intermediate of 2e&#8208; O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) catalytic unit.

Herein, we report    a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two-dimensional conductive Zn-containing metal-organic framework (Zn-MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn-MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in oC), in which the catalytic capability of Zn-MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing-induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn-O4) in Zn-MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron-rich state due to the annealing-induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key   *OOH intermediate of 2e- O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn-MOF(lc) catalytic unit. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 production activity and excellent stability under visible light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in Mononuclear Yb/Sm Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based upconversion luminescence transforming high&#8208;energy photons into low&#8208;energy photons is an attractive anti&#8208;Stokes shift process for fundamental research and promising applications. In this work, we developed the upconversion luminescence in co&#8208;crystal assemblies consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes. The characteristic visible emissions of Sm3+ were observed under the excitation of absorption band of Yb3+ at 980 nm. A series of co&#8208;crystal assemblies were investigated based on mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes, and the strongest luminescence was obtained when the molar concentration between Yb3+ and Sm3+ is equivalent. The crystal structure was fully characterized by the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and upconverting energy transfer mechanisms were verified as cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion. This is the first example of Sm3+&#8208;based upconverting luminescence in discrete lanthanide complexes which present as co&#8208;crystal assemblies at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alcohol&#8208;containing solution with no presence of a typical sacrificial agent. The best performing cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF hybrid catalyzes hydrogen production with an average HER rate up to 38 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 in ethanol/phosphate buffer solution under 4 h illumination. Ultrafast transient optical spectroscopy characterizations and charge carrier analysis reveal that the alcohol contents functioning as hole scavengers could be oxidized by the photogenerated holes of COFs to form aldehydes and protons. The consumption of the photogenerated holes thus suppresses exciton recombination of COFs and improves the ratio of free electrons that were effectively utilized to drive catalytic reaction for HER. This work demonstrates a great potential of COF&#8208;catalyzed HER using alcohol solvents as hole scavengers and provides an example toward realizing the accessibility to the scope of reaction conditions and a greener route for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Desaturation and Epoxidation with Oxygen by Sequential Flavin Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, flavoenzymes mediate mechanistically unrelated transformations such as desaturations and epoxidations with oxygen from air. We disclose the combination of both activities in a sequential fashion using molecular flavin catalysts in the organic laboratory. Our protocol consists of initial photochemical desaturation of silyl enol ethers and subsequent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketone formation with molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Catalytic desaturations are important strategies for the functionalization of organic molecules. In nature, flavoenzymes mediate the formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds by concomitant cofactor reduction. Contrary to many laboratory methods for these reactions, such as the Saegusa&#8208;Ito oxidation, no transition metal reagents or catalysts are required. However, a molecular flavin&#8208;mediated variant has not been reported so far. We disclose a photochemical approach for silyl enol ether oxidation, which leads to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (13 examples) in very good yields. The flavin catalysts are stable throughout the desaturation reaction, and we successfully applied them in a subsequent aerobic epoxidation by simply changing the reaction conditions. This protocol allowed us to directly convert silyl enol ethers into &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketones in a one&#8208;pot fashion (12 examples). Sequential flavin catalysis is not limited to one specific reactivity combination and can, inter alia, couple the photochemical oxidation with radical additions. We anticipate that flavin&#8208;catalyzed desaturation will be applicable to other substrate classes and that its sequential catalytic activity will enable rapid substrate diversification.

         <title>Electrochemical Reversible Reforming between Ethylamine and Acetonitrile on Heterostructured Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a successful development of an ethylenediamine&#8208;acetonitrile electrochemical reversible reformation system was achieved, utilizing a Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 heterostructured catalyst synthesized through an in situ construction strategy as the multifunctional catalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of electrocatalysts is essential to achieve desirable performance of electrochemical synthesis process. Heterostructured catalysts have thus attracted widespread attention due to their multifunctional intrinsic properties, and diverse catalytic applications with corresponding outstanding activities. Here, we report an in situ restoration strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Such Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets exhibit excellent activity and selectivity towards reversible electrochemical reforming of ethylamine and acetonitrile. In the acetonitrile reduction process, Pd acts as reaction center, while Ni(OH)2 provide proton hydrogen through promoting the dissociation of water. Also ethylamine oxidation process can be achieved on the surface of the heterostructured nanosheets with abundant Ni(II) defects. More importantly, an electrolytic cell driven by solar cells was successfully constructed to realize ethylamine&#8208;acetonitrile reversible reforming. This work demonstrates the importance of heterostructure engineering in the rational synthesis of multifunctional catalysts towards electrochemical synthesis of fine chemicals.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Transfer&#8208;Based High&#8208;Capacity Organic Lithium&#8208;Iodine (Chlorine) Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The static organic lithium&#8208;iodine (chlorine) batteries fueled by brand&#8208;new three&#8208;electron redox chemistry (redox couples: I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0) with electrochemically active tetrabutylammonium triiodide cathode exhibit the excellent specific energy density, representing a significant advancement in the field of halogen battery.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type batteries apply the principle that more charge transfer is preferable. The underutilized electron transfer mode within two undermines the electrochemical performance of halogen batteries. Here, we realised a three&#8208;electron transfer lithium&#8208;halogen battery based on I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0 couples by using a common commercial electrolyte saturated with Cl&#8722; anions. The resulting Li||tetrabutylammonium triiodide (TBAI3) cell exhibits three distinct discharging plateaus at 2.97, 3.40, and 3.85&#8197;V. Moreover, it has a high capacity of 631&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1I (265&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1electrode, based on entire mass loading) and record&#8208;high energy density of up to 2013&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1I (845&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1electrode). To support these findings, experimental characterisations and density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the redox chemistry involved in this novel interhalogen strategy. We believe our paradigm presented here has a foreseeable inspiring effect on other halogen batteries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pursuit.

         <title>Harnessing Transition Metal Scaffolds for Targeted Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious threats to public health but the problem is compounded by the lack of new drugs with new modes of action in the development pipeline. In this review, we spotlight four emerging antibacterial strategies that take advantages of the unique chemical properties of transition metal complexes, namely Trojan horse, triggered warhead release, &#8220;new&#8208;to&#8208;nature&#8221; chemistry, and biomimetic reactions. We further propose that transition metal complexes can replenish this diminishing stockpile of drug candidates by providing compounds with unique properties that are not easily accessible using pure organic scaffolds.







Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance, caused by persistent adaptation and growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to overprescribed antibiotics, poses one of the most serious and urgent threats to global public health. The limited pipeline of experimental antibiotics in development further exacerbates this looming crisis and new drugs with alternative modes of action are needed to tackle evolving pathogenic adaptation. Transition metal complexes can replenish this diminishing stockpile of drug candidates by providing compounds with unique properties that are not easily accessible using pure organic scaffolds. We spotlight four emerging strategies to harness these unique properties to develop new targeted antibacterial agents.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation&#8208;Induced Glycolate Aldol Additions of Silyl Glyoxylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral (diene)Rh(I) complex catalyzes the enantioselective three&#8208;component coupling reaction of silyl glyoxylates, boronic acids, and aldehydes to yield complex fully substituted mandelates. Notable features include the mild generation of chiral Rh&#8208;enolates by 1,2&#8208;Brook rearrangement and, from that point, modular preparation of glycolate aldol adducts.







Abstract
(Diene)Rh(I) complexes catalyze the stereoselective three&#8208;component coupling of silyl glyoxylates, arylboronic acids, and aldehydes to give glycolate aldol products. The participation of Rh&#8208;alkoxides in the requisite Brook rearrangement was established through two component Rh&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silyl glyoxylates with ArB(OH)2 to give silyl&#8208;protected mandelate derivatives. The intermediacy of a chiral Rh&#8208;enolate was inferred through enantioselective protonation using a chiral Rh&#8208;catalyst. Diastereoselective three&#8208;component couplings with aldehydes as terminating electrophiles to give racemic products were best achieved with a bulky aryl ester on the silyl glyoxylate reagent. Optimal enantioselective couplings were carried out with the tert&#8208;butyl ester variant using an anisole&#8208;derived enantiopure tricyclo[3.2.2.02,4]nonadiene ligand.

         <title>Multitargeting Prodrugs that Release Oxaliplatin, Doxorubicin and Gemcitabine are Potent Inhibitors of Tumor Growth and Effective Inducers of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtIV prodrug (2) can release Gem, Oxal, and Dox in their active form upon cellular reduction. It effectively induces release of ICD markers, DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells and exhibited superior in vivo tumor growth inhibition in two murine models (LLC and CT26) with significantly lower body weight loss. An ICD re&#8208;challenge study showed better tumor free survival compared to the FDA drugs.







Abstract
A multitargeting prodrug (2) that releases gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin in their active form in cancer cells is a potent cytotoxic agent with nM IC50s; it is highly selective to cancer cells with mean selectivity indices to human (136) and murine (320) cancer cells. It effectively induces release of DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells facilitating more efficient phagocytosis by J774 macrophages than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration. The viability of CT26 cells co&#8208;cultured with J774 macrophages and treated with 2 was reduced by 32&#8201;% compared to the non&#8208;treated cells, suggesting a synergistic antiproliferative effect between the chemical and immune reactions. 2 inhibited in vivo tumor growth in two murine models (LLC and CT26) better than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration with significantly lower body weight loss. Mice inoculated with CT26 cells treated with 2 showed slightly better tumor free survival than doxorubicin.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Unstrained Heterocycles Using Cobalt Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt catalysts promote enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of unstrained heterocycles by the reductive addition of 1,1&#8208;dichloroalkenes. The products are acyclic homoallylic alcohols containing a vinylzinc motif, which can be further functionalized with an electrophile. Mechanistic studies suggest that ring&#8208;opening occurs by an outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by a Zn(II) Lewis acid.







Abstract
Cobalt catalysts promote highly enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans using vinylidenes. The products are acyclic organozinc compounds that can be functionalized with an electrophile. The proposed mechanism involves the generation of a cobalt vinylidene species that adds to the alkene by a [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition pathway. Ring&#8208;opening then occurs via outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by coordination of a ZnX2 Lewis acid to the alkoxide leaving group. DFT models reveal that competing inner&#8208;sphere syn &#946;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;O elimination pathways are suppressed by the geometric constraints of the metallacycle intermediate. These models rationalize the observed stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

         <title>Enzymatic Oxy&#8208; and Amino&#8208;Functionalization in Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygenation and amination reactions are widely spread in synthetic chemistry to produce valuable compounds. Nowadays, the importance of sustainable strategies to introduce oxygen and amino functionalities into organic molecules is increasing. This review discusses recent examples of multi&#8208;step biocatalytic cascades involving oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions to produce value&#8208;added compounds such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors.







Abstract
Biocatalytic cascades are a powerful tool for building complex molecules containing oxygen and nitrogen functionalities. Moreover, the combination of multiple enzymes in one pot offers the possibility to minimize downstream processing and waste production. In this review, we illustrate various recent efforts in the development of multi&#8208;step syntheses involving C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming enzymes to produce high value&#8208;added compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors. Both in vitro and in vivo examples are discussed, revealing the respective advantages and drawbacks. The use of engineered enzymes to boost the cascades outcome is also addressed and current co&#8208;substrate and cofactor recycling strategies are presented, highlighting the importance of atom economy. Finally, tools to overcome current challenges for multi&#8208;enzymatic oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions are discussed, including flow systems with immobilized biocatalysts and cascades in confined nanomaterials.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Phase&#8208;Separating Fluorescent Molecules for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we designed a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compound that forms molecular coacervates based on liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the aqueous solution. The molecular coacervates deliver proteins into mammalian cells and disperse the payload within the cytosol upon photoillumination. This work showcases a small&#8208;molecule coacervation system and photoresponsive cytosolic protein delivery.







Abstract
Cellular membranes, including the plasma and endosome membranes, are barriers to outside proteins. Various vehicles have been devised to deliver proteins across the plasma membrane, but in many cases, the payload gets trapped in the endosome. Here we designed a photo&#8208;responsive phase&#8208;separating fluorescent molecule (PPFM) with a molecular weight of 666.8 daltons. The PPFM compound condensates as fluorescent droplets in the aqueous solution by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), which disintegrate upon photoirradiation with a 405&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) lamp within 20&#8197;min or a 405&#8197;nm laser within 3&#8197;min. The PPFM coacervates recruit a wide range of peptides and proteins and deliver them into mammalian cells. Photolysis disperses the payload from condensates into the cytosolic space. Altogether, a type of small molecules that are photo&#8208;responsive and phase separating are discovered; their coacervates can serve as transmembrane vehicles for intracellular delivery of proteins, whereas photo illumination triggers the cytosolic distribution of the payload.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we designed a low-molecular-weight compound that forms molecular coacervates based on liquid-liquid phase separation in the aqueous solution. The molecular coacervates deliver proteins into mammalian cells and disperse the payload within the cytosol upon photoillumination. This work showcases a small-molecule coacervation system and photoresponsive cytosolic protein delivery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular membranes, including the plasma and endosome membranes, are barriers to outside proteins. Various vehicles have been devised to deliver proteins across the plasma membrane, but in many cases, the payload gets trapped in the endosome. Here we designed a photo-responsive phase-separating fluorescent molecule (&lt;b&gt;PPFM&lt;/b&gt;) with a molecular weight of 666.8 daltons. The PPFM compound condensates as fluorescent droplets in the aqueous solution by liquid-liquid phase separation (&lt;b&gt;LLPS&lt;/b&gt;), which disintegrate upon photoirradiation with a 405&#8197;nm light-emitting diode (&lt;b&gt;LED&lt;/b&gt;) lamp within 20&#8197;min or a 405&#8197;nm laser within 3&#8197;min. The PPFM coacervates recruit a wide range of peptides and proteins and deliver them into mammalian cells. Photolysis disperses the payload from condensates into the cytosolic space.

         <title>Superparamagnetic Composite Nanobeads Anchored with Molecular Glues for Ultrasensitive Label&#8208;free Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coverage of label&#8208;free proteomics for precious trace specimens is limited due to redundant pretreatments. We design molecular glue&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles equipped with protein anchors to capture proteins in complex trace biological samples. We propose a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) in one single tube to reduce protein loss for ultrasensitive proteomic analysis.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry has emerged as a mainstream technique for label&#8208;free proteomics. However, proteomic coverage for trace samples is constrained by adsorption loss during repeated elution at sample pretreatment. Here, we demonstrated superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles functionalized with molecular glues (MGs) to enrich proteins in trace human biofluid. We showed high protein binding (&gt;95&#8201;%) and recovery (&#8776;90&#8201;%) rates by anchor&#8208;nanoparticles. We further proposed a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) method that enabled unbiased protein capture, protein digestion and pure peptides elution in one single tube. We demonstrated SWAP to quantify over 2500 protein groups with 100 HEK 293T cells. We adopted SWAP to profile proteomics with trace aqueous humor samples from cataract (n=15) and wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (n=8) patients, and quantified &#8776;1400 proteins from 5&#8197;&#956;L aqueous humor. SWAP simplifies sample preparation steps, minimizes adsorption loss and improves protein coverage for label&#8208;free proteomics with previous trace samples.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;methanobactin OB3b, a unique carcerand&#8208;like chalkophore, is reported. Key features were a cyclodehydratation&#8208;thioacylation sequence for accessing two unprecedented azlactone building blocks and metal ion&#8208;templation for enabling cyclization of the methanobactin peptide backbone.







Abstract
Methanobactin OB3b (Mbn&#8208;OB3b) is a unique natural product with stunning affinity for copper ions (Ka&#8776;Cu(I) 1034). Here, we report the first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;bound methanobactin OB3b featuring as key transformations a cyclodehydration&#8208;thioacylation sequence, to generate the conjugated heterocyclic systems, and a copper&#8208;templated cyclization, to complete the caged structure of the very sensitive target compound.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Absorbing Monodispersed Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) light absorption were developed based on resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). Interesting properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance are demonstrated with the monodisperse oligomers. The pentamer exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength of 1169&#8197;nm, which is the longest for oligomers reported so far. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with the tetramer as the electron acceptor shows a peak specific detectivity of 2.98&#215;1011 Jones at 1180&#8197;nm under zero bias, which is among the best for NIR II OPDs.







Abstract
Organic molecules with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR II) light absorption are essential for many biological and opto&#8208;electronic applications. Herein, we report monodispersed oligomers as NIR II light absorber using a new molecular design strategy of resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). We synthesize a series of monodispersed oligomers with thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TB), which contains resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, as the repeating unit. The TB pentamer exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength of 1169&#8197;nm, which is the longest for oligomers reported so far. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with the TB tetramer as the electron acceptor shows the specific detectivity of 2.98&#215;1011 Jones at 1180&#8197;nm under zero bias. This performance is among the best for NIR II OPDs. These results indicate a new kind of NIR II absorbing molecules as excellent opto&#8208;electronic materials.

         <title>Functionalization of Pentacene: A Facile and Versatile Approach to Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple two&#8208;step synthesis procedure involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes has proven to be the key step in the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Despite their highly nonplanar conformations, these contorted PAHs also exhibited emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
In this work, a facile and versatile strategy for the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) starting from the functionalized pentacene was established. A series of novel PAHs 1&#8211;4 and their derivatives were synthesized through a simple two&#8208;step synthesis procedure involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes 5&#8211;8 as a key step. All the molecules were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied in detail. Interestingly, the most striking feature of 1&#8211;4 is their highly contorted carbon structures and the accompanying helical chirality. In particular, the optical resolution of 2 was successfully achieved by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC, and the enantiomers were characterized by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence spectroscopy. Despite the highly nonplanar conformations, these contorted PAHs exhibited emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields, implying the potential utility of this series PAHs as high&#8208;quality organic laser dyes. By using a self&#8208;assembly method with the help of epoxy resin, a bottle microlaser based on 3&#8201;a was successfully illustrated with a lasing wavelength of 567.8&#8197;nm at a threshold of 0.3&#8197;mJ/cm2. We believe that this work will shed light on the chemical versatility of pentacene and its derivatives in the construction of novel functionalized PAHs.

         <title>Asymmetric Allenylation of Alkynes mediated by Chiral Organoselenated Reagents under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium&#8208;mediated methodology for the asymmetric synthesis of allenyl amides is described. This was achieved in two steps from simple alkynes, and features highly stereocontrolled &#946;&#8208;H&#8208;syn&#8208;eliminations of vinyl selenoxides performed with good yields and ee up to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
The reactivity of novel chiral lactamide&#8208;substituted diselenide&#8208;based reagents under oxidative conditions was exploited to develop a metal&#8208;free method for the preparation of enantioenriched allenylamides from simple alkynes in good yields, and with enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The key of the success in this method is attributed to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded lactamide appendages that ensure configurational stability of chiral vinyl selenoxide intermediates for an optimal enantiotopic &#946;&#8208;syn&#8208;elimination step.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane over Au1Ag Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Modified ZnO with Oxygen and Water Vapor: Synergy of Gold and Silver</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Au1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticles&#8208;modified ZnO catalyst exhibits excellent C2H6 yield via photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane with O2 and H2O. Au single atoms in Au1Ag alloy effectively activate O2 and H2O into *OOH, promoting C&#8722;H activation of CH4 to form *CH3 on ZnO. Electron deficient Au single atoms effectively transfer electron donor *CH3 from ZnO to the Ag of the Au1Ag alloy, promoting subsequent *CH3 coupling to form C2H6.







Abstract
C&#8722;H dissociation and C&#8722;C coupling are two key steps in converting CH4 into multi&#8208;carbon compounds. Here we report a synergy of Au and Ag to greatly promote C2H6 formation over Au1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticles (Au1Ag NPs)&#8208;modified ZnO catalyst via photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (POCM) with O2 and H2O. Atomically dispersed Au in Au1Ag NPs effectively promotes the dissociation of O2 and H2O into *OOH, promoting C&#8722;H activation of CH4 on the photogenerated O&#8722; to form *CH3. Electron&#8208;deficient Au single atoms, as hopping ladders, also facilitate the migration of electron donor *CH3 from ZnO to Au1Ag NPs. Finally, *CH3 coupling can readily occur on Ag atoms of Au1Ag NPs. An excellent C2H6 yield of 14.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 79&#8201;% and an apparent quantum yield of 14.6&#8201;% at 350&#8197;nm is obtained via POCM with O2 and H2O, which is at least two times that of the photocatalytic system. The bimetallic synergistic strategy offers guidance for future catalyst design for POCM with O2 and H2O.

         <title>Creating an amyloid &#8216;kaleidoscope&#8217; using short iodinated peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide fibrils are widely used as functional biomaterials, but the understanding at atomic level remains limited. In this study, we determined the fibril atomic structures of GFGGNDNFG and three iodinated derivatives to understand how the introduction of iodine affects the fibril structure and properties. Additionally, we designed a novel iodinated peptide, and its fibril properties and structures align well with our design expectations.







Abstract
Amyloid fibrils formed by peptides with different sequences exhibit diversified morphologies, material properties and activities, making them valuable for developing functional bionanomaterials. However, the molecular understanding underlying the structural diversity of peptide fibrillar assembly at atomic level is still lacking. In this study, by using cryogenic electron microscopy, we first revealed the structural basis underlying the highly reversible assembly of 1GFGGNDNFG9 (referred to as hnRAC1) peptide fibril. Furthermore, by installing iodine at different sites of hnRAC1, we generated a collection of peptide fibrils with distinct thermostability. By determining the atomic structures of the iodinated fibrils, we discovered that iodination at different sites of the peptide facilitates the formation of diverse halogen bonds and triggers the assembly of entirely different structures of iodinated fibrils. Finally, based on this structural knowledge, we designed an iodinated peptide that assembles into new atomic structures of fibrils, exhibiting superior thermostability, that aligned with our design. Our work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the atomic&#8208;level processes underlying the formation of diverse peptide fibril structures, and paves the way for creating an amyloid &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221; by employing various modifications and peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune the atomic structure and properties of fibrillar nanostructures.

         <title>Modulating the Reaction Configuration by Breaking the Structural Symmetry of Active Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetrical active site with a polarized electronic structure in oxygen vacancy contained Co3O4 hollow nanoparticles on ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon framework switches the CO2 reaction configuration from a single&#8208;site linear model to a multiple&#8208;site bending one, enabling a high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 even under natural sunlight.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 is considered as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the environmental and energy issues. However, the weak CO2 adsorption and tough CO2 activation process seriously compromise the CO production, due to the chemical inertness of CO2 molecule and the formed fragile metal&#8208;C/O bond. Herein, we designed and fabricated oxygen vacancy contained Co3O4 hollow nanoparticles on ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon framework (Vo&#8722;HCo3O4/OMNC) towards photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2. In situ spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the constructed oxygen vacancy is able to break the local structural symmetry of Co&#8722;O&#8722;Co sites. The formation of asymmetric active site switches the CO2 configuration from a single&#8208;site linear model to a multiple&#8208;sites bending one with a highly stable configuration, enhancing the binding and structural polarization of CO2 molecules. As a result, Vo&#8722;HCo3O4/OMNC shows unprecedent activity in the photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (10&#8201;% CO2/Ar) under laboratory light source or even natural sunlight, affording a syngas yield of 337.8 or 95.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with an apparent quantum yield up to 4.2&#8201;%.

         <title>77&#8201;% Photothermal Conversion in Blatter&#8208;Type Diradicals: Photophysics and Photodynamic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conical intersection between the lowest energy excited state and the ground state of the Blatter&#8208;type diradical is responsible for highly efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion of the absorbed radiation. Also, it is first applied to photothermal therapy of tumor cells, demonstrating good stability and the highest photo&#8208;thermal conversion in the diradicaloid field.







Abstract
Diradicals based on the Blatter units and connected by acetylene and alkene spacers have been prepared. All the molecules show sizably large diradical character and low energy singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Their photo&#8208;physical properties concerning their lowest energy excited state have been studied in detail by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy. We have fully identified the main optical absorption band and full absence of emission from the lowest energy excited state.

     alt="77&#8201;% Photothermal Conversion in Blatter-Type Diradicals: Photophysics and Photodynamic Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conical intersection between the lowest energy excited state and the ground state of the Blatter-type diradical is responsible for highly efficient light-to-heat conversion of the absorbed radiation. Also, it is first applied to photothermal therapy of tumor cells, demonstrating good stability and the highest photo-thermal conversion in the diradicaloid field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diradicals based on the Blatter units and connected by acetylene and alkene spacers have been prepared. All the molecules show sizably large diradical character and low energy singlet-triplet gaps. Their photo-physical properties concerning their lowest energy excited state have been studied in detail by steady-state and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. We have fully identified the main optical absorption band and full absence of emission from the lowest energy excited state. A computational study has been also carried out that has helped to identify the presence of a conical intersection between the lowest energy excited state and the ground state which produces a highly efficient light-to-heat conversion of the absorbed radiation. Furthermore, an outstanding photo-thermal conversion 77.23&#8201;% has been confirmed, close to the highest in the diradicaloid field. For the first time, stable diradicals are applied to photo-thermal therapy of tumor cells with good stability and satisfactory performance at near-infrared region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a fully orthogonal olefination, which involves the site&#8208; and E&#8208;selective coupling of aryl germanes with alkenes, tolerating otherwise widely employed coupling handles such as aromatic (pseudo)halogens (C&#8211;I, C&#8211;Br, C&#8211;Cl, C&#8211;F, C&#8211; OTf, C&#8211;OSO2F), silanes and boronic acid derivatives as well as alternative functionalities. This unprecedented [Ge]&#8208;based oxidative Heck coupling proceeds at room temperature with high speed (10 min to 2 hours) and operational simplicity owing to its base&#8208;free and air&#8208;tolerant features.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy&#8208;atom tunneling limits the lifetime and observability of bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene, a key intermediate in the rearrangement of phenylcarbene. Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene had been proposed as the primary intermediate of the rearrangement of phenylcarbene, but despite many efforts evaded its characterization even in cryogenic matrices. By introducing fluorine substituents into the ortho&#8208;positions of the phenyl ring of phenylcarbene, the highly strained cyclopropene 1,5&#8208;difluorobicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene becomes stable enough to be characterized in cryogenic matrices. However, even at 3 K this cyclopropene is only metastable and rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to the corresponding cycloheptatetraene. Calculations suggest that the fluorination is necessary to slow down the tunneling rearrangement of the bicycloheptatriene. The parent bicycloheptatriene rapidly rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunnelling and therefore cannot be detected in cryogenic matrices.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive Supramolecular Networks: Emergent Sensing from Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular differentiation by supramolecular sensors is typically achieved through sensor arrays, relying on the pattern recognition responses of large panels of isolated sensing elements. Here we report a new one&#8208;pot systems chemistry approach to differential sensing in biological solutions. We constructed an adaptive network of three cross&#8208;assembling sensor elements with diverse analyte&#8208;binding and photophysical properties. This robust sensing approach exploits complex interconnected sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte equilibria, producing emergent supramolecular and photophysical responses unique to each analyte. We characterize the basic mechanisms by which an adaptive network responds to analytes. The inherently data&#8208;rich responses of an adaptive network discriminate among very closely related proteins&#160;and protein mixtures&#160;without relying on designed protein recognition elements. We show that a single adaptive sensing solution provides better analyte discrimination using fewer response observations than a sensor array built from the same components. We also show the network&#8217;s ability to adapt and respond to changing biological solutions over time.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane and Propane over Copper&#8208;Containing Mordenite: Insights into Reaction Mechanism and Product Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite (CuMOR) is capable of activation of C&#8208;H bonds in C1&#8208;C3 alkanes, albeit there are remarkable differences between the functionalization of ethane and propane compared to methane. The reaction of ethane and propane with CuMOR results in the formation of ethylene and propylene, while the reaction of methane predominantly yields methanol and dimethyl ether. By combining in situ FTIR and MAS NMR spectroscopies as well as time&#8208;resolved Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the reaction mechanism was derived, which differs significantly for each alkane. The formation of ethylene and propylene proceeds via oxidative dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes with selectivity above 95% for ethane and above 85 % for propane. The formation of stable &#960;&#8208;complexes of olefins with CuI sites, formed upon reduction of CuII&#8208;oxo species, protects olefins from further oxidation and/or oligomerization. This is different from methane, the activation of which proceeds via oxidative hydroxylation leading to the formation of surface methoxy species bonded to the zeolite framework. Our findings constitute one of the major steps in the direct conversion of alkanes to important commodities and open a novel research direction aiming at the selective synthesis of olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Lead for Tin in PbHfO3: Noncubic Structure of SnHfO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The removal of lead from commercialized perovskite&#8208;oxide&#8208;based piezoceramics has been a recent major topic in materials research owing to legislation in many countries. In this regard, Sn(II)&#8208;perovskite oxides have garnered keen interest due to their predicted large spontaneous electric polarizations and isoelectronic nature for substitution of Pb(II) cations. However, they have not been considered synthesizable owing to their high metastability. Herein, the perovskite lead hafnate, i.e., PbHfO3 in space group Pbam, is shown to react with SnClF at a low temperature of 300 &#176;C, and resulting in the first complete Sn(II)&#8208;for&#8208;Pb(II) substitution, i.e. SnHfO3. During this topotactic transformation, a high purity and crystallinity is conserved with Pbam symmetry, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction, elemental analysis, and 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. In situ diffraction shows SnHfO3 also possesses reversible phase transformations and is potentially polar between ~130&#8208;200 &#176;C. This so&#8208;called &#8216;de&#8208;leadification&#8217; is thus shown to represent a highly useful strategy to fully remove lead from perovskite&#8208;oxide&#8208;based piezoceramics and opening the door to new explorations of polar and antipolar Sn(II)&#8208;oxide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Interphasial Pre&#8208;lithiation and Reinforcement of Micro&#8208;Si Anode through Fluorine&#8208;free Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micro&#8208;sized silicon (mSi) anodes offer advantages in cost and tap density over nanosized counterparts. However, its practical application still suffers from poor cyclability and low initial and later&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency (CE), caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and irreversible lithiation of the surface oxide layer. Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)&#8208;free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre&#8208;lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH4, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network. The significance of this F&#8208;free electrolyte brings unprecedented F&#8208;free interphase that also enables the high&#8208;performance mSi electrode (80 wt% mSi), including high specific capacity of 2900 mAh/g, high initial CE of 94.7% and excellent cyclability capacity retention of 94.3% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. This work confirms the feasibility of F&#8208;free interphase, thus opening up a new avenue toward cost&#8208;advantaged and environmentally friendly electrolytes for more emerging battery systems.</dc:description>

Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)-free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre-lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH4, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network.

         <title>Ferric Single&#8208;Site Catalyst Confined in a Zeolite Framework for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a highly efficient approach for propene industry that is commonly catalyzed by noble Pt or toxic Cr catalysts and suffers from coking. In this work, zeolite framework confined ferric catalyst was synthesized by hydrothermal procedure. The isolated Fe in the framework formed distorted tetrahedron, which was beneficial for the selectively dehydrogenation of propane and reached over 95% propene selectivity and over 99% total olefins selectivity. This catalyst had silanol free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable and coke free, with the deactivation constant of 0.01 h&#8208;1. This study provided a guidance for the synthesis of structural heteroatomic zeolite and efficient propane non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation over early&#8208;transition metal.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Manganese and Iminium Catalysis: Selective Hydroalkenylation of Unsaturated Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of synergistic catalytic strategy can usually circumvent the intrinsic limitations of one catalytic system. In this communication, we disclose a cooperative catalysis strategy of manganese and iminium catalysis to realize selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Its success stems from the LUMO activation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds with secondary amines as the organocatalyst and the synergistic HOMO activation of alkenylboronic acids with Mn2(CO)8Br2. This protocol exhibits several synthetic advances, e.g., simple operation, good functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. The theoretical calculation indicates the migratory insertion followed by demetallation&#8208;isomerization process is kinetically more favorable than Michael&#8208;like nucleophilic addition. The use of proline&#8208;derived organocatalyst together with mangansese(I) catalyst can deliver the desired products in moderate enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Carbanionic Synthesis of Fully Bio&#8208;Based Triblock Structures Derived from &#946;&#8208;Farnesene and ll&#8208;Dilactide: Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the bifunctional carbanionic polymerization of &#946;&#8208;farnesene and subsequent end&#8208;functionalization with ethoxy ethyl glycidyl ether, telechelic multihydroxy functional polyfarnesene is accessible. Via organobase&#8208;catalyzed ROP of ll&#8208;dilactide a fully bio&#8208;based A2BA2&#8208;type block copolymer structure was generated. The material was investigated in terms of its morphology, mechanical and thermoplastic elastomer properties.







Abstract
Current environmental challenges and the shrinking fossil&#8208;fuel feedstock are important criteria for the next generation of polymer materials. In this context, we present a fully bio&#8208;based material, which shows promise as a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Due to the use of &#946;&#8208;farnesene and L&#8208;lactide as monomers, bio&#8208;based feedstocks, namely sugar cane and corn, can be used. A bifunctional initiator for the carbanionic polymerization was employed, to permit an efficient synthesis of ABA&#8208;type block structures. In addition, the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent MTBE (methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether) was used for the anionic polymerisation, enabling excellent solubility of the bifunctional anionic initiator. This afforded low dispersity (&#272;=1.07 to 1.10) and telechelic polyfarnesene macroinitiators. These were employed for lactide polymerization to obtain H&#8208;shaped triblock copolymers. TEM and SAXS revealed clearly phase&#8208;separated morphologies, and tensile tests demonstrated elastic mechanical properties. The materials featured two glass transition temperatures, at &#8208; 66&#8201;&#176;C and 51&#8201;&#176;C as well as gyroid or cylindrical morphologies, resulting in soft elastic materials at room temperature.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Electrolyte Concentration and Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Surface toward Actuating Fast Zn2+ Dehydration for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional porous coating on zinc electrode is emerging as a powerful ionic sieve to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby improving highly reversible aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, the ultrafast charge rate is limited by the substantial cation transmission strongly associated with dehydration efficiency. Here, we unveil the entire dynamic process of solvated Zn2+ ions&#8217; continuous dehydration from electrolyte across the MOF&#8208;electrolyte interface into channels with the aid of molecular simulations, taking zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The moderate concentration of 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte being advantageous over other concentrations possesses the homogeneous water&#8208;mediated ion pairing distribution, resulting in the lowest dehydration energy, which elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying such concentration adopted by numerous experimental studies. Furthermore, we show that modifying linkers on the ZIF&#8208;7 surface with hydrophilic groups such as &#8208;OH or &#8208;NH2 can weaken the solvation shell of Zn2+ ions to lower the dehydration free energy by approximately 1 eV, and may improve the electrical conductivity of MOF. These results shed light on the ions delivery mechanism and pave way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities through atomic&#8208;scale modification of functional porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Bis(oxalate)borate Additive for Self&#8208;repairing Zincophilic Solid Electrolyte Interphases towards Ultrahigh&#8208;rate and Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in Zn anode stabilization but its long&#8208;term effectiveness at high rates is still challenged. Herein, to achieve superior long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate Zn anode, an exquisite electrolyte additive, lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), is proposed to in&#8208;situ derive a highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI and to dynamically patrol its cycling&#8208;initiated defects. Profiting from the as&#8208;constructed real&#8208;time, automatic SEI repairing mechanism, the Zn anode can be cycled with distinct reversibility over 1800 h at an ultrahigh current density of 50 mA cm&#8208;2, presenting a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity up to 45 Ah cm&#8722;2. The superiority of the formulated electrolyte is further demonstrated in the Zn||MnO2 and Zn||NaV3O8 full batteries, even when tested under harsh conditions (limited Zn supply (N/P&#8776;3), 2500 cycles). This work brings inspiration for developing fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries toward grid&#8208;scale storage of renewable energy sources.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shape&#8208;changing polymeric materials have gained significant attention in the field of bioinspired soft robotics. However, challenges remain in versatilizing the shape&#8208;morphing process to suit different tasks and environments, and in designing systems that combine reversible actuation and self&#8208;healing ability. Here, we report halogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) that can be arbitrarily shape&#8208;programmed and that self&#8208;heal under mild thermal or photothermal stimulation. We incorporate halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating diiodotetrafluorobenzene molecules as dynamic supramolecular crosslinks into the LCEs and show that these relatively weak crosslinks are pertinent for their mechanical programming and self&#8208;healing. Utilizing the halogen&#8208;bonded LCEs, we demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept soft robotic motions such as crawling and rolling with programmed velocities. Our results showcase halogen bonding as a promising, yet unexplored tool for the preparation of smart supramolecular constructs for the development of advanced soft actuators.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Proteins with highly hydrophobic regions or aggregation&#8208;prone sequences are typically difficult targets for chemical synthesis at the current stage, as obtaining such type of peptides via solid phase peptide synthesis requires sophisticated operations. Herein, we report the N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) as robust and effective building blocks to allow direct synthesis of difficult peptides/proteins via a kinked backbone strategy. The effectiveness and easy accessibility of NBDs have been well demonstrated in our chemical syntheses of various challenging peptides/proteins, including chemokine, therapeutic hormones, histone and glycosylated erythropoietin.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Subphthalocyanine Cage as Catalytic Container for the Functionalization of Fullerenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first example of a supramolecular cage that works as a catalytic molecular reactor to perform transformations over fullerenes in aqueous medium. Taking advantage of the ability of metallo&#8208;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine (SubPc) capsules to form stable host:guest complexes with C60, we have prepared a water&#8208;soluble cage that provides a hydrophobic environment for conducting cycloadditions over encapsulated C60, namely, Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with anthracene. Indeed, the presence of catalytic amounts of solubilized SubPc cage promotes co&#8208;encapsulation of insoluble C60 and anthracene substrates, allowing the reaction to occur inside the cavity under mild conditions. The lower stability of the host:guest complex with the C60 cycloadduct facilitates displacement by pristine C60, allowing catalytic turnover. Moreover, bis&#8208;addition compounds are regioselectively formed inside the cage when using excess anthracene.</dc:description>

         <title>Wetting vs Droplet Aggregation: A Broadband Rotational Spectroscopic Study of 3&#8208;Methylcatechol &#8943; Water Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two competing solvation pathways of 3&#8208;methylcatechol (MC), an atmospherically relevant aromatic molecule, with up to five water molecules were explored in detail by using a combination of broadband rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Theoretically, two different pathways of solvation emerge: the commonly observed droplet pathway which involves preferential binding among the water molecules while the solute serves as an anchor point for the formation of a water cluster, and an unexpected wetting pathway which involves interactions between the water molecules and the aromatic face of MC, i.e., a wetting of the &#960;&#8208;surface. Conclusive identification of the MC hydrate structures, and therefore the wetting pathway, was facilitated by rotational spectra of the parent MC hydrates and several H218O and 13C isotopologues which exhibit splittings associated with methyl internal rotation and/or water tunneling motions. Theoretical modelling and analyses offer insights into the tunneling and conversion barriers associated with the observed hydrate conformers and the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interactions involved in choosing the unusual wetting pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Cobalt/Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysts for Synergistically Boosting Hydrogen Generation from Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of practical materials for (de)hydrogenation reactions is a prerequisite for the launch of a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, we present the design and construction of an atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal site Co/Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst allowing significantly improved dehydrogenation of formic acid, which is available from carbon dioxide and green hydrogen. The active catalyst centers consist of specific CoCuN6 moieties with double&#8208;N&#8208;bridged adjacent metal&#8208;N4 clusters decorated on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support. At optimal conditions the dehydrogenation performance of the nanostructured material (mass activity 77.7 L&#183;gmetal&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) is up to 40 times higher compared to commercial 5% Pd/C. In situ spectroscopic and kinetic isotope effect experiments indicate that Co/Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C promoted formic acid dehydrogenation follows the so&#8208;called formate pathway with the C&#8208;H dissociation of HCOO* as the rate&#8208;determining step. Theoretical calculations reveal that Cu in the CoCuN6 moiety synergistically contributes to the adsorption of intermediate HCOO* and raise the d&#8208;band center of Co to favor HCOO* activation and thereby lower the reaction energy barrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Programmable Enzymatic Nanorobot Arm&#160;to Modulate Anisotropic Gold Nanoparticle Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Programmable assembly of gold nanoparticle superstructures with precise spatial arrangement has drawn much attentions for their unique characteristics in plasmonics and biomedicine. Bio&#8208;inspired methods have already provided programmable, molecular approaches to direct AuNP assemblies using biopolymers. The existing methods, however, predominantly use DNA as scaffolds to directly guide the AuNP interactions to produce intended superstructures. New paradigms for regulating AuNP assembly will greatly enrich the toolbox for DNA&#8208;directed AuNP manipulation and fabrication. Here, we developed a strategy of spatially programmable enzymatic nanorobot arm&#160;to modulate anisotropic DNA surface modifications and assembly of AuNPs. Through spatial controls of the proximity of the reactants, the locations of the modifications were precisely regulated. We demonstrated the control of the modifications on a single 15 nm AuNP, as well as on a rectangular DNA origami platform, to direct unique anisotropic AuNP assemblies. This method adds an alternative enzymatic manipulation to DNA&#8208;directed AuNP superstructure assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Unique Octupolar 2D&#8208;Polymer Frameworks as Mixed Conductors and Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts for Dual&#8208;Promoted Li and S Electrochemistry: Multi&#8208;regulation Role of Ethoxylation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we for the first time introduce ethoxylation chemistry to develop a new octupolar cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked 2D polymer framework (Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO) capable of acting as efficient mixed electron/ion conductors and metal&#8208;free sulfur evolution catalysts for dual&#8208;promoted Li and S electrochemistry. Our strategy creates a unique interconnected network of strongly&#8208;coupled donor 3&#8208;(acceptor&#8208;core) octupoles in Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO, affording enhanced intramolecular charge transfer, substantial active sites and crowded open channels. This enables Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO as a new versatile separator modifier, which endows the modified separator with superior catalytic activity for sulfur conversion and rapid Li ion conduction with the high Li+ transference number up to 0.94. Thus, the incorporation of Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO can concurrently regulate sulfur redox reactions and Li&#8208;ion flux in Li&#8208;S cells, attaining boosted bidirectional redox kinetics, inhibited polysulfide shuttle and dendrite&#8208;free Li anodes. The Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO&#8208;involved Li&#8208;S cell is endowed with excellent overall electrochemical performance especially large areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm&#8211;2 at high sulfur loading of 8.7 mg cm&#8211;2. Mechanistic studies unveil the dominant multi&#8208;promoting effect of the triethoxylation on electron and ion conduction, polysulfide adsorption and catalytic conversion as well as previously&#8208;unexplored &#8208;CN/C&#8208;O dual&#8208;site synergistic effect for enhanced polysulfide adsorption and reduced energy barrier toward Li2S conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)&#8208;Ladder&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fast Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical proton storage plays an essential role in designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;rate energy storage devices, e.g., aqueous batteries. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs) are promising electrode materials, but their competitive proton and metal&#8208;ion insertion mechanisms remain elusive, and proton storage in COFs is rarely explored. Here, we report a perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;COF towards fast proton storage in both mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. We unveil that the discharged C&#8208;O&#8208; groups exhibit largely reduced basicity due to the considerable p&#8208;delocalization in perinone, thus affording the 2D c&#8208;COF a unique affinity to protons with fast kinetics. As a consequence, the 2D c&#8208;COF electrode presents outstanding rate capability up to 200 A g&#8208;1 (over 2500C), surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated polymers, COFs and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Our work reports the first example of pure proton storage among COFs and highlights the great potential of BBL&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D conjugated polymers in future energy devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Crosstalk between hepatic glutathione efflux and tumor targeting of ICG&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elevated glutathione (GSH) level in solid tumors has been used as a major hallmark for GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity. Meanwhile, GSH is mainly synthesized inside the hepatocytes of the liver in the body and constantly released into the blood through hepatic GSH efflux to regulate redox potential of the entire body. However, it remains largely unknown how the liver crosses talk with tumor in the nanoparticle targeting through hepatic GSH efflux. Herein, we report that depletion of hepatic GSH enhanced the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive indocyanine green&#8208;conjugated Au25 nanoclusters coated with 18 GSH ligand (ICG&#8208;Au25SG18). The dissociation of ICG from Au25SG18 by the hepatic GSH through thiol&#8208;exchange reaction and the subsequent hepatobiliary clearance of the detached ICG were slowed down by GSH depletion, which in turn prolonged the blood circulation of intact ICG&#8208;Au25SG18 and enhanced its tumor targeting. Our work highlights glutathione&#8208;mediated crosstalk between the liver and tumor, in addition to well&#8208;known Kupffer cell&#8208;mediated uptake, in the tumor targeting of engineered nanoparticles, which could be modulated to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity of cancer nanomedicines while reducing their nonspecific accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Reagent Engineering for Group Transfer Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis has become a major driver in the innovation of preparative chemistry. Enzyme discovery, engineering and computational design have matured to reliable strategies in the development of biocatalytic processes. By comparison, substrate engineering has received much less attention. In this minireview, we highlight the idea that the design of synthetic reagents may be an equally fruitful and complementary approach to develop novel enzyme&#8208;catalyzed group&#8208;transfer chemistry. This review discusses key examples from the literature that illustrate how synthetic substrates can be devised to improve the efficiency, scalability and sustainability, as well as the scope of such reactions. We also provide an opinion as to how this concept might be further developed in the future aspiring to replicate the evolutionary success story of natural group transfer reagents such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM).</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Induced Radical&#8208;Radical Heterocoupling Boosts Photodriven Oxidative Esterification of Benzyl Alcohol over Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of alcohols under mild conditions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in the bulk and fine chemical industry, which usually requires environmentally unfriendly oxidants and bases that are difficult to separate. Here, a plasmonic catalyst of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Co nanoparticles (Co@NC) with an excellent catalytic activity towards selective oxidation of alcohols is demonstrated. With light as only energy input, the plasmonic Co@NC catalyst effectively operates via combining action of the localized surface&#8208;plasmon resonances (LSPR) and the photothermal effects to achieve a factor of 7.8 times improvement compared with the activity of thermocatalysis. A high turnover frequency (TOF) of 15.6 h&#8208;1 is obtained under base&#8208;free condition, which surpasses all the reported catalytic performances of thermocatalytic analogues in the literature. Detail characterizations reveal that the d states of metallic Co gain the absorbed light energy, so the excitation of interband d&#8208;to&#8208;s transitions generates energetic electrons. LSPR&#8208;mediated charge injection to Co@NC surface activates molecular oxygen and alcohol molecules adsorbed on its surface to generate the corresponding radical species (e.g., &#8226;O2&#8722;, CH3O&#8226; and R&#8208;&#8226;CH&#8208;OH). The formation of multi&#8208;type radical species creates a direct and forward pathway of oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol to speed up the esters production.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Evidence of a Ni(0/II/III) Cycle for Nickel Photoredox Amide Arylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates the dominance of a Ni(0/II/III) cycle for Ni&#8208;photoredox amide arylation, which contrasts with other Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8208;heteroatom couplings that operate via Ni(I/III) self&#8208;sustained cycles. The kinetic data gathered when using different Ni precatalysts supports an initial Ni(0)&#8208;mediated oxidative addition into the aryl bromide. Using NiCl2 as the precatalyst resulted in an observable induction period, which was found to arise from a photochemical activation event to generate Ni(0) and to be prolonged by unproductive comproportionation between the Ni(II) precatalyst and the in&#8208;situ generated Ni(0) active species. Ligand exchange after oxidative addition yields a Ni(II) aryl amido complex, which was identified as the catalyst resting state for the reaction. Stoichiometric experiments showed that oxidation of this Ni(II) aryl amido intermediate was required to yield functionalized amide products. The kinetic data presented supports a rate&#8208;limiting photochemically&#8208;mediated Ni(II/III) oxidation to enable C&#8722;N reductive elimination. An alternative Ni(I/III) self&#8208;sustained manifold was discarded based on EPR and kinetic measurements. The mechanistic insights uncovered herein will inform the community on how subtle changes in Ni&#8208;photoredox reaction conditions may impact the reaction pathway, and have enabled us to include aryl chlorides as coupling partners and to reduce the Ni loading by 20&#8208;fold without any reactivity loss.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first coordination&#8208;saturated buckyball with C60 molecule totally encased in an icosidodecahedral Cu30 in a (&#956;30&#8208;(&#951;2)30)&#8208;fashion, namely C60@Cu30@Cl36N12, has been successfully realized via a C60&#8208;templated assembly. The 48 outmost coordinating atoms (36Cl + 12N) comprise a new simplicial polyhedron that is described by a ccf topology.&#160; Charge transfer from (CuI, Cl) to C60 explains the expansion of light absorption up to 700 nm, and accounts for an ultrafast photophysical process that underpins its high photothermal conversion efficiency. This work puts a giant step forward in exohedral metallofullerene (ExMF) chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternatives to Styrene&#8208; and Diisobutylene&#8208;based Copolymers for Membrane Protein Solubilization via Nanodisc Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Styrene&#8208;maleic acid copolymers (SMAs), and related amphiphilic copolymers, are promising tools for isolating and studying integral membrane proteins in a native&#8208;like state. However, they do not exhibit this ability universally, as several reports have found that SMAs and related amphiphilic copolymers show little to no efficiency when extracting specific membrane proteins. Recently, it was discovered that esterified SMAs could enhance the selective extraction of trimeric Photosystem I from the thylakoid membranes of the thermophilic cyanobacteria; however, these polymers are susceptible to saponification that can result from harsh preparation or storage conditions. To address this concern, we herein describe the development of &#945;&#8208;olefin&#8208;maleic acid copolymers (&#945;MAs) that can extract trimeric PSI from cyanobacterial membranes with the highest extraction efficiencies observed when using any amphiphilic copolymers, including diisobutylene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic acid (DIBMA) and functionalized SMA samples. Furthermore, we will show that &#945;MAs facilitate the formation of photosystem I&#8208;containing nanodiscs that retain an annulus of native lipids and a native&#8208;like activity. We also highlight how &#945;MAs provide an agile, tailorable synthetic platform that enables fine&#8208;tuning hydrophobicity, controllable molar mass, and consistent monomer incorporation while overcoming shortcomings of prior amphiphilic copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Type&#8208;I Photosensitizer with Quenched&#160;Photosensitization Pre and Post Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phototoxicity of photosensitizers (PSs) pre and post Photodynamic therapy&#160;(PDT), and the hypoxic&#160;tumor microenvironment are two major problems limiting the application of&#160;PDT.&#160;While activatable PSs can successfully address the PS phototoxicity pre&#8208; PDT, and type&#8208;I PS can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) effectively in hypoxic environment, very limited approach is available for addressing the phototoxicity post PDT. There is virtually no solution available to address all these issues using a single design. Herein, we propose a&#160;proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept on&#8208;demand switchable photosensitizers with quenched photosensitization pre and post PDT, which could be activated only in tumor hypoxic environment. Particularly, a hypoxia&#8208;normoxia cycling responsive type&#8208;I PS TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3&#160;was designed to demonstrate the concept, which was further formulated into TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3&#160;nanoparticles (NPs) using DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;2000 as the encapsulation matrix. The NPs could be activated only&#160;in hypoxic tumors to generate type&#8208;I ROS&#160;during PDT treatment, but remain non&#8208;toxic in normal tissues, pre or after PDT, thus minimizing the side effect and improving the therapeutic effect.

         <title>Linkages Make a Difference in the Photoluminescence of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different linkages endow COFs with huge differences in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield for imine&#8208;linked and vinylene&#8208;linked pyrene&#8208;based COFs. Different charge&#8208;transfer pathways in imine&#8208;linked and vinylene&#8208;linked COFs influence the exciton relaxation way and quenching of fluorescence.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural designability and tunability of photophysical properties enable them to be a promising class of organic luminescent materials by incorporating well&#8208;designed fluorescent units directly into the periodic skeletons. The photophysical properties of COFs are mainly affected by the structural features, which determine the conjugation degree, charge delocalization ability, and exciton dynamics of COFs. To understand the relationship between COF structures and their photophysical properties, two COFs with the same pyrene chromophore units but different linkages (imine or vinylene) were designed and synthesized. Interestingly, different linkages endow COFs with huge differences in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for imine&#8208; and vinylene&#8208;linked pyrene&#8208;based COFs, which possess PLQY values of 0.34&#8201;% and 15.43&#8201;%, respectively. The femtosecond&#8208;transient absorption spectra and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveal the different charge&#8208;transfer pathways in imine&#8208; and vinylene&#8208;linked COFs, which influence the exciton relaxation way and fluorescence intensity. In addition, an effective white&#8208;light device was obtained by coating the vinylene&#8208;linked COF on a light&#8208;emitting diode strip.

         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition of vinyldiazo compounds is described, providing cyclopentene derivatives with conservation of one diazo functional group. The reaction involves an unprecedented single electron oxidation of vinyldiazo compounds using iridium photocatalysis.







Abstract
A photocatalytic self&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition of vinyldiazo compounds is described, which provides cyclopentene derivatives with conservation of one diazo functional group. Experimental insights and density functional theory indicate that the reaction is triggered by an unusual single electron oxidation of vinyldiazo compounds, while the photolysis for the generation of free carbene species is not involved. The synthetic applications of the resulting cyclopentenyl &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds were demonstrated based on the rich chemistry of the diazo functional group.

         <title>Electronic Configuration Tuning of Centrally Extended Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Approaching 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of acceptors featuring conjugation&#8208;extended electron&#8208;deficient cores were synthesized via a newly developed strategy for organic solar cells, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to &#8776;19&#8201;% were achieved. The properties of new acceptors were systematically investigated and elucidated experimentally and computationally.







Abstract
In the molecular optimizations of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), extending the central core can tune the energy levels, reduce nonradiative energy loss, enhance the intramolecular (donor&#8208;acceptor and acceptor&#8208;acceptor) packing, facilitate the charge transport, and improve device performance. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize acceptors featuring conjugation&#8208;extended electron&#8208;deficient cores. Among these, the acceptor CH&#8208;BBQ, embedded with benzobisthiadiazole, exhibited an optimal fibrillar network morphology, enhanced crystallinity, and improved charge generation/transport in blend films, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 18.94&#8201;% for CH&#8208;BBQ&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs; 18.19&#8201;% for binary OSCs) owing to its delicate structure design and electronic configuration tuning. Both experimental and theoretical approaches were used to systematically investigate the influence of the central electron&#8208;deficient core on the properties of the acceptor and device performance. The electron&#8208;deficient core modulation paves a new pathway in the molecular engineering of NFAs, propelling relevant research forward.

         <title>Histone Deacetylase 3&#8208;Directed PROTACs Have Anti&#8208;inflammatory Potential by Blocking Polarization of M0&#8208;like into M1&#8208;like Macrophages</title>

         <dc:description>
We employed the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology to target the non&#8208;enzymatic histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) function. A newly developed potent and selective HDAC3 PROTAC provided an anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine expression profile in cultured cells and inhibited the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 phenotype in primary macrophages.







Abstract
Macrophage polarization plays a crucial role in inflammatory processes. The histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has a deacetylase&#8208;independent function that can activate pro&#8208;inflammatory gene expression in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;stimulated M1&#8208;like macrophages and cannot be blocked by traditional small&#8208;molecule HDAC3 inhibitors. Here we employed the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology to target the deacetylase&#8208;independent function of HDAC3. We developed a potent and selective HDAC3&#8208;directed PROTAC, P7, which induces nearly complete HDAC3 degradation at low micromolar concentrations in both THP&#8208;1 cells and human primary macrophages. P7 increases the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion in THP&#8208;1&#8208;derived M1&#8208;like macrophages. Importantly, P7 decreases the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in M1&#8208;like macrophages derived from human primary macrophages. This can be explained by the observed inhibition of macrophage polarization from M0&#8208;like into M1&#8208;like macrophage. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the HDAC3&#8208;directed PROTAC P7 has anti&#8208;inflammatory activity and blocks macrophage polarization, demonstrating that this molecular mechanism can be targeted with small molecule therapeutics.

         <title>Insights into Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyzed Defluorination of Aromatic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional calculations establish a novel mechanism of aromatic defluorination by P450 Compound&#8197;I. This is achieved via either an initial epoxide intermediate or through a 1,2&#8208;fluorine shift in an electrophilic intermediate, which highlights that the P450s can defluorinate fluoroarenes. However, in the absence of a proton donor a strong Fe&#8722;F bond can be obtained as shown from the calculations. The biodegradability of many fluorinated compounds is limited due to the robustness of the C&#8722;F bond. Recently, experimental studies suggested the potential involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes in facilitating aromatic defluorination, raising questions about where this can be applied in biocatalysis. Our study offers an in&#8208;depth computational examination into the oxidative defluorination process of a drug molecule, mediated by cytochrome P450 Compound&#8197;I. We explored a large number of potential mechanisms, and identify two competitive low&#8208;energy pathways that are initiated with an electrophilic attack on the aromatic ring, and followed by either a 1,2&#8208;fluorine shift or a ring&#8208;closure to form an epoxide intermediate. Both of these intermediates are shown to react rapidly through defluorination assisted by a solvent proton. Interestingly, defluorination in the vicinity of a heme group may generate a stable iron(III)&#8208;fluoride complex, potentially leading to enzyme inactivation.

&lt;p&gt;Density functional calculations establish a novel mechanism of aromatic defluorination by P450 Compound&#8197;I. This is achieved via either an initial epoxide intermediate or through a 1,2-fluorine shift in an electrophilic intermediate, which highlights that the P450s can defluorinate fluoroarenes. However, in the absence of a proton donor a strong Fe&#8722;F bond can be obtained as shown from the calculations. The biodegradability of many fluorinated compounds is limited due to the robustness of the C&#8722;F bond. Recently, experimental studies suggested the potential involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes in facilitating aromatic defluorination, raising questions about where this can be applied in biocatalysis. Our study offers an in-depth computational examination into the oxidative defluorination process of a drug molecule, mediated by cytochrome P450 Compound&#8197;I. We explored a large number of potential mechanisms, and identify two competitive low-energy pathways that are initiated with an electrophilic attack on the aromatic ring, and followed by either a 1,2-fluorine shift or a ring-closure to form an epoxide intermediate. Both of these intermediates are shown to react rapidly through defluorination assisted by a solvent proton. Interestingly, defluorination in the vicinity of a heme group may generate a stable iron(III)-fluoride complex, potentially leading to enzyme inactivation.

         <title>Improved Interfacial Ion Migration and Deposition through the Chain&#8208;Liquid Synergistic Effect by a Carboxylated Hydrogel Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative double&#8208;network carboxylated hydrogel electrolyte was designed to stabilize zinc anode. The charged functional groups on polymer chains synergize with liquid phase components to reconstruct the solvent sheath and guide the directional migration of Zn2+ ions. The robust chemical bonding of hydrogel layer to Zn slab induces a dendrite&#8208;free plating behavior, ultimately ensuring the long&#8208;term operation of zinc ion hybrid capacitors.







Abstract
The large&#8208;scale applicability of Zn&#8208;metal anodes is severely impeded by the issues such as the dendrite growth, complicated hydrogen evolution, and uncontrollable passivation reaction. Herein, a negatively charged carboxylated double&#8208;network hydrogel electrolyte (Gelatin/Sodium alginate&#8208;acetate, denoted as Gel/SA&#8208;acetate) has been developed to stabilize the interfacial electrochemistry, which restructures a type of Zn2+ ion solvent sheath optimized via a chain&#8208;liquid synergistic effect. New hydrogen bonds are reconstructed with water molecules by the zincophilic functional groups, and directional migration of hydrated Zn2+ ions is therefore induced. Concomitantly, the robust chemical bonding of such hydrogel layers to the Zn slab exhibits a desirable anti&#8208;catalytic effect, thereby greatly diminishing the water activity and eliminating side reactions. Subsequently, a symmetric cell using the Gel/SA&#8208;acetate electrolyte demonstrates a reversible plating/stripping performance for 1580&#8197;h, and an asymmetric cell reaches a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art runtime of 5600&#8197;h with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. The resultant zinc ion hybrid capacitors deliver exceptional properties including the capacity retention of 98.5&#8201;% over 15000&#8197;cycles, energy density of 236.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and high mechanical adaptability. This work is expected to pave a new avenue for the development of novel hydrogel electrolytes towards safe and stable Zn anodes.

         <dc:description>
Two new dibenzothiophene sulfone&#8208;based organic semiconductors were designed and synthesized. They demonstrate a high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield of 46&#8211;67&#8201;% and typical ambipolar transport character in simple&#8208;structured organic light&#8208;emitting transistors. High quality blue electroluminescence CIE (0.179, 0.119) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm is achieved.







Abstract
The development of blue&#8208;emissive ambipolar organic semiconductor is an arduous target due to the large energy gap, but is an indispensable part for electroluminescent device, especially for the transformative display technology of simple&#8208;structured organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (SS&#8208;OLET). Herein, we designed and synthesized two new dibenzothiophene sulfone&#8208;based high mobility blue&#8208;emissive organic semiconductors (DNaDBSOs), which demonstrate superior optical property with solid&#8208;state photoluminescent quantum yield of 46&#8211;67&#8201;% and typical ambipolar&#8208;transporting properties in SS&#8208;OLETs with symmetric gold electrodes. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal the natural of ambipolar property for such blue&#8208;emissive DNaDBSOs&#8208;based materials is ascribed to a synergistic effect on lowering LUMO level and reduced electron injection barrier induced by the interfacial dipoles effect on gold electrodes due to the incorporation of appropriate DBSO unit. Finally, efficient electroluminescence properties with high&#8208;quality blue emission (CIE (0.179, 0.119)) and a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm are achieved for DNaDBSO&#8208;based SS&#8208;OLET, showing good spatial control of the recombination zone in conducting channel. This work provides a new avenue for designing ambipolar emissive organic semiconductors by incorporating the synergistic effect of energy level regulation and molecular&#8208;metal interaction, which would advance the development of superior optoelectronic materials and their high&#8208;density integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Generation of Cyanocarbenes from Alkynyl Triazenes for the Synthesis of Nitrile Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes using different light sources induced an unusual cleavage of the triazene moiety leading to a methylene nitrile. By varying the reaction conditions, a cyanocarbene and a variety of substitution patterns bearing a nitrile group become selectively available under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions without the use of a toxic cyanating agent or the need for unstable substrates.







Abstract
The chemistry of alkynyl triazenes is an emerging field for organic chemists and especially acid&#8208;induced nucleophilic functionalizations, either directly, or after a prior reaction towards aromatic triazenes under extrusion of nitrogen, paved the way for fruitful strategies. In contrast, the chemical behavior of alkynyl triazenes upon irradiation with light is still unknown. Herein we present the first photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes that triggers an uncommon reactivity pattern involving the cleavage of the N1&#8722;N2 bond of the triazene moiety resulting in a unique approach to cyanocarbenes from a readily available, stable, and insensitive precursor. This allows to access various nitrile compounds without the use of a toxic cyanating agent by exploiting the reactivity pattern of carbenes. By variation of the reaction conditions and light sources, different substitution patterns can be obtained selectively in good yields under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions, thus introducing the alkynyl triazene unit as a photo accessible methylene nitrile synthon. Using this synthon, subclasses like &#945;&#8208;alkoxynitriles, &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;cyanohydrazones become easily available. These exhibit synthetically valuable substitution patterns for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, intermediates for total synthesis and amino acid synthesis.

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Pore Engineering of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Weak Interaction&#8208;Triggered Multiple Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinylene&#8208;linked COF with narrow pore sizes of less than 1&#8197;nm were constructed by the condensation of tetramethylpyrazine as the smallest tetratopic monomer with linear aromatic dialdehyde monomers. Their aggregates in water feature negative charges and can be tuned through protonation/deprotonation, to give pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent colorimetric responses to various anions with different pKa values with high selectivity.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as promising crystalline materials, but their narrow pore engineering is severely impeded by the weak reversibility of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction, which has led to less exploration of their ultramicroporous structures and properties. Herein, we developed a single aromatic ring&#8208;based tetratopic monomer, tetramethylpyrazine, which undergoes a smooth Knoevenegal condensation at its four arylmethly carbon atoms with linear aromatic dialdehyde monomers upon the self&#8208;catalyzed activation of pyridine nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers in the presence of an organic anhydride. This has resulted in the formation of two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs, which both crystallized in orthorhombic lattices, and layered in AA stacking fashions along the vertical directions. They exhibit high surface areas and well&#8208;tailored ultramicropore sizes up to 0.5&#8197;nm. The unique cross&#8208;linking mode at two pairs of para&#8208;positions of each pyrazine unit through carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds afford them with &#960;&#8208;extended conjugation over the in&#8208;plane backbones and substantial semiconducting characters. The resultant COFs can be well&#8208;dispersed in water to form stable sub&#8208;microparticles with negative charges (zeta potentials: ca. &#8722;30&#8197;mV), and exhibiting tunable aggregation behaviors through protonation/deprotonation. As a consequence, they exhibit pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent colorimetric responses to various anions with different pKa values in high selectivity.

         <title>Overcoming Cancer Resistance to Platinum Drugs by Inhibiting Cholesterol Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtIV complexes of fenofibric acid relieve the drug resistance of cancer cells via regulating cholesterol metabolism besides damaging DNA. By inhibiting the expression of cholesterol&#8208;related proteins, the complexes impede the accumulation and promote the removal of cholesterol, leading to both apoptosis and pyroptosis. Cholesterol metabolism provides a new target for potentiating antitumor activity and overcoming the drug resistance of Pt drugs.







Abstract
Drug resistance is a serious challenge for platinum anticancer drugs. Platinum complexes may get over the drug resistance via a distinct mechanism of action. Cholesterol is a key factor contributing to the drug resistance. Inhibiting cellular cholesterol synthesis and uptake provides an alternative strategy for cancer treatment. Platinum(IV) complexes FP and DFP with fenofibric acid as axial ligand(s) were designed to combat the drug resistance through regulating cholesterol metabolism besides damaging DNA. In addition to producing reactive oxygen species and active platinum(II) species to damage DNA, FP and DFP inhibited cellular cholesterol accumulation, promoted cholesterol efflux, upregulated peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#945;), induced caspase&#8208;1 activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, thus leading to both apoptosis and pyroptosis in cancer cells. The reduction of cholesterol significantly relieved the drug resistance of cancer cells. The double&#8208;acting mechanism gave the complexes strong anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, particularly against cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells.

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Optical Probes for Imaging Quadruplex DNA Structures via Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New platinum(II)&#8208;based optical probes for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA are reported, which switch&#8208;on their emission intensity and, more importantly, they display a selective and distinct lengthening of their emission lifetime when bound to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. We show that this effect can be used to selectively visualise these structures in cells using Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex DNA is a non&#8208;canonical structure that forms in guanine&#8208;rich regions of the genome. There is increasing evidence showing that G&#8208;quadruplexes have important biological functions, and therefore molecular tools to visualise these structures are important. Herein we report on a series of new cyclometallated platinum(II) complexes which, upon binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA, display an increase in their phosphorescence, acting as switch&#8208;on probes. More importantly, upon binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes they display a selective and distinct lengthening of their emission lifetime. We show that this effect can be used to selectively visualise these structures in cells using Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (PLIM).

         <title>Breaking K+ Concentration Limit on Cu Nanoneedles for Acidic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K+ concentration (4.22&#8197;M), breaking the K+ solubility limit (3.5&#8197;M). This enables a highly efficient CO2RR in 3&#8197;M KCl at pH=1, with a FEC2+ of 90.69&#177;2.15&#8201;% at 1400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a single pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) of 25.49&#177;0.82&#8201;% at a CO2 flow rate of 7&#8197;sccm.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) in acidic electrolyte is one of the most advanced routes for tackling our current climate and energy crisis. However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the poor selectivity towards the valuable C2+ products are the major obstacles for the upscaling of these technologies. High local potassium ions (K+) concentration at the cathode's surface can inhibit proton&#8208;diffusion and accelerate the desirable carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling process. However, the solubility limit of potassium salts in bulk solution constrains the maximum achievable K+ concentration at the reaction sites and thus the overall acidic CO2RR performance of most electrocatalysts. In this work, we demonstrate that Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K+ concentrations (4.22&#8197;M) &#8211; thus breaking the K+ solubility limit (3.5&#8197;M) &#8211; which enables a highly efficient CO2RR in 3&#8197;M KCl at pH=1. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 90.69&#177;2.15&#8201;% for C2+ (FEC2+) can be achieved at 1400&#8197;mA.cm&#8722;2, simultaneous with a single pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) of 25.49&#177;0.82&#8201;% at a CO2 flow rate of 7&#8197;sccm.

         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous and recyclable ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles of iridium(0) enabled highly selective hydrogenation of distal unsubstituted aromatic rings to generate novel phosphine ligands. The iridium&#8208;hydride species and hydrogen bonding between the substrate and solvent facilitate the catalysis, as reported by Fabrice Gallou, Sachin Handa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307139).

         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoid neocaesalpin A (1) is disclosed. At the heart of the synthesis lies an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction that rapidly assembles the target framework from commercial materials. A carefully orchestrated sequence of oxidations secured the desired oxygenation pattern. Late&#8208;stage release of the characteristic butenolide occurred through a novel mercury(II)&#8208;mediated furan oxidation. Successful extension of the route allowed preparation of neocaesalpin AA (2) as well as nominal neocaesalpin K (3) and suggested structural revision of neocaesalpin K, leading to the hypothesis that the two are likely the same natural product with correct assignment as 2.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;Block Potassium Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalyst with K&#8208;N4 Configuration Derived from K+/Polydopamine for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) research mainly focuses on transition metal atoms as active centers. Due to their delocalized s/p&#8208;bands, the s&#8208;block main group metal elements are typically regarded as catalytically inert. Herein, an s&#8208;block potassium SAC (K&#8208;N&#8208;C) with K&#8208;N4 configuration is reported for the first time, which exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability under alkaline conditions. Specifically, the half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) is up to 0.908 V, and negligible changes in E1/2 are observed after 10,000 cycles. In addition, the K&#8208;N&#8208;C offers an exceptional power density of 158.1 mW&#8201;cm&#8208;2 and remarkable durability up to 420 h in a Zn&#8208;air battery. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that K&#8208;N&#8208;C has bifunctional active K and C sites, can optimize the free energy of ORR reaction intermediates, and adjust rate decision steps. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) results showed for the first time that the s orbitals of K played a major role in the adsorption of intermediates, which was different from the d orbitals in transition metals. This work significantly guides the rational design and catalytic mechanism research of s&#8208;block SACs with high ORR activity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) research mainly focuses on transition metal atoms as active centers. Due to their delocalized s/p-bands, the s-block main group metal elements are typically regarded as catalytically inert. Herein, an s-block potassium SAC (K-N-C) with K-N4 configuration is reported for the first time, which exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability under alkaline conditions. Specifically, the half-wave potential (E1/2) is up to 0.908 V, and negligible changes in E1/2 are observed after 10,000 cycles.

         <title>First&#8208;Row d6 Metal Complex Enables Photon Upconversion and Initiates Blue Light&#8208;Dependent Polymerization with Red Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitizers for sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) often rely on precious heavy metals, whereas coordination complexes based on abundant first&#8208;row transition metals are less common. This is mainly because long&#8208;lived triplet excited states are more difficult to obtain for 3d metals, particularly when the d&#8208;subshell is only partially filled. Here, we report the first example of sTTA&#8208;UC based on a 3d6 metal photosensitizer yielding an upconversion performance competitive with precious metal&#8208;based analogues. Using a newly developed Cr(0) photosensitizer featuring equally good photophysical properties as an Os(II) benchmark complex in combination with an acetylene&#8208;decorated anthracene annihilator, red&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion is achievable. The upconversion efficiency under optimized conditions is 1.8%, and the excitation power density threshold to reach the strong annihilation limit is 5.9 W/cm2. These performance factors, along with high photostability, permit the initiation of acrylamide polymerization by red light, based on radiative energy transfer between delayed annihilator fluorescence and a blue light absorbing photo&#8208;initiator. Our study provides the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for photon upconversion with elusive first&#8208;row analogues of widely employed precious d6 metal photosensitizers, and for their application in photochemical reactions triggered by excitation wavelengths close to near&#8208;infrared.</dc:description>

         <title>Motorized Photomodulator: Making A Non&#8208;photoresponsive Supramolecular Gel Switchable by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing photo&#8208;responsive molecules offers an attractive approach for remote and selective control and dynamic manipulation of material properties. However, it remains highly challenging how to use a minimal amount of photo&#8208;responsive units to optically modulate materials that are inherently inert to light irradiation. Here we show that the application of a light&#8208;driven rotary molecular motor as a &#8220;motorized photo&#8208;modulator&#8221; to endow a typical H&#8208;bond&#8208;based gel system with the ability to respond to light irradiation creating a reversible sol&#8208;gel transition. The key molecular design feature is the introduction of a minimal amount (1 mol%) of molecular motor into the supramolecular network as a photo&#8208;switchable non&#8208;covalent crosslinker. Advantage is taken of the subtle interplay of the large geometry change during photo&#8208;isomerization of the molecular motor guest and the dynamic nature of a supramolecular gel host system. As a result, a tiny amount of molecular motors is enough to switch the mechanical modulus of the entire supramolecular systems. This study proves the concept of designing photo&#8208;responsive materials with minimum use of non&#8208;covalent light&#8208;absorbing units.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;promoted carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage employing a reusable Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of methods for selective cleavage reactions of thermodynamically stable C&#8208;C/C=C bonds in a green manner is a challenging research field which is largely unexplored. Herein, we present a heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with highly dispersed iron centers that allows for the oxidative C&#8208;C/C=C bond cleavage of amines, secondary alcohols, ketones, and olefins in the presence of air (O2) and water (H2O). Mechanistic studies reveal the presence of water to be essential for the performance of the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C system, boosting the product yield from &lt;1% to &gt;90%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and control experiments suggest the singlet 1O2 and hydroxide species generated from O2 and H2O, respectively, take selectively part in the C&#8208;C bond cleavage. The broad applicability (&gt;40 examples) even for complex drugs as well as high activity, selectivity, and durability under comparably mild conditions highlight this unique catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anisotropic NMR spectroscopy, revealing residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and residual chemical shift anisotropies (RCSAs) has emerged as a powerful tool to determine the configurations of synthetic and complex natural compounds. The deduction of the absolute in addition to the relative configuration is one of the primary goals in the field. Therefore, the investigation of the enantiodiscriminating capabilities of chiral alignment media becomes essential. While RDCs and RCSAs are used for the determination of the relative configuration now routinely, RCSAs have not been measured in chiral alignment media such as chiral liquid crystals. Herein, we present this application by measuring RCSAs for chiral analytes such as indanol and isopinocampheol in the lyotropic liquid crystalline phase of an L&#8208;valine derived helically chiral polyacetylenes. We have also demonstrated that a single 1D 13C&#8208;{1H} NMR spectrum suffices to get the RCSAs circumventing the necessity to acquire two spectra at two alignment conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multicomponent reactions are of utmost importance at generating a unique, wide, and complex chemical space. Herein we describe a novel multicomponent approach based on the combination of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4+1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction to generate pyrazole amide derivatives. The scope of the reaction as well as mechanistic insights governing the 4H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;imine tautomerization are provided. This multicomponent process provides access to a new chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives and offers a novel tool for peptide modification and stapling.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Sites Decorated Nonpolar Pore&#8208;Based MOF for One&#8208;step Acquisition of C2H4 and Recovery of C3H6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Zn&#8208;BPZ&#8208;TATB with accessible N/O active sites in nonpolar pore surfaces was reported for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6 or C3H6 mixtures as well as recovery of C3H6 from C2H6/C3H6/C2H4 mixtures.&#160;The MOF exhibits&#160;the favorable C2H6 and C3H6 uptakes (&gt; 100 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K under 100 kPa) as well as selective adsorption of C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4. The C3H6&#8208; and C2H6&#8208;selective feature were investigated detailedly by experimental tests as well as sorption kinetic studyies. Molecular modelling revealed the multiple interactions between C3H6 or C2H6 molecules and methyl groups as well as triazine rings in pores. &#160;Zn&#8208;BPZ&#8208;TATB not only can directly generate 323.4 L kg&#8208;1 and 15.4 L kg&#8208;1 of high&#8208;purity (&#8805;99.9%) C2H4&#160;from&#160;C3H6/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4&#160;mixtures, but also provide a large high&#8208;purity (&#8805;99.5%)&#160;C3H6 recovery capacity of 60.1 L kg&#8208;1 from C3H6/C2H4 mixtures. More importantly, the high&#8208;purity C3H6 (&#8805;99.5%) and C2H4 (&#8805;99.9%)&#160; with the productivities of 38.2 and 12.7 L kg&#8208;1 can be simultaneously obtained from C2H6/C3H6/C2H4 mixtures through a single adsorption/desorption cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;demand Activation of Transesterification via Chemical Amplification in Dynamic Thiol&#8208;ene Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical amplification is a well&#8208;established concept in photoresist technology, wherein one photochemical event leads to a cascade of follow&#8208;up reactions facilitating a controlled change in the solubility of a polymer. Herein, we transfer this concept to dynamic polymer networks to liberate both catalyst and functional groups required for bond exchange reactions via UV irradiation. For this, we exploit a photochemically&#8208;generated acid to catalyse a deprotection reaction of an acid&#8208;labile tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl group, which is employed to mask the hydroxy groups of a vinyl monomer. At the same time, the released acid serves as a catalyst for thermo&#8208;activated transesterifications between the deprotected hydroxyl and ester moieties. Introduced in an orthogonally&#8208;cured (450 nm) thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, this approach allows for a spatio&#8208;temporally controlled activation of bond exchange reactions, which is crucial in light of the creep resistance vs reflow ability trade&#8208;off of dynamic polymer networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Selenide Nanomembrane for Enantiospecific Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the synthesis of chiral selenium nanoparticles (NPs) using cysteine and the interfacial assembly strategy to generate a self&#8208;assembled nanomembrane on a large&#8208;scale with controllable morphology and handedness.  The selenide (Se) NPs exhibited  circular dichroism (CD) bands in the  ultraviolet and visible region with a maximum intensity of 39.96 mdeg at 388 nm and optical anisotropy factors (g&#8208;factors) of up to 0.0013 while a self&#8208;assembled monolayer nanomembrane exhibited symmetrical CD approaching 72.8 mdeg at 391nm and g&#8208;factors up to 0.0034. Analysis showed that a photocurrent of 20.97&#177;1.55 nA was generated by the D&#8208;nanomembrane when irradiated under light while the L&#8208;nanomembrane generated a photocurrent of 20.58&#177;1.36 nA. Owing to the asymmetric intensity of the photocurrent with respect to the handedness of the nanomembrane, an ultrasensitive recognition of enantioselective kynurenine (Kyn) was achieved by the ten&#8208;layer (10L) D&#8208;nanomembrane exhibiting a photocurrent for L&#8208;kynurenine (L&#8208;Kyn) that was 8.64&#8208;fold lower than that of D&#8208;Kyn, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0074 nM for the L&#8208;Kyn, which was attributed to stronger affinity between L&#8208;Kyn and D&#8208;Se nanoparticles. Noticeably, the chiral Se nanomembrane precisely distinguished L&#8208;Kyn in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy subjects.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Terminal C&#8208;C Coupling Reaction Inside Water Soluble Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing methods that activate C&#8208;H bonds directly with high selectivity for C&#8208;C bond formation in complex organic synthesis has been a major chemistry challenge. Recently it has been shown that photoactivation of weakly polarized C&#8208;H bonds can be carried out inside a cationic water&#8208;soluble nanocage with visible light&#8208;mediated host&#8208;guest charge transfer (CT) chemistry. Using this novel photoredox activation paradigm, here we demonstrate C&#8208;C bond formation to photo&#8208;generate 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature in water from terminal aromatic alkynes for the first time. The formation of cavity&#8208;confined alkyne radical cation and the proton&#8208;removed neutral radical species highlight the unique C&#8208;C coupling step driven by supramolecular preorganization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Solution&#8208;processable Porphyrin&#8208;based Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework for Photoelectrochemical Sensing of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detecting CO2 in complex gas mixtures is challenging due to the presence of competitive gases in ambient atmosphere. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) techniques offer a solution, but material selection and specificity remain limiting. Here, we invented a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework material based on a porphyrin tecton decorated with diaminotriazine (DAT) moieties. The DAT moieties on the porphyrin molecules not only facilitate the formation of complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonds between the tectons but also function as recognition sites in the resulting porous HOF materials for the selective CO2 adsorption. In addition, the in&#8208;plane growth of FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 into anisotropic molecular sheets with large areas of up to 23,000 &#956;m2 and controllable thickness between 0.298 and 2.407 &#181;m were realized by a simple solution&#8208;processing method in over 89% yields. The FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 can be directly grown and deposited onto different substrates including silica, carbon, and metal&#8208;oxides by self&#8208;assembly in situ in formic acid. As a proof of concept, a screen&#8208;printing electrode deposited with FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 was fabricate as a label&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for CO2 detection. Such a signal&#8208;off PEC sensor exhibits low detection limit for CO2 (2.3 ppm), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 days).</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Amidation Chemistry Enables Closed&#8208;Loop Chemical Recycling of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites to Monomers and Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient recycling of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites into monomers and fibers is a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a closed&#8208;loop recycling approach for carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites using reversible amidation chemistry, enabling the complete recovery of intact carbon fibers and pure monomers. The polymer network, synthesized by amidation between a macromonomer linear polyethyleneimine and a bifunctional maleic anhydride cross&#8208;linker, serves as matrices for the construction of composites with exceptional mechanical properties, thermal stability and solvent resistance. The matrices can be fully depolymerized under the acidic condition at ambient temperature, allowing for the effective separation and recovery of both carbon fibers and the two monomers. The reclaimed carbon fibers retain nearly identical mechanical properties to pristine ones, while pure monomers are recycled with high separation yields (&gt; 93%). They can be reused in the manufacture of new composites for multiple cycles, whose mechanical properties recover over 95% of their original properties. This line of research presents a promising approach for the design of high&#8208;performance and sustainable thermoset composites, offering significant environmental and economic benefits.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Type Sodium&#8208;ion Conducting Solid Electrolytes for All Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) show promise as solid electrolytes due to their cost&#8208;effective materials and rapid Na+ conductivity. Lattice parameters and Na+ channel sizes are influenced by transition metals, which in turn affect Na+ conductivity by modifying its interaction with PBA frameworks. Leveraging these insights, all solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries using PBAs as solid electrolytes have been developed for the first time.







Abstract
Conventional solid electrolyte frameworks typically consist of anions such as sulphur, oxygen, chlorine, and others, leading to inherent limitations in their properties. Despite the emergence of sulphide, oxide, and halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, their utilization is hampered by issues, including the evolution of H2S gas, the need for expensive elements, and poor contact. Here, we first introduce Prussian Blue analogue (PBA) open&#8208;framework structures as a solid electrolyte that demonstrates appreciable Na+ conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). We delve into the relationship between Na+ conductivity and the lattice parameter of N&#8208;coordinated transition metal, which is attributed to the reduced interaction between Na+ and the framework, corroborated by the distribution of relaxation times and density functional theory calculations. Among the five PBAs studied, Mn&#8208;PBA have exhibited the highest Na+ conductivity of 9.1&#215;10&#8722;2mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Feasibility tests have revealed that Mn&#8208;PBA have maintained a cycle retention of 95.1&#8201;% after 80cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C and a C&#8208;rate of 0.2C. Our investigation into the underlying mechanisms that play a significant role in governing the conductivity and kinetics of these materials contributes valuable insights for the development of alternative strategies to realize all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Controllable One&#8208;Step Assembly of Uniform Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer Cylindrical Micelles by a Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Process and Their Application as Tougheners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step strategy has been used to assemble cylindrical micelles with highly controllable lengths from a single liquid crystalline block copolymer by an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. This strategy was used to produce uniform cylindrical micelles at decent scales for practical applications, and their dramatic toughening effect for glassy thermoplastics was demonstrated.







Abstract
The fabrication of uniform cylindrical nanoobjects from soft materials has attracted tremendous research attention from both fundamental research and practical application points of view but has also posed outstanding challenges in terms of their preparation. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step method to assemble cylindrical micelles (CMs) with highly controllable lengths from a single liquid crystalline block copolymer by an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. By adjusting the assembly conditions, the lengths of the CMs are controlled from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. Several influencing factors are systematically investigated to comprehensively understand the process. Particularly, the solvent quality is found determinative in either enhancing or suppressing the nucleation process to produce shorter and longer CMs, respectively. Taking advantage of this strategy, the lengths of CMs can be nicely controlled over a wide concentration range of four orders of magnitude. Lastly, CMs are produced on decent scales and applied as additives to dramatically toughen glassy plastic matrix, revealing an unprecedented length&#8208;dependent toughening effect.

         <title>Strong and Ultra&#8208;tough Ionic Hydrogel Based on Hyperbranched Macro&#8208;Cross&#8208;linker: Influence of Topological Structure on Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyperbranched PCL was used as a macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker to fabricate a novel family of strong and ultra&#8208;tough ionic hydrogels. By tailoring the hyperbranched topological structure, the optimal balance of covalent/non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking could be obtained. As a result, the well&#8208;designed hydrogel possesses high strength, superior toughness, and good ionic conductivity, with potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.







Abstract
The application of hydrogels often suffers from their inherent limitation of poor mechanical properties. Here, a carboxyl&#8208;functionalized and acryloyl&#8208;terminated hyperbranched polycaprolactone (PCL) was synthesized and used as a macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker to fabricate a super strong and ultra&#8208;tough ionic hydrogel. The terminal acryloyl groups of hyperbranched PCL are chemically incorporated into the network to form covalent cross&#8208;links, which contribute to robust networks. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic domains formed by the spontaneous aggregation of PCL chains and coordination bonds between Fe3+ and COO&#8722; groups serve as dynamic non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links, which enhance the energy dissipation ability. Especially, the influence of the hyperbranched topological structure of PCL on hydrogel properties has been well investigated, exhibiting superior strengthening and toughening effects compared to the linear one. Moreover, the hyperbranched PCL cross&#8208;linker also endowed the ionic hydrogel with higher sensitivity than the linear one when used as a strain sensor. As a result, this well&#8208;designed ionic hydrogel possesses high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and well ionic conductivity, exhibiting potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Potassium&#8208;Modified Nickel&#8208;Zinc Carbide Boosts Production of Higher Alcohols beyond CH4 in CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8722;Zn bimetal catalyst breaks the limits of methanation over metallic Ni0 for CO2 hydrogenation. K promotion of the Ni&#8722;Zn catalyst facilitates the in situ formation of Ni3Zn1C0.7 IMC, enhances CO2 adsorption, and accelerates C&#8722;C coupling, thereby promoting C2+OH production.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied in the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4, but selective and efficient synthesis of higher alcohols (C2+OH) from CO2 hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based catalyst is still challenging due to successive hydrogenation of C1 intermediates leading to methanation. Herein, we report an unprecedented synthesis of C2+OH from CO2 hydrogenation over K&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Zn bimetal catalyst with promising activity and selectivity. Systematic experiments (including XRD, in situ spectroscopic characterization) and computational studies reveal the in situ generation of an active K&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Zn carbide (K&#8208;Ni3Zn1C0.7) by carburization of Zn&#8208;incorporated Ni0, which can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption and the surface coverage of alkyl intermediates, and boost the C&#8722;C coupling to C2+OH rather than conventional CH4. This work opens a new catalytic avenue toward CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH, and also provides an insightful example for the rational design of selective and efficient Ni&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to multiple carbon products.

         <title>Achiral Au(I) Cyclic Trinuclear Complexes with High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Near&#8208;Infrared TADF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two achiral Au(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes with circularly polarized near&#8208;infrared thermally activated delay fluorescence (NIR&#8208;TADF) have been synthesized and charaterized, whose photoluminescence quantum yields are very high in the solid state. Utilizing the circularly polarized light (CPL) function and 3D printing technology, the CPL&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting logo with achiral material was successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Realizing high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region is challenging and valuable for luminescent material, especially for thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) material. In this work, we report two achiral cyclic trinuclear Au(I) complexes, Au3(4&#8208;Clpyrazolate)3 and Au3(4&#8208;Brpyrazolate)3 (denoted as Cl&#8722;Au and Br&#8722;Au), obtained through the reaction of 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole and 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole with Au(I) salts, respectively. Both Cl&#8722;Au and Br&#8722;Au exhibit TADF with high PLQY (&gt;70&#8201;%) in the NIR I (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm) (&#955;max = 720&#8197;nm) region, exceeding other NIR&#8722;TADF emitters in the solid state.

     alt="Achiral Au(I) Cyclic Trinuclear Complexes with High-Efficiency Circularly Polarized Near-Infrared TADF"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two achiral Au(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes with circularly polarized near-infrared thermally activated delay fluorescence (NIR-TADF) have been synthesized and charaterized, whose photoluminescence quantum yields are very high in the solid state. Utilizing the circularly polarized light (CPL) function and 3D printing technology, the CPL-based anti-counterfeiting logo with achiral material was successfully fabricated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the near-infrared (NIR) region is challenging and valuable for luminescent material, especially for thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) material. In this work, we report two achiral cyclic trinuclear Au(I) complexes, Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4-Clpyrazolate)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4-Brpyrazolate)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as &lt;b&gt;Cl&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Br&#8722;Au)&lt;/b&gt;, obtained through the reaction of 4-chloro-1H-pyrazole and 4-bromo-1H-pyrazole with Au(I) salts, respectively. Both &lt;b&gt;Cl&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Br&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; exhibit TADF with high PLQY (&amp;gt;70&#8201;%) in the NIR I (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm) (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 720&#8197;nm) region, exceeding other NIR&#8722;TADF emitters in the solid state. Photophysical experiments and theoretical calculations confirmed the efficient NIR&#8722;TADF properties of &lt;b&gt;Cl&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Br&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; were attributed to the small energy gap&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbofunctionalization of Alkynes with Organohalides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first report of 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes using organohalides as coupling partners in the field of gold catalysis has been presented. Mechanistic investigations, including NMR, tandem mass spectrometry and DFT studies, reveal that an oxidative addition/carbophilic activation pathway is preferred over the migratory insertion/cis&#8208;trans isomerization pathway.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first gold&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes using organohalides as non&#8208;prefunctionalized coupling partners. The mechanism of the reaction involves an oxidative addition/&#960;&#8208;activation mechanism in contrast to the migratory insertion/cis&#8208;trans isomerization pathway that is predominantly observed with other transition metals yielding products with anti&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic insights include several control experiments, NMR studies, HR&#8208;MSMS analyses, and DFT calculations that strongly support the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Dual Nickel(II)/Mechanoredox Catalysis: Mechanical&#8208;Force&#8208;Driven Aryl&#8208;Amination Reactions Using Ball Milling and Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a new class of synergistic catalytic system that uses a nickel(II) catalyst and a mechanoredox catalyst to promote mechanochemical&#8208;force&#8208;driven C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. This reaction shows a broad substrate scope, an inexpensive catalyst, short reaction time, and an almost negligible quantity of solvents. The present approach accordingly complements existing nickel(II)/photoredox cocatalysis.







Abstract
The combination of a nickel(II) catalyst and a mechanoredox catalyst under ball&#8208;milling conditions promotes mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;driven C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this nickel(II)/mechanoredox cocatalyst system, the modulation of the oxidation state of the nickel center, induced by piezoelectricity, is used to facilitate a highly efficient aryl&#8208;amination reaction, which is characterized by a broad substrate scope, an inexpensive combination of catalysts (NiBr2 and BaTiO3), short reaction times, and an almost negligible quantity of solvents. Moreover, this reaction can be readily up&#8208;scaled to the multi&#8208;gram scale, and all synthetic operations can be carried out under atmospheric conditions without the need for complicated reaction setups. Furthermore, this force&#8208;induced system is suitable for excitation&#8208;energy&#8208;accepting molecules and poorly soluble polyaromatic substrates that are incompatible with solution&#8208;based nickel(II)/photoredox cocatalysts.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Cleavage of Lignin Models by a Soluble Perylene Diimide/Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PDI) is one of the best n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, as ideal light&#8208;driven catalysts for lignin depolymerization. However, the charge localization effect and the excessively strong intermolecular aggregation trend in PDI result in rapid electron&#8208;hole (e&#8208;&#8722;h+) recombination, which limits photocatalytic performance. Herein, polymeric carbon nitride/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane PDI (p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by the solvent evaporation&#8208;deposition method for C&#8722;C bond selective cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Based on the material characterization results, the synergic role of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction maintains appropriate aggregation domains, achieves better solar light utilization, faster charge transfer efficiency, and greater redox capacity. Notably, the 3% p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI heterostructure exhibits a remarkable enhancement in cleavage conversion efficiency, achieving approximately 16.42&#8208; and 2.57&#8208; times higher conversion rates compared to polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane modified PDI (POSS&#8208;PDI) and polymeric carbon nitride (p&#8208;CN), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Molecular Recognition of Structural Analogues in Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering Spectroscopy: Inducing Charge and Geometry Complementarity to Mimic Molecular Docking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular recognition of complex isomeric biomolecules remains challenging in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy due to their small Raman cross&#8208;sections and/or poor surface affinities. To date, the use of molecular probes has achieved excellent molecular sensitivities but still suffers from poor spectral specificity. Here, we induce 'charge and geometry complementarity' between probe and analyte as a key strategy to achieve high spectral specificity for effective SERS molecular recognition of structural analogues. We employ 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine (MPY) as the probe, and chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharides with isomeric sulfation patterns as our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Our experimental and in silico studies reveal that 'charge and geometry complementarity' between MPY&#8217;s binding pocket and the CS sulfation patterns drives the formation of site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions at the respective CS isomerism sites, which 'locks' each CS in its analogue&#8208;specific complex geometry, akin to molecular docking events. Leveraging the resultant spectral fingerprints, we achieve &gt; 97% classification accuracy for 4 CSs and 5 potential structural interferences, as well as attain multiplex CS quantification with &lt; 3 % prediction error. These insights could enable practical SERS differentiation of biologically important isomers to meet the burgeoning demand for fast&#8208;responding applications across various fields such as biodiagnostics, food and environmental surveillance.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Microcapsules Harnessing the COVID&#8208;19 Immune Response for Cancer Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of gene therapy and immunotherapy concepts, along recent advances in DNA nanotechnology, have the potential to provide important tools for cancer therapies.

         <title>Photoinduced Metallonitrene Formation by N2 Elimination from Azide Diradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond ultraviolet&#8208;pump/mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveals that singlet and triplet azide&#8208;anion diradical ligands facilitate the efficient formation of a metallonitrene from a diamagnetic azido precursor.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal nitrides/nitrenes are highly promising reagents for catalytic nitrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reactivity. They are typically prepared in situ upon optically induced N2 elimination from azido precursors. A full exploitation of their catalytic potential, however, requires in&#8208;depth knowledge of the primary photo&#8208;induced processes and the structural/electronic factors mediating the N2 loss with birth of the terminal metal&#8208;nitrogen core. Using femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, we elucidate here the primary molecular&#8208;level mechanisms responsible for the formation of a unique platinum(II) nitrene with a triplet ground state from a closed&#8208;shell platinum(II) azide precursor. The spectroscopic data in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide compelling evidence that product formation requires the initial occupation of a singlet excited state with an anionic azide diradical ligand that is bound to a low&#8208;spin d8&#8208;configured PtII ion. Subsequent intersystem crossing generates the Pt&#8208;bound triplet azide diradical, which smoothly evolves into the triplet nitrene via N2 loss in a near barrierless adiabatic dissociation. Our data highlight the importance of the productive, N2&#8208;releasing state possessing azide &#960;&#960;* character as a design principle for accessing efficient N&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysts.

         <title>Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response in a Densely&#8208;Stacked Van Der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Oxychloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;sole functional module&#8221; strategy that assembles dense structures comprising well&#8208;aligned nonlinear optical&#8208;efficient modules is proposed. This has led to the discovery of a densely&#8208;stacked van der Waals transition&#8208;metal oxychloride with a giant mid&#8208;infrared second&#8208;harmonic generation response.







Abstract
Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental optical property of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. Thus far, it has proved difficult to engineer large SHG responses, particularly in the mid&#8208;infrared region, owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the arrangement and density of functional NLO&#8208;active units. Herein, a new assembly strategy employing functional modules only, and aimed at maximizing the density and optimizing the spatial arrangement of highly efficient functional modules, has been applied to the preparation of NLO crystals, affording the van der Waals crystal MoO2Cl2. This exhibits the strongest powder SHG response (2.1&#215;KTiOPO4 (KTP) @ 2100&#8197;nm) for a transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide, a wide optical transparency window, and a sufficient birefringence. MoO2Cl2 is the first SHG&#8208;active transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide effective in the infrared region. Theoretical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest that the densely packed, optimally&#8208;aligned [MoO4Cl2] modules within the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals layers are responsible for the giant SHG response.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(diphenylacetylene)s by Molybdenum and Tungsten Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two improved methods for synthesis of poly(diphenylacetylene)s having functional groups have been developed. Molybdenum(V) catalysis with the MoCl5&#8208;PhSnnBu3 system provides linear poly(diphenylacetylene)s by migratory insertion polymerization while low&#8208;valent tungsten catalysis with the WCl4&#8208;Ph4Sn&#8208;PPh3 system provides cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s by ring expansion polymerization.







Abstract
Improved methods for the synthesis of linear and cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s by polymerization of the corresponding diphenylacetylenes using MoCl5&#8208; and WCl4&#8208;based catalytic systems have been developed. MoCl5 induces migratory insertion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of arylation reagents such as Ph4Sn and ArSnnBu3 to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular linear poly(diphenylacetyelene)s with high molecular weights (number&#8208;average molar mass (Mn)=30,000&#8211;3,200,000) in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%). On the other hand, WCl4 induces ring expansion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of Ph4Sn or reducing reagents to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s with high molecular weights (Mn=20,000&#8211;250,000) in moderate to good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). Both catalytic systems are applicable to the polymerization of various diphenylacetylenes having polar functional groups such as esters that are not efficiently polymerized by conventional methods using WCl6&#8208;Ph4Sn and TaCl5&#8208;nBu4Sn systems.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Cation Solvation Structure for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular engineering strategy for regulating the solvation shell of metal cations has been reported, aiming to achieve a balanced H2O activation behavior. By enriching the interface with aprotic organic molecules, the density of H2O is decreased, and a second&#8208;sphere effect is delivered to stabilize the adsorbed H2O molecule, leading to highly selective CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Balancing the activation of H2O is crucial for highly selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), as the protonation steps of CO2RR require fast H2O dissociation kinetics, while suppressing hydrogen evolution (HER) demands slow H2O reduction. We herein proposed one molecular engineering strategy to regulate the H2O activation using aprotic organic small molecules with high Gutmann donor number as a solvation shell regulator. These organic molecules occupy the first solvation shell of K+ and accumulate in the electrical double layer, decreasing the H2O density at the interface and the relative content of proton suppliers (free and coordinated H2O), suppressing the HER. The adsorbed H2O was stabilized via the second sphere effect and its dissociation was promoted by weakening the O&#8722;H bond, which accelerates the subsequent *CO2 protonation kinetics and reduces the energy barrier. In the model electrolyte containing 5&#8197;M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive (KCl&#8208;DMSO&#8208;5), the highest CO selectivity over Ag foil increased to 99.2&#8201;%, with FECO higher than 90.0&#8201;% within &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.15&#8197;V (vs. RHE). This molecular engineering strategy for cation solvation shell can be extended to other metal electrodes, such as Zn and Sn, and organic molecules like N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide.

In the model electrolyte containing 5&#8197;M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive (KCl-DMSO-5), the highest CO selectivity over Ag foil increased to 99.2&#8201;%, with FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; higher than 90.0&#8201;% within &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.15&#8197;V (vs. RHE). This molecular engineering strategy for cation solvation shell can be extended to other metal electrodes, such as Zn and Sn, and organic molecules like N,N-dimethylformamide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extremely Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Lewis&#8208;Paired CN Groups for Organic p&#8208;Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of various CN&#8208;functionalized conjugated molecules and Lewis acids has led to the synthesis of&#160;unprecedentedly strong organic p&#8208;dopants (LUMO level down to &#8722;5.93&#8197;eV) exhibiting excellent doping stability (over 40&#8197;h at 120&#8201;&#176;C). Lewis pairing leads to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the CN groups increasing almost twofold and the dopant size enlarging significantly.







Abstract
P&#8208;type chemical doping (p&#8208;doping) is a key technique to modulate the optical, electrical, and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. However, typical functional groups in organic p&#8208;dopants have insufficient electron&#8208;withdrawing strength, and the inevitable diffusion of dopants in host matrices degrades doping stabilities. Herein, we utilize extremely electron&#8208;withdrawing Lewis&#8208;paired CN groups as a new class of building blocks for designing unprecedentedly strong organic p&#8208;dopants with excellent doping stability. Various Lewis acids are paired with CN&#8208;functionalized conjugated molecules in the solution state, which strengthens the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of CN groups almost twofold. The large dopants afford outstanding doping stability against continuous heating and long&#8208;term atmospheric exposure, which is promising for practical applications in devices. Given the broad applicability of this simple combinatorial approach, it may impact many fields of (opto)electronics.

         <title>Anomalous Charge Transfer from Organic Ligands to Metal Halides in Zero&#8208;Dimensional [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5 Enabled by Pressure&#8208;Induced Lone Pair&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge transfer from organic ligands to metal halides in zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5 is achieved through pressure modulation. It leads to high excitonic emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. In situ experimental and theoretical methods show that the pressure&#8208;induced electronic coupling between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Sb3+ and the &#960; electrons of benzene acts as an unexpected &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the charge transfer.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional (low&#8208;D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have emerged as fascinating candidates for optoelectronics due to their integrated properties from both organic and inorganic components. However, for most of low&#8208;D OMHHs, especially the zero&#8208;D (0D) compounds, the inferior electronic coupling between organic ligands and inorganic metal halides prevents efficient charge transfer at the hybrid interfaces and thus limits their further tunability of optical and electronic properties. Here, using pressure to regulate the interfacial interactions, efficient charge transfer from organic ligands to metal halides is achieved, which leads to a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) at around 6.0&#8197;GPa in a 0D OMHH, [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the pressure&#8208;induced electronic coupling between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Sb3+ and the &#960; electrons of benzene ring (lp&#8208;&#960; interaction) serves as an unexpected &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the charge transfer. Our work opens a versatile strategy for the new materials design by manipulating the lp&#8208;&#960; interactions in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid systems.

         <title>Tetrazole Diversification of Amino Acids and Peptides via Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaddition with Aryldiazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic platform that could transform proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of unprecedented tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives is developed via a silver&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition reaction with aryldiazonium salts.







Abstract
Selective structural modification of amino acids and peptides is a central strategy in organic chemistry, chemical biology but also in pharmacology and material science. In this context, the formation of tetrazole rings, known to possess significant therapeutic properties, would expand the chemical space of unnatural amino acids but has received less attention. In this study, we demonstrated that the classic unimolecular Wolff rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;derived diazoketones could be replaced by a faster intermolecular cycloaddition reaction with aryldiazonium salts under identical practical conditions. This strategy provides an efficient synthetic platform that could transform proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of unprecedented tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives with preservation of the stereocenters. Density functional theory studies shed some light on the reaction mechanism and provided information regarding the origins of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Furthermore, this diazo&#8208;cycloaddition protocol was applied to construct tetrazole&#8208;modified peptidomimetics and drug&#8208;like amino acid derivatives.

         <title>Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of residual dipolar couplings by NMR spectroscopy is presented. The medium is based on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli and shown to withstand a wide range of challenging experimental conditions. Being compatible with biological macromolecules and small molecules alike, its high versatility suggests broad applicability in molecular structure determination by NMR.







Abstract
In NMR spectroscopy, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) have emerged as one of the most exquisite probes of biological structure and dynamics. The measurement of RDCs relies on the partial alignment of the molecule of interest, for example by using a liquid crystal as a solvent. Here, we establish bacterial type 1 pili as an alternative liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of RDCs. To achieve alignment at pilus concentrations that allow for efficient NMR sample preparation, we elongated wild&#8208;type pili by recombinant overproduction of the main structural pilus subunit. Building on the extraordinary stability of type 1 pili against spontaneous dissociation and unfolding, we show that the medium is compatible with challenging experimental conditions such as high temperature, the presence of detergents, organic solvents or very acidic pH, setting it apart from most established alignment media. Using human ubiquitin, HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and camphor as spectroscopic probes, we demonstrate the applicability of the medium for the determination of RDCs of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. Our results show that type 1 pili represent a very useful alternative to existing alignment media and may readily assist the characterization of molecular structure and dynamics by NMR.

         <title>Secretion&#8208;Catalyzed Assembly of Protein Biomaterials on a Bacterial Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>

Bacillus subtilis can be programmed to autonomously assemble recombinant silk peptides on its own membrane, and then release them as fibers into the extracellular milieu. The process, called secretion&#8208;catalyzed assembly, enables coupled synthesis, assembly, and processing of biomaterials by microbes.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;based biomaterials have played a key role in tissue engineering, and additional exciting applications as self&#8208;healing materials and sustainable polymers are emerging. Over the past few decades, recombinant expression and production of various fibrous proteins from microbes have been demonstrated; however, the resulting proteins typically must then be purified and processed by humans to form usable fibers and materials. Here, we show that the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis can be programmed to secrete silk through its translocon via an orthogonal signal peptide/peptidase pair. Surprisingly, we discover that this translocation mechanism drives the silk proteins to assemble into fibers spontaneously on the cell surface, in a process we call secretion&#8208;catalyzed assembly (SCA). Secreted silk fibers form self&#8208;healing hydrogels with minimal processing. Alternatively, the fibers retained on the membrane provide a facile route to create engineered living materials from Bacillus cells. This work provides a blueprint to achieve autonomous assembly of protein biomaterials in useful morphologies directly from microbial factories.

         <title>Asymmetric (4+n) Cycloadditions of Indolyldimethanols for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Indole&#8208;Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric (4+2) and (4+3) cycloadditions of 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols enable the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. This approach led to the first enantioselective construction of challenging tetrahydroindolocarbazole scaffolds, which show promising anticancer activity. Theoretical calculations offer an in&#8208;depth understanding of this class of indolylmethanols.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric construction of chiral indole&#8208;fused rings has become an important issue in the chemical community because of the significance of such scaffolds. In this work, we have accomplished the first catalytic asymmetric (4+2) and (4+3) cycloadditions of 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols by using indoles and 2&#8208;naphthols as suitable reaction partners under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acids, constructing enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused six&#8208;membered and seven&#8208;membered rings in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In addition, this approach is used to realize the first enantioselective construction of challenging tetrahydroindolocarbazole scaffolds, which are found to show promising anticancer activity. More importantly, theoretical calculations of the reaction pathways and activation mode offer an in&#8208;depth understanding of this class of indolylmethanols. This work not only settles the challenges in realizing catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of indolyldimethanols but also provides a powerful strategy for the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings.

         <title>Platinum and Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Ceria as Dual&#8208;Active Sites for Efficient Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;active sites comprising Pt clusters and frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) on porous CeO2 nanorods provide an interface&#8208;independent pathway to boost the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction at low temperatures. The FLP sites enable strong adsorption of CO2 for efficient activation, but weak adsorption of CO that suppresses CH4 formation.







Abstract
The low&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction faces the following obstacles: low activity and unsatisfactory selectivity. Herein, the dual&#8208;active sites of platinum (Pt) clusters and frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) on porous CeO2 nanorods (Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2) provide an interface&#8208;independent pathway to boost high performance RWGS reaction at low temperatures. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that Pt clusters can effectively activate and dissociate H2. The FLP sites, instead of the metal and support interfaces, not only enhance the strong adsorption and activation of CO2, but also significantly weaken CO adsorption on FLP to facilitate CO release and suppress the CH4 formation. With the help of hydrogen spillover from Pt to PN&#8722;CeO2, the Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 catalysts achieved a CO yield of 29.6&#8201;%, which is very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium yield of CO (29.8&#8201;%) at 350&#8201;&#176;C. Meanwhile, the Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 catalysts delivered a large turnover frequency of 8720&#8197;h&#8722;1. Moreover, Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 operated stably and continuously for at least 840&#8197;h. This finding provides a promising path toward optimizing the RWGS reaction.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective 1,4&#8208;Oxyamination of Conjugated gem&#8208;Difluorodienes via Coupling with Carboxylic Acids and Dioxazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes afforded 1,4&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives in excellent 1,4&#8208;regioselectivity and enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeded via rhodium(III) catalysis through an &#951;3&#8208;allyl intermediate.







Abstract
The incorporation of fluorine atoms in organics improves their bioactivity and lipophilicity. Catalytic functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorodienes represents one of the most straightforward approaches to access fluorinated alkenes. In contrast to the regular 1,3&#8208;dienes that undergo diverse asymmetric di/hydrofunctionalizations, the regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes remains untouched. Herein, we report asymmetric 1,4&#8208;oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodiene by chiral rhodium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling with readily available carboxylic acid and dioxazolone, affording gem&#8208;difluorinated 1,4&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives. Our asymmetric protocol exhibits high 1,4&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Stoichiometric experiments provide evidences for the &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium pathway. Related oxyamination was also realized when trifluoroethanol was used as an oxygen nucleophile.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked [2]Rotaxane Aerogels with Tunable Morphologies and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of mechanical bonds in modulating the intrinsic characteristics of aerogels, such as porous microstructures and mechanical performances, has been demonstrated with mechanically interlocked aerogels. Such networks facilitate the development of smart materials with complex functionalities.







Abstract
Mechanical bonds have been utilized as promising motifs to construct mechanically interlocked aerogels (MIAs) with mechanical adaptivity and multifunctionality. However, fabricating such aerogels with not only precise chemical structures but also dynamic features remains challenging. Herein, we present MIAs carrying dense [2]rotaxane units, which bestow both the stability and flexibility of the aerogel network. Owing to the stable chemical structure of a [2]rotaxane, MIAs possessing a precise and full&#8208;scale mechanically interlocked network could be fabricated with the aid of diverse solvents. In addition, the dynamic nature of the [2]rotaxane resulted in morphologies and mechanical performances of the MIAs that can be dramatically modulated under chemical stimuli. We hope that the structure&#8211;property relationship in MIAs will facilitate the development of mechanically interlocked materials and provide novel opportunities toward constructing smart materials with multifunctionalities.

We hope that the structure&#8211;property relationship in MIAs will facilitate the development of mechanically interlocked materials and provide novel opportunities toward constructing smart materials with multifunctionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Difluorocarbene Transfer via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles via palladium catalysis has been developed. This reaction overcomes the intrinsic limitations of electrophilic difluorocarbene and allows difluoromethylation of various aryl bromides and aryl triflates. Experimental mechanistic studies revealed that a palladium(0/II) pathway is responsible for this reductive reaction.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles has been developed, representing a new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The approach uses low&#8208;cost and bulk industrial chemical chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H) as the difluorocarbene precursor. It produces a variety of difluoromethylated (hetero)arenes from widely available aryl halides/triflates and proton sources, featuring high functional group tolerance and synthetic convenience without preparing organometallic reagents. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that an unexpected Pd0/II catalytic cycle is involved in this reductive reaction, wherein the oxidative addition of palladium(0) difluorocarbene ([Pd0(Ln)]=CF2) with aryl electrophile to generate the key intermediate aryldifluoromethylpalladium [ArCF2Pd(Ln)X], followed by reaction with hydroquinone, is responsible for the reductive difluorocarbene transfer.

         <title>Intracellular Molecules Induced Extracellular Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Efficient and Effective In Situ Cell Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unavoidable leaky protein expression limits in situ cell purification of synthetic mRNA switches. Harnessing the power of controlled self&#8208;assembly, we use synthetic mRNA switch to convey intracellular biomarker information into enzyme&#8208;controlled toxic assemblies only on the surface of undesired cells, promising high purity and high retention of target cells.







Abstract
Synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) switches are powerful tools for in situ cell purification, especially for cells derived from stem cells. However, the retention effectiveness of the target cells is limited by the leaky expression of toxic protein. The elimination efficiency of non&#8208;target cells is also constrained due to the lack of signal amplification. In this study, we designed a novel approach that uses synthetic mRNA switch to convey intracellular marker molecule information into spatially controlled extracellular toxic assembly formation. The approach bypasses the use of toxic protein to ensure high target cell recovery effectiveness. Meanwhile, the marker molecule information is amplified at multiple levels to ensure high non&#8208;target cell elimination effectiveness. Our approach can be tailored to meet various in situ cell purification needs, promising high&#8208;quality in situ cell purification for a wide range of biomedical applications.

         <title>Modular Alcohol Click Chemistry Enables Facile Synthesis of Recyclable Polymers with Tunable Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile method to synthesize a series of recyclable plastics has been developed. It involves the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS and arises from the discovery of a new, modular, and efficient click reaction involving alcohol.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers derived from sustainable feedstocks presents enormous challenges. Here, we develop a novel, modular, and efficient click reaction for connecting primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohols with activated alkenes via a bridge molecule of carbonyl sulfide (COS). The click reaction is successfully applied to synthesize a series of recyclable polymers by the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS. Diols and diacrylates are common chemicals and can be produced from biorenewable sources, and COS is released as the industrial waste. In addition to sustainable monomers, the approach is atom&#8208;economical, wide in scope, metal&#8208;free, and performed under mild conditions, affording unprecedented polymers with nearly quantitative yields. The produced polymers also possess predesigned and widely tunable structure owing to the versatility of our method and the broad variety of monomers. The in&#8208;chain thiocarbonate and ester polar groups can play as breakpoints, allowing these polymers to be easily recycled. Overall, the polymers have broad prospects for green materials given their facile synthesis, readily available feedstocks, desirable performance, and chemical recyclability.

         <title>Migration and Precipitation of Platinum in Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the complementary techniques of X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, Pt ion migration was identified as an important factor to explain the decay in performance of anion&#8208;exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells. The picture shows 3D reconstruction micro&#8208;CT images of the cross&#8208;section MEAs with Sustainion AEM and Pt/C cathode electrode after (a) 5&#8197;h and (b) 70&#8197;h of operation at 0.15&#8197;A/cm2.







Abstract
Despite the recent progress in increasing the power generation of Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), their durability is still far lower than that of Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Using the complementary techniques of X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;computed tomography (CT), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we have identified Pt ion migration as an important factor to explain the decay in performance of AEMFCs. In alkaline media Pt+2 ions are easily formed which then either undergo dissolution into the carbon support or migrate to the membrane. In contrast to PEMFCs, where hydrogen cross over reduces the ions forming a vertical &#8220;Pt line&#8221; within the membrane, the ions in the AEM are trapped by charged groups within the membrane, leading to disintegration of the membrane and failure. Diffusion of the metal components is still observed when the Pt/C of the cathode is substituted with a FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst, but in this case the Fe and Co ions are not trapped within the membrane, but rather migrate into the anode, thereby increasing the stability of the membrane.

         <title>Unlocking Reversible Silicon Redox for High&#8208;Performing Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible Si redox has been unlocked in Cl&#8208;based batteries through rational electrolyte dilution and anode passivation, which demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and high practicability. It enables us to revisit the overlooked Cl&#8208;based batteries and to harness them for sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy storage.







Abstract
Chlorine (Cl)&#8208;based batteries such as Li/Cl2 batteries are recognized as promising candidates for energy storage with low cost and high performance. However, the current use of Li metal anodes in Cl&#8208;based batteries has raised serious concerns regarding safety, cost, and production complexity. More importantly, the well&#8208;documented parasitic reactions between Li metal and Cl&#8208;based electrolytes require a large excess of Li metal, which inevitably sacrifices the electrochemical performance of the full cell. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to establish new anode chemistry, particularly with electrochemical reversibility, for Cl&#8208;based batteries. Here we show, for the first time, reversible Si redox in Cl&#8208;based batteries through efficient electrolyte dilution and anode/electrolyte interface passivation using 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane and cyclized polyacrylonitrile as key mediators. Our Si anode chemistry enables significantly increased cycling stability and shelf lives compared with conventional Li metal anodes. It also avoids the use of a large excess of anode materials, thus enabling the first rechargeable Cl2 full battery with remarkable energy and power densities of 809&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 4,277&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively. The Si anode chemistry affords fast kinetics with remarkable rate capability and low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, indicating its great potential in practical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorine (Cl)-based batteries such as Li/Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries are recognized as promising candidates for energy storage with low cost and high performance. However, the current use of Li metal anodes in Cl-based batteries has raised serious concerns regarding safety, cost, and production complexity. More importantly, the well-documented parasitic reactions between Li metal and Cl-based electrolytes require a large excess of Li metal, which inevitably sacrifices the electrochemical performance of the full cell. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to establish new anode chemistry, particularly with electrochemical reversibility, for Cl-based batteries. Here we show, for the first time, reversible Si redox in Cl-based batteries through efficient electrolyte dilution and anode/electrolyte interface passivation using 1,2-dichloroethane and cyclized polyacrylonitrile as key mediators. Our Si anode chemistry enables significantly increased cycling stability and shelf lives compared with conventional Li metal anodes. It also avoids the use of a large excess of anode materials, thus enabling the first rechargeable Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full battery with remarkable energy and power densities of 809&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4,277&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The Si anode chemistry affords fast kinetics with remarkable rate capability and low-temperature electrochemical performance, indicating its great potential in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Achiral and Chiral Organic Ligands in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Metal Halides to Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an efficient strategy to achieve simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield and large dissymmetry factor (glum) in chiral 0D hybrid metal halides by integrating achiral and chiral ligands. A pair of (R/S&#8208;MBA)2(Gua)4(In0.99Sb0.01Cl6)2 H2O (MBA=&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylammonium, Gua=guanidine) HMHs with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and large glum values (~0.01) are constructed.







Abstract
Chiral zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) could combine excellent optical properties and chirality, making them promising for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral 0D HMHs with efficient CPL have been rarely reported. Here, we propose an efficient strategy to achieve simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and large dissymmetry factor (glum), by integrating achiral and chiral ligands into 0D HMHs. Specifically, three pairs of chiral 0D hybrid indium&#8208;antimony chlorides are synthesized by combing achiral guanidine with three types of chiral methylbenzylammonium&#8208;based derivatives as the organic cations. These chiral 0D HMHs exhibit near&#8208;unity PLQY and large glum values up to around &#177;1&#215;10&#8722;2. The achiral guanidine ligand is not only essential to crystallize these hybrid indium&#8208;antimony chlorides to achieve near&#8208;unity PLQYs, but also greatly enhances the chirality induction from organic ligands to inorganic units in these 0D HMHs. Furthermore, the choice of different chiral ligands can modify the strength of hydrogen bonding interactions in these 0D HMHs, to maximize their glum values. Overall, this study provides a robust way to realize efficient CPL in chiral HMHs, expanding their applications in chiroptical fields.

         <title>Total Structure, Electronic Structure and Catalytic Hydrogenation Activity of Metal&#8208;Deficient Chiral Polyhydride Cu57 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral metal&#8208;deficient Cu57 hydride&#8208;rich nanocluster was prepared by a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy. Its total structure and electronic structure were established by combined experimental and DFT results. Its optical and catalytic hydrogenation properties were studied.







Abstract
Accurate identifying and in&#8208;depth understanding of the defect sites in a working nanomaterial could hinge on establishing specific defect&#8208;activity relationships. Yet, atomically precise coinage&#8208;metal nanoclusters (NCs) possessing surface vacancy defects are scarce primarily owing to challenges in the synthesis and isolation of such defective NCs. Herein we report a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy to synthesizing an intrinsically chiral and metal&#8208;deficient copper hydride&#8208;rich NC [Cu57H20(PET)36(TPP)4]+ (Cu57H20). Its total structure (including hydrides) and electronic structure are well established by combined experimental and computational results. Crystal structure reveals Cu57H20 features a cube&#8208;like Cu8 kernel embedded in a corner&#8208;missing metal&#8208;ligand shell of Cu49(PET)36(TPP)4. Single Cu vacancy defect site occurs at one corner of the shell, evocative of mono&#8208;lacunary polyoxometalates. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the above&#8208;mentioned point vacancy causes one surface hydride exposed as an interfacial capping &#956;3&#8208;H&#8722;, which is accessible in chemical reaction, as proved by deuterated experiment. Moreover, Cu57H20 shows catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of nitroarene. The success of this work opens the way for the research on well&#8208;defined chiral metal&#8208;deficient Cu and other metal NCs, including exploring their application in asymmetrical catalysis.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reaction&#8208;Mediated Tumor&#8208;Selective Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 System for Dual&#8208;Targeted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;targeted CRISPR/Cas delivery strategy was developed to switch on antitumor immunity via bioorthogonal reaction. Selectively labeling tumor sites and the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved first, turning &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221;. The targeted accumulation of the CRISPR/Cas system within tumors via click chemistry then further enhanced cancer immunotherapy, substantially boosting antitumor effectiveness.







Abstract
CRISPR system&#8208;assisted immunotherapy is an attractive option in cancer therapy. However, its efficacy is still less than expected due to the limitations in delivering the CRISPR system to target cancer cells. Here, we report a new CRISPR/Cas9 tumor&#8208;targeting delivery strategy based on bioorthogonal reactions for dual&#8208;targeted cancer immunotherapy. First, selective in vivo metabolic labeling of cancer and activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved simultaneously through tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;biodegradable hollow manganese dioxide (H&#8208;MnO2) nano&#8208;platform. Subsequently, CRISPR/Cas9 system&#8208;loaded liposome was accumulated within the modified tumor tissue through in vivo click chemistry, resulting in the loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) and further sensitizing tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, our strategy provides a modular platform for precise gene editing in vivo and exhibits potent antitumor response by boosting innate and adaptive antitumor immunity.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mn2+&#8722;NO and NO&#8722;NO Distance Measurements Reveal That Catalytic Asymmetry Regulates Alternating Access in an ABC Transporter
</title>

         <dc:description>
Several ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporters possess asymmetric nucleotide&#8208;binding sites (NBSs). Here, we elucidated its functional relevance using concomitant NO&#8722;NO, Mn2+&#8722;NO, and Mn2+&#8722;Mn2+ distance measurements for the ABC exporter TmrAB in a time&#8208;resolved manner. Our results shows that ATP hydrolysis at the active consensus NBS accelerates the reverse transition, and the impaired degenerate NBS might regulate the overall kinetics of this process.







Abstract
ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporters shuttle diverse substrates across biological membranes. Transport is often achieved through a transition between an inward&#8208;facing (IF) and an outward&#8208;facing (OF) conformation of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Asymmetric nucleotide&#8208;binding sites (NBSs) are present among several ABC subfamilies and their functional role remains elusive. Here we addressed this question using concomitant NO&#8722;NO, Mn2+&#8722;NO, and Mn2+&#8722;Mn2+ pulsed electron&#8211;electron double&#8208;resonance spectroscopy of TmrAB in a time&#8208;resolved manner. This type&#8208;IV ABC transporter undergoes a reversible transition in the presence of ATP with a significantly faster forward transition. The impaired degenerate NBS stably binds Mn2+&#8722;ATP, and Mn2+ is preferentially released at the active consensus NBS. ATP hydrolysis at the consensus NBS considerably accelerates the reverse transition. Both NBSs fully open during each conformational cycle and the degenerate NBS may regulate the kinetics of this process.

Transport is often achieved through a transition between an inward-facing (IF) and an outward-facing (OF) conformation of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites (NBSs) are present among several ABC subfamilies and their functional role remains elusive. Here we addressed this question using concomitant NO&#8722;NO, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;NO, and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pulsed electron&#8211;electron double-resonance spectroscopy of TmrAB in a time-resolved manner. This type-IV ABC transporter undergoes a reversible transition in the presence of ATP with a significantly faster forward transition. The impaired degenerate NBS stably binds Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;ATP, and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is preferentially released at the active consensus NBS. ATP hydrolysis at the consensus NBS considerably accelerates the reverse transition. Both NBSs fully open during each conformational cycle and the degenerate NBS may regulate the kinetics of this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 Clusters as Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Selective H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>

Novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster electrocatalysts were prepared through a mild and facile synthetic method, affording excellent 2 e&#8722; ORR activity for efficient and selective H2O2 synthesis.







Abstract
Co&#8208;based material catalysts have shown attractive application prospects in the 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, for the industrial synthesis of H2O2, there is still lack of Co&#8208;based catalysts with high production yield rate. Here, novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster catalysts were prepared via a mild and facile method. The catalyst exhibited remarkable H2O2 selectivity (94.2&#8201;% ~ 98.2&#8201;%), good stability (99&#8201;% activity retention after 35&#8197;h), and ultra&#8208;high H2O2 production yield rate (5.58&#8197;mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the H&#8208;type electrolytic cell), demonstrating its promising industrial application potential. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the cyclodextrin&#8208;mediated Co(OH)2 electronic structure optimizes the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and significantly enhances the activation energy barrier for dissociation, leading to the high reactivity and selectivity for the 2 e&#8722; ORR. This work offers a valuable and practical strategy to design Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electronegative Channels as Cationic Highways for Sustainable Lithium Metal Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative 1D channels are presented as a cationic highway membrane strategy for sustainable Li metal battery anodes. Introduction of triazine rings and fluorinated groups into the COF skeletons played a viable role in enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels. The resulting COF membrane exhibited reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability and stable capacity retention in the Li/LiFePO4 full cell.







Abstract
Despite the enormous interest in Li metal as an ideal anode material, the uncontrollable Li dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have plagued its practical application. These limitations can be attributed to the sluggish and uneven Li+ migration towards Li metal surface. Here, we report olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative channels for facilitating selective Li+ transport. The triazine rings and fluorinated groups of the COFs are introduced as electron&#8208;rich sites capable of enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels, resulting in a high Li+ transference number (0.85) and high ionic conductivity (1.78&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The COFs are mixed with a polymeric binder to form mixed matrix membranes. These membranes enable reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability over 700&#8197;h in Li/Li symmetric cells and stable capacity retention in Li/LiFePO4 cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable cationic highway for accelerating Li+ conduction.

         <title>Regulating Degradation Pathways of Polymers by Radical&#8208;Triggered Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have proposed the radical&#8208;triggered luminescence to monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from ROO&#8901; emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways of polymers were regulated into a double sigmoidal curve by anti&#8208;degradation LDHs.







Abstract
Understanding the radical behaviours during polymer degradation is beneficial to unveil and regulate the degradation pathways of polymers to achieve a sustainable polymer development. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to study radical behaviours owing to the ultra&#8208;short lifetime of the transient radicals generated during the polymer degradation. In this contribution, we have proposed the radical&#8208;triggered luminescence to monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation without/with the addition of inorganic additives. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from peroxy radicals (ROO&#8901;) emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways with the addition of additives, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with positively charged Al centers, could be modulated into a double sigmoidal dynamics, involving the main product of alkoxy radicals (RO&#8901;) with the activation energy of 40.2&#8197;kJ/mol and a small amount of ROO&#8901; with 76.3&#8197;kJ/mol, respectively. Accordingly, the polymers with the additive&#8208;regulated pathways could exhibit prominently anti&#8208;degradation behaviours. This work is beneficial for the deep understanding of the radical mechanisms during polymer degradation, and for the rational design of anti&#8208;degradation polymers.

         <title>Remote C&#8722;H Olefination of Heterocyclic Biaryls Enabled by Reversibly Bound Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalizations of 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;phenylpyridine biaryls at sterically disfavored ortho positions were realized by developing two new catalytic templates.







Abstract
Remote C&#8722;H functionalization of heterocyclic biaryls will be of great importance in synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Through adjusting the geometric relationship of the directing atom and target C&#8722;H bonds, two new catalytic templates have been developed to enable the functionalization of the more hindered ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of heterobiaryls bearing directing heteroatom at the meta&#8208; or para&#8208;positions, affording unprecedented site&#8208;selectivity. The use of template chaperone also overcomes product inhibition and renders the directing templates catalytic. The utility of this protocol was demonstrated by olefination of heterocyclic biaryls with various substituents, overriding conventional steric and electronic effects. These ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H olefinated heterobiaryls are sterically hindered and can often be challenging to prepare through aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions.

         <title>A Modular Approach for the Synthesis of Natural and Artificial Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust chem&#8208;stamp approach consisting of two steps, one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to alkenyl boronates and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of these alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols, has been developed for the construction of key isoprene units in terpenoids. This approach enables the modular concise synthesis of terpenoids and the creation of artificial terpenoids with control over the number of isoprene units, the side chain, and two terminal groups.







Abstract
Many terpenoids with isoprene unit(s) demonstrating critical biological activities have been isolated and characterized. In this study, we have developed a robust chem&#8208;stamp strategy for the construction of the key isoprene unit, which consists of two steps: one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to the alkenyl boronates by the boron&#8208;Wittig reaction and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols to yield enals. This chem&#8208;stamp could readily be applied repeatedly and separately, enabling the modular concise synthesis of many natural and pharmaceutically active terpenoids, including retinal, &#946;&#8208;carotene, vitamin A, tretinoin, fenretinide, acitretin, ALRT1550, nigerapyrone C, peretinoin, and lycopene. Owing to the diversified availability of the starting materials, aldehydes and 2,3&#8208;allenols, creation of new non&#8208;natural terpenoids has been realized from four dimensions: the number of isoprene units, the side chain, and the two terminal groups.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Poly (Triazine Imide) Nanosheets for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>

Single&#8208;crystalline poly (Triazine Imide)/Li+Cl&#8722; nanosheets with more exposed active sites and efficient charge transfer present a record apparent quantum efficiency of 25&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) (PTI/Li+Cl&#8722;), one of the crystalline versions of polymeric carbon nitrides, holds great promise for photocatalytic overall water splitting. In principle, the photocatalytic activity of PTI/Li+Cl&#8722; is closely related to the morphology, which could be reasonably tailored by the modulation of the polycondensation process. Herein, we demonstrate that the hexagonal prisms of PTI/Li+Cl&#8722; could be converted to hexagonal nanosheets by adjusting the binary eutectic salts from LiCl/KCl or NaCl/LiCl to ternary LiCl/KCl/NaCl. Results reveal that the extension of in&#8208;plane conjugation is preferred, when the polymerisation was performed in the presence of ternary eutectic salts. The hexagonal nanosheets bears longer lifetimes of charge carriers than that of hexagonal prisms due to lower intensity of structure defects and shorter hopping distance of charge carriers along the stacking direction of triazine nanosheets. The optimized hexagonal nanosheets exhibits a record apparent quantum yield value of 25&#8201;% (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) for solar hydrogen production by one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting.

         <title>From Tethered to Freestanding Stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions through Fragment Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linked fragments for molecular glue development for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are described. Two classes of fragments were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a noncovalent hybrid molecule that was further optimized, guided by 20 crystal structures, resulting in a selective 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; PPIs.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule stabilization of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising strategy in chemical biology and drug discovery. However, the systematic discovery of PPI stabilizers remains a largely unmet challenge. Herein we report a fragment&#8208;linking approach targeting the interface of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and a peptide derived from the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) protein. Two classes of fragments&#8212;a covalent and a noncovalent fragment&#8212;were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a noncovalent hybrid molecule in which the original fragment interactions were largely conserved. Supported by 20 crystal structures, this initial hybrid molecule was further optimized, resulting in selective, 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; interaction. The high&#8208;resolution structures of both the single fragments, their co&#8208;crystal structures and those of the linked fragments document a feasible strategy to develop orthosteric PPI stabilizers by linking to an initial tethered fragment.

         <title>Nano Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) with Anti&#8208;Hook Effect for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ peptide self&#8208;assembly into a nano proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) system was reported with &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221; to realize dose&#8208;dependent and long&#8208;acting protein degradation in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is an emerging pharmacological modality with innovated post&#8208;translational protein degradation capabilities. However, off&#8208;target induced unintended tissue effects and intrinsic &#8220;hook effect&#8221; hinder PROTAC biotechnology to be maturely developed. Herein, an intracellular fabricated nano proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) modality with a center&#8208;spoke degradation network for achieving efficient dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation in tumor is reported. The PROTAC precursors are triggered by higher GSH concentrations inside tumor cells, which subsequently in situ self&#8208;assemble into Nano&#8208;PROTACs through intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. The fibrous Nano&#8208;PROTACs can form effective polynary complexes and E3 ligases degradation network with multi&#8208;binding sites, achieving dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation with &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221;. The generality and efficacy of Nano&#8208;PROTACs are validated by degrading variable protein of interest (POI) such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and androgen receptor (AR) in a wide&#8208;range dose&#8208;dependent manner with a 95&#8201;% degradation rate and long&#8208;lasting potency up to 72&#8197;h in vitro. Significantly, Nano&#8208;PROTACs achieve in vivo dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation up to 79&#8201;% and tumor growth inhibition in A549 and LNCap xenograft mice models, respectively. Taking advantages of in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy, the Nano&#8208;PROTACs provide a generalizable platform to promote precise clinical translational application of PROTAC.

         <title>A Semisynthetic Bioluminescence Sensor for Ratiometric Imaging of Metal Ions In Vivo Using DNAzymes Conjugated to An Engineered Nano&#8208;Luciferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fusion protein of Nano&#8208;luciferase and HaloTag was engineered to construct a DNAzyme sensor for metal ion detection in vivo, utilizing bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET).







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based probes have gained significant attention as versatile tools for biochemical analysis, benefiting from their programmability and biocompatibility. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based probes rely on fluorescence as the signal output, which can be problematic due to issues like autofluorescence and scattering when applied in complex biological materials such as living cells or tissues. Herein, we report the development of bioluminescent nucleic acid (bioLUNA) sensors that offer laser excitation&#8208;independent and ratiometric imaging of the target in vivo. The system is based on computational modelling and mutagenesis investigations of a genetic fusion between circular permutated Nano&#8208;luciferase (NLuc) and HaloTag, enabling the conjugation of the protein with a DNAzyme. In the presence of Zn2+, the DNAzyme sensor releases the fluorophore&#8208;labelled strand, leading to a reduction in bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and fluorophore. Consequently, this process induces ratiometric changes in the bioluminescent signal. We demonstrated that this bioLUNA sensor enabled imaging of both exogenous Zn2+ in vivo and endogenous Zn2+ efflux in normal epithelial prostate and prostate tumors. This work expands the DNAzyme sensors to using bioluminescence and thus has enriched the toolbox of nucleic acid sensors for a broad range of biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A fusion protein of Nano-luciferase and HaloTag was engineered to construct a DNAzyme sensor for metal ion detection &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, utilizing bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA-based probes have gained significant attention as versatile tools for biochemical analysis, benefiting from their programmability and biocompatibility. However, most existing DNA-based probes rely on fluorescence as the signal output, which can be problematic due to issues like autofluorescence and scattering when applied in complex biological materials such as living cells or tissues. Herein, we report the development of bioluminescent nucleic acid (bioLUNA) sensors that offer laser excitation-independent and ratiometric imaging of the target &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The system is based on computational modelling and mutagenesis investigations of a genetic fusion between circular permutated Nano-luciferase (NLuc) and HaloTag, enabling the conjugation of the protein with a DNAzyme. In the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the DNAzyme sensor releases the fluorophore-labelled strand, leading to a reduction in bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and fluorophore. Consequently, this process induces ratiometric changes in the bioluminescent signal. We demonstrated that this bioLUNA sensor enabled imaging of both exogenous Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;i&gt;+&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and endogenous Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux in normal epithelial prostate and prostate tumors. This work expands the DNAzyme sensors to using bioluminescence and thus has enriched the toolbox of nucleic acid sensors for a broad range of biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination and Activation of N2 at Low&#8208;Valent Magnesium using a Heterobimetallic Approach: Synthesis and Reactivity of a Masked Dimagnesium Diradical
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of a bulky magnesium(II) diamide with 5&#8201;% w/w K/KI under an N2 atmosphere has given a complex between magnesium and doubly reduced dinitrogen, N22&#8722;. The reaction has been calculated to proceed via an anionic magnesium(I) radical, and the final product shown to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reactions with CO, H2 and C2H4.







Abstract
The activation of dinitrogen (N2) by transition metals is central to the highly energy intensive, heterogeneous Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Considerable progress has been made towards more sustainable homogeneous activations of N2 with d&#8208; and f&#8208;block metals, though little success has been had with main group metals. Here we report that the reduction of a bulky magnesium(II) amide [(TCHPNON)Mg] (TCHPNON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene) with 5&#8201;% w/w K/KI yields the magnesium&#8208;N2 complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]. DFT calculations and experimental data show that the dinitrogen unit in the complex has been reduced to the N22&#8722; dianion, via a transient anionic magnesium(I) radical. The compound readily reductively activates CO, H2 and C2H4, in reactions in which it acts as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical.

         <title>Correlating Metal Redox Potentials to Co(III)K(I) Catalyst Performances in Carbon Dioxide and Propene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide and propene oxide ring opening copolymerization is a leading carbon dioxide utilization technology. Future catalyst development needs better understanding of how to maximize both activity and selectivity. Here, a series of catalysts show a correlation between both their activity and selectivity values with the cobalt reduction potential, providing a useful &#8216;predictive&#8217; tool for catalyst performances.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide copolymerization is a front&#8208;runner CO2 utilization strategy but its viability depends on improving the catalysis. So far, catalyst structure&#8208;performance correlations have not been straightforward, limiting the ability to predict how to improve both catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a simple measure of a catalyst ground&#8208;state parameter, metal reduction potential, directly correlates with both polymerization activity and selectivity. It is applied to compare performances of 6 new heterodinuclear Co(III)K(I) catalysts for propene oxide (PO)/CO2 ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) producing poly(propene carbonate) (PPC). The best catalyst shows an excellent turnover frequency of 389&#8197;h&#8722;1 and high PPC selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;% (50&#8201;&#176;C, 20&#8197;bar, 0.025&#8197;mol% catalyst). As demonstration of its utility, neither DFT calculations nor ligand Hammett parameter analyses are viable predictors. It is proposed that the cobalt redox potential informs upon the active site electron density with a more electron rich cobalt centre showing better performances. The method may be widely applicable and is recommended to guide future catalyst discovery for other (co)polymerizations and carbon dioxide utilizations.

         <title>A Strategy for Controlling the Polymerizations of Thiyl Radical Propagation by RAFT Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy that could enable the polymerizations of thiyl radical propagation to be controlled by existing RDRP methods has been reported. The key to this strategy is the propagating thiyl radicals could undergo desulfurization with isocyanides to generate stabilized alkyl radicals, thereby allowing for controlling the polymerization via RAFT agents, leading to the formation of main&#8208;chain polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures.







Abstract
The ability to extend the polymerizations of thiyl radical propagation to be regulated by existing controlled methods would be highly desirable, yet remained very challenging to achieve because the thiyl radicals still cannot be reversibly controlled by these methods. In this article, we reported a novel strategy that could enable the radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of macrocyclic allylic sulfides, wherein propagating specie is thiyl radical, to be controlled by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents. The key to the success of this strategy is the propagating thiyl radical can undergo desulfurization with isocyanide and generate a stabilized alkyl radical for reversible control. Systematic optimization of the reaction conditions allowed good control over the polymerization, leading to the formation of polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures, exemplified by the radical block copolymerization of macrocyclic allylic sulfides and vinyl monomers and the incorporation of sequence&#8208;defined segments into the polymer backbone. This work represents a significant step toward directly enabling the polymerizations of heteroatom&#8208;centered radical propagation to be regulated by existing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques.

         <title>Pore Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of HOFs with unique pore structures have been designed by precise pore modulation engineering through the introduction of structure directing agents. One example is HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 with a one&#8208;dimensional pearl&#8208;chain channel that balances size control, adsorption capacity, and functional sites for efficient storage and separation of propylene.







Abstract
Developing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) that combine functional sites, size control, and storage capability for targeting gas molecule capture is a novel and challenging venture. However, there is a lack of effective strategies to tune the hydrogen&#8208;bonded network to achieve high&#8208;performance HOFs. Here, a series of HOFs termed as HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;M (M=1, 2, and 3) with different pore structures are obtained by introducing structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs) into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). These HOFs have distinct space configurations with pore channels ranging from discrete to continuous multi&#8208;dimensional. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals a rare diversity of hydrogen&#8208;bonding models dominated by SDAs. HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2, which forms a strong layered hydrogen&#8208;bonding network with ammonium (NH4+) through multiple carboxyl groups, has a suitable 1D &#8220;pearl&#8208;chain&#8221; channel for the selective capture of propylene (C3H6). At 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, the C3H6 storage density of HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 reaches 0.6&#8197;kg&#8201;L&#8722;1, representing one of the best C3H6 storage materials, while offering a propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) selectivity of 12.2. Theoretical calculations and in situ SCXRD provide a detailed analysis of the binding strength of C3H6 at different locations in the pearl&#8208;chain channel. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirm that HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 can effectively separate C3H6 from multi&#8208;mixtures.

At 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; storage density of &lt;b&gt;HOF-ZSTU-2&lt;/b&gt; reaches 0.6&#8197;kg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing one of the best C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; storage materials, while offering a propylene/propane (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) selectivity of 12.2. Theoretical calculations and in situ SCXRD provide a detailed analysis of the binding strength of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; at different locations in the pearl-chain channel. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirm that &lt;b&gt;HOF-ZSTU-2&lt;/b&gt; can effectively separate C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; from multi-mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C(sp2)&#8722;F Bond Alkylation of Industrially Relevant Hydrofluoroolefin HFO&#8208;1234yf</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond alkylation of the inexpensive industrial chemical HFO&#8208;1234yf with alkylzinc reagents has been developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the less electron&#8208;rich pyridine&#8208;oxazoline or bipyridine&#8208;based ligands feature comparable or even higher rates of C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition than the electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands in the presence of lithium bromide.







Abstract
The selective transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;F bond functionalization of inexpensive industrial fluorochemicals represents one of the most attractive approaches to valuable fluorinated compounds. However, the selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond carbofunctionalization of refrigerant hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) remains challenging. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond alkylation of HFO&#8208;1234yf with alkylzinc reagents. The resulting 2&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes can serve as a versatile synthon for diversified transformations, including the anti&#8208;Markovnikov type hydroalkylation and the synthesis of bioactive molecule analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that lithium salt is essential to promote the oxidative addition of Ni0(Ln) to the C&#8722;F bond; the less electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;based ligands, such as bipyridine and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline, feature comparable or even higher oxidative addition rates than the electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands; the strong &#963;&#8208;donating phosphine ligands, such as PMe3, are detrimental to transmetallation, but the less electron&#8208;rich and bulky N&#8208;based ligands, such as pyridine&#8208;oxazoline, facilitate transmetallation and reductive elimination to form the final product.

         <title>Cooperative and Orthogonal Switching in the Solid State Enabled by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Confinement Leading to a Thermo&#8208;Photochromic Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like two color&#8208;changing chameleons coming face to face, integration of two distinct stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within the same platform results in their synergistic behavior. Perturbation of the chameleons&#8217; environment upon a different external stimulus breaks the synergy, promoting their orthogonal behavior, a concept highlighted for a novel hierarchical photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework.







Abstract
Cooperative behavior and orthogonal responses of two classes of coordinatively integrated photochromic molecules towards distinct external stimuli were demonstrated on the first example of a photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive hierarchical platform. Synergetic and orthogonal responses to temperature and excitation wavelength are achieved by confining the stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), leading to the preparation of a novel photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive spiropyran&#8208;diarylethene based material. Synergistic behavior of two photoswitches enables the study of stimuli&#8208;responsive resonance energy transfer as well as control of the photoinduced charge transfer processes, milestones required to advance optoelectronics development. Spectroscopic studies in combination with theoretical modeling revealed a nonlinear effect on the material electronic structure arising from the coordinative integration of photoresponsive molecules with distinct photoisomerization mechanisms. Thus, the reported work covers multivariable facets of not only fundamental aspects of photoswitch cooperativity, but also provides a pathway to modulate photophysics and electronics of multidimensional functional materials exhibiting thermo&#8208;photochromism.

         <title>Designing F/P Hybrid Polymer as Ultrastable Cationic Shielding Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the on&#8208;demand development of phosphonium fluoropolymers as the electrostatic shielding interlayer to stabilize Li metal anodes, where the periodic arrangement of F/P units not only adaptively homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, but also restrained undesirable coating decomposition to provide persistent protection for long&#8208;term battery cycling.







Abstract
Dendrite growth on electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase has severely limited applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we developed an ionic alternating polymer with fluorocarbons and phosphonium cations in repeating units to regulate Li deposition for the first time. The combined functionalities in the F/P hybrid polymer exhibit remarkable characteristics as a protective layer on top of Li anode, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical stability, ion flux redistributing capability and adaptive chain mobility. Based on characterizations and simulations, this cationic interlayer could effectively furnish long&#8208;standing electrostatic shielding for anodes, allowing restrained coating decomposition and homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, and enabling full cells with enhanced rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance. Given the importance of LMBs, this work will promote polymer design to stabilize anodes with superior electrochemical behavior.

         <title>An Endogenous Prompting Mechanism for Sulfur Conversions Via Coupling with Polysulfides in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional sulfur conversion reactions suffer from severe shuttle effects as well as sluggish redox kinetics. Here, we achieved an endogenous facilitation mechanism for sulfur conversion which constructed a fast &#8220;internal cycle&#8221; of the promotors to promote the slow &#8220;external cycle&#8221; of sulfur conversions by coupling lithium polysulfides with functional molecules. By regulating the intermediates solubility and mediating the reaction kinetics, organophosphorus polysulfides as endogenous promotors can simultaneously eliminate the shuttle effect and improve the sulfur electrode process.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics process and shuttling of soluble intermediates present in complex conversion between sulfur and lithium sulfide severely limit the practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Herein, by introducing a designated functional organic molecule to couple with polysulfide intermediators, an endogenous prompting mechanism of sulfur conversions has thus been created leading to an alternative sulfur&#8208;electrode process, in another words, to build a fast &#8220;internal cycle&#8221; of promotors that can promote the slow &#8220;external cycle&#8221; of sulfur conversions. The coupling&#8208;intermediators between the functional organic molecule and polysulfides, organophosphorus polysulfides, to be the &#8220;promotors&#8221; for sulfur conversions, are not only insoluble in the electrolyte but also with higher redox&#8208;activity. So the sulfur&#8208;electrode process kinetics is greatly improved and the shuttle effect is eliminated simultaneously by this strategy. Meanwhile, with the endogenous prompting mechanism, the morphology of the final discharge product can be modified into a uniform covering film, which is more conducive to its decomposition when charging. Benefiting from the effective mediation of reaction kinetics and control of intermediates solubility, the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries can act out excellent rate performance and cycling stability.

         <title>Supramolecular Block Copolymers from Tricarboxamides. Biasing Co&#8208;assembly by the Incorporation of Pyridine Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;assembly of the pyridine&#8208;based tricarboxamides 2&#8211;4 with tricarboxamide 1 is investigated. Whilst the formation of the supramolecular co&#8208;polymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;2 is not possible, co&#8208;polymers poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 and poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;4 are formed. The latter has been investigated by mass&#8208;balance model that revealed an alternating blocky microstructure.







Abstract
The synthesis of a series of triangular&#8208;shaped tricarboxamides endowed with three picoline or nicotine units (compounds 2 and 3, respectively) or just one nicotine unit (compound 4) is reported, and their self&#8208;assembling features investigated. The pyridine rings make compounds 2&#8211;4 electronically complementary with our previously reported oligo(phenylene ethynylene)tricarboxamides (OPE&#8208;TA) 1 to form supramolecular copolymers. C3&#8208;symmetric tricarboxamide 2 forms highly stable intramolecular five&#8208;membered pseudocycles that impede its supramolecular polymerization into poly&#8208;2 and the co&#8208;assembly with 1 to yield copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;2. On the other hand, C3&#8208;symmetric tricarboxamide 3 readily forms poly&#8208;3 with great stability but unable to form helical supramolecular polymers despite the presence of the peripheral chiral side chains. The copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 can only be obtained by a previous complete disassembly of the constitutive homopolymers in CHCl3. Helical poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 arises in a process involving the transfer of the helicity from racemic poly&#8208;1 to poly&#8208;3, and the amplification of asymmetry from chiral poly&#8208;3 to poly&#8208;1. Importantly, C2v&#8208;symmetric 4, endowed with only one nicotinamide moiety and three chiral side chains, self&#8208;assembles into a P&#8208;type helical supramolecular polymer (poly&#8208;4) in a thermodynamically controlled cooperative process. The combination of poly&#8208;1 and poly&#8208;4 generates chiral supramolecular copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;4, whose blocky microstructure has been investigated by applying the previously reported supramolecular copolymerization model.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Manufacturing of Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystal Elastomers by Stress&#8208;Induced Alignment and Hydrogen Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular soft actuators have been developed that are based on hydrogen&#8208;bond crosslinked liquid&#8208;crystal elastomers (LCEs). The LCEs can be manufactured in the form of fibers and 2D/3D objects that are capable of performing stable and reversible thermal actuation under mechanical stretch or melt extrusion, opening the way for the one&#8208;step and custom manufacturing of soft actuators.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystal elastomers (LCEs) capable of performing large and reversible deformation in response to an external stimulus are an important class of soft actuators. However, their manufacturing process typically involves a multistep approach that requires harsh conditions. For the very first time, LCEs with customized geometries that can be manufactured by a rapid one&#8208;step approach at room temperature are developed. The LCEs are hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) crosslinked main chain polymers comprising flexible short side chains. Applying a stretching/shear force to the LCE can simultaneously induce mesogen alignment and H&#8208;bond exchange, allowing for the formation of well&#8208;aligned LCE networks stabilized by H&#8208;bonds. Based on this working principle, soft actuators in fibers and 2D/3D objects can be manufactured by mechanical stretching or melt extrusion within a short time (e.g. &lt;1&#8197;min). These actuators can perform reversible macroscopic motions with large, controlled deformations up to 38&#8201;%. The dynamic nature of H&#8208;bonds also provides the actuators with reprocessability and reprogrammability. Thus, this work opens the way for the one&#8208;step and custom manufacturing of soft actuators.

         <title>Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity as Solid Ion Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes based on polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) are proposed as ideal solid electrolytes for lithium batteries. Benefiting from rational material selection and structure design, solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries deliver high discharge specific capacity (11307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and prolonged cycling life (247&#8197;cycles). The solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries can operate steadily for over 100&#8197;cycles after a series of abuse tests (bending and twisting).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity and superior stability are considered to be a key technology for the safe operation of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, current SSEs are incapable of meeting the requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here we report a general strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance SSEs by engineering polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs). Taking advantage of the interconnected ion pathways generated from the ionizable groups, high ionic conductivity (1.06&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) is achieved for the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs. The mechanically strong (50.0&#8197;MPa) and non&#8208;flammable SSEs combine the two superiorities of outstanding Li+ conductivity and electrochemical stability, which can restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short&#8208;circuiting even after more than 2200&#8197;h cycling. Benefiting from the rational design of SSEs, PIMs&#8208;based SSEs Li&#8208;metal batteries can achieve good cycling performance and superior feasibility in a series of withstand abuse tests including bending, cutting, and penetration. Moreover, the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs endow high specific capacity (11307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (247&#8197;cycles) for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The PIMs&#8208;based SSEs present a powerful strategy for enabling safe operation of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Proton/Mg2+ Co&#8208;Insertion Chemistry in Aqueous Mg&#8208;Ion Batteries: From the Interface to the Inner</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton co&#8208;insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion. At the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, hydrated Mg2+ has poor insertion kinetics and thus accumulates on the surface of VO2(B) to hydrolyze, triggering the formation of Mg&#8208;rich SEI and production of protons. In the tunnels, co&#8208;inserted/lattice H2O molecules block the Mg2+ diffusion while facilitate proton diffusion.







Abstract
Co&#8208;insertion of protons happens widely and enables divalent&#8208;ion aqueous batteries to achieve high performances. However, detailed investigations and comprehensive understandings of proton co&#8208;insertion are scarce. Herein, we demonstrate that proton co&#8208;insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion: at the interface, hdrated Mg2+ has poor insertion kinetics, and therefore accumulates and hydrolyzes to produce protons; in the tunnels, co&#8208;inserted/lattice H2O molecules block the Mg2+ diffusion while facilitate the proton diffusion. When monoclinic vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) anode is tested in Mg(CH3COO)2 aqueous solution, the formation of Mg&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase on the VO2(B) electrode and co&#8208;insertion of derived protons are probed; in the tunnels, the diffusion energy barrier of Mg2++H2O is 2.7&#8197;eV, while that of the protons is 0.37&#8197;eV. Thus, protons dominate the subsequent insertion and inner diffusion. As a consequence, the VO2(B) achieves a high capacity of 257.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high rate retention of 59.1&#8201;% from 1 to 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and stable cyclability of 3000 times with a capacity retention of 81.5&#8201;%. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the proton co&#8208;insertion and may promote the development of rechargeable aqueous batteries.

Herein, we demonstrate that proton co-insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion: at the interface, hdrated Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has poor insertion kinetics, and therefore accumulates and hydrolyzes to produce protons; in the tunnels, co-inserted/lattice H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules block the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion while facilitate the proton diffusion. When monoclinic vanadium dioxide (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B)) anode is tested in Mg(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aqueous solution, the formation of Mg-rich solid electrolyte interphase on the VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B) electrode and co-insertion of derived protons are probed; in the tunnels, the diffusion energy barrier of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;+H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is 2.7&#8197;eV, while that of the protons is 0.37&#8197;eV. Thus, protons dominate the subsequent insertion and inner diffusion. As a consequence, the VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B) achieves a high capacity of 257.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high rate retention of 59.1&#8201;% from 1 to 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and stable cyclability of 3000 times with a capacity retention of 81.5&#8201;%. This work provides an in-depth understanding of the proton co-insertion and may promote the development of rechargeable aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Defect&#8208;Induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Polyoxo&#8208;metalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination defect&#8208;induced strategy gives frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) sites in a polyoxometalate (POM) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), where the Lewis acid (LA) sites are linker&#8208;defective metal nodes and the Lewis base (LB) sites are derived from surface oxygen atoms of the POM. This FLP catalyst achieved heterolytic dissociation of H2 into highly active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting excellent activity in acetylene hydrogenation.







Abstract
Precise control of the structure and spatial distance of Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) sites in a porous system to construct efficient solid frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst is vital for industrial application but remains challenging. Herein, we constructed FLP sites in a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) by introducing coordination&#8208;defect metal nodes (LA) and surface&#8208;basic POM with abundant oxygen (LB). The well&#8208;defined and unique spatial conformation of the defective POM&#8208;based MOF ensure that the distance between LA and LB is at ~4.3&#8197;&#197;, a suitable distance to activate H2. This FLP catalyst can heterolytically dissociate H2 into active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting high activity in hydrogenation, which is 55 and 2.7&#8197;times as high as that of defect&#8208;free POM&#8208;based MOF and defective MOF without POM, respectively. This work provides a new avenue toward precise design multi&#8208;site catalyst to achieve specific activation of target substrate for synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Insights into the Correlation of Cross&#8208;linking Modes with Mechanical Properties for Dynamic Polymeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on comprehensive comparison on mechanical properties between dually cross&#8208;linked network and individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linked network, we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking mode can combine the advantages of covalent cross&#8208;links and supramolecular cross&#8208;links, exhibiting not only quick deformation recovery, outstanding breaking stress and puncture resistance, but also excellent toughness and energy dissipation ability.







Abstract
Simultaneously introducing covalent and supramolecular cross&#8208;links into one system to construct dually cross&#8208;linked networks, has been proved an effective approach to prepare high&#8208;performance materials. However, so far, features and advantages of dually cross&#8208;linked networks compared with those possessing individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linking points are rarely investigated. Herein, on the basis of comparison between supramolecular polymer network (SPN), covalent polymer network (CPN) and dually cross&#8208;linked polymer network (DPN), we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking strategy can endow the DPN with integrated advantages of CPN and SPN. Benefiting from the energy dissipative ability along with the dissociation of host&#8211;guest complexes, the DPN shows excellent toughness and ductility similar to the SPN. Meanwhile, the elasticity of covalent cross&#8208;links in the DPN could rise the structural stability to a level comparable to the CPN, exhibiting quick deformation recovery capacity. Moreover, the DPN has the strongest breaking stress and puncture resistance among the three, proving the unique property advantages of dual cross&#8208;linking method. These findings gained from our study further deepen the understanding of dynamic polymeric networks and facilitate the preparation of high&#8208;performance elastomeric materials.

         <title>Balancing the Crystallinity and Film Formation of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes through In Situ Modulation for Efficient Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The balance between crystallinity and film&#8208;formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is demonstrated for the first time using a facile in situ modulation strategy. Through competitive complexation with a ligand, acetic acid systematically reduces the crystallinity and optimizes the film formation of the MOF membrane, influencing its gas separation properties.







Abstract
Polycrystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layers hold great promise as molecular sieve membranes for efficient gas separation. Nevertheless, the high crystallinity tends to cause inter&#8208;crystalline defects/cracks in the nearby crystals, which makes crystalline porous materials face a great challenge in the fabrication of defect&#8208;free membranes. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the balance between crystallinity and film formation of MOF membrane through a facile in situ modulation strategy. Monocarboxylic acid was introduced as a modulator to regulate the crystallinity via competitive complexation and thus concomitantly control the film&#8208;forming state during membrane growth. Through adjusting the ratio of modulator acid/linker acid, an appropriate balance between this structural &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; was achieved. The resulting MOF membrane with moderate crystallinity and coherent morphology exhibits molecular sieving for H2/CO2 separation with selectivity up to 82.5.

         <title>Accelerated Surface Reconstruction through Regulating the Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface by Oxyanions in Perovskite Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To promote the spontaneous chemical reaction process of LaNiO3&#8722;&#948;, the oxyanions were added into electrolytes to regulate the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The oxyanions adsorb onto the solid&#8211;liquid interface, disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed OH&#8722; ions and the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction. It could be an effective way to accelerate surface reconstruction process.







Abstract
A comprehensive understanding of surface reconstruction was critical to developing high performance lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based perovskite electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the primary determining factor of the surface reconstruction process was believed to be the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Hence, most previous studies focused on optimizing composition to reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which in turn facilitated the surface reconstruction process. Here, for the first time, we found that adding oxyanions (SO42&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) into the electrolyte could effectively regulate the solid&#8211;liquid interface, significantly accelerating the surface reconstruction process and enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. Further studies indicated that the added oxyanions would adsorb onto the solid&#8211;liquid interface layer, disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed OH&#8722; ions and the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction process. As such, the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction process could be more readily released into the electrolyte, thereby leading to an acceleration of the surface reconstruction. Thus, it was expected that our finding would provide a new layer of understanding to the surface reconstruction process in LOM&#8208;based perovskite electrocatalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;divergent Bissilylation of Alkynoates: Scope, Mechanism, and Origin of Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed divergent bissilylation of alkynoates using disilane reagent TMDQ (see TOC graphic) is presented. Reversed regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity was obtained through addition of Lewis acids. MAD (methylaluminum bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxide) impacted electronically&#8208;favored migratory insertion through steric effect while the addition of BCF (tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane) allowed reductive elimination as the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed bissilylation reactions of alkynes with disilane reagents have become one of the most straightforward and efficient protocols to rapidly produce structurally diverse alkenyl silicon derivatives. In these reactions, the utilization of unsymmetrical disilane reagents provided the possibilities for reactivity enhancement as well as the synthetic merits in contrast to symmetrical disilane reagents. However, a major yet challenging objective is achieving precise control over the selectivity including the regioselectivity and the cis/trans&#8208;selectivity. Herein we realized the first divergent bissilylation of alkynoates with our developed air&#8208;stable disilane reagent 8&#8208;(2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetramethyldisilanyl)quinoline (TMDQ) by means of synergistic Pd/Lewis acid catalytic system. The catalytic system precisely dictates the selectivity, resulting in the divergent synthesis of 1,2&#8208;bissilyl alkenes. The power of these 1,2&#8208;bissilyl alkenes serving as the key synthetic intermediates has been clearly demonstrated by rapid construction of diverse motifs and densely functionalized biologically active compounds. In addition, the origins of the switchable selectivities were well elucidated by experimental and computational studies on the reaction mechanism and were mainly attributed to different ligand steric effects, the use of the specific disilane reagent TMDQ and the different coordination modes of different Lewis acid with alkynoates.

         <title>One/Two&#8208;Photon&#8208;Excited ESIPT&#8208;Attributed Coordination Polymers with Wide Temperature Range and Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One/two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited long persistent luminescence (LPL) was obtained in an ESIPT&#8208;attributed CdII coordination polymer (LIFM&#8208;106) with wide temperature range (100&#8211;380&#8197;K) and color tunability. Comparative study manifests the rational ligand modification and J&#8208;aggregation in LIFM&#8208;106 enhances the competitiveness of monomer LPL to counter&#8208;balance the excimer emission.







Abstract
The multiple metastable excited states provided by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules are beneficial to bring temperature&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL). Meanwhile, ESIPT molecules are intrinsically suitable to be modulated as D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure to obtain both one/two&#8208;photon excitation and LPL emission simultaneously. Herein, we report the rational design of a dynamic CdII coordination polymer (LIFM&#8208;106) from ESIPT ligand to achieve the above goals. By comparing LIFM&#8208;106 with the counterparts, we established a temperature&#8208;regulated competitive relationship between singlet excimer and triplet LPL emission. The optimization of ligand aggregation mode effectively boost the competitiveness of the latter. In result, LIFM&#8208;106 shows outstanding one/two&#8208;photon excited LPL performance with wide temperature range (100&#8211;380&#8197;K) and tunable color (green to red). The multichannel radiation process was further elucidated by transient absorption and theoretical calculations, benefiting for the application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Control over Reversible Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticle Folding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimanes allow the synthesis of water&#8208;soluble single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) and enable the effective unfolding with mild visible light from a compact structure into a linear chain. The unfolding of the fluorescent nanoparticles is reversible and occurs in aqueous systems, making it promising for controlling and tracing the SCNPs in biological environments.







Abstract
We introduce a class of single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) that respond to visible light (&#955;max=415&#8197;nm) with complete unfolding from their compact structure into linear chain analogues. The initial folding is achieved by a simple esterification reaction of the polymer backbone constituted of acrylic acid and polyethylene glycol carrying monomer units, introducing bimane moieties, which allow for the photochemical unfolding, reversing the ester&#8208;bond formation. The compaction and the light driven unfolding proceed cleanly and are readily followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), monitoring the change in the hydrodynamic radius (RH). Importantly, the folding reaction and the light&#8208;induced unfolding are reversible, supported by the high conversion of the photo cleavage. As the unfolding reaction occurs in aqueous systems, the system holds promise for controlling the unfolding of SCNPs in biological environments.

         <title>Xylene Synthesis Through Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation and Toluene Methylation Over a Composite ZnZrO Zeolite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective xylene synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation was achieved by regulating the interaction between two active components of a composite catalyst through a toluene&#8208;containing coupling reaction. The relationship between ZnZrO and the zeolite involved in the promotion effect was explored with detailed characterization.







Abstract
Selective synthesis of specific value&#8208;added aromatics from CO2 hydrogenation is of paramount interest for mitigating energy and climate problems caused by CO2 emission. Herein, we report a highly active composite catalyst of ZnZrO and HZSM&#8208;5 (ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG) for xylene synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation via a coupling reaction in the presence of toluene, achieving a xylene selectivity of 86.5&#8201;% with CO2 conversion of 10.5&#8201;%. A remarkably high space time yield of xylene could reach 215&#8197;mg&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, surpassing most reported catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The enhanced performance of ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG could be due to high dispersion and abundant oxygen vacancies of the ZZO component for CO2 adsorption, more feasible hydrogen activation and transfer due to the close interaction between the two components, and enhanced stability of the formate intermediate. The consumption of methoxy and methanol from the deep hydrogenation of formate by introduced toluene also propels an oriented conversion of CO2.

         <dc:description>
A novel bimetallic Ni&#8722;Cu electrode for the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with an industrial&#8208;scale current density of up to 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been successfully developed. Superior stability and activity of the prepared electrode enable the gram&#8208;scale production of FDCA with a very high overall yield, purity, and Faradaic efficiency.

Electricity&#8208;driven organo&#8208;oxidations have shown an increasing potential recently. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the primary competitive reaction, especially under high current densities, which leads to low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the product and catalyst detachment from the electrode. Here, we report a bimetallic Ni&#8722;Cu electrocatalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni&#8722;Cu/NF) to passivate the OER process while the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is significantly enhanced. A current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at 1.50&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, and both FE and yield keep close to 100&#8201;% over a wide range of potentials. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that Cu doping impedes the OH* deprotonation to O* and hereby OER process is greatly passivated. Those instructive results provide a new approach to realizing highly efficient biomass upgrading by regulating the OER activity.

         <title>A Nuclearity&#8208;Dependent Enantiodivergent Epoxide Opening via Enthalpy&#8208;Controlled Mononuclear and Entropy&#8208;Controlled Dinuclear (Salen)Titanium Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A nuclearity&#8208;dependent enantiodivergent epoxide opening reaction has been developed based on a mononuclear (salen)TiIII complex and its self&#8208;assembled oxygen&#8208;bridged dinuclear counterparts within the same stereogenic ligand scaffold. Mechanistic studies reveal that the nuclearity&#8208;distinct catalysts regulate the enthalpy and entropy controlling modes in the enantiodifferentiation process to achieve profound chirality inversion.







Abstract
A nuclearity&#8208;dependent enantiodivergent epoxide opening reaction has been developed, in which both antipodes of chiral alcohol products are selectively accessed by mononuclear (salen)TiIII complex and its self&#8208;assembled oxygen&#8208;bridged dinuclear counterparts within the same stereogenic ligand scaffold. Kinetic studies based on the Eyring equation revealed an enthalpy&#8208;controlled enantio&#8208;differentiation mode in mononuclear catalysis, whereas an entropy&#8208;controlled one in dinuclear catalysis. DFT calculations outline the origin of the enantiocontrol of the mononuclear catalysis and indicate the actual catalyst species in the dinuclear catalytic system. The mechanistic insights may shed a light on a strategy for stereoswichable asymmetric catalysis utilizing nuclearity&#8208;distinct transition&#8208;metal complexes.

         <title>Topological Design of Unprecedented Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Featuring Multiple Anion Functionalities and Hierarchical Porosity for Benchmark Acetylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented robust metal organic framework ZNU&#8208;9 with a new wly topology and featuring multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity was reported for simultaneous efficient C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separation with both high capacity and high selectivity.







Abstract
Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene (C2H4) is industrially important but still challenging so far. Herein, we developed two novel robust metal organic frameworks AlFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;8) with znv topology and SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;9) with wly topology for efficient capture of C2H2 from CO2 and C2H4. Both ZNU&#8208;8 and ZNU&#8208;9 feature multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity. Notably, ZNU&#8208;9 with more anionic binding sites and three distinct cages displays both an extremely large C2H2 capacity (7.94&#8197;mmol/g) and a high C2H2/CO2 (10.3) or C2H2/C2H4 (11.6) selectivity. The calculated capacity of C2H2 per anion (4.94&#8197;mol/mol at 1&#8197;bar) is the highest among all the anion pillared metal organic frameworks. Theoretical calculation indicated that the strong cooperative hydrogen bonds exist between acetylene and the pillared SiF62&#8722; anions in the confined cavity, which is further confirmed by in situ IR spectra. The practical separation performance was explicitly demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments with equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixtures and 1/99&#8197;C2H2/C2H4 mixtures under various conditions with excellent recyclability and benchmark productivity of pure C2H2 (5.13&#8197;mmol/g) or C2H4 (48.57&#8197;mmol/g).

         <title>Semi&#8208;Metallic Superionic Layers Suppressing Voltage Fading of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Towards Superior&#8208;Stable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;rich layer oxide (LRLO) cathodes with semi&#8208;metallic superionic layers are prepared via a simple one&#8208;step modification. The inner semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO), has spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons that can bond with oxygen, preventing oxygen release. The outer fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 (LNO) acts as a fast&#8208;ion conductor facilitating Li+ migration and alleviating metal dissolution.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LRLOs) with greater specific capacity density are constrained by voltage attenuation and inferior rate performance because of irreversible oxygen release, metal dissolving and poor lithium&#8208;ion transport capacity. Herein, a simple surface modification is designed to solve the performance degradation and structural collapse of LRLOs. Combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO) with spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, is introduced to the surface of the cathode restrains the activated surficial lattice oxygen ions by its stable oxygen vacancies. Additionally, Ni doping results in a fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 structure (LNO) with lowered lithium ions diffusion barrier, which is tightly conjugating to substrate and synergistically reinforces the Li diffusion path through the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Moreover, Mn dissolution is successfully relieved due to the decrease in Mn concentration in the coating layers. As a result, the modified material (LRLO@LMO@LNO) exhibits an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 120.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 10&#8197;C with a very small discharge voltage attenuation of 313&#8197;mV after 600&#8197;cycles (0.52&#8197;mV per cycle) at 1&#8197;C. Undoubtedly, this method discloses a simple and effective approach to promote the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density.

Recently, Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. reported a crystal structure of a ternary complex of the non&#8208;heme iron endoperoxidase FtmOx1 (PDB entry&#8197;7ETK) and concluded that it provides evidence supporting the FtmOx1 catalysis CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model. However, this work did not accurately describe key mechanistic features and differences of the Carc&#8208;like and COX&#8208;like models, and their data do not support their conclusions.







Abstract
In their recent Angewandte Chemie publication (doi: 10.1002/anie.202112063), Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. reported the crystal structure of a ternary complex of the non&#8208;heme iron endoperoxidase FtmOx1 (PDB entry&#8197;7ETK). The biochemical data assessed in this study were from a retracted study (doi: 10.1038/nature15519) by Zhang, Liu, Zhang et&#8197;al.; no additional biochemical data were included, yet there was no discussion on the source of the biochemical data in the report by Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. Based on this new crystal structure and subsequent QM/MM&#8208;MD calculations, Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. concluded that their work provided evidence supporting the CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model for FtmOx1 catalysis. However, the authors did not accurately describe either the CarC&#8208;like model or the COX&#8208;like model, and they did not address the differences between them. Further, and contrary to their interpretations in the manuscript, the authors&#8217; data are consistent with the COX&#8208;like model once the details of the CarC&#8208;like and COX&#8208;like models have been carefully analyzed.

The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme enzyme FtmOx1 can catalyze the endoperoxidation of fumitremorgin B, producing verruculogen. The side product of deisoprenylation becomes the major product when the analogue 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;fumitremorgin B is used as the substrate. Fumitremorgin B and 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;fumitremorgin B show similar substrate&#8208;binding patterns with FtmOx1 but different enzymatic conversions.







Abstract
The high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2OG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;fumitremorgin B and the catalytic mechanism were recently reported by us (DOI 10.1002/anie.202112063). In their Correspondence, Zhang, Costello, Liu et&#8197;al. criticize our work in several aspects. Herein, we address these questions one by one. These structural clarifications and new computational results further support the CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model.

         <title>Back Cover: Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 37/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for recording residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) by NMR spectroscopy is reported by Lo&#239;c Salmon, Christoph Giese and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202305120). The medium relies on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli, is compatible with harsh experimental conditions and allows RDC measurements for proteins, nucleic acids and small organic molecules.

A general tetrazole diversification platform of amino acids is presented by Ilan Marek, Fa&#8208;Guang Zhang, Jun&#8208;An Ma, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202304740). This method transformed proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives via silver&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition with aryldiazonium salts. The background of the cover image shows the key tetrazole structure surrounded by selected amino acid&#8208;derived tetrazoles and some starting amino acids.

Developing indolyldimethanols as four&#8208;carbon platform molecules for enantioselective cycloadditions is like climbing a higher peak of the mountain: full of challenges but exciting. In their Research Article (e202305450), Shao&#8208;Fei Ni, Wei Tan, Feng Shi et&#8197;al. describe catalytic asymmetric (4+n) cycloadditions of indolyldimethanols, leading to the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings.

Molecular doping is a key technique to modulate optical, electrical, and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. However, typical functional groups in organic p&#8208;dopants have insufficient electron&#8208;withdrawing strength, and inevitable dopant diffusion in host matrices degrades doping stabilities. In their Research Article (e202304245), Jaeyoung Jang and co&#8208;workers develop extremely electron&#8208;withdrawing Lewis&#8208;paired CN groups as a new class of building blocks for designing strong organic p&#8208;dopants with excellent doping stability.

         <title>About Perfluoropolyhedranes, Their Electron&#8208;Accepting Ability and Questionable Supramolecular Hosting Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry infers perfection and perennity, order, and harmony. Synthesizing perfluoropolyhedranes, a serious challenge, greatly enhances polyhedrane electron affinity, providing a unique opportunity for hosting an extra electron inside a molecular frame. The expectations for an easy entry to supramolecular chemistry hinted by such &#8220;cage&#8221; or &#8220;box&#8221; structures are, however, illusive.







Abstract
Polyhedral molecules are appealing for their eye&#8208;catching architecture and distinctive chemistry. Perfluorination of such, often greatly strained, compounds is a momentous challenge. It drastically changes the electron distribution, structure and properties. Notably, small high&#8208;symmetry perfluoropolyhedranes feature a centrally located, star&#8208;shaped low&#8208;energy unoccupied molecular orbital that can host an extra electron within the polyhedral frame, thus producing a radical anion, without loss of symmetry. This predicted electron&#8208;hosting capacity was definitively established for perfluorocubane, the first perfluorinated Platonic polyhedrane to be isolated pure. Hosting atoms, molecules, or ions in such &#8220;cage&#8221; structures is, however, all but forthright, if not illusionary, offering no easy access to supramolecular constructs. While adamantane and cubane have fostered numerous applications in materials science, medicine, and biology, specific uses for their perfluorinated counterparts remain to be established. Some aspects of highly fluorinated carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes and graphite, are briefly mentioned for context.

         <title>Orderly Self&#8208;Assembly of Organic Fluorophores for Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In past decades, the orderly self&#8208;assembly of functionalized fluorophores has gained much attention. Such fluorophores can form nanoaggregates by self&#8208;assembly, which prolong their residence time in vivo, achieving high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios and accurate bioimaging. In this review, we summarize progress and challenges of self&#8208;assembled fluorophores, focusing on their development history, self&#8208;assembly mechanism and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging utilizing traditional organic fluorophores is extensively applied in both cellular and in vivo studies. However, it faces significant obstacles, such as low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) and spurious positive/negative signals, primarily due to the facile diffusion of these fluorophores. To cope with this challenge, orderly self&#8208;assembled functionalized organic fluorophores have gained significant attention in the past decades. These fluorophores can create nanoaggregates via a well&#8208;ordered self&#8208;assembly process, thus prolonging their residency time within cells and in vivo settings. The development of self&#8208;assembled&#8208;based fluorophores is an emerging field, and as such, in this review, we present a summary of the progress and challenges of self&#8208;assembly fluorophores, focusing on their development history, self&#8208;assembly mechanisms, and biomedical applications. We hope that the insights provided herein will assist scientists in further developing functionalized organic fluorophores for in situ imaging, sensing, and therapy.

         <title>Beyond Solvothermal: Alternative Synthetic Methods for Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a comprehensive overview of the recent synthetic advancements of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with emphasis on the energy input required. These emerging strategies encompass microwave&#8208;assisted, sonochemical, mechanochemical, photochemical, plasma&#8208;promoted, electric field&#8208;induced, and electron beam&#8208;mediated synthesis. We also delve into the merits and limitations of these methods in comparison to the solvothermal approach.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous organic materials that hold a wealth of potential applications across various fields. The development of COFs, however, is significantly impeded by the dearth of efficient synthetic methods. The traditional solvothermal approach, while prevalent, is fraught with challenges such as complicated processes, excessive energy consumption, long reaction times, and limited scalability, rendering it unsuitable for practical applications. The quest for simpler, quicker, more energy&#8208;efficient, and environmentally benign synthetic strategies is thus paramount for bridging the gap between academic COF chemistry and industrial application. This Review provides an overview of the recent advances in alternative COF synthetic methods, with a particular emphasis on energy input. We discuss representative examples of COF synthesis facilitated by microwave, ultrasound, mechanic force, light, plasma, electric field, and electron beam. Perspectives on the advantages and limitations of these methods against the traditional solvothermal approach are highlighted.

         <title>40 Years of Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 40&#8197;years development of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes for rechargeable batteries has been reviewed. Critical insights are given from both underlying mechanistic and practical engineering aspects while we traverse the history on the rational design of low&#8208;temperature electrolyte systems.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium batteries are one of the most appropriate energy storage systems in our electrified society, as virtually all portable electronic devices and electric vehicles today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. However, sub&#8208;zero Celsius operation, especially below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, remains a huge challenge for lithium batteries and greatly limits their application in extreme environments. Slow Li+ diffusion and charge transfer kinetics have been identified as two main origins of the poor performance of RLBs under low&#8208;temperature conditions, both strongly associated with the liquid electrolyte that governs bulk and interfacial ion transport. In this review, we first analyze the low&#8208;temperature kinetic behavior and failure mechanism of lithium batteries from an electrolyte standpoint. We next trace the history of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes in the past 40&#8197;years (1983&#8211;2022), followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress as well as introducing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization and computational methods for revealing their underlying mechanisms. Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes with particular emphasis on mechanism analysis and practical application.

         <title>Regioselective Formal &#946;&#8208;Allylation of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formal Tsuji&#8211;Trost &#946;&#8208;allylation of various carbonyl compounds with different allylic electrophiles is reported. Reactions proceed through initial silyl enol ether formation and subsequent cooperative photoredox/nickel catalysis.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction between carbonyl compounds and allylic precursors has been widely used in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. As the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond is far more acidic than the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, carbonyl compounds undergo highly regioselective allylation at the &#945;&#8208;position and their &#946;&#8208;allylation is therefore highly challenging. This innate &#945;&#8208;reactivity conversely hampers diversity, especially if the corresponding &#946;&#8208;allylation product is targeted. Herein, we present a formal intermolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;C bond formation reaction of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with different allyl electrophiles through cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis. &#946;&#8208;Selectivity is achieved via initial transformation of the aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding silyl enol ethers. The overall transformation features mild conditions, excellent regioselectivity, wide functional group tolerance and high reaction efficiency. The introduced facile and regioselective &#946;&#8208;allylation of carbonyl compounds proceeding through cooperative catalysis allows the preparation of valuable building blocks that are difficult to access from aldehydes and ketones using existing methodology.

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistor Based on Hydrophobic Polymer Tuned by Ionic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic gel interfacial layer is applied to improve the ionic transport of the hydrophobic conjugated polymers in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). With this approach, hydrophobic conjugated polymers could be used directly, while the types and ratios of gel matrix and ionic liquids in the ionic gels could be tuned to achieve optimal OECT properties for improved performance.







Abstract
Hydrophobic conjugated polymers have poor ionic transport property, so hydrophilic side chains are often grafted for their application as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, this modification lowers their charge transport ability. Here, an ionic gel interfacial layer is applied to improve the ionic transport while retaining the charge transport ability of the polymers. By using the ionic gels comprising gel matrix and ionic liquids as the interfacial layers, the hydrophobic polymer achieves the OECT feature with high transconductance, low threshold voltage, high current on/off ratio, short switching time, and high operational stability. The working mechanism is also revealed. Moreover, the OECT performance can be tuned by varying the types and ratios of ionic gels. With the proposed ionic gel strategy, OECTs can be effectively realized with hydrophobic conjugated polymers.

         <title>Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx Cocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting by Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly (triazine imide) modified with Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx as H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, respectively, largely improves the charge separation efficiency and restrains the undesired backward reaction, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency of 20.2&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
In situ photo&#8208;deposition of both Pt and CoOx cocatalysts on the facets of poly (triazine imide) (PTI) crystals has been developed for photocatalytic overall water splitting. However, the undesired backward reaction (i.e., water formation) on the noble Pt surface is a spontaneously down&#8208;hill process, which restricts their efficiency to run the overall water splitting reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that the efficiency for photocatalytic overall water splitting could be largely promoted by the decoration of Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx as H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, respectively. Results reveal that the dual cocatalysts greatly extract charges from bulk to surface, while the Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst dramatically restrains the backward reaction, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 20.2&#8201;% for the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8722;N Biaryl Atropisomers through Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation with Acrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H alkylation reaction is described. A series of structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole and pyrrole&#8208;pyrrole N&#8722;N atropisomers were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). This reaction features perfect atom economy, wide substrate scope, and multifunctionalized products allowing diverse transformations.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers is an emerging area but remains underexplored. The development of efficient synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers is in great demand. Herein, the construction of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers through iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H alkylation is reported for the first time. In the presence of readily available Ir precursor and Xyl&#8208;BINAP, a variety of axially chiral molecules based on indole&#8208;pyrrole skeleton were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, N&#8722;N bispyrrole atropisomers could also be synthesized in excellent yields and enantioselectivity. This method features perfect atom economy, wide substrate scope, and multifunctionalized products allowing diverse transformations.

In the presence of readily available Ir precursor and Xyl-BINAP, a variety of axially chiral molecules based on indole-pyrrole skeleton were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, N&#8722;N bispyrrole atropisomers could also be synthesized in excellent yields and enantioselectivity. This method features perfect atom economy, wide substrate scope, and multifunctionalized products allowing diverse transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topochemical Syntheses of Polyarylopeptides Involving Large Molecular Motions: Frustrated Monomer Packing Leads to the Formation of Polymer Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of aryl rings in the backbone of polymer chains is one of the key strategies to improve the chain rigidity and hence the properties. In peptide chemistry the technique gave birth to a new class of molecular systems called arylopeptides. Here we discuss the synthesis of polyarylopeptides, peptide polymers with periodic aryl units, from amino acid&#8208;based monomers via topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization.







Abstract
We report the topochemical syntheses of three polyarylopeptides, wherein triazolylphenyl group is integrated into the backbone of peptide chains. We synthesized three different monomers having azide and arylacetylene as end&#8208;groups from glycine, L&#8208;alanine and L&#8208;valine. We crystallized these monomers and the crystal structures of two of them were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Due to the steric constraints, both of these monomers crystallized with two molecules, viz. conformers A and B, in the asymmetric unit. Consistently, in both cases, the A&#8208;conformers are antiparallelly &#960;&#8208;stacked and B&#8208;conformers are parallelly slip&#8208;stacked, exploiting weak interactions. Though the arrangements of molecules in the pristine crystals were unsuitable for topochemical reaction, upon heating, they undergo large motion inside the crystal lattice to reach a transient reactive orientation and thereby the self&#8208;sorted conformer stacks react to give a blend of triazole&#8208;linked polyarylopeptides having two different linkages. Due to the large molecular motion inside crystals, the product phase loses its crystallinity.

         <title>Stereoselective Plasmonic Interaction in Peptide&#8208;tethered Photopolymerizable Diacetylenes Doped with Chiral Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;tethered diacetylene monomers exhibit efficient topochemical photopolymerization and allow control over the chiroptical properties of the resulting chiral polydiacetylenes. Achiral and chiral gold nanoparticles were incorporated in the chiral polymers and the stereoselective plasmonic interactions investigated, with the ultimate goal of designing next&#8208;generation organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials with large chiroptic effects.







Abstract
Designing polymeric systems with ultra&#8208;high optical activity is instrumental in the pursuit of smart artificial chiroptical materials, including the fundamental understanding of structure/property relations. Herein, we report a diacetylene (DA) moiety flanked by chiral D&#8208; and L&#8208;FF dipeptide methyl esters that exhibits efficient topochemical photopolymerization in the solid phase to furnish polydiacetylene (PDA) with desired control over the chiroptical properties. The doping of the achiral gold nanoparticles provides plasmonic interaction with the PDAs to render asymmetric shape to the circular dichroism bands. With the judicious design of the chiral amino acid ligand appended to the AuNPs, we demonstrate the first example of selective chiral amplification mediated by stereo&#8208;structural matching of the polymer&#8208;plasmonic AuNP hybrid pairs. Such ordered self&#8208;assembly aided by topochemical polymerization in peptide&#8208;tethered PDA provides a smart strategy to produce soft responsive materials for applications in chiral photonics.

         <title>Insights into the Diffusion Behaviors of Water over Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Catalysts During the Conversion of Syngas to High&#8208;Quality Gasoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst composed of hydrophobic FeNa@Si&#8208;c and HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite converts syngas to gasoline with high selectivity. The diffusion of water molecules through a hydrophilic catalyst is bidirectional, while the diffusion through a hydrophobic catalyst is unidirectional, thereby allowing control of syngas&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline side reactions related to water.







Abstract
Although considerable efforts towards directly converting syngas to liquid fuels through Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis have been made, developing catalysts with low CO2 selectivity for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality gasoline remains a big challenge. Herein, we designed a bifunctional catalyst composed of hydrophobic FeNa@Si&#8208;c and HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite, which exhibited a low CO2 selectivity of 14.3&#8201;% at 49.8&#8201;% CO conversion, with a high selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% for gasoline in total products. Molecular dynamic simulations and model experiments revealed that the diffusion of water molecules through hydrophilic catalyst was bidirectional, while the diffusion through hydrophobic catalyst was unidirectional, which were crucial to tune the water&#8208;gas shift reaction and control CO2 formation. This work provides a new fundamental understanding about the function of hydrophobic modification of catalysts in syngas conversion.

         <title>A Broad Light&#8208;Harvesting Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Enables Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation in a Bacterial Biohybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new strategy to enable light&#8208;driven nitrogen fixation in non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria by integrating the novel conjugated oligoelectrolyte COE&#8208;IC into A. vinelandii. Upon excitation of light, COE&#8208;IC generates electron equivalents at the abiotic&#8208;biotic interface. These photoelectrons are then transferred to nitrogenase, which drives the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia.







Abstract
We report a rationally designed membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), namely COE&#8208;IC, which endows aerobic N2&#8208;fixing bacteria Azotobacter vinelandii with a light&#8208;harvesting ability that enables photosynthetic ammonia production. COE&#8208;IC possesses an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) type conjugated core, which promotes visible light absorption with a high molar extinction coefficient. Furthermore, COE&#8208;IC spontaneously associates with A. vinelandii to form a biohybrid in which the COE is intercalated within the lipid bilayer membrane. In the presence of L&#8208;ascorbate as a sacrificial electron donor, the resulting COE&#8208;IC/A. vinelandii biohybrid showed a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in light&#8208;driven ammonia production, as compared to the control. Photoinduced enhancement of bacterial biomass and production of L&#8208;amino acids is also observed. Introduction of isotopically enriched 15N2 atmosphere led to the enrichment of 15N&#8208;containing intracellular metabolites, consistent with the products being generated from atmospheric N2.

Single&#8208;atom modifications are typically accompanied by appreciable changes to the overall particle's structure. Herein, we demonstrate surface single&#8208;atom manipulation based on [Cu58H20PET36(PPh3)4]2+ (Cu58; PET: phenylethanethiolate; PPh3: triphenylphosphine), leading to the isostructural analogue [Cu57H20PET36(PPh3)4]+ (Cu57). Remarkably, this single surface atom drastically alters the catalytic reactivity of the nanoclusters.







Abstract
Elucidating single&#8208;atom effects on the fundamental properties of nanoparticles is challenging because single&#8208;atom modifications are typically accompanied by appreciable changes to the overall particle's structure. Herein, we report the synthesis of a [Cu58H20PET36(PPh3)4]2+ (Cu58; PET: phenylethanethiolate; PPh3: triphenylphosphine) nanocluster&#8212;an atomically precise nanoparticle&#8212;that can be transformed into the surface&#8208;defective analog [Cu57H20PET36(PPh3)4]+ (Cu57). Both nanoclusters are virtually identical, with five concentric metal shells, save for one missing surface copper atom in Cu57. Remarkably, the loss of this single surface atom drastically alters the reactivity of the nanocluster. In contrast to Cu58, Cu57 shows promising activity for click chemistry, particularly photoinduced [3+2] azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AAC), which is attributed to the active catalytic site in Cu57 after the removal of one surface copper atom. Our study not only presents a unique system for uncovering the effect of a single&#8208;surface atom modification on nanoparticle properties but also showcases single&#8208;atom surface modification as a powerful means for designing nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>A Homo&#8208;Mannich Reaction Strategy Enables Collective Access to Ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homo&#8208;Mannich reaction of cyclopropanol with an iminium ion, generated by an asymmetric allylic dearomatization of indole, has been developed to construct a tricyclic hydrocarbazole core. This approach enables a collective asymmetric synthesis of ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus alkaloids having either a five&#8208;, six&#8208;, or seven&#8208;membered E ring.







Abstract
We report here a homo&#8208;Mannich reaction of cyclopropanol with an iminium ion, generated by an asymmetric allylic dearomatization of indole, to construct a tricyclic hydrocarbazole core, which is shared by a variety of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids across families. Through this approach, an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center as well as an allyl and a ketone group were installed. Using this functionalized hydrocarbazole as the structural platform, D ring and E rings of different sizes (i.e., five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered) were successively or simultaneously assembled, leading to a collective asymmetric synthesis of seven alkaloids belonging to the ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus alkaloid families.

         <title>Chiral Adaptive Induction of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework by Dipeptides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected chiral adaptive induction of an achiral CB[8]&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (SOF) was explored, exhibiting the opposite CD and CPL spectra in the presence of L&#8208;TrpTrp and L&#8208;PhePhe, respectively. Furthermore, this SOF demonstrates the sequence&#8208;selective chiral induction for sequences&#8208;opposite Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptides, allowing for the discrimination and differentiation of these dipeptide sequences.







Abstract
Chiral induction by natural biomolecules can reveal the indispensable role of chiral structures in life and can be used to develop the chirality&#8208;sensing biomolecular recognition. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of an achiral supramolecular organic framework (SOF&#8208;1) constructed from cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) derivative (1) in water. Due to the propeller&#8208;like rotational chiral conformation of HPB units and the specific recognition properties of CB[8], SOF&#8208;1 demonstrates chiral adaptive induction in water when interacting with the N&#8208;terminal Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptides including L&#8208;TrpX and L&#8208;PheX (X is an amino acid residue), respectively, exhibiting contrasting circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra. Consequently, SOF&#8208;1 has been developed as a supramolecular host and chiroptical sensor capable of recognizing and distinguishing the sequence&#8208;opposite Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptide pairs including L&#8208;TrpX/L&#8208;XTrp and L&#8208;PheX/L&#8208;XPhe based on the sequence&#8208;selective CD responses.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Atom Tunneling in a Homochiral Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How would a chiral environment impact the dynamics of hydrogen atoms? Using rotational spectroscopy in combination with the solutions of a simple one&#8208;dimensional Schr&#246;dinger equation approach, we revealed the intriguing distinctions of hydrogen atom dynamics between homochiral and heterochiral dimers of trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediol.







Abstract
The role&#8208;exchanging concerted torsional motion of two hydrogen atoms in the homochiral dimer of trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediol was characterized through a combination of broadband rotational spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. The results reveal that the concerted tunneling motion of the hydrogen atoms leads to the inversion of the sign of the dipole moment components along the a and b principal axes, due to the interchange motion that cooperatively breaks and reforms one intermolecular hydrogen bond. This motion is also coupled with two acceptor switching motions. The energy difference between the two ground vibrational states arising from this tunneling motion was determined to be 29.003(2) MHz. The corresponding wavefunctions suggest that the two hydrogen atoms are evenly delocalized on two equivalent potential wells, which differs from the heterochiral case where the hydrogen atoms are confined in separate wells, as the permutation&#8208;inversion symmetry breaks down. This intriguing contrast in hydrogen&#8208;atom behavior between homochiral and heterochiral environments could further illuminate our understanding of the role of chirality in intermolecular interactions and dynamics.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Responsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Capsule Displaying Unusual Encapsulation&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative assembly of bent amphiphiles with two ferrocene units leads to a ferrocene&#8208;based capsule in water. Besides redox&#8208;responsive disassembly/assembly properties, the new capsule displays unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions upon encapsulation of electron&#8208;accepting molecules in the multi&#8208;ferrocene cavity. The CT interactions are facilely dissociated by a redox&#8208;triggered stimulus.







Abstract
A ferrocene&#8208;based capsule is spontaneously and quantitatively formed in water by the assembly of bent amphiphiles carrying two ferrocene units. The disassembly and assembly of the new organometallic capsule, with a well&#8208;defined and highly condensed ferrocene core, are demonstrated by chemical redox stimuli in a fully reversible fashion under ambient conditions. In contrast to previously reported multiferrocene assemblies, only the present capsule efficiently encapsulates typical organic/inorganic dyes as well as electron&#8208;accepting molecules in water. As a result, unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, displaying relatively wide absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;=650&#8211;1350&#8197;nm), are observed upon the encapsulation of acceptors (i.e., chloranil and TCNQ). The resultant encapsulation&#8208;induced CT interactions can be released by a redox stimulus through the disassembly of the capsule.

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative assembly of bent amphiphiles with two ferrocene units leads to a ferrocene-based capsule in water. Besides redox-responsive disassembly/assembly properties, the new capsule displays unusual host-guest charge-transfer (CT) interactions upon encapsulation of electron-accepting molecules in the multi-ferrocene cavity. The CT interactions are facilely dissociated by a redox-triggered stimulus.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ferrocene-based capsule is spontaneously and quantitatively formed in water by the assembly of bent amphiphiles carrying two ferrocene units. The disassembly and assembly of the new organometallic capsule, with a well-defined and highly condensed ferrocene core, are demonstrated by chemical redox stimuli in a fully reversible fashion under ambient conditions. In contrast to previously reported multiferrocene assemblies, only the present capsule efficiently encapsulates typical organic/inorganic dyes as well as electron-accepting molecules in water.

         <title>Achieving Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence in Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long persistent luminescence (LPL) of 2D Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase perovskites based on the self&#8208;assembled 2D interlayer galleries structure is investigated. Through doping engineering, the LPL decay time is increased, the emission color is adjustable, and the thermal stability of PL is enhanced dramatically. Furthermore, we highlight the promising applications of Cs2CdCl4 perovskite systems in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;halide perovskites have been enriched over recent years to offer remarkable features from diverse chemical structures and environmental stability endowed with exciting functionalities in photoelectric detectors and phosphorescence systems. However, the low conversion efficiency of singlet to triplet in 2D hybrid halide perovskites reduces phosphorescence lifetimes. In this study, the long persistent luminescence of 2D all&#8208;inorganic perovskites with a self&#8208;assembled 2D interlayer galleries structure is investigated. The results show that the decay time of the long persistent luminescence increases from 450&#8197;s to 600&#8197;s, and the luminescence color changes from cyan to orange, and the thermal stability of photoluminescence enhances dramatically after replacing Cd2+ by appropriate Mn2+ ions in 2D Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase perovskites. Furthermore, diversified anti&#8208;counterfeiting modes are fabricated to highlight the promising applications of Cs2CdCl4 perovskite systems with tunable persistent luminescence in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Therefore, our studies provide a novel model for realizing tunable long persistent luminescence of perovskite with 2D self&#8208;assembled layered structure for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life, High&#8208;Rate Rechargeable Lithium Batteries Based on Soluble Bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) Disulfide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) disulfide (Pym2S2) has proven to be a high rate cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. The superdelocalization of pyrimidyl groups is reducing the S&#8722;S bond dissociation energy, which depletes the intrinsic energy barrier of dissociated electron transfer. The lithium half cell achieves 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. In addition, the cell shows a capacity retention of 78.0&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 30&#8197;C.







Abstract
Organosulfides are promising candidates as cathode materials for the development of electric vehicles and energy storage systems due to their low&#8208;cost and high capacity properties. However, they generally suffer from slow kinetics because of the large rearrangement of S&#8722;S bonds and structural degradation upon cycling in batteries. In this paper, we reveal that soluble bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) disulfide (Pym2S2) can be a high&#8208;rate cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. Benefiting from the superdelocalization of pyrimidyl group, the extra electrons prefer to be localized on the &#960;* (pyrimidyl group) than &#963;* (S&#8722;S bond) molecular orbitals initially, generating the anion&#8208;like intermedia of [Pym2S2]2&#8722; and thus decreasing the dissociation energy of the S&#8722;S bond. It makes the intrinsic energy barrier of dissociative electron transfer depleted, therefore the lithium half cell exhibits 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. This study provides a distinct pathway for the design of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life organic cathode materials.

The first report on electrochemical AuI/AuIII catalysis for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of C&#8722;C multiple bonds has been presented. This external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free approach utilizes the anodic oxidation of vinyl&#8208;AuI to vinyl&#8208;AuIII complexes to achieve oxy&#8208;alkynylation of allenoates to access alkyne&#8208;substituted butenolides in an undivided cell.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first report of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of C&#8722;C multiple bonds using electrochemical gold redox catalysis. By adopting the electrochemical strategy, the inherent &#960;&#8208;activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactivity of gold catalysis are harnessed to develop the oxy&#8208;alkynylation of allenoates under external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigations such as 31P NMR, control experiments, mass studies, and cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis have been performed to support the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Difluoromethylation&#8208;Alkynylation of Olefins by Solving the Dilemma between Acidities and Reduction Potentials of Difluoromethylating Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear relationship between reduction potential differences (&#916;E) and substituent constants (&#963;) of aryl difluoromethyl sulfones provides a powerful strategy to solve the dilemma of acidities and reduction potentials of difluoromethylating agents. The strategy enabled achieving enantioselective difluoromethylation&#8208;alkynylation reactions of olefins with difluoromethyl 4&#8208;chlorophenyl sulfone.







Abstract
Molecules containing a difluoromethyl group or a propargylic stereocenter are widely used in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and 1,2&#8208;functionalization of olefins is an important method for introducing the two groups into molecules simultaneously. The construction of the propargylic stereocenter with terminal alkynes usually requires bases. However, difluoromethylating agents with high reduction potentials often decompose in the presence of bases because of their acidities, and those with low reduction potentials are stable but difficult to undergo the desired single electron transfer (SET) reduction. Using the linear relationship between reduction potential differences (&#916;E) and Hammett substituent constants (&#963;) of difluoromethyl aryl sulfones, we solved the dilemma between acidities and reduction potentials of difluoromethylating agents. Herein, we report the first enantioselective difluoromethylation&#8208;alkynylation of olefins with difluoromethyl 4&#8208;chlorophenyl sulfone with high enantioselectivity (&gt;90&#8201;% ee). We also extended this asymmetric fluoroalkylation&#8208;alkynylation reaction with other fluoroalkyl sulfones, which enabled efficient installation of trifluoromethyl, difluoroalkyl, difluorobenzyl, (benzenesulfonyl)&#8208;difluoromethyl and monofluoromethyl groups into products.

         <title>Dual&#8208;emissive Iridium(III) Complexes as Phosphorescent Probes with Orthogonal Responses to Analyte Binding and Oxygen Quenching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes bearing a di(2&#8208;picolyl)&#8208;amine (DPA) unit, which exhibited green and red dual phosphorescence in aqueous solutions. The complexes exhibited static and dynamic phosphorescence quenching in response to copper(II) ions and oxygen, respectively, at different wavelengths, achieving colorimetric emission response in solutions and multichannel response in live cell imaging.







Abstract
Phosphorescent probes often show sensitive response toward analytes at a specific wavelength. However, oxygen quenching usually occurs at the same wavelength and thus hinders the accurate detection of analytes. In this study, we have developed dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes that exhibit phosphorescence responses to copper(II) ions at a wavelength distinct from that where oxygen quenching occurs. The complexes displayed colorimetric phosphorescence response in aqueous solutions under different copper(II) and oxygen conditions. In cellular imaging, variation in oxygen concentration over a large range from 5&#8201;% to 80&#8201;% can modulate the intensity and lifetime of green phosphorescence without affecting the response of red phosphorescence toward intracellular copper(II) ions.

         <title>Tribochemically Controlled Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Enabled by Contact Electrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound or ball milling of piezoelectric particles to control atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) requires high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;frequency mechanical stimuli. Tribochemically controlled ATRP (tribo&#8208;ATRP) using titanium oxide particles and CuBr2/tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine enables a contact&#8208;electrification catalysis (ca. 10&#8197;Hz) and gives access to a variety of polymers with predetermined molecular weights, low dispersity, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.







Abstract
Traditional mechanochemically controlled reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) utilizes ultrasound or ball milling to regenerate activators, which induce side reactions because of the high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;frequency stimuli. Here, we propose a facile approach for tribochemically controlled atom transfer radical polymerization (tribo&#8208;ATRP) that relies on contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) between titanium oxide (TiO2) particles and CuBr2/tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethylamine (TPMA), without any high&#8208;energy input. Under the friction induced by stirring, the TiO2 particles are electrified, continuously reducing CuBr2/TPMA into CuBr/TPMA, thereby conversing alkyl halides into active radicals to start ATRP. In addition, the effect of friction on the reaction was elucidated by theoretical simulation. The results indicated that increasing the frequency could reduce the energy barrier for the electron transfer from TiO2 particles to CuBr2/TPMA. In this study, the design of tribo&#8208;ATRP was successfully achieved, enabling CEC (ca. 10&#8197;Hz) access to a variety of polymers with predetermined molecular weights, low dispersity, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.

         <title>Reactivity Umpolung of Tertiary Amide Enabled by Catalytic Reductive Stannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide carbonyl group usually serves as the electrophile, which can react with various nucleophiles. The current work shows a process to achieve the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide carbonyl group. By leveraging this strategy, tertiary amide can react with a wide range of electrophiles to produce complex amines.







Abstract
Reactivity umpolung is an important concept in organic chemistry. Established reactivity umpolung mainly focuses on the aldehyde and umpolung of amide carbonyl group is not known. In this report, we describe a process to obtain the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide. This process hinges on the efficient reductive stannylation catalyzed by Ir/silane and facile Sn&#8722;Li exchange. By leveraging this umpolung reactivity, drug Fluoxetine was derivatized to 12 different analogues via reacting with various electrophiles and four biologically active molecules were prepared concisely. This unlocked umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide is expected to find applications to synthesize complex amines from amides.

         <title>Precision Graphene Nanoribbon Heterojunctions by Chain&#8208;Growth Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated the controlled synthesis of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions for the first time from block polyphenylene precursor that was achieved by chain&#8208;growth polymerization. This synthetic strategy opens a door for the rational synthesis of unexplored GNR heterojunctions with diverse topologies and emerging physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. In particular, GNR heterojunctions have received considerable attention due to their exotic topological electronic phases at the heterointerface. However, strategies for their precision synthesis remain at a nascent stage. Here, we report a novel chain&#8208;growth polymerization strategy that allows for constructing GNR heterojunction with N=9 armchair and chevron GNRs segments (9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR). The synthesis involves a controlled Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) between 2&#8208;(6&#8242;&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;ditetradecyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:2&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;yl) boronic ester (M1) and 2&#8208;(7&#8208;bromo&#8208;9,12&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;tetradecylphenyl)&#8208;triphenylene&#8208;2&#8208;yl) boronic ester (M2), followed by the Scholl reaction of the obtained block copolymer (poly&#8208;M1/M2) with controlled Mn (18&#8197;kDa) and narrow &#272; (1.45). NMR and SEC analysis of poly&#8208;M1/M2 confirm the successful block copolymerization. The solution&#8208;mediated cyclodehydrogenation of poly&#8208;M1/M2 toward 9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR is unambiguously validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis spectroscopies. Moreover, we also demonstrate the on&#8208;surface formation of pristine 9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR from the unsubstituted copolymer precursor, which is unambiguously characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>An Asymmetric Hydrogenation/N&#8208;Alkylation Sequence for a Step&#8208;Economical Route to Indolizidines and Quinolizidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines and subsequent N&#8208;alkylation lead to indolizidines and quinolizidines. The presence of Cl&#8722; results in retention of the absolute configuration of the initially formed alcohol. Noncovalent interactions, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions also play important roles in regulating the stereoselectivity of the reaction process.







Abstract
The direct catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines for the synthesis of piperidines remains a challenge. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines with subsequent N&#8208;alkylation using a traceless Br&#248;nsted acid activation strategy. Catalyzed by an iridium&#8208;BINAP complex, the substrates undergo ketone reduction, cyclization and pyridine hydrogenation in sequence to form indolizidines and quinolizidines. The absolute configuration of the stereocenter of the alcohol is retained and influences the formation of the second stereocenter. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies reveal that the chloride anion and certain noncovalent interactions govern the stereoselectivity of the cascade reaction throughout the catalytic process.
