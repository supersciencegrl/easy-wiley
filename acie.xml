         <title>Paired Oxidative and Reductive Catalysis: Breaking the Potential Barrier of Electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the intrinsic inertness of alkanes, strong oxidative conditions are typically required to enable their C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. Herein, a paired electrocatalysis strategy was developed by integrating oxidative catalysis with reductive catalysis in one cell without interference, in which earth&#8208;abundant iron and nickel are employed as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. This approach lowers the previously high oxidation potential required for alkane activation, enabling electrochemical alkane functionalization at the ultra&#8208;low oxidation potential of ~0.25 V&#160;vs. Ag/AgCl under mild conditions. Structurally diverse alkenes, including challenging all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted olefins, can be accessed using readily available alkenyl electrophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation and Recycling of Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accumulation of plastic waste, due to lack of recycling, has led to serious environmental pollution. Although mechanical recycling can alleviate this issue, it inevitably reduces the molecular weight and weakens the mechanical properties of materials and is not suitable for mixed materials. Chemical recycling, on the other hand, breaks the polymer into monomers or small&#8208;molecule constituents, allowing for the preparation of materials of quality comparable to that of the virgin polymers and can be applied to mixed materials. Mechanochemical degradation and recycling leverages the advantages of mechanical techniques, such as scalability and efficient energy use, to achieve chemical recycling. We summarize recent progress in mechanochemical degradation and recycling of synthetic polymers, including both commercial polymers and those designed for more efficient mechanochemical degradation. We also point out the limitations of mechanochemical degradation and present our perspectives on how the challenges can be mitigated for a circular polymer economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ene Reductase Enabled Intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Substituted Cyclohexanones for Efficient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds containing 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold have many applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. However, their synthesis is challenging and mainly limited to chemical synthesis. Herein we report that ene reductases (EREDs) can facilitate an unprecedented intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles containing the 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. To streamline the synthesis of these privileged motifs, we developed a gram scale one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic cascade by combining iridium photocatalysis with EREDs using readily available N&#8208;phenylglycines and cyclohexenones that can be obtained from biomass. Further derivatization using enzymatic or chemical methods can convert 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;one to 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;ols, which can be potentially utilized for the synthesis of azaprophen and its analogues for drug discovery. Mechanistic studies revealed the reaction requires oxygen presumably to produce oxidized flavin which can selectively dehydrogenate the 3&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone derivatives to form the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Robustness of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enabled by Surface Atomic Arrangement Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered transition metal oxide cathodes have been one of the dominant cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with efficient Li+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by the weak layered interaction and unstable surface, mechanical and chemical failure plagues their electrochemical performance, especially for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Here, adopting a simultaneous elemental&#8208;structural atomic arrangement control based on the intrinsic Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn system, the surface role is intensively investigated. Within the invariant oxygen sublattice of the crystal, a robust surface with the synergistic concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure is constructed on the model single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode. With mechanical strain dissipation and chemical erosion suppression, the cathode exhibits an impressive capacity retention of 82% even at the harsh 60 oC after 150 cycles at 1C. This work highlights the coupling effect of structure and composition on the chemical&#8208;mechanical properties, and the concept will spur more researches on the cathodes that share the same sublattice.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Antioxidase&#8208;Inspired Biocatalysts with Axial Mn&#8208;N5 Sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Networks for Rescuing Stem Cell Fate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing highly effective biocatalysts with controllable coordination geometry for eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) is extremely desirable but remains challenging for addressing the current bottlenecks in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics. Here, inspired by the coordination structure of manganese&#8208;based antioxidase, we report a&#160;manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8208;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8208;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks to serve as artificial antioxidase for rescuing stem cell fates. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, the Mn&#8208;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, including the H2O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722;, which surpasses the by&#8208;far&#8208;reported Mn&#8208;based ROS&#8208;scavenging artificial antioxidases. Consequently, the Mn&#8208;PcBC provides efficient rescuing of the bioactivities and functionalities of stem cells in high ROS&#8208;level microenvironments via protecting the transcription of osteogenesis&#8208;related genes. This work not only offers essential insights into the crucial functions of axially coordinated Mn&#8208;N5 sites in ROS&#8208;scavenging but also proposes new strategies to create efficient artificial antioxidases for stem&#8208;cell therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Electric Double Layer Adsorption for Stable Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase in 2.3 Ah Zn&#8208;Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a reliable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is imperative for enabling highly reversible zinc metal (Zn0) electrodes. Contrary to conventional &#8220;bulk solvation&#8221; mechanism, we found the SEI structure is dominated by electric double layer (EDL) adsorption. We manipulate the EDL adsorption and Zn2+ solvation with ether additives (i.e. 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5, 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4, and triglyme). The 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 with medium adsorption on EDL leads to a layer&#8208;structured SEI with inner inorganic ZnFx/ZnSx and outer organic C&#8208;O&#8208;C components. This structure endows SEI with high rigidness and strong toughness enabling the 100&#160;cm2 Zn||Zn pouch cell to exhibit a cumulative capacity of 4250 mAh cm&#8722;2 at areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2. More importantly, a 2.3 Ah Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#8226;nH2O pouch cell delivers a recorded energy density of 104 Wh Lcell&#8722;1 and runs for &gt; 70 days under the harsh conditions of low negative/positive electrode ratio (2.2:1), lean electrolyte (8&#160;g&#160;Ah&#8208;1), and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity (~13&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Rhodium(I) Tetrafluoroborate Catalyzed Intramolecular Carbofluorination of Alkenes via Acyl Fluoride C&#8208;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;F bonds of acyl fluorides can be cleaved and added across tethered alkenes in the presence of a cationic rhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate catalyst. This 1,2&#8208;carbofluorination reaction offers a powerful method for the synthesis of tertiary alkyl fluoride derivatives with atom economy of 100%. Mechanistic studies indicate that the concerted action of a rhodium cation and a tetrafluoroborate anion is the key for the success of this catalytic cleavage and formation of C&#8211;F bonds in a controlled manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Benzothiophenes at C4 by Activation as their Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzothiophenes, activated by oxidation to the corresponding S&#8208;oxides, undergo C&#8208;H/C&#8208;H&#8208;type coupling with phenols to give C4 arylation products. While an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C3 of the benzothiophene is important, the process operates without a directing group and a metal catalyst, thus rendering it compatible with sensitive functionalities &#8208; e.g. halides and formyl groups. Quantum chemical calculations suggest a formal stepwise mechanism involving heterolytic cleavage of an aryloxysulfur species to give a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation. Subsequent addition of the phenoxonium cation to the C4 position of the benzothiophene is favored over the addition to C3; Fukui functions predict that the major regioisomer is formed at the more electron&#8208;rich position between C3 and C4. Varied selective manipulation of the benzothiophene products showcase the synthetic utility of the metal&#8208;free arylation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Prenucleation&#8208;Induced Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite film with high crystal quality is fundamental to achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. A fast nucleation process is crucial to improving the crystallization quality. Here, we propose a self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy to achieve fast nucleation. This is realized through rational solvent design. The key characteristics of different solvents are systematically evaluated. Among them, formamide, with ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant, low Gutman donor number, and a high boiling point, is selected as the co&#8208;solvent. These unique characteristics render formamide a double&#8208;face solvent that is a good solvent for formamidinium iodide (FAI) and CsI while a poor solvent for PbI2. As a result, formamide induces the self&#8208;driven prenucleation of PbI2&#8208;DMSO seeding crystals and accelerates the nucleation, improving the crystalline quality of perovskite film. The efficiency of the hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is boosted beyond 19% for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Traceless Chiral Shift Reagent Based on Nonbonding Interaction with Single&#8208;Handed Helical Poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;handed poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)s (PQX) have been found to serve as a new chiral shift reagent (CSR) for determining the enantiomeric ratio by NMR. Even though there is no specific binding site in PQX, its nonbonding interaction with chiral analytes leads to a significant shift of the NMR chemical shift, allowing quantification of the enantiomeric ratio. The new CSR has the advantages of a wide scope of analytes including ethers, haloalkanes, and alkanes, easy tunability of the degree of chemical shifts by measurement temperature, and erasability of proton signals of CSR because of the short spin&#8211;spin (T2) relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation of Aryl Bromides Enabled by Potassium Metabisulfite as a Uniquely Effective SO2 Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides has been developed utilizing an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. While initial mechanistic studies identified SO2 as a catalyst poison, later use of the isolated oxidative addition complex revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2 slowly released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5.







Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K2S2O5 as a reservoir of SO2 that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.

A new and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure of bromoacetonitrile has been developed. A variety of valuable 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, this transformation can be carried out under atmospheric pressure and provides an alternative route to 7 drug compounds.







Abstract
Nitrile compounds containing ester and amide groups are important functionalized chemicals in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. In this article, an efficient and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure toward 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions via radical intermediate which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization. Gram&#8208;scale experiment was performed successfully under low catalyst loading and gave the target product in excellent yield. Additionally, this transformation can be performed under atmospheric pressure and provide alternative routes to 7 drug precursors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrile compounds containing ester and amide groups are important functionalized chemicals in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. In this article, an efficient and convenient palladium-catalyzed carbonylative procedure toward 2-cyano-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetamide and 2-cyanoacetate compounds has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions via radical intermediate which is suitable for late-stage functionalization. Gram-scale experiment was performed successfully under low catalyst loading and gave the target product in excellent yield. Additionally, this transformation can be performed under atmospheric pressure and provide alternative routes to 7 drug precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial RNA Modification for Cancer RNA Interference Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known cyclization reaction between furan and nucleotides of nucleic acid under the ignition of 1O2, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification (NIMiRM) strategy was herein developed for long&#8208;term NIR/PA dual&#8208;modality imaging and remarkable suppression of tumors in vivo.







Abstract
Mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) plays a critical role in synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Interfering mtRNA is a highly effective way to induce cell apoptosis. Herein, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification approach for long&#8208;term imaging and effective suppression of tumors. A tumor&#8208;targetable NIR fluorescent probe f&#8208;CRI consisting of a cyclic RGD peptide, a NIR fluorophore IR780, and a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;labile furan group for RNA modification was rationally designed and synthesized. This probe was demonstrated to dominantly accumulate in cellular mitochondria and could be covalently conjugated onto mtRNA upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation resulting in prolonged retention in tumors. More notably, this covalent modification of mtRNA by f&#8208;CRI could perturb the function of mitochondria leading to remarkable tumor suppression. We thus envision that our current approach would offer a potential approach for cancer RNA interference therapeutics.

         <title>From Dinitrogen to N&#8208;Containing Organic Compounds: Using Li2CN2 as a Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the conversion of inert N2 into various nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds is presented. The activated N&#8208;containing species Li2CN2 is successfully prepared in high yields from N2 gas, C and LiH. Li2CN2 can be transformed into a range of N&#8208;containing organic compounds, including cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives. 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives, have also been prepared from 15N2 gas.







Abstract
Through the synergies of a heterogeneous synthetic approach and a homogeneous synthetic methodology, N&#8208;containing organic compounds can be synthesized via activated N&#8208;containing species prepared from N2 gas and suitable carbon sources. From N2, carbon, and LiH, we have previously succeeded in the high&#8208;yield preparation of Li2CN2 as the activated N&#8208;containing species. In this work, we applied Li2CN2 as a novel synthetic synthon for constructing N&#8208;containing organic compounds. A series of reaction models, including a substitution reaction, cycloaddition reaction, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction, were successfully performed using Li2CN2 under mild conditions. Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti&#8208;cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from 15N2 gas.

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atomic Pt Nanozymes for Enzymatic Theranostics of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;atomic Pt nanozyme was developed using a facile missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination strategy. The nanozyme shows superior catalase&#8208;mimicking activity for the catalytic conversion of H2O2 overproduced in tumors into localized O2 for tumor hypoxia alleviation, which leads to enhanced ROS generation from loaded photosensitizers for apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
Conventional nanozymes often possess low active site density. Pursuing effective strategies for constructing highly active single&#8208;atomic nanosystems with maximum atom utilization efficiency is exceptionally attractive. Herein, we develop a facile &#8220;missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination&#8221; strategy to fabricate two self&#8208;assembled nanozymes, i.e., conventional nanozyme (NE) and single&#8208;atomic nanozyme (SAE), which respectively consist of Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms as active catalytic sites anchored in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated photosensitizers for catalase&#8208;mimicking enhanced photodynamic therapy. Compared to a Pt nanoparticle&#8208;based conventional nanozyme, a Pt single&#8208;atomic nanozyme shows enhanced catalase&#8208;mimicking activity in generating oxygen for overcoming tumor hypoxia, thus exhibiting a more efficient reactive oxygen species generation and high tumor inhibition rate.

         <title>A Hydrazine&#8208;Nitrate Flow Battery Catalyzed by a Bimetallic RuCo Precatalyst for Wastewater Purification along with Simultaneous Generation of Ammonia and Electricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new and general electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst can efficiently catalyze both the hydrazine oxidation and nitrate reduction reactions so as to assemble a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery with electricity and ammonia generation.







Abstract
The traditional technologies for industrial and agricultural effluent treatment are often energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we suggest an electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we propose a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery (HNFB) that can efficiently purify the wastewater and meanwhile generate both ammonia fuel and electricity with the assistance of our developed bimetallic RuCo precatalyst. Specifically, the battery delivers a peak power density of 12&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and continuously operates for 20&#8197;h with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated electricity can further drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. Our work provides an alternative pathway to purify wastewater and generate high value&#8208;added fuels at low cost.

         <title>Catalytic Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Radical Carbocyanation of 2&#8208;Azadienes for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and broadly applicable method for the construction of complex &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derivatives through a novel cascade strategy is presented. Alkyl radicals are generated by the photo&#8208;mediated reductive decarboxylation of redox&#8208;active esters, captured by 2&#8208;azadienes to provide 2&#8208;azallyl radicals and cyanized by a copper catalyst.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis.

     alt="Catalytic Chemo- and Regioselective Radical Carbocyanation of 2-Azadienes for the Synthesis of &#945;-Amino Nitriles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mild and broadly applicable method for the construction of complex &#945;- and &#946;-functionalized &#945;-amino nitrile derivatives through a novel cascade strategy is presented. Alkyl radicals are generated by the photo-mediated reductive decarboxylation of redox-active esters, captured by 2-azadienes to provide 2-azallyl radicals and cyanized by a copper catalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis. The preparation of &#945;- and &#946;-functionalized &#945;-amino nitriles from readily available scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/copper-catalyzed chemo- and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2-azadienes to access functionalized &#945;-amino nitriles by using redox-active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This cascade process employs a broad scope of RAEs and provides the corresponding &#945;-amino nitrile building blocks in 50&#8211;95&#8201;% yields (51 examples, regioselectivity &amp;gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5).

         <title>High&#8208;Performance and Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detectors Made of Smooth Perovskite Microcrystalline Films with 100&#8197;&#956;m Grains</title>

         <dc:description>
Dense, smooth, substrate&#8208;integrated, large&#8208;area and thickness&#8208;controlled perovskite microcrystalline films are prepared. They are used as self&#8208;powered microcrystalline X&#8208;ray detectors with an impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which may further reduce the X&#8208;ray radiation risk to patients.







Abstract
Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal&#8208;induced growth and hot&#8208;pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi&#8208;inch&#8208;sized microcrystalline films can be in situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100&#8197;&#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#956;&#964;) product as single crystals. As a result, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Combining with the fast response speed (186&#8197;&#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite&#8208;based low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Ruthenium/TiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate: Reaction Pathways Dominated by Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of Ru in Ru/TiO2 dictates the reaction pathway for polyethylene terephthalate hydrogenolysis. Under&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor the formation of arenes through a desired binding orientation of aromatic adsorbates, which discourages ring hydrogenation and ring&#8208;opening reactions.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis can produce benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), where the selectivity control is challenging. We report a reaction pathway dictated by the Ru coordination environment by examining the binding geometries of adsorbates on differently coordinated Ru centers and their evolution during PET hydrogenolysis. A BTX yield of 77&#8201;% was obtained using a Ru/TiO2 with a Ru coordination number of ca. 5.0 where edge/corner sites are dominant, while more gas and saturated products were formed for Ru/TiO2 containing primarily terrace sites. Density functional theory and isotopic labelling revealed that under&#8208;coordinated Ru edge sites favor &#8220;upright&#8221; adsorption of aromatic adsorbates while well&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption, where the former mitigates ring hydrogenation and opening. This study demonstrates that reaction pathways can be directed through controlled reactant/intermediate binding via tuning of the Ru coordination environment for efficient conversion of PET to BTX.

         <title>Cooperative Proton and Li&#8208;ion Conduction in a 2D&#8208;Layered MOF via Mechanical Insertion of Lithium Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ionic conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) was observed in the 2D&#8208;Ti&#8208;dobdc MOF after Li salt intercalation, which improved the H2O affinity of the frameworks, facilitating Li+ and H+ diffusion. Furthermore, the ion diffusion evaluated by PFG&#8197;NMR indicates the counter anion effect. It was demonstrated that the moderate covalent/ionic character of LiBr and the high H2O uptake are crucial factors in efficient ionic conductors.







Abstract
Ionic conduction in highly designable and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks has been explored through the introduction of various ionic species (H+, OH&#8722;, Li+, etc.) using post&#8208;synthetic modification such as acid, salt, or ionic liquid incorporation. Here, we report on high ionic conductivity (&#963;&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in a two&#8208;dimensionally (2D)&#8208;layered Ti&#8208;dobdc (Ti2(Hdobdc)2(H2dobdc), H4dobdc: 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid) via LiX (X=Cl, Br, I) intercalation using mechanical mixing. The anionic species in lithium halide strongly affect the ionic conductivity and durability of conductivity. Solid&#8208;state pulsed&#8208;field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8197;NMR ) verified the high mobility of H+ and Li+ ions in the temperature range of 300&#8211;400&#8197;K. In particular, the insertion of Li salts improved the H+ mobility above 373&#8197;K owing to strong binding with H2O. Furthermore, the continuous increase in Li+ mobility with temperature contributed to the retention of the overall high ionic conductivity at high temperatures.

         <title>CuNi Nanoalloys with Tunable Composition and Oxygen Defects for the Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal synthesis is an excellent tool for the study of cooperative effects in nanoalloys. In this work, bimetallic model CuNi nanoparticles of defined size and composition are fully characterized and tested for the oxygen evolution reaction. Copper addition to nickel leads to modifications in the structural and electronic properties, showing a higher concentration of surface oxygen defects and formation of active Ni3+ sites under reaction conditions. The ratio OV/OL between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen shows a clear correlation with the overpotential, being an excellent descriptor of the electrocatalytic activity. This is attributed to modifications in the crystalline structure, leading to lattice strain and grain size effects. Bimetallic Cu50Ni50NP showed the lowest overpotential (318 mV vs RHE), low Tafel slope (63.9 mV dec&#8208;1), and excellent stability. This work unravels the relative concentration between oxygen defects and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) as an excellent descriptor of the catalytic activity of bimetallic precatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Glycosidic&#8208;Bond&#8208;Based Mass&#8208;Spectrometry&#8208;Cleavable Cross&#8208;linker Enables In vivo Cross&#8208;linking for Protein Complex Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) has emerged as a powerful technology to analyze protein complexes. However, the progress of in vivo CXMS studies has been limited by cross&#8208;linking biocompatibility and data analysis. Herein, a glycosidic bond&#8208;based MS&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) was designed and synthesized, which was fragmented in MS under CID/HCD to simplify the cross&#8208;linked peptides into conventional single peptides via selective cleavage between glycosidic and peptide bonds under individual MS collision energy. Consequently, the cross&#8208;linking identification accuracy and throughput were significantly enhanced, and the popular MS mode of stepped HCD was allowed. In addition, TDS showed proper cell&#8208;penetrating properties while being highly water&#8208;soluble, making it non&#8208;DMSO dependent during solubilization. Collectively, TDS provides a promising toolkit for CXMS characterization of living systems with high biocompatibility and accuracy.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbazolylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle based Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two covalent organic frameworks consisting of carbazolylene&#8208;ethynylene shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles with azine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1) or imine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;2) linkages were synthesized via imine condensation. The obtained 2D frameworks are fully conjugated which imparts semiconducting properties. In addition, the frameworks showed high porosity with aligned accessible porous channels along the z axis, serving as an ideal platform for post&#8208;synthetic incorporation of I2 into the channels to enable electrical conductivity. The resulting MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 showed an electrical conductivity up to 7.8 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S/cm at room temperature upon I2 doping with the activation energy as low as 0.09 eV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the electrical properties of both MC&#8208;COFs are switchable between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states by simply implementing doping&#8208;regenerating cycles. The knowledge gained in this study opens new possibilities for the future development of tunable conductive 2D organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic Acid and Porphyrin for Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the subcellular localization of photosensitizers. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoparticle platform for enhanced PDT of cancer. By grafting 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a Hf12&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (Hf&#8208;MOL) via carboxylate coordination, ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL enhanced ALA delivery and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis in mitochondria, and trapped the Hf&#8208;MOL comprising 5,15&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;benzoatoporphyrin (DBP) photosensitizers in lysosomes. Light irradiation at 630 nm simultaneously excited PpIX and DBP to generate single oxygen and rapidly damage both mitochondria and lysosomes, leading to synergistic enhancement of the PDT efficacy. The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL outperformed Hf&#8208;MOL in preclinical PDT studies, with a 2.7&#8208;fold lower half maximal inhibitory concentration in cytotoxicity assays in vitro and a 3&#8208;fold higher cure rate in a colon cancer model in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Methylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Engineered Methyltransferases To Generate Non&#8208;natural Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>numerous biological functions. Selective late&#8208;stage modification of their carbon scaffold has the potential to optimize or transform their biological activities. However, the synthesis of terpenoids with a non&#8208;natural carbon scaffold is often a challenging endeavor because of the complexity of these molecules. Here we report the identification and engineering of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent sterol methyltransferases for selective C&#8209;methylation of linear terpenoids. The engineered enzyme catalyzes selective methylation of unactivated alkenes in mono&#8208;, sesqui&#8208; and diterpenoids to produce C11, C16&#160;and C21&#160;derivatives. Preparative conversion and product isolation reveals that this biocatalyst performs C&#8209;C bond formation with high chemo&#8209; and regioselectivity. The alkene methylation most likely proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and regioselective deprotonation. This method opens new avenues for modifying the carbon scaffold of alkenes in general and terpenoids in particular.</dc:description>

         <title>Triphenylamine&#8208;Derived Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Dots for Multicolor High&#8208;Efficiency Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as fantastic luminescent nanomaterials in electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the device performance of the reported CDs&#8208;based electroluminescent LEDs is far from satisfactory due to the serious aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of CDs. Here, inspired by the nonplanar structure and good carrier mobility of triphenylamine unit, two kinds of triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with orange and yellow color are facilely synthesized through a solvothermal treatment. Theoretical calculations show that the triphenylamine structure could greatly inhibit the direct &#960;&#8208;&#960;* stacking of aromatic skeletons and enhance the fluorescence properties of CDs in aggregation state. Delightedly, both the two CDs show strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence, excellent solution&#8208;processability, good film&#8208;forming ability, and high electron/hole mobility. More interestingly, by adopting the obtained CDs as single emissive layer, high&#8208;performance orange&#8208;color and green&#8208;color LEDs are successfully fabricated, with maximum brightness of 9450/4236 cd/m2, high current efficiency of 1.57/2.34 cd/A and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.1/3.6 eV are respectively achieved. Significantly, white&#8208;color LED device with a CIE coordinate of (0.30, 0.39), maximum brightness of 5726 cd/m2 and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.0 eV is further prepared. This work provides a universal platform for the construction of novel solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with significant applications in photoelectric device.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Alkynes as One&#8208;Carbon Donors in [5+1] Heteroannulation: Synthesis of Pyridines via Ynimine Intermediates and Application in the Total Synthesis of Anibamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed&#160;[4+2] heteroannulation between&#160;a,b&#8208;unsaturated oximes&#160;and their&#160;derivatives with alkynes&#160;have been developed into a powerful strategy for the synthesis of pyridines.

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Arylpyrroles via Atroposelective Diyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral biaryls widely exist in natural products and pharmaceuticals and are used as chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis. Compared to the well&#8208;established axially chiral 6&#8208;membered biaryl skeletons, examples of 5&#8208;membered biaryls have been quite scarce, and mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers have not been reported. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization for the construction of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8211;H insertion of vinyl cations. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers, but also constitutes the first example of atroposelective diyne cyclization and the first atropisomer construction via vinyl cations. Theoretical calculations further support the mechanism of vinyl cation&#8208;involved cyclization and elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a Au(I) complex modified with a hemi&#8208;labile (C^N) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand that is able to mediate oxidative addition of aryl iodides. Detailed computational and experimental investigations have been undertaken to verify and rationalize the oxidative addition process. Application of this initiation mode has resulted in the first examples of &#8220;exogenous oxidant&#8208;free&#8221; AuI/AuIII catalyzed 1,2&#8208;oxyarylations of ethylene and propylene. These demanding yet powerful processes establish these commodity chemicals as nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic building blocks in catalytic reaction design.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure of an i&#8208;Motif from the HRAS Oncogene Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An i&#8208;motif is a non&#8208;canonical DNA structure implicated in gene regulation and linked to cancers. The C&#8208;rich strand of the HRAS oncogene, 5&#8217;&#8208;CGCCCGTGCCCTGCGCCCGCAACCCGA&#8208;3&#8217; (here referred to as iHRAS), forms an i&#8208;motif in vitro but its exact structure was unknown. HRAS is a member of the RAS proto&#8208;oncogene family. About 19% of US cancer patients carry mutations in RAS genes. We solved the structure of iHRAS at 1.77 &#197; resolution. The structure reveals that iHRAS folds into a double hairpin. The two double hairpins associate in an antiparallel fashion, forming an i&#8208;motif dimer capped by two loops on each end and linked by a connecting region. Six C&#8208;C+ base pairs form each i&#8208;motif core, and the core regions are extended by a G&#8208;G base pair and C stacking. Extensive canonical and non&#8208;canonical base pairing and stacking stabilizes the connecting region and loops. The iHRAS structure is the first atomic resolution structure of an i&#8208;motif from a human oncogene. This structure sheds light on i&#8208;motifs folding and function in the cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazabicyclic Electroactive Ionenes for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroactive ionenes combining caged&#8208;shaped diazabicyclic cations and aromatic diimides were developed as interlayers in organic solar cells (OSCs). These ionenes reduce the work&#8208;function of air&#8208;stable metal electrodes (e.g., Ag, Cu and Au) by generating strong interfacial dipoles, and their optoelectronic and morphological characters can be modulated by aromatic diimides, leading to high conductivity and good compatibility with active layers. The optimal ionene exhibits superior charge&#8208;transport, desirable crystallinity, and weak visible&#8208;absorption, boosting the efficiency of benchmark PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs up to 17.44%. The corresponding normal devices show excellent stability at maximum power point test under one sun illumination for 1000 h. Replacing Y6 with L8&#8208;BO promotes the efficiency to 18.43%, one of the highest in binary OSCs. Notably, high efficiencies &gt; 16% are maintained as the interlayer thickness increasing to 105 nm, the best result with interlayer&#8208;thickness over 100 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission by Molecular Design: A Route to High&#8208;Performance Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emission efficiency of organic semiconductors (OSCs) often suffers from aggregation caused quenching (ACQ). An elegant solution is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which constitutes the design of the OSC so that its morphology inhibits quenching &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and non&#8208;radiative motional deactivation. The light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) can be sustainably fabricated, but its function depends on motion of bulky ions in proximity of the OSC. It is therefore questionable whether the AIE morphology can be retained during LEC operation. Here, we synthesize two structurally similar OSCs, which are distinguished by that 1 features ACQ while 2 delivers AIE. Interestingly, we find that the AIE&#8208;LEC significantly outperforms the ACQ&#8208;LEC. We rationalize our finding by showing that the AIE morphology remains intact during LEC operation, and that it can feature appropriately sized free&#8208;volume voids for facile ion transport and suppressed non&#8208;radiative excitonic deactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Longitudinally Grafting of Graphene with Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Porous Organic Polymer to Boost Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymers (PFePc) are attractive noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the low site&#8208;exposure degree and poor electrical conductivity of bulk PFePc restricted their practical applications. Herein, laminar PFePc nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) was prepared. Such structural engineering qualifies 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc with high site utilization and rapid mass transfer. Thence, 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc demonstrates efficient ORR performance with a high specific activity of 69.31 &#956;A cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 81.88 A g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 0.93 e s&#8722;1 site&#8722;1 at 0.90 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode in O2&#8208;saturated 0.1 M KOH, outperforming the lamellar PFePc wrapped graphene counterpart. Systematic electrochemical analyses integrating variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in&#8208;situ scanning electrochemical microscopy further underline the rapid kinetics of 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc towards ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Tough, Reprocessable and Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Polymers with Ultrastable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers, whose emission can persist for a long period after photoexcitation, are of great importance in practical applications. Herein, dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8211;N coordination are incorporated into commercial epoxy matrix. The reversible dissociation of B&#8211;N bonds upon loading provides an efficient energy dissipation pathway for the epoxy network, while the rigid epoxy matrix can inhibit the quenching of triplet excitons in boronic esters. The obtained polymers exhibit enhanced mechanical toughness (12.26 MJ m&#8208;3), ultralong RTP (&#964; = 540.4 ms) and shape memory behavior. Notably, the RTP property shows no obvious decrease upon prolonged immersion in various solvents due to the robust networks. Moreover, the dynamic bonds endow the polymers with superior reprocessablity and recyclability. Based on these novel properties, their potential applications for information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting were demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A systematic evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N versus C&#8208;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of hitherto unknown chemoselective O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry. Use of the CyPAd&#8208;DalPhos precatalyst C2 enabled particularly challenging O&#8208;arylation chemoselectivity in amino alcohols featuring branched primary and secondary alkylamine groups, while selective N&#8208;arylation was observed in substrates featuring less&#8208;hindered linear alkylamine and aniline reacting groups. Useful reaction scope in the (hetero)aryl chloride was achieved throughout, and the ability to conduct such transformations using benchtop handling of materials is demonstrated.</dc:description>

Thus, the development of methods for their synthesis is highly valuable yet remains challenging. Herein, an unprecedented catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides with aminating agents has been developed, accessing enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives. Conceptually, sterically&#8208;disfavoured and electronically&#8208;disfavoured enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes have been successfully tuned using different transition metals and chiral ligands. Notably, extremely steric congested aliphatic &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam derivatives were synthesized by Cu&#8208;H catalyzed asymmetric forge of C&#8208;N bond with tertiary alkyl species for the first time.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four highly porous pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The reported findings highlight that the presence of pyrene active sites in very close proximity leads to unwanted H2O2 decomposition. Accordingly, a biphasic system (benzyl alcohol and water) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition.







Abstract
Four highly porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing pyrene units were prepared and explored for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The experimental studies are complemented by density functional theory calculations, proving that the pyrene unit is more active for H2O2 production than the bipyridine and (diarylamino)benzene units reported previously. H2O2 decomposition experiments verified that the distribution of pyrene units over a large surface area of COFs plays an important role in catalytic performance. The Py&#8208;Py&#8208;COF though contains more pyrene units than other COFs which induces a high H2O2 decomposition due to a dense concentration of pyrene in close proximity over a limited surface area. Therefore, a two&#8208;phase reaction system (water&#8208;benzyl alcohol) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition. This is the first report on applying pyrene&#8208;based COFs in a two&#8208;phase system for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

         <title>Imaging Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Membrane Interactions: Ion&#8208;Channel Pores and Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Permeability in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric, protofibril, annular and fibril assemblies is intimately linked with neuronal toxicity and Alzheimer's disease. A&#946; can have a range of impacts on the lipid membrane including a carpeting effect and ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Imaging these interactions with the lipid bilayer is providing a clearer picture of A&#946;&#8208;induced membrane permeability, which leads to loss of cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
The accumulation of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides (A&#946;) is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism by which A&#946; triggers a cascade of events that leads to dementia is a topic of intense investigation. A&#946; self&#8208;associates into a series of complex assemblies with different structural and biophysical properties. It is the interaction of these oligomeric, protofibril and fibrillar assemblies with lipid membranes, or with membrane receptors, that results in membrane permeability and loss of cellular homeostasis, a key event in Alzheimer's disease pathology. A&#946; can have an array of impacts on lipid membranes, reports have included: a carpeting effect; a detergent effect; and A&#946; ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Recent advances imaging these interactions are providing a clearer picture of A&#946; induced membrane disruption. Understanding the relationship between different A&#946; structures and membrane permeability will inform therapeutics targeting A&#946; cytotoxicity.

         <title>Decrypting the Controlled Product Selectivity over Ag&#8722;Cu Bimetallic Surface Alloys for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;Cu surface alloys, as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, demonstrated controllable product selectivity with their surface compositions and the applied potentials rationally tuned. The working mechanism of these catalysts was revealed by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations. A predominant region map describing the thermodynamic predominance of *CO involved subsequent reactions is provided as reliable guidance for the design of catalysts CO2 reduction towards value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controlled product selectivity is realized on Ag&#8722;Cu bimetallic surface alloys, with high selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;60&#8201;% faradaic efficiency, FE), C1 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;41&#8201;% FE) and CO (&#8776;74&#8201;% FE) achieved by tuning surface compositions and applied potentials. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that surface&#8208;composition&#8208;dependent d&#8208;band center could tune *CO binding strengths, regulating the *CO subsequent reaction pathways and then the product selectivity. Further adjusting the applied potentials will alter the energy of participated electrons, which leads to controlled ECO2RR selectivity towards desired products. A predominant region map, with an indicator proposed to evaluate the thermodynamic predominance of the *CO subsequent reactions, is then provided as a reliable theoretical guidance for the controllable ECO2RR product selectivity over bimetallic alloys.

         <title>Toward Scalable Nanofluidic Osmotic Power Generation from Hypersaline Water Sources with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy toward scalable nanofluidic osmotic power generation by using PSS/HKUST&#8208;1 membrane with subnanometer pores and using hypersaline water sources. The hypersaline water sources provide high ionic conductivity and the subnanometer pores guarantee charge selectivity under high salinity. The power density stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 when the membrane area increased to 7&#8197;mm2, the highest for macro&#8208;sized nanofluidic membranes.







Abstract
Nanofluidic membranes have shown great promise in harvesting osmotic energy but its scalablity remains challenging since most studies only tested with a membrane area of &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;mm2 or smaller. We demonstrate that metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes with subnanometer pores can be used for scalable osmotic power generation from hypersaline water sources. Our membrane can be scaled up to a few mm2, and the power density can be stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. We reveal that the key is to improve the out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane conductance while keeping the membrane's charge selectivity, contradicting the previous conception that the ionic conductivity of the membrane plays the dominating role. We highlight that subnanometer pores are essential to ensure the charge selectivity in hypersaline water sources. Our results suggest the importance to engineer the interplay between the in&#8208;membrane and out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane ion transport properties for scalable osmotic power generation.

         <title>Rationally Modulating the Functions of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx Nanocomposite Electrocatalysts towards Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the understanding of intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the interactions with all pertinent intermediates, an efficient Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx electrocatalyst was designed and proven to realize mutual coordination among functions of active sites on the efficient dissociative adsorption of water, the easy desorption of OH&#8722;, and the facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation concurrently, leading to significantly boosted alkaline HER kinetics.







Abstract
Identifying electrocatalysts with functions of easy dissociation of water, rapid transformation of hydroxyl and facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation are indispensable while challenge for realizing efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we presented the design of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx nanocomposites towards addressing this challenge. We showed that Ni3Sn2 possessed ideal hydrogen adsorption and low hydroxyl adsorption abilities and NiSnOx facilitated water dissociation and hydroxyl transfer process, respectively. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned interplay of the two functional parts realized the mutual coordination among the multiple functions and led to significantly boosted HER kinetics. Current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were obtained at overpotentials of 14 and 165&#8197;mV on the optimized catalyst. This work highlights the significance of considering intrinsic interactions between active sites and all pertinent intermediates on obtaining promising electrocatalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical CaC2&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Biochar to C2H2: High Carbon Efficiency and Low Contamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid cathode electrolysis in molten salts is expected to convert biomass carbon into CaC2 with 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency. Simultaneously, the electrolysis can remove elements such as S and P from biomass, circumventing the contamination of harmful H2S and H3P in the final hydrolytic C2H2 product.







Abstract
The carbon to CaC2 route is promising to provide a sustainable elementary unit, C2H2, for the organic synthesis industry, but the traditional thermal reaction process suffers from low carbon efficiency, harmful gas contamination, high temperature operation, and risky CO management. We herein report a high carbon efficiency (ca. 100&#8201;%) conversion of biochar to C2H2 through an electrolytic synthesis of solid CaC2 in molten CaCl2/KCl/CaO at 973&#8197;K. The main reactions are carbon reduction to CaC2 at the solid carbon cathode and oxygen evolution at an inert anode. Meanwhile, the electrolysis removes S and P from the solid cathode, avoiding the formation of CaS and Ca3P2 in CaC2 and consequently eliminating H2S and PH3 contamination in the finally produced C2H2.

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the periodic surface of catalysts by the inclusion of single atoms can help building atomic electric fields that highly promote the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. We show here that this is achieved by modulating the interfacial water orientation and by subsequently decreasing the active sites&#8208;hydrogen distance.







Abstract
The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00&#215;1010&#8197;N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M&#8722;H bond length (M=active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.

Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single-atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O show that the M&#8722;H bond length (M=active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activated Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Copper(I) Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) copper cluster&#8208;assembled chains was prepared, which exhibited unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property. Based on which the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was constructed, which showed reversible photo&#8208;response property with excellent fatigue resistance.







Abstract
In this study, a pair of chiral copper(I) cluster&#8208;assembled materials (R/S&#8208;2) was prepared, exhibiting unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with a concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property in DMSO solution. By the combination of R/S&#8208;2 with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was developed, the CPL signal (glum=9&#215;10&#8722;3) of which could be induced by UV light irradiation. Moreover, the film exhibited a reversible photo&#8208;response and extremely good fatigue resistance. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response properties of the R/S&#8208;2 solution and film are attributed to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S&#8208;2 and a photo&#8208;induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster&#8208;assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive composite materials.

         <title>C&#8208;Bound or O&#8208;Bound Surface: Which One Boosts Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the localized negatively charged surface with C&#8208;affinity is superior to the positively charged one with O&#8208;affinity, providing guidance for screening and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate under ambient conditions is kind of sustainable and promising alternative method for urea synthesis. To date, the influence of catalyst surface properties on molecular adsorption configuration and electrocatalytic urea synthesis activity is unclear. In this work, we proposed that the urea synthesis activity is closely linked with the localized surface charge on bimetallic electrocatalysts, it is found that a negatively charged surface induces C&#8208;bound path and boosts urea synthesis. The urea yield rate can reach 13.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 on negatively charged Cu97In3&#8208;C, which is about 13&#8197;times that of positively charged Cu30In70&#8208;C counterpart with O&#8208;bound surface. This conclusion also applies to Cu&#8722;Bi and Cu&#8722;Sn systems. The molecular modification shifts the surface of Cu97In3&#8208;C to positively charged state, which leads to a sharp decline in urea synthesis performance. We demonstrated that the C&#8208;bound surface is more favorable than O&#8208;bound one to boost electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive (Hetero)Arylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Imines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides have been uncovered with a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach complements the traditional strategy using preformed organometallic reagents, and it exhibits good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl organometallic reagents to imines has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for the formation of optically active diarylmethylamines. Here, we report the first asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides enabled by a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach shows good functional group compatibility and complements the reported strategy without use of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic investigations supported that aryl&#8208;cobalt, instead of an arylzinc reagent, was formed in situ in this reductive aryl&#8208;addition event.

         <title>Reversible Li Plating on Graphite Anodes through Electrolyte Engineering for Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering towards a high&#8208;quality SEI regulates Li plating on graphite anode with a high reversibility and uniform morphology during fast&#8208;charging. This work provides a novel strategy to address the Li plating issue for fast&#8208;charging batteries.







Abstract
The difficulties to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step cause the lithium (Li) plating hard to be completely avoided on graphite anodes during fast charging. Therefore, Li plating regulation and morphology control are proposed to address this issue. Specifically, a Li plating&#8208;reversible graphite anode is achieved via a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to successfully regulate the Li plating with high reversibility over high&#8208;rate cycling. The evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) before and after Li plating is deeply investigated to explore the interaction between the lithiation behavior and electrochemical interface polarization. Under the fact that Li plating contributes 40&#8201;% of total lithiation capacity, the stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI renders the anode a higher average Coulombic efficiency (99.9&#8201;%) throughout 240&#8197;cycles and a 99.95&#8201;% reversibility of Li plating. Consequently, a self&#8208;made 1.2&#8208;Ah LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite pouch cell delivers a competitive retention of 84.4&#8201;% even at 7.2&#8197;A (6&#8197;C) after 150&#8197;cycles. This work creates an ingenious bridge between the graphite anode and Li plating, for realizing the high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>Boosting Selective Oxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Glycol Assisted by In situ Generated H2O2 from O2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ generated H2O2 from O2 electroreduction over mesoporous carbon is applied to oxidize ethylene via titanium silicalite&#8208;1. The in situ generated &#8901;OOH on the mesoporous carbon can form the key active species Ti&#8208;OOH over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 and oxidize ethylene. This route exhibits outstanding production rate and selectivity of ethylene glycol.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol is a useful organic compound and chemical intermediate for manufacturing various commodity chemicals of industrial importance. Nevertheless, the production of ethylene glycol in a green and safe manner is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we established an integrated, efficient pathway for oxidizing ethylene into ethylene glycol. Mesoporous carbon catalyst produces H2O2, and titanium silicalite&#8208;1 catalyst would subsequently oxidize ethylene into ethylene glycol with the in situ generated H2O2. This tandem route presents a remarkable activity, i.e., 86&#8201;% H2O2 conversion with 99&#8201;% ethylene glycol selectivity and 51.48&#8197;mmol&#8201;gecat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 production rate at 0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H2O2 as an oxidant, there exists &#8901;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H2O2 over titanium silicalite&#8208;1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in situ generated H2O2 in tandem route.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethylene glycol is a useful organic compound and chemical intermediate for manufacturing various commodity chemicals of industrial importance. Nevertheless, the production of ethylene glycol in a green and safe manner is still a long-standing challenge. Here, we established an integrated, efficient pathway for oxidizing ethylene into ethylene glycol. Mesoporous carbon catalyst produces H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and titanium silicalite-1 catalyst would subsequently oxidize ethylene into ethylene glycol with the in situ generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This tandem route presents a remarkable activity, i.e., 86&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion with 99&#8201;% ethylene glycol selectivity and 51.48&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;ecat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; production rate at 0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an oxidant, there exists &#8901;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over titanium silicalite-1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in situ generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in tandem route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water Activation for Boosting Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is demonstrated as an innovative co&#8208;reactant in the luminol electrochemiluminescence system for the first time, where cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide is afforded as an advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently catalyze the oxidation of water for the generation of reactive oxygen species, achieving the enhancement of electrochemiluminescence emission for sensitive biosensing.







Abstract
In conventional luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems, hydrogen peroxide and dissolved oxygen are employed as typical co&#8208;reactants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient ECL emission. However, the self&#8208;decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and limited solubility of oxygen in water inevitably restrict the detection accuracy and luminous efficiency of luminol ECL system. Inspired by ROS&#8208;mediated ECL mechanism, for the first time, we used cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide as co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently activate water to generate ROS for enhancing luminol emission. Experimental investigations verify the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in the process of electrochemical water oxidation, which subsequently react with luminol anion radicals to trigger strong ECL signals. Finally, the detection of alkaline phosphatase has been successfully achieved with impressive sensitivity and reproducibility for practical sample analysis.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyphenylene Wires Comprising Rigid Aliphatic Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Isolator Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphenylene wires regularly substituted with rigid aliphatic bicyclopentane isolators were obtained by on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterized with submolecular precision.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motifs are of growing importance to the pharmaceutical industry as sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres of benzene rings and as molecular building blocks in materials science. Herein we explore the behavior of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties on metal surfaces by combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy / non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy studies with density functional theory modeling. We examine the configuration of individual BCP&#8208;containing precursors on Au(111), their supramolecular assembly and thermally activated dehalogenative coupling reactions, affording polymeric chains with incorporated electronically isolating units. Our studies not only provide the first sub&#8208;molecular insights of the BCP scaffold behavior on surfaces, but also extend the potential application of BCP derivatives towards integration in custom&#8208;designed surface architectures.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Two Light and Pressure Responsive Physisorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging strategy to enable energy efficient gas storage and separation technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents. Herein, we report two isostructural light&#8208;modulated adsorbents (LMAs) which undergo pressure&#8208;induced transformations from closed (non&#8208;porous) to open (porous) phases via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2.







Abstract
An emerging strategy in the design of efficient gas storage technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents which undergo transformations in response to a particular stimulus, such as pressure, heat or light. Herein, we report two isostructural light modulated adsorbents (LMAs) containing bis&#8208;3&#8208;thienylcyclopentene (BTCP), LMA&#8208;1 [Cd(BTCP)(DPT)2] (DPT=2,5&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) and LMA&#8208;2 [Cd(BTCP)(FDPT)2] (FDPT=5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate). Both LMAs undergo pressure induced switching transformations from non&#8208;porous to porous via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2. LMA&#8208;1 exhibited multi&#8208;step adsorption while LMA&#8208;2 showed a single&#8208;step adsorption isotherm. The light responsive nature of the BTPC ligand in both frameworks was exploited with irradiation of LMA&#8208;1 resulting in a 55&#8201;% maximum reduction of CO2 uptake at 298&#8197;K. This study reports the first example of a switching sorbent (closed to open) that can be further modulated by light.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;selective regulation of protein translocation is achieved through the rational design of an endogenous enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids platform. The system enables enzyme&#8208;activated capture of proteins of interest and thus regulation of their cytoplasmic&#8208;nuclear shuttling with tumor&#8208;cell specificity, as reported by Mengyuan Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214958).

         <title>The Rigid Core and Flexible Surface of Amyloid Fibrils Probed by Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Spectroscopy of Aromatic Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rock&#8208;solid amyloid?&#160;Aromatic residues in the core of the amyloid fibrils HELLF and HET&#8208;s show no sign&#160;of ring flips suggesting a rigid core that does not undergo &#8222;breathing motions&#8221;. Aromatic residues facing outside on the other hand are highly flexible and show ring flips on various timescales. These conclusions could be drawn from dynamics measurements by solid&#8208;state MAS NMR in combination with specific labeling of phenylalanines and tyrosines as Antoine Loquet, Paul Schanda&#160;et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article (e202219314).

         <title>Chiral Iron Porphyrins Catalyze Enantioselective Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Amination Upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for the asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to give chiral indolines and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides in high product yields and with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions, as reported by Li Dang, Yungen Liu, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218577). This method provides a complementary approach to asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H aminations by precious metal&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein upregulation by modulating the interaction between a target protein and its E3 ligase is the opposite strategy of targeted protein degradation (PROTAC). In their Research Article (e202300978), Dong&#8208;Sup Lee, Seung&#8197;Bum Park enhanced the cellular STING levels by inhibiting STING&#8208;TRIM29 interaction, which activates innate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and potentiates the immune&#8208;oncology treatment by changing COLD to HOT tumor. Thus, targeted protein upregulation can be an alternative drug discovery strategy for undruggable targets.

         <title>Systematic Enzymatic Synthesis of dTDP&#8208;Activated Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides are the most diverse sugar nucleotides in nature. They serve as the glycosylation donors of glycosyltransferases to produce various carbohydrate structures. In their Research Article (e202217894), Liuqing Wen and co&#8208;workers developed a general strategy for the efficient preparation of dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides from readily available starting materials. This high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy avoids the need for complicated purification procedures.

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Charge Transport through Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;covalent interaction modulation is a promising strategy to guide the design of applicable (supra)molecular electronics. A rare investigation of the relationship between host&#8208;guest interaction and supramolecular charge transport is reported by Xiaobing Li, Siyuan Zhou, Cunlan Guo, Shigui Chen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (&lt;url href=&#8220;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202216987&#8221;&gt;e202216987). The current density through the pillar[5]arenes&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers can be raised up to &#8764;2.1 orders of magnitude after the introduction of cationic guest molecules, providing a new route for the design of molecular electronic devices and functional sensors with tunable electronic components.

         <title>11C&#8208;Cyanation of Aryl Fluorides via Nickel and Lithium Chloride&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#160;fluorides are expected to be useful as radiolabeling precursors due to their chemical stability and ready availability. However, direct radiolabeling via carbon&#8211;fluorine (C&#8211;F) bond cleavage is a challenging issue due to its significant inertness. Herein, we report a two&#8208;phase radiosynthetic method for the ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of aryl fluorides to obtain [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8211;F bond activation. We also established a practical protocol that avoids the use of a glovebox, except for the initial preparation of a nickel/phosphine mixture, rendering the method applicable for general PET centers. This method enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse [11C]aryl nitriles from the corresponding aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicated a significant promotion effect of lithium chloride on the oxidative addition, affording an aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complex, which serves as a precursor for rapid 11C&#8208;cyanation.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenazine&#8208;based Compound Realizing Separate Hydrogen and Oxygen Production in Electrolytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a sustainable approach for hydrogen production. However, conventional water electrolysis may suffer from gas mixing, and the different kinetics between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will limit the direct use of unstable renewable energies, leading to increased cost of H2 production. Herein, a novel phenazine&#8208;based compound is synthesized to develop the solid&#8208;state redox mediator associated water splititng process, and thus decoupling the H2 and O2 production in acid solution without the use of membrane. Excitingly, this organic redox mediator exhibits high specific capacity (290 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1), excellent rate performance (186 mAh g&#8208;1 at 30 A g&#8208;1) and long cycle life (3000 cycles) due to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic structure and the fast kinetics of H+ storage/release process. Furthermore, a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis architecture driven by solar energy is achieved, demonstrating high&#8208;purity H2 production at different times.</dc:description>

Herein, a novel phenazine-based compound is synthesized to develop the solid-state redox mediator associated water splititng process, and thus decoupling the H2 and O2 production in acid solution without the use of membrane. Excitingly, this organic redox mediator exhibits high specific capacity (290 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), excellent rate performance (186 mAh g-1 at 30 A g-1) and long cycle life (3000 cycles) due to its &#960;-conjugated aromatic structure and the fast kinetics of H+ storage/release process. Furthermore, a membrane-free decoupled water electrolysis architecture driven by solar energy is achieved, demonstrating high-purity H2 production at different times.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Passive Gate&#8208;Tunable Kinetic Photovoltage along Semiconductor&#8208;Water Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Moving boundaries of electrical double layer at solid&#8208;liquid interface enables unprecedented persistent energy conversion and provokes a kinetic photovoltaic effect by moving an illumination region along the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. Here, we report a transistor&#8208;inspired gate modulation of kinetic photovoltage by applying a bias at the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. The kinetic photovoltage of both p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type silicon samples can be facilely switched on/off, stemming from the electrical&#8208;field&#8208;modulated surface band bending. In contrast to the function of solid&#8208;state transistors relying on external sources, passive gate modulation of the kinetic photovoltage is achieved simply by introducing a counter electrode with materials of desired electrochemical potential. This architecture provides the ability to modulate the kinetic photovoltage over three orders of magnitude and opens up a new way for self&#8208;powered optoelectronic logic devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advances made in the field of stimuli&#8208;responsive catalysis during the last five years with a focus on the novel recently&#8208;emerged directions and applications have been surveyed. Metal&#8208;free catalysts and organometallic complexes, as well as biomimetic systems and extended structures, which display switchable catalytic activity for a variety of organic transformations, are discussed. Light&#8208;activated systems comprised of photochromic molecules capable of modulating reaction rate, yield, or enantioselectivity based on geometric and electronic changes associated with photoisomerization are the focus of the&#160;detailed discussion. Alternative stimuli, including pH and temperature, which could be applied either alone or in combination with light, are also addressed. Recent advances clearly demonstrate that the capability to finely tune catalyst behavior via an external stimulus is a powerful tool that could alter the landscape of sustainable chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis &#8208; Controlling the Competition of Monomeric versus Dimeric Reaction Pathway Enhances Stereoselectivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral phosphoric acids (CPA) have become a privileged catalyst type in organocatalysis, but the selection of the optimum catalyst is still challenging. So far hidden competing reaction pathways may limit the maximum stereoselectivities and the potential of prediction models. In CPA catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of imines, we identified for many systems two reaction pathways with inverse stereoselectivity, featuring as active catalyst either one CPA or a hydrogen bond bridged dimer. NMR measurements and DFT calculations revealed the dimeric intermediate and a stronger substrate activation via cooperativity. Both pathways are separable: Low temperatures and high catalysts loadings favor the dimeric pathway (ee up to &#8208;98%), while low temperatures with reduced catalyst loading favor the monomeric pathway and give significantly enhanced ee (92&#8208;99% ee; prior 68&#8208;86% at higher temperatures). Thus, a broad impact is expected on CPA catalysis regarding reaction optimization and prediction.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Multi&#8208;Cationic Molecular Chains for Gate Mechanism Controlled Superionic Conduction in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are high potential in achieving better safety and higher energy density, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) cannot fully satisfy the complicated requirements of SSBs. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (COF&#8208;MCMC) was developed as an efficient SSE. The MCMCs chemically anchored on COF channels were generated by nano&#8208;confined copolymerization of cationic ionic liquid monomers, which can function as Li+ selective gates. The coulombic interaction between MCMCs and anions leads to easier dissociation of Li+ from coordinated states, and thus Li+ transport is accelerated. While the movement of anions is restrained due to the charge interaction, resulting in a high Li+ conductivity of 4.9&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1and Li+ transference number of 0.71 at 30 &#176;C. The SSBs with COF&#8208;MCMC demonstrate an excellent specific energy density of 403.4 Wh kg&#8209;1 with high cathode loading and limited Li metal source.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Radical Afterglow of Carboxylic Acids with Tunable Spin Populations and Hole&#8208;Electron Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>No matter photoinduced organic radicals have been reported frequently, they are usually non&#8208;luminescent at ambient conditions. The internal mechanism on stability and electronic transitions of photoinduced radicals, is thus crucial for the development of relevant materials. Herein, a series of photoinduced radical emission systems were developed conveniently through doping benzoic acids into the hydrogen donor polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. Visual photoinduced radical emission and photochromism could be observed on Ph&#8208;3COOH@PVA film with the formation of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type structure. For the first time, radical afterglow appeared with energy transfer from triplet state. The appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for decreasing spin population and promoting electronic transitions of the radical. This study largely expands the radical emission property from both internal mechanism and practical application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of hybrid Wells&#8208;Dawson polyoxometalate (POM) containing a diphosphoryl group (P2O6X) of the general formula [P2W17O57(P2O6X)]6&#8208;&#160; (X = O, NH, or CR1R2). Modifying the bridging unit X was found to impact the redox potentials of the POM. The ease with which a range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized diphosphonic acids (X = CR1R2) can be prepared provides possibilities to access diverse functionalized hybrid POMs. Compared to existing phosphonate hybrid Wells&#8208;Dawson POMs, diphosphoryl&#8208;substituted POMs offer a wider tunable redox window and enhanced hydrolytic stability.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Optophysiology for Recording Intracellular and Extracellular Signals across the Brain of Free&#8208;Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of both intra/extracellular chemical signals across the large&#8208;scale brain is the key bottleneck, for understanding the interactions between the molecules inside and outside neurons. Here we built up a high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.</dc:description>

         <title>Laser Writing of Block&#8208;Copolymer Images into Mesopores Using SBDC&#8208;Initiated Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the iniferter N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) under visible&#8208;light irradiation with and without additional photocatalyst is demonstrated for the first time. Through the transfer of the polymerization to a commercially available microscope, automated laser writing of different polymers in mesoporous silica films is realized.







Abstract
For miniaturization, as well as for improving artificial nanopore performance, precise local polymer functionalization and the combination of different functionalities are required. Imagining data driven nanopore design automated nanopore functionalization would be beneficial. Using direct laser writing as one option of automated nanopore polymer functionalization visible light induced polymerizations are beneficial. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of mesoporous silicafilms with two different polymers using automated laser writing. For this we developed a visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm and 405&#8197;nm) N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) inifierter initiated polymerization. While transferring this visible light induced polymerization using SBDC to a commercially available microscope, direct, automated laser writing, as well as polymer re&#8208;initiation was demonstrated. Thereby, polymer spots of 37 and 40&#8197;&#956;m in diameter were achieved using 1&#8211;5&#8197;seconds for each irradiated spot.

         <title>Switching Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions by Mechanical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching among different anchoring sites of single&#8208;molecule junctions was achieved by mechanical tuning, leading to the control of the transmission pathway between the destructive quantum interference (DQI) and the constructive quantum interference (CQI) at the single&#8208;molecule level, which provides a new strategy for designing molecular electromechanics devices.







Abstract
The charge transport through single&#8208;molecule electronic devices can be controlled mechanically by changing the molecular geometrical configuration in situ, but the tunable conductance range is typically less than two orders of magnitude. Herein, we proposed a new mechanical tuning strategy to control the charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions via switching quantum interference patterns. By designing molecules with multiple anchoring groups, we switched the electron transport between the constructive quantum interference (CQI) pathway and the destructive quantum interference (DQI) pathway, and more than four orders of magnitude conductance variation can be achieved by shifting the electrodes in a range of about 0.6&#8197;nm, which is the highest conductance range ever achieved using mechanical tuning.

         <title>Suppressive Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Ruthenium/TiO2 Promote Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction with Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppressive strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) enable hot electrons excited on Ru to transfer to a TiO2&#8722;H2 support, thereby reducing the electron density on Ru to accelerate light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with methane. The optimized Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 composite exhibits an enhanced CO2 conversion rate of 400&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have gained great attention in the heterogeneous catalysis field, but its negative role in regulating light&#8208;induced electron transfer is rarely explored. Herein, we describe how SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO2 in light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by CH4 due to the photo&#8208;induced transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Ru. In contrast, on suppression of SMSI Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 achieves a 46&#8208;fold CO2 conversion rate compared to Ru/TiO2. For Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2, a considerable number of photo&#8208;excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate CO2 activation under illumination, simultaneously rendering Ru&#948;+ electron deficient and better able to accelerate CH4 decomposition. Consequently, photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 lowers the activation energy and overcomes the limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts by regulating two&#8208;phase interactions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Molecular Oxygen Activation in Heterogeneous Thermo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Mini&#8208;review systematically summarized the recent research progress of dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) for molecular oxygen activation (MOA) in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Despite the rapid developments in this field, many great challenges still hinder the practical application of DASCs. We look forward to the challenges and application prospects of DASCs for MOA.







Abstract
Efficient molecular oxygen activation (MOA) is the key to environmentally friendly catalytic oxidation reactions. In the last decade, single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with nearly 100&#8201;% atomic utilization and unique electronic structure have been widely investigated for MOA. However, the single active site makes the activation effect unsatisfactory and difficult to deal with complex catalytic reactions. Recently, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) have provided a new idea for the effective activation of molecular oxygen (O2) due to more diverse active sites and synergetic interactions among adjacent atoms. In this review, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of DASCs for MOA in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Finally, we look forward to the challenges and application prospects in the construction of DASCs for MOA.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Bound Diarylethene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films as Photoactuators with a Directed Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators is presented. The DAE units are assembled in a surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. The light&#8208;induced length changes of the DAE linkers multiply to anisotropic mesoscopic length changes. Due to the architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, here, bending a cantilever and performing work.







Abstract
Molecular machines and responsive materials open a plethora of new opportunities in nanotechnology. We present an oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators, arranged in a way to yield an anisotropic response. The DAE units are assembled, together with a secondary linker, into a monolithic surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. By Infrared (IR) and UV/Vis spectroscopy as well as by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, we show that the light&#8208;induced extension changes of the molecular DAE linkers multiply to yield mesoscopic and anisotropic length changes. Due to the special architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, leading to the bending of a cantilever and performing work. This research shows the potential of assembling light&#8208;powered molecules into SURMOFs to yield photoactuators with a directed response, presenting a path to advanced actuators.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of a Pyryne Precursor to Higher Pyrenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By palladium&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization reactions of pyrene&#8208;based o&#8208;trimethylsilyl triflates larger cyclic pyrenylenes were formed with up to 10&#8208;membered rings as has been unambiguously characterized by SCXRD. Furthermore, the underlying reaction mechanism has been studied by quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The palladium catalyzed cyclotrimerization of ortho&#8208;silylaryl triflates as aryne precursors is meanwhile an established method to synthesize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with triphenylene cores. During the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a pyrene with an o&#8208;silylaryl triflate moiety in the K&#8208;region higher homologues with central eight&#8208; and ten&#8208;membered rings (the pyrenylenes) were found, besides the expected trimer and a protocol was developed to isolate all members of this series. This unprecedented new class of PAHs was fully investigated by all means, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of single&#8208;crystals, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, a mechanism of all higher cyclooligomers is proposed.

         <title>Controlled Deformation of Soft Nanogel Particles Generates Artificial Biominerals with Ordered Internal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled deformation of soft nanogel particles during their occlusion within calcite crystals enables the generation of artificial biominerals with oriented internal structure. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and indicates that the rational design of multi&#8208;scale nanocomposite materials should be feasible via nanoparticle occlusion.







Abstract
Biominerals can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties owing to their hierarchically&#8208;ordered organic/inorganic nanocomposite structure. However, synthetic routes to oriented artificial biominerals of comparable complexity remain a formidable technical challenge. Herein we design a series of soft, deformable nanogels that are employed as particulate additives to prepare nanogel@calcite nanocomposite crystals. Remarkably, such nanogels undergo a significant morphological change&#8212;from spherical to pseudo&#8208;hemispherical&#8212;depending on their degree of cross&#8208;linking. This deformation occurs normal to the growth direction of the (104) face of the calcite and the underlying occlusion mechanism is revealed by in situ atomic force microscopy studies. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and offers new avenues for the design of synthetic nanocomposites comprising aligned anisotropic nanoparticles.

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on Nitrogen Electrooxidation to Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The powerful electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) techniques are employed to detect reaction intermediates. Based on the detected intermediates, the associative mechanism with the addition of hydroxyl at distal N (distal mechanism) is deduced for nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR).







Abstract
As a potential substitute technique for conventional nitrate production, electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is gaining more and more attention. But, the pathway of this reaction is still unknown owing to the lack of understanding on key reaction intermediates. Herein, electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotope&#8208;labeled online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) are employed to study the NOR mechanism over a Rh catalyst. Based on the detected asymmetric NO2&#8722; bending, NO3&#8722; vibration, N=O stretching, and N&#8722;N stretching as well as isotope&#8208;labeled mass signals of N2O and NO, it can be deduced that the NOR undergoes an associative mechanism (distal approach) and the strong N&#8801;N bond in N2 prefers to break concurrently with the hydroxyl addition in distal N.

         <title>Solid Interhalogen Compounds with Effective Br0 Fixing for Stable High&#8208;energy Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound IBr as a cathode, in which the active I fixes the oxidized Br0 without generating crossing&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charge and discharge process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers improved energy density compared with those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes.







Abstract
Though massive efforts have been devoted to exploring Br&#8208;based batteries, the highly soluble Br2/Br3&#8722; species causing rigorous &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, leads to severe self&#8208;discharge and low Coulombic efficiency. Conventionally, quaternary ammonium salts such as methyl ethyl morpholinium bromide (MEMBr) and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) are used to fix Br2 and Br3&#8722;, but they occupy the mass and volume of battery without capacity contribution. Here, we report an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound, IBr, as a cathode to address the above challenges, in which the oxidized Br0 is fixed by iodine (I), thoroughly eliminating cross&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charging and discharging process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers remarkably high energy density of 385.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is higher than those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes. Our work provides new approaches to achieve active solid interhalogen chemistry for high&#8208;energy electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Catalytic Homologation&#8208;Allylboration Sequence for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Densely Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Fluorohydrins with Tertiary Fluoride Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrins with tertiary fluoride stereocenters can be obtained via catalytic homologation and allylboration sequence with stereoselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. By allylboration of ketones, the process can also be used to access compounds with adjacent tertiary C&#8722;F and C&#8722;O stereocenters.







Abstract
Homologation of trisubstituted fluoroalkenes followed by allylboration of aldehyde, ketone and imine substrates is suitable for synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrin and amine products. In the presence of (R)&#8208;iodo&#8208;BINOL catalyst enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% can be achieved by formation of a single stereoisomer with adjacent stereocenters, of which one is a tertiary C&#8722;F center.

         <title>Photoelectromagnetic Responsive Adaptive Porous Frameworks through Dynamic Covalent Chemistry of Tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned Aryldicyanomethyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic materials undergoing adaptive solid&#8208;state transitions are attractive for soft mechanics and information technology. Here, we report a novel porous framework system based on macrocyclic trimers assembled from open&#8208;shell tetraarylethylene building blocks with aryldicyanomethyl radicals as coupling linkers. Under mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli, the framework showed adaptability by activating conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;based transformations, thus displaying macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, luminescence, and magnetism. We studied the dynamic processes by variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR), variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance (VT&#8208;ESR), and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurement and further established a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for multi&#8208;modal information encryption. The strategy may open avenues for rational design of solid&#8208;state photoelectromagnetic dynamic materials by merging dynamic covalent coupling chemistry and functional aggregation principles.</dc:description>

         <title>Do The Twist: Efficient Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Visible Light Polymerization Facilitated by Spin&#8208;Orbit Charge Transfer Inter&#8208;system Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light to drive polymerizations with spatiotemporal control offers a mild alternative to contemporary UV&#8208;light&#8208;based production of soft materials. In this spectral region, photoredox catalysis represents the most efficient polymerization method, yet it relies on the use of heavy&#8208;atoms, such as precious metals or toxic halogens. Herein, spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing from boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads bearing twisted aromatic groups is shown to enable efficient visible light polymerizations in the absence of heavy&#8208;atoms. A ~5&#8208;15&#215; increase in polymerization rate and improved photostability was achieved for twisted BODIPYs relative to controls. Furthermore, monomer polarity had a distinct effect on polymerization rate, which was attributed to charge transfer stabilization based on ultrafast transient absorption and phosphorescence spectroscopies. Finally, rapid and high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with a green LED was demonstrated using the present photosystem.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Au13 Clusters Stabilized by Enantiopure Monodentate NHC Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Au nanoclusters have promising application prospects in chiral sensing, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptics. However, enantiopure superatomic homogold clusters with crystallographic structures emitting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain challenging. In this study, we designed chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), and for the first time enantioselectively synthesized a pair of monovalent cationic superatomic Au13 clusters. This new enantiomeric pair of clusters has a quasi&#8208;C2 symmetric core and exhibited CPL with an unprecedent solution&#8208;state quantum yield (QY) of 61% among those of the atomically precise Au nanoclusters. DFT calculations provided insights into the circular dichroism behavior, and revealed the origin of CPL from superatomic Au clusters. This work opens a new avenue for developing novel homochiral nanoclusters using chiral NHC ligands and provides fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptics of metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;planar Nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] Cluster Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts, as promising alternative to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are still highly expected to achieve better performance by modulating the composition and spatial structure of active site. Herein, we constructed the non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane. Adjacent double Fe atoms effectively weaken the O&#8208;O bond by forming a peroxide bridge&#8208;like adsorption configuration, and the introduction of S atoms breaks the planar coordination of Fe resulting in greater structural deformation tension, lower spin state, and downward shifted Fe d&#8208;band center, which together facilitate the release of OH* intermediate. Hence, the non&#8208;planar [Fe2S2] cluster catalyst, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 V, displays superior ORR activity than that of planar [FeN4] or [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into the co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Induced Electronic States Regulation Boosting Electroreduction of Dilute Nitrate to Ammonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically converting NO3&#8208; into NH3 offers a promising route for water treatment. Nevertheless, electroreduction of dilute NO3&#8208; is still suffering from low activity and/or selectivity. Herein, B as a modifier was introduced to tune electronic states of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8208; reduction reaction (NO3RR) with dilute NO3&#8208; concentration (&#8804;100 ppm NO3&#8208;&#8208;N). Notably, a linear relationship was established by plotting NH3 yield vs. the oxidation state of Cu, indicating that the increase of Cu+ content leads to an enhanced NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion activity. Under a low NO3&#8208;&#8208;N concentration of 100 ppm, the optimal Cu(B) catalyst displays a 100% NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion at &#8208;0.55 to &#8208;0.6 V vs. RHE, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield of 309 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1, which is more than 25 times compared with the pristine Cu nanoparticles (12 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1). This research provides an effective method for conversion of dilute NO3&#8208; to NH3, which has certain guiding significance for the efficient and green conversion of wastewater in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Fusion of Thermoresponsive Polypeptides with UCST&#8208;type Behavior Mediates 1D Assembly of Coiled&#8208;Coil Bundlemers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermoresponsive resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths were genetically fused to two different computationally designed coiled coil&#8208;forming peptides with distinct thermal stability, to develop new strategies to assemble coiled coil peptides via temperature&#8208;triggered phase separation of the RLP units. Their successful production in bacterial expression hosts was verified via gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) turbidimetry, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements confirmed the stability of the coiled coils and showed that the thermosensitive phase behavior of the RLPs was preserved in the genetically fused hybrid polypeptides. Cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and coarse&#8208;grained modeling revealed that functionalizing the coiled coils with thermoresponsive RLPs leads to their thermally triggered noncovalent assembly into nanofibrillar assemblies.</dc:description>

Their successful production in bacterial expression hosts was verified via gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) turbidimetry, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements confirmed the stability of the coiled coils and showed that the thermosensitive phase behavior of the RLPs was preserved in the genetically fused hybrid polypeptides. Cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy and coarse-grained modeling revealed that functionalizing the coiled coils with thermoresponsive RLPs leads to their thermally triggered noncovalent assembly into nanofibrillar assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Redistribution Enables Redox&#8208;Resistible Li6PS5Cl towards High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivity hold great promise for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the parasitic redox reactions between sulfide electrolyte and Li metal result in interfacial instability and rapid decline of the battery performance. Herein, a redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) electrolyte is created by regulating the electron distribution in LPSC with Mg and F incorporation. The introduction of Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptation from Li, and F generates the self&#8208;limiting interface, which hinders the redox reactions between LPSC and Li metal. This redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2 electrolyte therefore presents a high critical current density (2.3 times of pristine electrolyte). The LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2/Li cell shows an outstanding cycling stability (93.3%@100 cycles at 0.2 C). This study highlights the electronic structure modulation to address redox issues on sulfide&#8208;based lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensional Reduction of Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cryopreservation of Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To increase the red blood cell (RBC) cryopreservation efficiency by metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), a dimensional reduction approach has been proposed. Namely 3D MOF nanoparticles are progressively reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). We found that 2D MOLs are beneficial for enhanced interactions of interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network and increased utilization of inner ordered structures, due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. Specifically, a series of hafnium (Hf)&#8208;based 2D MOLs with different thickness (monolayer to stacked multilayers) and density of hydrogen bonding sites have been synthesized. Both ice recrystallization inhibition activity (IRI) and RBCs cryopreservation assay confirm the pronounced better IRI activity and excellent cell recovery efficiency (up to ~63% at a very low concentration of 0.7 mg mL&#8211;1) of thin&#8208;layered Hf&#8208;MOLs compared to their 3D counterparts, thereby verifying the dimensional reduction strategy to improved cryoprotectant behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Density Cationic Defects Coupling with Local Alkaline&#8208;Enriched Environment for Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inferior activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) seriously limit their practical applications in various electrochemical energy conversion systems. Here we report, a drastic nonequilibrium precipitation approach to construct a highly disordered crystal structure of layered double hydroxides as a model OER catalyst. The unconventional crystal structure contains high&#8208;density cationic defects coupled with a local alkaline&#8208;enriched environment, enabling ultrafast diffusion of OH&#8208; ions and thus avoiding the formation of a local acidic environment and dissolution of active sites during OER. An integrated experimental and theoretical study reveals that high&#8208;density cationic defects, especially di&#8208;cationic and multi&#8208;cationic defects, serve as highly active and durable catalytic sites. This work showcases a promising strategy of crystal structure engineering to construct robust active sites for high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution in an alkaline solution.</dc:description>

         <title>A Recyclable and Scalable High&#8208;Capacity Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox organic electrode materials (OEMs) have attracted extensive attention for batteries due to the possibility to be designed with high performance. However, the practical application of OEMs requires rigor criteria such as low cost, recyclability, scalability and high performance etc. and hence seems still far away. Here, we demonstrate an OEM for high performance aqueous organic batteries. Quantification of the charge storage confirmed the storage of protons with fast reaction kinetics, thereby enabling the high performance at high mass loading. As a result, the laminated pouch cells delivered Ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale capacity with excellent cycling performance. Benefited from the small molecular nature and the stable both charged and discharged states, the electrodes can be recycled at any states of charge with high yields (more than 90%). This work provides a substantial step in the practical applications of OEMs for the future sustainable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Dithioacetal Polymers via Reversible Entropy&#8208;Driven Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a sustainable circular economy, polymers capable of chemical recycling to monomers are highly desirable. We report an efficient monomer&#8208;polymer recycling of polydithioacetal (PDTA). Pristine PDTAs were readily synthesized from 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzaldehyde and alkyl dithiols. They then exhibited depolymerizability via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization into macrocycles, followed by entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) to reform the virgin polymers. High conversions were obtained for both the forward and reverse reactions. Once crosslinked, the network exhibited thermal reprocessability enabled by acid&#8208;catalyzed dithioacetal exchange. The network retained the recyclability into macrocyclic monomers in solvent which can repolymerize to regenerate the crosslinked network. These results demonstrated PDTA as a new molecular platform for the design of recyclable polymers and the advantages of ED&#8208;ROP for which polymerization is favored at higher temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Tubular Flow System with Replaceable Photocatalyst Membranes for Scalable Coupling and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals at lab&#8208;scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0th&#8208;order reaction kinetics and a high space&#8208;time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.</dc:description>

         <title>Exposed Zinc Sites on Hybrid ZnIn2S4@CdS Nanocages for Efficient Regioselective Photocatalytic Epoxide Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis through C&#8211;O bond cleavage and formation has emerged as an alternative to synthesizing anti&#8208;tumoral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, the lack of crucial evidence to interpret the interaction between reactants and photocatalyst surface makes it challenging for photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis with both high activity and regioselectivity. In this work, we report the hierarchical ZnIn2S4@CdS photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis with high regioselectivity nearly 100%. Mechanistic studies unveil that the precise activation switch on exposed Zn acid sites for C&#8211;O bond polarization and cleavage has a critical significance for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis through C&#8211;O bond cleavage and formation has emerged as an alternative to synthesizing anti-tumoral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, the lack of crucial evidence to interpret the interaction between reactants and photocatalyst surface makes it challenging for photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis with both high activity and regioselectivity. In this work, we report the hierarchical ZnIn2S4@CdS photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis with high regioselectivity nearly 100%. Mechanistic studies unveil that the precise activation switch on exposed Zn acid sites for C&#8211;O bond polarization and cleavage has a critical significance for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the establishment of Z-scheme heterojunction facilitates the interface charge separation and transfer. Remarkably, the underlying regioselective photocatalytic reaction pathway has been distinctly revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x= 2&#8208;6) Units Realizing Giant Birefringence with Transparency in the Near&#8208;Infrared for Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals are requisite optical devices in laser and modern opto&#8208;electronic fields. Development of excellent birefringent materials are still challenging. Herein, the linear or chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x = 2&#8208;6) species were theoretically proved to be the origin of the large birefringence, and could be regarded as birefringent genes. Besides, the metal polysulfide family was first proposed to be rich birefringent materials source, among which Cs2S6 realizes giant birefringence 0.58@1064 nm together with a wide bandgap of 1.70 eV (based on the generalized gradient approximation). Moreover, the first dual&#8208;anion group polysulfide Na4Ba3(S2)4S3 was obtained, showing wide infrared transmission range (0.5&#8208;6.2 &#956;m), wide band gap (2.3 eV), and large birefringence (0.37 at 1064 nm). This work provides a new guiding thought for exploring large birefringence crystals in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>[n]Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Pillar[5]arene Bismacrocycles: Their Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Multiple Guest Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both pillar[n]arenes (P[n]As) and [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) play an important role in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report the precise synthesis of two multifunctional bismacrocycles [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A by integrating P[5]A into the [n]CPP backbone. The photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of the bismacrocycles was found to show a dramatic increase relative to the corresponding [n]CPPs. The chiral enantiomers (pR)/(pS)&#8208;[8]CPP&#8208;P[5]A were successfully isolated by chiral HPLC, and showed promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum ~ 0.02). In addition, [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A bismacrocycles are capable of binding pyridinium salts and fullerene derivatives with high affinity and specificity within the two distinct cavities. Transient absorption studies showed that photo&#8208;induced electron transfer occurs in [10]CPP&#8208;P[5]A&#8835;C60 complex. Our results suggest that [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A are potentially useful in CPL&#8208;active materials, multiple guest recognition and supramolecular polymer preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iridium/Aluminum Cooperative Strategy for the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the widespread success in the functionalization of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds, the deliberate functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a highly site&#8208; and stereoselective manner remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, we report an iridium/aluminum cooperative catalyst system that enables the &#946;&#8208;selective C&#8211;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines and lactams. Furthermore, we have accomplished an enantioselective variant using binaphthol&#8208;derived chiral aluminum catalysts to forge C&#8722;B bonds with high levels of stereocontrol. Computational studies suggest that the formation of a Lewis pair with the substrates is crucial to lower the energy of the transition state for the rate&#8208;determining reductive elimination step.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization for Hydrogel Synthesis through Barriers and Development of Light&#8208;Regulated Healable Hydrogels under NIR Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an aqueous and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated photoinduced reversible addition&#8722;fragmentation chain transfer (photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS4&#8722;) in the presence of peroxides. Taking advantage of its fast polymerization rates and high oxygen tolerance, this system is successfully applied for the preparation of hydrogels. Exploiting the enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through non&#8208;transparent biological barriers. Notably, the RAFT agents embedded in these hydrogel networks can be reactivated on&#8208;demand, enabling the hydrogel healing under NIR light irradiation. In contrast to the minimal healing capability (&lt; 15%) of hydrogels prepared by free radical polymerization (FRP), RAFT&#8208;mediated networks display more than 80% recovery of tensile strength. Although healable polymer networks under UV and blue lights have already been established, this work is the first photochemistry system using NIR light, facilitating photoinduced healing of hydrogels through thick non&#8208;transparent barriers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a two&#8208;step approach to obtain synthetically versatile bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives using Grignard reagents. This method allows the incorporation of BCP units in tetrapyrrolic macrocycles and the synthesis of a new class of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two BCP units. In addition, a doubly N&#8208;confused system was also formed in the presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the BCP bridgeheads. The pyrrole rings in BCP containing macrocycles exist in 1,3&#8208;alternate or abab conformation, as observed from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and 2D NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable NIR Fluorescent Probe for NAD(P)H and Its Application to the Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of p53 Abnormalities In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of NAD(P)H in mitochondria in living colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) was demonstrated to be highly co&#8208;related to p53 abnormality for the first time by employing a selective NIR fluorescent probe KC8 for NAD(P)H. Due to its NIR emission (745&#8197;nm) and excellent tumor&#8208;targeting character, KC8 was enriched in tumor region when administered intravenously, which was further utilized to discriminate the HCT&#8208;116 p53&#8722;/&#8722; from HCT&#8208;116 in vivo.







Abstract
NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, KC8, which exhibits excellent tumor&#8208;targeting ability and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using KC8, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, KC8 was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5&#8208;Fu. This study provides a new tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.

     alt="An Activatable NIR Fluorescent Probe for NAD(P)H and Its Application to the Real-Time Monitoring of p53 Abnormalities In Vivo"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of NAD(P)H in mitochondria in living colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) was demonstrated to be highly co-related to p53 abnormality for the first time by employing a selective NIR fluorescent probe KC8 for NAD(P)H. Due to its NIR emission (745&#8197;nm) and excellent tumor-targeting character, KC8 was enriched in tumor region when administered intravenously, which was further utilized to discriminate the HCT-116 p53&#8722;/&#8722; from HCT-116 in vivo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, &lt;b&gt;KC8&lt;/b&gt;, which exhibits excellent tumor-targeting ability and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using &lt;b&gt;KC8&lt;/b&gt;, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;KC8&lt;/b&gt; was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5-Fu. This study provides a new tool for real-time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&#8220;Our team had a big challenge: how do we simulate Gleevec dissociation that would take millions of years with ordinary MD simulations, within a more practical few days or weeks? &#8230; We made the whole protocol robust and automatic, and released it as open&#8208;source software which can now be used by others in the scientific community.&#8220; Find out more about the Tiwary&#8211;Seeliger collaboration for predictive pharmacodynamics.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Tiwary group, University of Maryland, College Park (USA) and the Seeliger group, Stony Brook University, New York (USA).

Through all&#8208;atom enhanced molecular dynamics simulations guided by statistical mechanics and information theory, they were able to explain the mechanistic basis of this perplexing observation.

         <title>Charge Makes a Difference: Molecular Ionic Bismuth Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged molecular bismuth species encompass cationic and anionic complexes with organic and inorganic ligand spheres as well as ligand&#8208;free molecular clusters. This review provides an overview of their syntheses, structures, and bonding modes. It outlines how the heavy metal bismuth, with its capability of forming non&#8208;toxic compounds, can be understood as the key towards unique reactivity and sustainable applications.







Abstract
Key challenges in modern synthetic chemistry include the design of reliable, selective, and more sustainable synthetic methods, as well as the development of promising candidates for new materials. Molecular bismuth compounds offer valuable opportunities as they show an intriguing spectrum of properties that is yet to be fully exploited: a soft character, a rich coordination chemistry, the availability of a broad variety of oxidation states (at least +V to &#8722;I) and formal charges (at least +3 to &#8722;3) at the Bi atoms, and reversible switching between multiple oxidation states. All this is paired with the status of a non&#8208;precious (semi&#8722;)metal of good availability and a tendency towards low toxicity. Recent findings show that some of these properties only come into reach, or can be substantially optimized, when charged compounds are specifically addressed. In this review, essential contributions to the synthesis, analyses, and utilization of ionic bismuth compounds are highlighted.

         <title>Turning the Inert Element Zinc into an Active Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Zn&#8722;N4 sites mediate transfer of electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to dissolved oxygen (DO). Self&#8208;oxidation of pollutants is realized along with PMS oxidation into singlet oxygen (1O2) and DO reduction into superoxide radicals (O2&#8901;&#8722;) for catalytic oxidation of contaminants. Resource consumption and residual sulfate anion (SO42&#8722;) formation are reduced.







Abstract
Amongst various Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the zinc (Zn)&#8208;related SACs have been barely reported due to the fully occupied 3d10 configuration of Zn2+ being inactive for the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Herein, the inert element Zn is turned into an active single&#8208;atom catalyst (SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC) for Fenton&#8208;like chemistry by forming an atomic Zn&#8722;N4 coordination structure. The SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC shows admirable Fenton&#8208;like activity in organic pollutant remediation, including self&#8208;oxidation and catalytic degradation by superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2). Experimental and theoretical results unveiled that the single&#8208;atomic Zn&#8722;N4 site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration PMS toward dissolved oxygen (DO) to actuate DO reduction into O2&#8901;&#8722; and successive conversion into 1O2. This work inspires an exploration of efficient and stable Fenton&#8208;like SACs for sustainable and resource&#8208;saving environmental applications.

         <title>Lithium Aluminium Hydride and Metallic Iron: A Powerful Team in Alkene and Arene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium aluminium hydride is well&#8208;known as a stoichiometric reducing agent for ketones. In combination with finely divided Fe0 it is a powerful catalyst for hydrogenation of challenging alkenes or even arenes. The actual catalyst is a thermal decomposition product of LiAlH4 and Fe0. The preactivated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst is also active under mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar).







Abstract
Alkenes that normally do not react with LiAlH4 (3&#8208;hexene, cyclohexene, 1&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexene), can be reduced to the corresponding alkanes by a mixture of LiAlH4 and Fe0 (the iron was activated by Metal&#8208;Vapour&#8208;Synthesis). This alkene&#8208;to&#8208;alkane conversion with a stoichiometric quantity of LiAlH4/Fe0 does not need quenching with water or acids, implying that both H's originate from LiAlH4. The LiAlH4/Fe0 combination is also a remarkably potent cooperative catalyst for hydrogenation of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes and benzene or toluene. An induction period of circa two hours and the minimally required temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C, suggests that the actual catalyst is a combination of Fe0 and the decomposition product of LiAlH4 (LiH and Al0). A thermally pre&#8208;activated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst did not need an induction time and is also active at room temperature and 1&#8197;bar H2. A combination of AliBu3 and Fe0 is an even more active hydrogenation catalyst. Without pre&#8208;activation, tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes like Me2C=CMe2 and toluene could be fully hydrogenated.

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Desulfurization Method Reminiscent of Aquatic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be efficiently achieved under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer by micromolar concentrations of iron. The desulfurization mechanism likely involves iron(III) species produced through the oxidation of iron(II)&#8208;carbonate complexes by molecular oxygen and is reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters.







Abstract
One pillar of protein chemical synthesis based on the application of ligation chemistries to cysteine is the group of reactions enabling the selective desulfurization of cysteine residues into alanines. Modern desulfurization reactions use a phosphine as a sink for sulfur under activation conditions involving the generation of sulfur&#8208;centered radicals. Here we show that cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be effected efficiently by micromolar concentrations of iron under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer, that is using conditions that are reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters. Therefore, our work shows that chemical processes taking place in aquatic systems can be adapted to a chemical reactor for triggering a complex chemoselective transformation at the protein level, while minimizing the resort to harmful chemicals.

         <title>Insights into the Role of Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photobase in Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in (sp3)C&#8722;H Oxygenation of Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation of oxazolidinones to corresponding oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones is enabled by mpg&#8208;CN, a carbon nitride photocatalyst, using oxygen gas as an oxidant. The reaction proceeds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. The mechanism of this transformation is established by photocatalytic experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) is a transition metal free semiconductor that mediates a variety of photocatalytic reactions. Although photoinduced electron transfer is often postulated in the mechanism, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a more favorable pathway for substrates possessing X&#8722;H bonds. Upon excitation of an (sp2)N&#8208;rich structure of g&#8208;CN with visible light, it behaves as a photobase&#8212;it undergoes reductive quenching accompanied by abstraction of a proton from a substrate. The results of modeling allowed us to identify active sites for PCET&#8212;the &#8216;triangular pockets&#8217; on the edge facets of g&#8208;CN. We employ excited state PCET from the substrate to g&#8208;CN to selectively cleavethe endo&#8208;(sp3)C&#8722;H bond in oxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;ones followed by trapping the radical with O2. This reaction affords 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones. Measurement of the apparent pKa value and modeling suggest that g&#8208;CN excited state can cleave X&#8722;H bonds that are characterized by bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) &#8776;100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymerization Accompanying Chirality Transfer in Heterostructures via Living Chain Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of tetraphenylethylene containing glycine (TPE&#8208;G) and/or d&#8208;/l&#8208;alanine moieties not only leads to the formation of supramolecular multi&#8208;blocks copolymers (BCPs; tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;blocks) by chain&#8208;growth process, but also transfers chirality at the seed end.







Abstract
We report the unique synthesis of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with controllable chirality using kinetically adjusted seeded supramolecular copolymerization in THF and DMSO (99&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v). Tetraphenylethylene (d&#8208; and l&#8208;TPE) derivatives bearing d&#8208; and l&#8208;alanine side chains formed thermodynamically favored chiral products via a kinetically trapped in monomeric state with a long lag phase. In contrast, achiral TPE&#8208;G containing glycine moieties did not form a supramolecular polymer owing to the energy barrier in its kinetically trapped state. We show that the copolymerization of the metastable states of TPE&#8208;G not only enables the generation of supramolecular BCPs by the seeded living growth method, but also transfers chirality at the seed ends. This research demonstrates the generation of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C block patterns accompanying chirality transfer via seeded living polymerization.

         <title>Allosterically Regulated Guest Binding Determines Framework Symmetry for an FeII4L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic cages are an important class of synthetic hosts, which are able to mimic the structural adaptability and allosteric regulation of naturally occurring systems. A low&#8208;symmetry FeII4L4 tetrahedral cage reported here was able to adapt its geometry from S4 to C3 or T symmetry upon guest binding; multiple binding sites allowed the host to simultaneously bind distinct guests with negative allostery.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of a flexible tritopic aniline and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;formylpyridine subcomponents around iron(II) templates gave rise to a low&#8208;spin FeII4L4 capsule, whereas a high&#8208;spin FeII3L2 sandwich species formed when a sterically hindered 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;formylpyridine was used. The FeII4L4 cage adopted a new structure type with S4 symmetry, having two mer&#8208;&#916; and two mer&#8208;&#581; metal vertices, as confirmed by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The flexibility of the face&#8208;capping ligand endows the resulting FeII4L4 framework with conformational plasticity, enabling it to adapt structurally from S4 to T or C3 symmetry upon guest binding. The cage also displayed negative allosteric cooperativity in simultaneously binding different guests within its cavity and at the apertures between its faces.

         <title>Reducing Overpotential of Solid&#8208;State Sulfide Conversion in Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving kinetics of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion in sulfur cathodes can enhance sulfur utilization and promote Coulombic efficiency of secondary metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, fundamental mechanisitic understanding of the solid&#8208;state conversion in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries remains to be achieved. Here, taking potassium&#8208;sulfur batteries as a model system, we for the first time report the reducing overpotential of solid&#8208;state K2S3 to K2S conversion via the meta&#8208;stable S2&#8208;3 intermediates on a range of transition metal single&#8208;atom catalytic sulfur hosts. The resultant catalytic sulfur host containing Cu single atoms demonstrate high discharge capacities of 1,595 and 1226 mAh g&#8208;1 at specific current densitieis of 335 and 1675 mA g&#8208;1, respectively, with stable Coulombic efficiency of ~100% during cycling. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and density functional theory computations reveal that the Cu single atom catalyst exhibits a relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding during sulfur redox conversion, resulting in low overpotential of solid&#8208;state K2S3&#8208;K2S conversion and high sulfur utilization. The elucidation of reaction mechanism of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion can direct the exploration of highly efficient metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimension Engineering of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 1D Molecular Crystals into Unusual 2D and 3D Zigzag Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate an innovative technique to achieve organic 2D and 3D waveguides with peculiar shapes from an acicular, light&#8208;stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular crystal, (2Z,2&#8217;Z)&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;(anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diyl)bis(2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacrylonitrile), Ant&#8208;CF3. The greenish&#8208;yellow fluorescent (FL) Ant&#8208;CF3 molecular crystals exhibit laser power&#8208;dependent permanent mechanical bending in 2D and 3D. Investigation of a single&#8208;crystal using spatially&#8208;resolved Raman/FL/electron microscopy, and theoretical calculations revealed photothermal (Z,E)/(E,E) isomerization&#8208;assisted transition from crystalline to amorphous phase at the laser&#8208;exposed regions. This phenomenon facilitates the dimension engineering of a 1D crystal waveguide into a 2D waveguide on a substrate or a 3D waveguide in free space. The presented technique has broader implications in organic photonics and other crystal&#8208;related technologies at large.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Copper Photoredox Catalysts for Iminyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binap&#8208;ligated copper dimer has been heterogenized on a pillar&#8208;layered MOF surface for the first time using a hydroxamic acid linker. This MOF&#8208;supported dimeric copper photocatalyst demonstrates much higher activity and recyclability than its homogeneous counterparts in intra&#8208; and intermolecular radical reactions of N&#8208;acyloxy imidates and O&#8208;acyl oximes.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light copper photocatalysis has recently emerged as a viable technology for building sustainable synthetic processes. To broaden the applications of phosphine&#8208;ligated copper(I) complexes, we describe herein an effective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported copper(I) photocatalyst for multiple iminyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions. Due to site isolation, the heterogenized copper photosensitizer has a significantly higher catalytic activity than its homogeneous counterpart. Using a hydroxamic acid linker to immobilize copper species on MOF supports affords the heterogeneous catalysts with high recyclability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification sequence on MOF surfaces allows for the preparation of previously unavailable monomeric copper species. Our findings highlight the potential of using MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalytic systems to address fundamental challenges in the development of synthetic methodologies and mechanistic investigations of transition&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Augmenting the Performance of Hydrogenase for Aerobic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via Solvent Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are shown to be superior solvents for solar hydrogen generation using natural hydrogenase enzymes. This &#8220;inDEStructible&#8221; system demonstrates that DES&#8208;based engineered solvents stabilise hydrogenase towards oxygen and enable efficient H2 generation in air.







Abstract
This work showcases the performance of [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen generation in a variety of organic&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. Despite its well&#8208;known sensitivity towards air and organic solvents, the hydrogenase shows remarkable performance under an aerobic atmosphere in these solvents when paired with a TiO2 photocatalyst. Tuning the water content further increases hydrogen evolution activity to a TOF of 60&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 and quantum yield to 2.3&#177;0.4&#8201;% under aerobic conditions, compared to a TOF of 4&#8197;s&#8722;1 in a purely aqueous solvent. Contrary to common belief, this work therefore demonstrates that placing natural hydrogenases into non&#8208;natural environments can enhance their intrinsic activity beyond their natural performance, paving the way for full water splitting using hydrogenases.

         <title>The Rigid Core and Flexible Surface of Amyloid Fibrils Probed by Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Spectroscopy of Aromatic Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rock&#8208;solid amyloid fibrils? Aromatic ring flips are a hallmark of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; in proteins. But does the infinitely long &#946;&#8208;sheet structure of amyloids allow for such motions? In their Article, Becker et&#8197;al. apply specific isotope labeling and solid&#8208;state NMR to two amyloid fibrils to demonstrate that the motion of aromatic rings strongly differs between the core and the surface of the fibril.







Abstract
Aromatic side chains are important reporters of the plasticity of proteins, and often form important contacts in protein&#8211;protein interactions. We studied aromatic residues in the two structurally homologous cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid fibrils HET&#8208;s, and HELLF by employing a specific isotope&#8208;labeling approach and magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning NMR. The dynamic behavior of the aromatic residues Phe and Tyr indicates that the hydrophobic amyloid core is rigid, without any sign of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; over hundreds of milliseconds at least. Aromatic residues exposed at the fibril surface have a rigid ring axis but undergo ring flips on a variety of time scales from nanoseconds to microseconds. Our approach provides direct insight into hydrophobic&#8208;core motions, enabling a better evaluation of the conformational heterogeneity generated from an NMR structural ensemble of such amyloid cross&#8208;&#946; architecture.

In their Article, Becker &lt;i&gt;et&#8197;al&lt;/i&gt;. apply specific isotope labeling and solid-state NMR to two amyloid fibrils to demonstrate that the motion of aromatic rings strongly differs between the core and the surface of the fibril.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatic side chains are important reporters of the plasticity of proteins, and often form important contacts in protein&#8211;protein interactions. We studied aromatic residues in the two structurally homologous cross-&#946; amyloid fibrils HET-s, and HELLF by employing a specific isotope-labeling approach and magic-angle-spinning NMR. The dynamic behavior of the aromatic residues Phe and Tyr indicates that the hydrophobic amyloid core is rigid, without any sign of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; over hundreds of milliseconds at least. Aromatic residues exposed at the fibril surface have a rigid ring axis but undergo ring flips on a variety of time scales from nanoseconds to microseconds. Our approach provides direct insight into hydrophobic-core motions, enabling a better evaluation of the conformational heterogeneity generated from an NMR structural ensemble of such amyloid cross-&#946; architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Trifluoromethoxylation of Propargyl Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, great challenges still remained for direct asymmetric trifluoromethoxylation with only two successful reports since the first discovery. Here, by subtly tuning the leaving group, protecting group, ligand structure, reaction temperature, solvent and base, we finally realized a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates for the first time.







Abstract
Due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and high lipophilicity of trifluoromethoxy group (OCF3), methods for introducing OCF3 into organic molecules are in high demand. However, the research area of direct enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation is still in the embryonic stage, with limited enantioselectivity and/or reaction types. Here, we describe the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates using trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS) as the trifluoromethoxy source in up to 96&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Closing the Cycle as It Begins: Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Iodobiaryls via Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the Catellani reactions has enabled the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls starting from aryl iodides and bromides. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation (32 examples and 6 subsequent derivatizations), a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halide complexes.







Abstract
Despite the advances in the field of carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, the straightforward catalytic access to selectively functionalized iodoaryls remains a challenge. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls from aryl iodides and bromides by palladium/norbornene catalysis. This new example of Catellani reaction features the initial cleavage of a C(sp2)&#8722;I bond, followed by the key formation of a palladacycle through ortho C&#8722;H activation, the oxidative addition of an aryl bromide and the ultimate restoration of the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond. A large variety of valuable o&#8208;iodobiaryls has been synthesized in satisfactory to good yields and their derivatization have been described too. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation, a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the key reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halides complexes.

         <title>A Bioinspired Free&#8208;Standing 2D Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Polyimine Membrane for Selective Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of flexible dibenzo&#8208;14&#8208;crown&#8208;4&#8208;ether moieties into a rigid framework has led to the generation of a bioinspired ultrathin membrane that allows proton transport. The interconnected hydrogen&#8208;bond/water networks and ideal binding sites result in the highly selective and fast transportation of protons through the membrane.







Abstract
Biological proton channels play important roles in the delicate metabolism process, and have led to great interest in mimicking selective proton transport. Herein, we designed a bioinspired proton transport membrane by incorporating flexible 14&#8208;crown&#8208;4 (14C4) units into rigid frameworks of polyimine films by an interfacial Schiff base reaction. The Young's modulus of the membrane reaches about 8.2&#8197;GPa. The 14C4 units could grab water, thereby forming hydrogen bond&#8208;water networks and acting as jumping sites to lower the energy barrier of proton transport. The molecular chains present a vertical orientation to the membrane, and the ions travel between the quasi&#8208;planar molecular sheets. Furthermore, the 14C4 moieties could bond alkali ions through host&#8211;guest interactions. Thus, the ion conductance follows H+&#8811;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+, and an ultrahigh selectivity of H+/Li+ (ca. 215) is obtained. This study provides an effective avenue for developing ion&#8208;selective membranes by embedding macrocycle motifs with inherent cavities.

         <title>The Self&#8208;Association of the KRAS4b Protein is Altered by Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Composition and Electrostatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of the peripheral membrane protein KRAS4b promotes oncogenic signaling. Using nanodiscs to enable paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments, we show that KRAS4b dimers associate through distinct conformations depending on lipid composition. Both states involve the &#945;4&#8208;&#945;5 interface, however increasing phosphatidylserine concentration alters the relative protomer orientation, shifting R135 electrostatic interactions from D153 to E168.







Abstract
KRAS is a peripheral membrane protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways, and is mutated in &#8776;30&#8201;% of cancers. Transient self&#8208;association of KRAS is essential for activation of the downstream effector RAF and oncogenicity. The presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the membrane was shown to promote KRAS self&#8208;assembly, however, the structural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed nanodisc bilayers of defined lipid compositions, and probed the impact of PS concentration on KRAS self&#8208;association. Paramagnetic NMR experiments demonstrated the existence of two transient dimer conformations involving alternate electrostatic contacts between R135 and either D153 or E168 on the &#8220;&#945;4/5&#8208;&#945;4/5&#8221; interface, and revealed that lipid composition and salt modulate their dynamic equilibrium. These dimer interfaces were validated by charge&#8208;reversal mutants. This plasticity demonstrates how the dynamic KRAS dimerization interface responds to the environment, and likely extends to the assembly of other signaling complexes on the membrane.

         <title>C&#8722;N Coupling through Hydroaminoalkylation on a Single&#8208;Atom Rh Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singly dispersed Rh1O4 sites anchored on the support of a heterogeneous catalyst are highly active and selective for hydroaminoalkylation at 110&#8201;&#176;C. Different from a Rh molecular catalyst, this Rh single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalyst can be readily separated from products and be reused in multiple runs with similar catalytic performance.







Abstract
C&#8722;N coupling is significant for the synthesis of fine chemicals toward various applications. Hydroaminoalkylation of olefins is a tandem reaction of C&#8722;N coupling involving first the formation of an aldehyde through hydroformylation of an olefin and then the production of amine through reductive amination of the aldehyde. Here we report a stable, supported catalyst of singly dispersed Rh1 atoms anchored on TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles designated as Rh1/P25. Its high activity for C&#8722;N coupling was demonstrated by six hydroaminoalkylations of olefins and amines with selectivity of higher than 90% for producing tertiary amines. The singly dispersed Rh1O4 on P25 exhibit activity and selectivity for hydroaminoalkylation comparable or even higher than some reported molecular catalysts. In contrast to molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8208;based single&#8208;atom Rh heterogeneous catalysis (Rh1/P25) can be readily separated from reactants and products, reused for multiple runs of hydroaminoalkylation, and recycled with a low cost.

Here we report a stable, supported catalyst of singly dispersed Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; atoms anchored on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (P25) nanoparticles designated as Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P25. Its high activity for C&#8722;N coupling was demonstrated by six hydroaminoalkylations of olefins and amines with selectivity of higher than 90% for producing tertiary amines. The singly dispersed Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on P25 exhibit activity and selectivity for hydroaminoalkylation comparable or even higher than some reported molecular catalysts. In contrast to molecular catalysts, the Rh-based single-atom Rh heterogeneous catalysis (Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P25) can be readily separated from reactants and products, reused for multiple runs of hydroaminoalkylation, and recycled with a low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Frustration in Super&#8208;Ionic Conductors Unraveled by the Density of Atomistic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of atomistic states (DOAS) quantitatively characterizes the onset and degree of disordering, reveals the energetics of local disorder, and elucidates how the frustration enhances diffusion, through the broadening and overlapping of the energy levels of atomistic states. The DOAS is generally applicable analytics for unraveling fundamental mechanisms in complex atomistic systems and for guiding material design.







Abstract
The frustration in super&#8208;ionic conductors enables their exceptionally high ionic conductivities, which are desired for many technological applications including batteries and fuel cells. A key challenge in the study of frustration is the difficulties in analyzing a large number of disordered atomistic configurations. Using lithium super&#8208;ionic conductors as model systems, we propose and demonstrate the density of atomistic states (DOAS) analytics to quantitatively characterize the onset and degree of disordering, reveal the energetics of local disorder, and elucidate how the frustration enhances diffusion through the broadening and overlapping of the energy levels of atomistic states. Furthermore, material design strategies aided by the DOAS are devised and demonstrated for new super&#8208;ionic conductors. The DOAS is generally applicable analytics for unraveling fundamental mechanisms in complex atomistic systems and guiding material design.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Switchable Selective Oxidations of Styrene Over Covalent Triazine Frameworks in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free covalent triazine frameworks were designed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. By deactivation of photogenerated H2O2, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99&#8201;% conversion and selectivity. Epoxidation of styrene with peroxymonocarbonate as an initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate produced styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76&#8201;% and near quantitative conversion.







Abstract
Using photocatalytic oxidation to convert basic chemicals into high value compounds in environmentally benign reaction media is a current focus in catalytic research. The challenge lies in gaining controllability over product formation selectivity. We design covalent triazine frameworks as heterogeneous, metal&#8208;free, and recyclable photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. Selectivity in product formation was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species. Using the same photocatalyst, by deactivation of photogenerated H2O2, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99&#8201;% conversion and over 99&#8201;% selectivity as a single product. The highly challenging and sensitive epoxidation of styrene was carried out by creating peroxymonocarbonate as an initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate, which led to formation of styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76&#8201;% with near quantitative conversion. This study demonstrates a preliminary yet interesting example for simple control over switchable product formation selectivity for challenging oxidation reactions of organic compounds in pure water.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Negative Hydrogen Production Strategy: CO2 Selective Capture with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure is reported. A universal photocatalysis reaction was adopted as driving force and carbonate&#8208;intercalated layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with electron storage/release function were employed as adsorption catalysts.







Abstract
We reported a strategy of carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure. For this purpose, carbonate&#8208;type CuxMgyFez layered double hydroxide (LDH) was preciously constructed, and then a photocatalysis reaction of interlayer CO32&#8722; reduction with glycerol oxidation was performed as driving force to induce the electron storage on LDH layers. With the participation of pre&#8208;stored electrons, CO2 was captured to recover interlayer CO32&#8722; in presence of H2O, accompanied with equivalent H2 production. During photocatalysis reaction, Cu0.6Mg1.4Fe1 exhibited a decent CO evolution amount of 1.63&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and dihydroxyacetone yield of 3.81&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In carbon&#8208;negative H2 production process, it showed an exciting CO2 capture quantity of 1.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and H2 yield of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Besides, this system possessed stable operation capability under simulated flu gas condition with negligible performance loss, exhibiting application prospect.

         <title>Easy Access to Diverse Multiblock Copolymers with On&#8208;Demand Blocks via Thioester&#8208;Relayed In&#8208;Chain Cascade Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization is developed for preparation of diverse multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures.







Abstract
Multiblock copolymers are envisioned as promising materials with enhanced properties and functionality compared with their diblock/triblock counterparts. However, the current approaches can construct multiblock copolymers with a limited number of blocks but tedious procedures. Here, we report a thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization strategy for the easy preparation of multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups with on&#8208;demand numbers are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides independently and concurrently to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures. The compositions, number of blocks, and block degree of polymerization can be easily regulated. This strategy can offer easy access to a library of multiblock copolymers with &#8776;100 blocks in only 2 to 4&#8197;steps.

Highly oriented sub&#8208;200&#8208;nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 and NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework membranes showed unprecedented CO2/N2 and H2/CO2 separation performances, respectively. Their formation was aided by the preparation of uniform triangular&#8208;shaped UiO&#8208;66 nanosheet seeds via anisotropic etching, confined counter&#8208;diffusion&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth, and the use of a ZrS2 source during epitaxial growth.







Abstract
Concurrent regulation of crystallographic orientation and thickness of zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) membranes is challenging but promising for their performance enhancement. In this study, we pioneered the fabrication of uniform triangular&#8208;shaped, 40&#8197;nm thick UiO&#8208;66 nanosheet (NS) seeds by employing an anisotropic etching strategy. Through innovating confined counter&#8208;diffusion&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 165&#8197;nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 membrane was prepared. The significant reduction in thickness and diffusion barrier in the framework endowed the membrane with unprecedented CO2 permeance (2070 GPU) as well as high CO2/N2 selectivity (35.4), which surpassed the performance limits of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polycrystalline MOF membranes. In addition, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 180&#8197;nm&#8208;thick NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 membrane showing superb H2/CO2 separation performance with H2 permeance of 1230 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of 41.3, was prepared with the above synthetic procedure.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Two&#8208;Color Coincidence Detection of Unlabeled alpha&#8208;Synuclein Aggregates</title>

         <dc:description>
Pathological protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders are difficult to characterise using current methods. We present a novel single&#8208;molecule detection method to specifically detect and characterise &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates at picomolar concentrations. We demonstrate the ability to detect aggregates in biologically relevant samples.







Abstract
Protein misfolding and aggregation into oligomeric and fibrillar structures is a common feature of many neurogenerative disorders. Single&#8208;molecule techniques have enabled characterization of these lowly abundant, highly heterogeneous protein aggregates, previously inaccessible using ensemble averaging techniques. However, they usually rely on the use of recombinantly&#8208;expressed labeled protein, or on the addition of amyloid stains that are not protein&#8208;specific. To circumvent these challenges, we have made use of a high affinity antibody labeled with orthogonal fluorophores combined with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics and single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy to specifically detect &#945;&#8208;synuclein, the protein associated with Parkinson's disease. We used this approach to determine the number and size of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates down to picomolar concentrations in biologically relevant samples.

         <title>ECNU&#8208;13: A High&#8208;Silica Zeolite with Three&#8208;Dimensional and High&#8208;Connectivity Multi&#8208;Pore Structures for Selective Alkene Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;silica zeolite skeleton, ECNU&#8208;13, was designed and synthesized by a phase&#8208;discrimination strategy. The crystallization process was directed by the regulation of single four&#8208;membered ring (s4r) units to give rise to two kinds of polymorphs with 3&#8208;dimensional high&#8208;connectivity multi&#8208;pore systems. The ECNU&#8208;13 zeolite demonstrated high propene selectivity in cracking of 1&#8208;butene, with minimized formation of aromatics.







Abstract
A high&#8208;silica zeolite ECNU&#8208;13 (Si/Al=23) with a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pore system and a nanosized morphology has been developed, consisting of multitudes of 10&#8208;membered ring (10&#8208;R) medium pores and one set of 8&#8208;R small pores. A phase&#8208;discrimination strategy was proposed to synthesize ECNU&#8208;13 by regulating the gel compositions and nucleation processes that were used for preparing 12&#8208;R large&#8208;pore germanosilicate IM&#8208;20 with the known UWY topology. The crystallization was directed towards forming one set of single four&#8208;ring (s4r) composite building units together with one set of double four&#8208;ring (d4r) rather than two different types of d4r units in IM&#8208;20. The electron crystallographic investigations elucidated that the ECNU&#8208;13 structure was composed of two kinds of polymorphs as a result of distinct atomic positionings in s4r units. In catalytic cracking of 1&#8208;butene, ECNU&#8208;13 exhibited high propene selectivity (55.6&#8201;%) and propene to ethylene molar ratio (&gt;4.7) superior to well&#8208;studied conventional ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast One&#8208;Handed Helix Induction and Its Static Helicity Memory in a Poly(biphenylylacetylene) with a Catalytic Amount of Chiral Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and subsequent static helicity memory in a poly(biphenylylacetylene) were achieved using a catalytic amount of nonracemic ammonium salts with non&#8208;coordinating tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate as a counter anion. Helix induction relies on crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like specific intermolecular complex formation of the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants with chiral ammonium in specific aromatic solvents.







Abstract
We report an ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and subsequent static helicity memory in poly(biphenylylacetylene) (PBPA&#8208;A) assisted by a catalytic amount of nonracemic ammonium salts comprised of non&#8208;coordinating tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (BArF&#8722;) as a counter anion. The remarkable acceleration of the helix&#8208;induction rate in PBPA&#8208;A accompanied by the significant amplification of the asymmetry relies on the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants, which can gain access to enfold the chiral ammoniums in a crown&#8208;ether manner in specific aromatic solvents, leading to ultra&#8208;fast helicity induction, which is completed within 30&#8197;s. In aromatic solvents, helicity memory is lost rapidly, but is quite stable in long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. The best use of specific solvents for helicity induction and static helicity memory, respectively, provides a highly sensitive chirality sensing system toward a small amount of chiral amines and amino acids when complexed with BArF&#8722;.

         <title>Crystallization&#8208;driven Nanoparticle Crystalsomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystallization of an end&#8208;functionalized polymer and nanoparticles (NPs) leads to the formation of hollow spherical assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization, the translational symmetry is broken in NPCs. This strategy paves the way to attaining exquisite morphological control of NP assemblies with broken translation symmetry.







Abstract
Nanoparticle (NP) assembly has been extensively studied, and a library of NP superstructures has been synthesized. These intricate structures show unique collective optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. In this work, we report a bottom&#8208;up approach for fabricating spherical gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assemblies that mimic colloidosomes. Co&#8208;crystallization of lipoic acid&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and AuNPs in solution via a self&#8208;seeding method led to the formation of hollow spherical NP assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the spherical shape, the translational symmetry of PEO crystals is broken in NPCs, which can be attributed to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization. This was confirmed by tuning the NPC morphology via varying the self&#8208;seeding temperature, crystallization temperature, and PEO molecular weight.

&lt;p&gt;Co-crystallization of an end-functionalized polymer and nanoparticles (NPs) leads to the formation of hollow spherical assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization, the translational symmetry is broken in NPCs. This strategy paves the way to attaining exquisite morphological control of NP assemblies with broken translation symmetry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticle (NP) assembly has been extensively studied, and a library of NP superstructures has been synthesized. These intricate structures show unique collective optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. In this work, we report a bottom-up approach for fabricating spherical gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assemblies that mimic colloidosomes. Co-crystallization of lipoic acid-end-functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and AuNPs in solution via a self-seeding method led to the formation of hollow spherical NP assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the spherical shape, the translational symmetry of PEO crystals is broken in NPCs, which can be attributed to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization. This was confirmed by tuning the NPC morphology via varying the self-seeding temperature, crystallization temperature, and PEO molecular weight. We envisage that this strategy paves the way to attaining exquisite morphological control of NP assemblies with broken translational symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activating Bi p&#8208;orbitals in Dispersed Clusters of Amorphous BiOx for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining first&#8208;principles calculations and in situ electrochemical conversion experiments, we propose a novel and effective approach to modify the 6p&#8208;orbitals of bismuth by exploiting the properties of atomically dispersed amorphous clusters. In contrast to transition metals, Bi exhibits superior p&#8208;orbital based catalytic activity and selectivity for nitrogen fixation by transferring electrons from the half&#8208;occupied pz into the inert N2 orbital.







Abstract
Catalytic strategies based on main group metals are significantly less advanced than those of transition metal catalysis, leaving untapped areas of potentially fruitful research. We here demonstrate an effective approach for the modulation of Bi 6p energy levels during the construction of atomically dispersed clusters of amorphous BiOx. Bi oxidation state is proposed to strongly affects the nitrogen fixation activity, with the half&#8208;occupied pz orbitals of the Bi2+ ions being highly efficient toward electron injection into the inert N2 molecule. With sufficient catalytic sites to adsorb and activate N2, the bonding between N2 and catalyst is able to be in situ identified. The catalyst shows an outstanding Faraday efficiency (&#8776;30&#8201;%) and high yield (&#8776;113&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat) in NH3 production, outperforming most of the existing catalysts in aqueous solution. These results lay the basis for developing the potential of p&#8208;block elements for catalysis of multi&#8208;electron reactions.

         <title>Efficient Reverse Intersystem Crossing in Carbene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide TADF Emitters via an Intermediate Triplet State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism underlying reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) dynamics in a carbene&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;carbazolyl TADF emitter is unravelled. Efficient rISC on a picosecond timescale occurs on a geometry of perpendicular ligand orientation mediated by a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state. This process is followed by a return to a co&#8208;planar ligand orientation with a high fluorescence rate.







Abstract
The mechanism behind reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) in metal&#8208;based TADF emitters is still under debate. Thermal rISC necessitates small singlet/triplet energy gaps as realized in donor&#8208;acceptor systems with charge&#8208;transfer excited states. However, their associated spin&#8208;orbit couplings are too small to account for effective rISC. Here, we report the first nonadiabatic dynamics simulation of the rISC process in a carbene&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;carbazolyl TADF emitter. Efficient rISC on a picosecond time scale is demonstrated for an initial triplet minimum geometry that exhibits a perpendicular orientation of the ligands. The dynamics involves an intermediate higher&#8208;lying triplet state of metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character (3MLCT), which enables large spin&#8208;orbit couplings with the lowest singlet charge transfer state. The mechanism is completed in the S1 state, where the complex can return to a co&#8208;planar coordination geometry that presents high fluorescence efficiency.

         <title>Alkaline&#8208;Stable Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes with Barium [2.2.2]Cryptate Cations: The Importance of High Binding Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex of [2.2.2]cryptand and Ba2+ is used as a novel cationic functional group for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membrane applications. The complex synergistically has high binding constant, excellent alkaline stability, and a stable main&#8208;group&#8208;metal center.







Abstract
The stability of cationic functional groups is one of the key factors determining lifetime of alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AAEMs) and the AAEM&#8208;based electrochemical devices. Main&#8208;group metal and crown ether complexes are stable cations due to the absence of degradation pathways including nucleophilic substitution, Hofmann elimination, and cation redox. However, the binding strength, a key feature for AAEM applications, is overlooked in previous work. We herein propose the use of barium [2.2.2]cryptate ([Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+) as a new cationic functional group for AAEMs due to its extremely strong binding (109.5&#8197;M&#8722;1 in water at 25&#8201;&#176;C). The [Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+&#8208;AAEMs with polyolefin backbones remain stable after treatment in 15&#8197;M KOH at 60&#8201;&#176;C for over 1500&#8197;hours. More importantly, these AAEMs are successfully applied in water electrolyzers, and an anolyte&#8208;feeding switch method is designed to further reveal the influence of binding constants.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric Bi0.6Sb0.4Te: Elimination of Detrimental Band Inversion in BiTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual synergistic effect of Sb doping in BiTe is reported that eliminates the detrimental band inversion by weakening the spin&#8208;orbit coupling, thus leading to a rare overlap of conduction band and valence band that significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient. In addition, this effect enhances the carrier mobility owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#915;&#8208;A direction in the first Brillouin zone.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric materials are the key to miniaturizing refrigeration equipment and have great scientific and social implications, yet their application is hindered by their extreme scarcity. BiTe exhibiting strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling peaks ZT at 600&#8197;K. Herein, we discover the synergy effect of Sb doping in BiTe that eliminates the detrimental band inversion and leads to an overlap of conduction band (CB) and valence band that significantly increases the S from 33 to 124&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;K&#8722;1. In addition, this effect enhances the &#956; from 58 to 92&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#915;&#8208;A in the first Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Sb doping increases the anharmonicity, shortens the phonon lifetime and lowers &#954;lat. Finally, Se/Sb codoping further optimizes the ZT to 0.6 at 300&#8197;K, suggesting that Bi0.6Sb0.4Te1&#8722;ySey is a potential room&#8208;temperature TE material.

         <title>Highly Selective Photoelectroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethanol over Graphene/Silicon Carbide Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial layer in the graphene/silicon carbide composite allows the facile transfer of photogenerated electrons from the silicon carbide substrate to the active sites of graphene, resulting in efficient CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling for ethanol production. This catalyst showed a near&#8208;perfect ethanol selectivity of&gt;99&#8201;% at an exceedingly high CO2 conversion rate of 17.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and stability in ambient CO2 photoelectroreduction.







Abstract
Using sunlight to produce valuable chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide (CO2), i.e., artificial photosynthesis (AP) is a promising strategy to achieve solar energy storage and a negative carbon cycle. However, selective synthesis of C2 compounds with a high CO2 conversion rate remains challenging for current AP technologies. We performed CO2 photoelectroreduction over a graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) catalyst under simulated solar irradiation with ethanol (C2H5OH) selectivity of&gt;99&#8201;% and a CO2 conversion rate of up to 17.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with sustained performance. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicated an optimal interfacial layer to facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the SiC substrate to the few&#8208;layer graphene overlayer, which also favored an efficient CO2 to C2H5OH conversion pathway.

         <title>A Compartmentalized Nanoreactor Formed by Interfacial Hydrogelation for Cascade Enzyme Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compartmented Burr&#8208;NCs@GlSOD nanoreactor was constructed by a self&#8208;confined catalysis strategy. The specific catalytic mechanism of the laccase&#8208;like superactivity induced hydrogelation and core&#8211;shell cascade laccase&#8208;SOD and SOD&#8208;Fenton catalytic therapy were explored. The work introduces a versatile means for nanointerface functionalization and biological construction of simulated enzymes with comparable activity and specificity to natural enzymes.







Abstract
Some cellular enzymatic pathways are located within a single organelle, while most others involve enzymes that are located within multiple compartmentalized cellular organelles to realize the efficient multi&#8208;step enzymatic process. Herein, bioinspired by enzyme&#8208;mediated biosynthesis and biochemical defense, a compartmented nanoreactor (Burr&#8208;NCs@GlSOD) was constructed through a self&#8208;confined catalysis strategy with burr defect&#8208;engineered molybdenum disulfide/Prussian blue analogues (MoS2/PBA) and an interfacial diffusion&#8208;controlled hydrogel network. The specific catalytic mechanism of the laccase&#8208;like superactivity induced hydrogelation and cascade enzyme catalytic therapy were explored. The confined hydrogelation strategy introduces a versatile means for nanointerface functionalization and provides insight into biological construction of simulated enzymes with comparable activity and also the specificity to natural enzymes.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H/O2 Dual Activation and Macrocyclization: Synthesis and Evaluation of Pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole Grafted Macrocyclic Inhibitors for Influenza H1N1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here is an unprecedented and practical RhIII&#8208;catalyzed acylmethylation macrocyclization via C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The reaction mode derives from a three&#8208;component coupling which differs from established olefination and alkylation paths. DFT calculations and control experiments revealed the mechanism of this unique C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The phenotypic screening result indicated that some macrocyclic products have a potent anti&#8208;H1N1 bioactivity.







Abstract
The development of environment&#8208;friendly, step economic couplings to generate structurally diverse macrocyclic compounds is highly desirable but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by the C&#8722;H oxidation mechanism of cytochromes&#8197;P450, an unprecedented and practical RhIII&#8208;catalyzed acylmethylation macrocyclization via C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation has been developed by us. The process of macrocyclization is facilitated by a synergic coordination from pyridine and ester group. Interestingly, the reaction mode derives from a three&#8208;component coupling which differs from established olefination and alkylation paths. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments revealed the mechanism of this unique C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The newly achieved acylmethylation macrocyclic products and their derivatives showed a potent anti&#8208;H1N1 bioactivity, which may provide an opportunity for the discovery of novel anti&#8208;H1N1 macrocyclic leading compounds.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mediated Spinel Octahedral Structures for Elevated Performances of Li&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;atomic metals could render highly active Co3+ centers exposed through the electron promoter effect and also separate the active sites, thereby regulating the morphology of Li2O2 to elevated performances of Li&#8208;oxygen battery. We found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Li&#8208;oxygen batteries have attracted much attention due to its ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity, but the discharge product Li2O2 is easy to accumulate, leading to low battery stability. Here, we demonstrate a series of high&#8208;efficiency cathode catalysts of Co3O4 loaded with single&#8208;atomic metals (M=Ru, Pd, Pt, Au, Ir). The single&#8208;atomic metal could substitute the central Co atom in the octahedral coordination structure and maintain the structural stability; benefiting from the electron promoter effect, rendering more highly active Co3+ exposed, providing rich nucleation sites for Li2O2 deposition. And the loaded M atoms could separate the active Co3+ centers, thereby regulating the dispersion of Li2O2 to obtained a sheet&#8208;like morphology, which could facilitate its decomposition in the subsequent charge cycle. Our work found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Kopsaporine, Kopsinol and Kopsiloscine&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified strategy for the synthesis of Kopsia monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is described. Key transformations developed are an intramolecular Pummerer rearrangement induced nucleophilic cyclization/aza&#8208;Prins cyclization to construct the highly functional hexahydrocarbazole skeleton, an iridium complex mediated radical addition to fuse the aspidofractine framework, and an IBX oxidation to introduce the &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone moiety.







Abstract
Kopsia alkaloids represent a complex class of natural products bearing a polycyclic ring system with two or three consecutive quaternary carbon centers. In this article, we report the first total synthesis of Kopsaporine related alkaloids. Features of our structure&#8208;unit&#8208;based strategy are an intramolecular Pummerer rearrangement induced nucleophilic cyclization/aza&#8208;Prins cyclization to construct the highly functional hexahydrocarbazole skeleton, an olefin migration vinylogous alkylation to establish the C20 all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, an iridium complex mediated radical addition to fuse the aspidofractine framework, an unprecedented IBX oxidation to introduce the &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone moiety, and a bioinspired retro&#8208;Aldol/Aldol reaction to convert kopsaporine to kopsiloscine&#8197;A.

&lt;p&gt;A unified strategy for the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Kopsia&lt;/i&gt; monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is described. Key transformations developed are an intramolecular Pummerer rearrangement induced nucleophilic cyclization/aza-Prins cyclization to construct the highly functional hexahydrocarbazole skeleton, an iridium complex mediated radical addition to fuse the aspidofractine framework, and an IBX oxidation to introduce the &#945;-hydroxyketone moiety.

         <title>Identification of Active Sites Formed on Cobalt Oxyhydroxide in Glucose Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides are well&#8208;known catalysts for biomass electrooxidation to produce valuable chemicals. However, identification of active site remains elusive, owing to the structural complexity under reaction conditions. In this work, a suite of operando spectroscopies and theoretical calculations were combined, unveiling two types of reducible Co3+&#8208;oxo species as the active sites in cobalt oxyhydroxide for glucose electrooxidation.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based oxyhydroxides are efficient catalysts in biomass electrooxidation towards fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;free production of valuable chemicals. However, identification of active sites remains elusive. Herein, using cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as the archetype and the electrocatalyzed glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) as the model reaction, we track dynamic transformation of the electronic and atomic structure of the catalyst using a suite of operando and ex situ techniques. We reveal that two types of reducible Co3+&#8208;oxo species are afforded for the GOR, including adsorbed hydroxyl on Co3+ ion (&#956;1&#8208;OH&#8722;Co3+) and di&#8208;Co3+&#8208;bridged lattice oxygen (&#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;Co3+). Moreover, theoretical calculations unveil that &#956;1&#8208;OH&#8722;Co3+ is responsible for oxygenation, while &#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;Co3+ mainly contributes to dehydrogenation, both as key oxidative steps in glucose&#8208;to&#8208;formate transformation. This work provides a framework for mechanistic understanding of the complex near&#8208;surface chemistry of metal oxyhydroxides in biomass electrorefining.

         <title>Synergistic Fe&#8722;Se Atom Pairs as Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts Boost Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional Fe&#8722;Se atom pair electrocatalyst shows a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance, and the Fe&#8722;Se/NC based cable&#8208;structure Zn&#8208;air batteries deliver an ultra&#8208;high cycling performance of 741&#8197;h @1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a negligible activity delay at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic interactions of Fe and Se sites.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully construct bifunctional electrocatalysts by synthesizing atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;Se atom pairs supported on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;Se/NC). The obtained Fe&#8722;Se/NC shows a noteworthy bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance with a low potential difference of 0.698&#8197;V, far superior to that of reported Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts. The theoretical calculations reveal that p&#8208;d orbital hybridization around the Fe&#8722;Se atom pairs leads to remarkably asymmetrical polarized charge distributions. Fe&#8722;Se/NC based solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC) present stable charge/discharge of 200&#8197;h (1090&#8197;cycles) at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is 6.9&#8197;times of ZABs&#8722;Pt/C+Ir/C. At extremely low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC displays an ultra&#8208;robust cycling performance of 741&#8197;h (4041&#8197;cycles) at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is about 11.7&#8197;times of ZABs&#8722;Pt/C+Ir/C. More importantly, ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC could be operated for 133&#8197;h (725&#8197;cycles) even at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <dc:description>
Under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide, a (phosphino)diazomethyl anion salt (1) undergoes a facile N2/CO exchange reaction giving a (phosphino)ketenyl anion salt (2). Reactivity investigations showed that the ketenyl anion can be a versatile synthon for derivatives of ketene, enolate, acrylate and acrylimidate moieties.







Abstract
Under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO), a (phosphino)diazomethyl anion salt [[P]&#8208;CN2][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)(THF)] (1) ([P]=[(CH2)(NDipp)]2P; 18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) undergoes a facile N2/CO exchange reaction giving the (phosphino)ketenyl anion salt [[P]&#8208;CCO][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)] (2). Oxidation of 2 with elemental Se affords the (selenophosphoryl)ketenyl anion salt [P](Se)&#8208;CCO][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)] (3). These ketenyl anions feature a strongly bent geometry at the P&#8208;bound carbon and this carbon atom is highly nucleophilic. The electronic structure of the ketenyl anion [[P]&#8208;CCO]&#8722; of 2 is examined by theoretical studies. Reactivity investigations demonstrate 2 as a versatile synthon for derivatives of ketene, enolate, acrylate and acrylimidate moieties.

         <title>Annealing in Argon Universally Upgrades the Na&#8208;Storage Performance of Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathodes by Creating Bulk Oxygen Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach of annealing in argon atmosphere rather than conventional air is for the first time, demonstrated to comprehensively upgrade the Na&#8208;storage performance (including specific capacity, operating voltage, and cycling durability) of Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes by creating bulk oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are extremely promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their high capacities and cost effectiveness, while the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion and low operating potential of Mn redox largely hinder their practical applications. Herein, we reveal that annealing in argon rather than conventional air is a universal strategy to comprehensively upgrade the Na&#8208;storage performance of Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes. Bulk oxygen vacancies are introduced via this method, leading to reduced Mn valence, lowered Mn 3d&#8208;orbital energy level, and formation of the new&#8208;concept Mn domains. As a result, the energy density of the model P2&#8208;Na0.75Mg0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode increases by &#8776;50&#8201;% benefiting from the improved specific capacity and operating potential of Mn redox. The Mn domains can disrupt the cooperative J&#8211;T distortion, greatly promoting the cycling stability.

     alt="Annealing in Argon Universally Upgrades the Na-Storage Performance of Mn-Based Layered Oxide Cathodes by Creating Bulk Oxygen Vacancies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general approach of annealing in argon atmosphere rather than conventional air is for the first time, demonstrated to comprehensively upgrade the Na-storage performance (including specific capacity, operating voltage, and cycling durability) of Mn-based layered oxide cathodes by creating bulk oxygen vacancies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manganese-rich layered oxide cathodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are extremely promising for large-scale energy storage owing to their high capacities and cost effectiveness, while the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion and low operating potential of Mn redox largely hinder their practical applications. Herein, we reveal that annealing in argon rather than conventional air is a universal strategy to comprehensively upgrade the Na-storage performance of Mn-based oxide cathodes. Bulk oxygen vacancies are introduced via this method, leading to reduced Mn valence, lowered Mn 3&lt;i&gt;d-&lt;/i&gt;orbital energy level, and formation of the new-concept Mn domains. As a result, the energy density of the model P2-Na&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode increases by &#8776;50&#8201;% benefiting from the improved specific capacity and operating potential of Mn redox. The Mn domains can disrupt the cooperative J&#8211;T distortion, greatly promoting the cycling stability. This exciting finding opens a new avenue towards high-performance Mn-based oxide cathodes for SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling for the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides under mild conditions is reported. The enantioselective alkenylation/arylation of racemic secondary phosphine oxides with alkenyl/aryl bromides provided P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides with high enantioselectivities of up to 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
A general and mild nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling for synthesizing P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides has been developed. The asymmetric alkenylation/arylation of racemic secondary phosphine oxides with alkenyl/aryl bromides generated P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides with high yields and enantioselectivities. Various functional groups were tolerated, and the applications of this method were demonstrated through late&#8208;stage functionalization and product transformations.

         <title>Recycling Valuable Metals from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Carbothermal Shock Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbothermal shock (CTS) method with high heating and cooling rates, high temperatures (up to &#8776;2200&#8201;&#176;C), and ultrafast reaction times of &#8776;20&#8197;s is utilized for recycling spent cathode materials. Li can be selectively leached through water leaching with an efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;%. Ni, Co, and Mn are recovered by dilute acid leaching with efficiencies &gt;98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Pyrometallurgy technique is usually applied as a pretreatment to enhance the leaching efficiencies in the hydrometallurgy process for recovering valuable metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, traditional pyrometallurgy processes are energy and time consuming. Here, we report a carbothermal shock (CTS) method for reducing LiNi0.3Co0.2Mn0.5O2 (NCM325) cathode materials with uniform temperature distribution, high heating and cooling rates, high temperatures, and ultrafast reaction times. Li can be selectively leached through water leaching after CTS process with an efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;%. Ni, Co, and Mn are recovered by dilute acid leaching with efficiencies &gt;98&#8201;%. The CTS reduction strategy is feasible for various spent cathode materials, including NCM111, NCM523, NCM622, NCM811, LiCoO2, and LiMn2O4. The CTS process, with its low energy consumption and potential scale application, provides an efficient and environmentally friendly way for recovering spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

A reversible photo&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal structural transformation was achieved for a mononuclear dysprosium&#8208;anthracene compound to form a 1D coordination polymer. This compound displays photoswitchable SMM properties with reduced effective spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier, narrowed butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop, and decreased blocking temperature.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM) hold great promise for future switching and memory devices. Herein, we report a dysprosium phosphonate [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma)2(4&#8208;hpy)2] (1Dy), which features a supramolecular framework containing layers of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and pillars of &#960;&#8211;&#960; interacted anthracene units. The photocycloaddition reaction of anthracene pairs led to a rapid and reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8211;SC) structural transition to form the 1D coordination polymer [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma2)(4&#8208;hpy)2]n (2Dy), accompanied by photoswitchable SMM properties with the reduction of effective energy barrier by half and the narrowing of the butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop. The diluted sample showed a photo&#8208;induced switch of the blocking temperature (TB) from 3.8&#8197;K for 1Dy@Y to 2.6&#8197;K for 2Dy@Y. This work may inspire the construction of lanthanide&#8208;based molecular materials with targeted photo&#8208;responsive magnetic properties.

         <title>Studying Regioisomer Formation in the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorination of Cyclic Vinyl Triflates: Evidence for in situ Ligand Modification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study was conducted to investigate the regioisomer formation in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates. Results suggested that the TESCF3 additive unlocked an alternative reaction pathway involving a usual in situ ligand dearomatization. This new mechanism prevented the formation of Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne intermediates and significantly increased the regioselectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic fluorination reactions are important methods for the synthesis of fluoroarenes and fluoroalkenes. However, these reactions can generate a mixture of regioisomeric products that are often difficult to separate. While investigating the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates, we observed that the addition of a substoichiometric quantity of TESCF3 significantly improved the regioselectivity of the reaction. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational study on the mechanism of this transformation focusing on the role of TESCF3. The poor regioselectivity of the reaction in the absence of additives results from the formation of LPd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes (L=biaryl monophosphine ligand). When TESCF3 is added to the reaction mixture, the generation of the Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes is diminished by an unexpected pathway involving the dearomatization of the ligand by nucleophilic attack from a trifluoromethyl anion (CF3&#8722;).

         <title>Tuning Local Coordination Environments of Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Properties for Selective Colorimetric Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for achieving the multi&#8208;enzymatic performance of SAzymes through regulating the coordination number of heterogeneous manganese single&#8208;atom catalysts (MnSA&#8722;Nx&#8722;C) is designed and implemented. A series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C SAzyme is successfully built for the specific recognition of biological molecules.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are promising in next&#8208;generation nanozymes, nevertheless, how to rationally modulate the microenvironment of SAzymes with controllable multi&#8208;enzyme properties is still challenging. Herein, we systematically investigate the relationship between atomic configuration and multi&#8208;enzymatic performances. The constructed MnSA&#8722;N3&#8208;coordinated SAzymes (MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C) exhibits much more remarkable oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and glutathione oxidase&#8208;like activities than that of MnSA&#8722;N4&#8722;C. Based on experimental and theoretical results, these multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like behaviors are highly dependent on the coordination number of single atomic Mn sites by local charge polarization. As a consequence, a series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C SAzymes is successfully built for specific recognition of biological molecules. These findings provide atomic&#8208;level insight into the microenvironment of nanozymes, promoting rational design of other demanding biocatalysts.

         <title>Enhancement of Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution Activity of 2D &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bipyridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Protonation</title>

         <dc:description>
The introduction of bipyridine motifs in the 2D conjugated covalent organic framework, 2D&#8208;c&#8208;COF, creates dedicated photoactive sites. Through a simple post&#8208;protonation strategy, the photo&#8208;generated electron&#8211;hole separation of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;COF was significantly enhanced and a hydrophilic pore channel was generated, which synergically lead to a significant improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution represents a promising and sustainable technology. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based photocatalysts have received growing attention. A 2D fully conjugated ethylene&#8208;linked COF (BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF) was fabricated with a dedicated designed active site. The introduced bipyridine sites enable a facile post&#8208;protonation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the actives sites, which results in a largely improved charge&#8208;separation efficiency and increased hydrophilicity in the pore channels synergically. After modulating the degree of protonation, the optimal BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;PCOF exhibits a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 15.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, which surpasses the biphenyl&#8208;based COF 6 times. By using different types of acids, the post&#8208;protonation is proved to be a potential universal strategy for promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution. This strategy would provide important guidance for the design of highly efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.

         <title>&#8220;Pore&#8208;Hopping&#8221; Ion Transport in Cellulose&#8208;Based Separator Towards High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>

Immersion curing of a cellulose&#8208;based separator (CP) with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) results in a cellulose&#8208;based composite separator (CP@PPC) for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; ion transport mechanism in CP@PPC allows a high Na+ transference number. PPC enhances the mechanical properties of the separator and the battery thermal safety, further promotes ion transport and improves the overall performance of the battery.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Cellulose is an attractive material for sustainable separators, but some key issues still exist affecting its application. Herein, a cellulose&#8208;based composite separator (CP@PPC) was prepared by immersion curing of cellulose&#8208;based separators (CP) with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC). With the assistance of PPC, the CP@PPC separator is able to operate the cell stably at high voltages (up to 4.95&#8197;V). The &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; ion transport mechanism in CP@PPC opens up extra Na+ migration paths, resulting in a high Na+ transference number (0.613). The separator can also tolerate folding, bending and extreme temperature under certain circumstances. Full cells with CP@PPC reveal one&#8208;up capacity retention (96.97&#8201;%) at 2C after 500 cycles compared to cells with CP. The mechanism highlights the merits of electrolyte analogs in separator modification, making a rational design for durable devices in advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of a Continuous ZIF&#8208;67 Membrane for Efficient Azeotropic Organic Solvent Mixture Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To prepare zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes, an ultrathin hydroxy salt precursor layer with high reactivity was constructed in situ. Its excellent induction effect allowed the formation of a continuous and ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 membrane on various surfaces at room temperature. Due to its pore size and preferential adsorption of polar molecules, the membrane gave excellent separation of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.







Abstract
Azeotropic organic solvent mixture separation is common in the chemical industry but extremely difficult. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) shows great potential in organic solvent mixture separation due to its rigid micropores and excellent stability. However, due to the fast nucleation rate, it is a great challenge to prepare continuous ZIF&#8208;67 membrane layers with ultrathin thickness. In this study, a hydroxy salt layer with high inducible activity was synthesized as a precursor on different porous substrates to prepare ZIF&#8208;67 membranes at room temperature. The precursor layer enables an intact ZIF&#8208;67 membrane with an ultrathin thickness of 176&#177;12&#8197;nm. The experimental and simulation results confirmed that the size sieving through the pore windows and the preferential adsorption of polar solvent molecules provide the ZIF&#8208;67 membrane an unprecedented separation performance such as high separation factors and fluxes, for four types of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.

         <title>Tuning Hole Transport Properties via Pyrrole Derivation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost hole transport materials T3, featuring a substituted pyrrole core and triphenylamine peripheral arms, have been designed and synthesized for high performance perovskite solar cells. The capability of functionalization in the final synthetic step provides an efficient way to tune energy levels and other properties of T3 materials.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) with high hole mobility, good band alignment and ease of fabrication are highly desirable for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we designed and synthesized novel organic HTMs, named T3, which can be synthesized in high yields with commercially available materials, featuring a substituted pyrrole core and triphenylamine peripheral arms. The capability of functionalization in the final synthetic step provides an efficient way to obtain a variety of T3&#8208;based HTMs with tunable energy levels and other properties. Among them, fluorine&#8208;substituted T3 (T3&#8208;F) exhibits the best band alignment and hole extraction properties, leading to PSCs with outstanding PCEs of 24.85&#8201;% and 24.03&#8201;% (certified 23.46&#8201;%) for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1&#8197;cm2, respectively. The simple structure and tunable performance of T3 can inspire further optimization for efficient PSCs.

         <title>Heterostructures with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Long&#8208;lasting Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy strategy for achieving sustained efficient tumor treatment was developed by synthesizing Janus&#8208;like Fe@Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O heterostructures with built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs). Driven by the BIEFs, electrons in the Fe0 core were continuously transferred to the surface to reduce &#8801;Cu2+ to &#8801;Cu+, thus ensuring a sustained Fenton&#8208;like reaction and &#8901;OH production and forcing tumor cells to undergo apoptosis through ERK signal activation.







Abstract
Sustained signal activation by hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) has great significance, especially for tumor treatment, but remains challenging. Here, a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF)&#8208;driven strategy was proposed for sustainable generation of &#8901;OH, thereby achieving long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy (LCDT). As a proof of concept, a novel Janus&#8208;like Fe@Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O heterogeneous catalyst was designed and synthesized, in which the BIEF induced the transfer of electrons in the Fe core to the surface, reducing &#8801;Cu2+ to &#8801;Cu+, thus achieving continuous Fenton&#8208;like reactions and &#8901;OH release for over 18&#8197;h, which is approximately 12 times longer than that of Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O and 72 times longer than that of Cu2O nanoparticles. In vitro and in vivo antitumor results indicated that sustained &#8901;OH levels led to persistent extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signal activation and irreparable oxidative damage to tumor cells, which promoted irreversible tumor apoptosis. Importantly, this strategy provides ideas for developing long&#8208;acting nanoplatforms for various applications.

         <title>Regioisomeric Benzidine&#8208;Fullerenes: Tuning of the Diverse Hole&#8208;Distribution to Influence Charge Separation Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three regioisomeric benzidine&#8208;fullerenes have been synthesized. Following charge separation (CS), the para&#8208;isomer manifests hole&#8208;delocalization, promoting ultrafast CS; while meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;isomers cause hole&#8208;localization, contributing to long&#8208;lived CS state. This work reveals the influence of regioisomerism on charge distribution and CS.







Abstract
Understanding the influence of molecular structure on charge distribution and charge separation (CS) provides essential guidance for optoelectronic materials design. Here we propose a regioisomeric strategy to tune the diverse hole&#8208;distribution, and probe the influence on CS patterns. Para&#8208;, meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;substituted benzidine&#8208;fullerene, named 1&#8201;p, 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o are designed. Following CS, hole&#8208;delocalization occurs in 1&#8201;p, while hole&#8208;localization exists in 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o. The rates of charge separation (4.02&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) and recombination (9.8&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1) of 1&#8201;p is about 20 and 12&#8197;times faster than 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o, indicating that para&#8208;determined delocalization promotes ultrafast CS, while meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;generated localization contributes to long&#8208;lived CS states. Computational analysis further implies that localization results from the destruction of electronic conjugation for 1&#8201;m, and limitation of conformational relaxation for 1&#8201;o. Given that the universality and simplicity of regional isomerism, this work opens up new thoughts for molecular design with tunable charge separation patterns.

         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles has been established via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition of indole&#8208;based enaminones with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters. This study provides a new strategy for the highly selective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles and shows the successful application of such skeletons in medicinal and synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
This study establishes the first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloadditions of indole&#8208;based enaminones as novel platform molecules with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, where de novo indole&#8208;ring formation is involved. Using this new strategy, various axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles were synthesized in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 87&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee). More importantly, this class of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles exhibited some degree of cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and was derived into axially chiral phosphine ligands with high catalytic activity. This study provides a new strategy for enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles using asymmetric organocatalysis and is the first to realize the applications of such scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>A Hydrolyzable Supra&#8208;amphiphile as a Marangoni Self&#8208;Propulsion Fuel for Efficient Macroscopic Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible Schiff base has been used as the basis for a fuel for continuous Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion. Excessive interfacial aggregation of the amphiphilic molecules is avoided by timely hydrolyzation to surface&#8208;inactive species, which prolongs the motion lifetime by over 10&#8197;times. The fuel can efficiently propel &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm components for the energy&#8208;dissipative self&#8208;assembly of precisely aligned structures.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm components is important for achieving all&#8208;scale ordering with requirements of extra energy for motion and interaction of components. Marangoni flows caused by surfactants on water provide appropriate energy but have limited lifetimes because of the inevitable interfacial aggregation and difficult decomposition of aggregated covalent surfactants that inactivate Marangoni effects. Here we have synthesized a supra&#8208;amphiphile Marangoni &#8220;fuel&#8221;&#8212;sodium&#8208;4&#8208;(benzylideneamino) benzenesulfonate (SBBS)&#8212;that can be hydrolyzed in a timely manner to a species without surface activity to extend the motion time by 10&#8208;fold. The motion was optimized at pH=2 by a fine equilibrium between the releasing and removal of interfacial SBBS, leading to the self&#8208;assembly of millimeter&#8208;scaled ordered dimers. The underlying mechanism was interpreted by motion analyses and simulation. This strategy provides an active solution to self&#8208;assembly at the &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm scale, as well as interactive ideas between miniaturized chemical robots.

&lt;p&gt;A reversible Schiff base has been used as the basis for a fuel for continuous Marangoni self-propulsion. Excessive interfacial aggregation of the amphiphilic molecules is avoided by timely hydrolyzation to surface-inactive species, which prolongs the motion lifetime by over 10&#8197;times. The fuel can efficiently propel &#956;m-to-mm components for the energy-dissipative self-assembly of precisely aligned structures.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Amorphous NiFe Oxide&#8208;based Nanoreactors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous NiFe oxide&#8208;based nanoreactors were synthesized and applied as water oxidation electrocatalysts. The nanoreactor structure changes the catalyst&#8242;s spatial curvature and mass transfer, enriching OH&#8722; on the catalyst surface and inside the channels, so that a high current density is obtained. In addition, the combination of amorphousness and nanoreactors synergistically promotes oxygen evolution, achieving the effect of &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221;.







Abstract
Synergy engineering is an important way to enhance the kinetic activity of oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Here, we fabricated NiFe amorphous nanoreactor (NiFe&#8208;ANR) oxide as OER electrocatalysts via a mild self&#8208;catalytic reaction. Firstly, the amorphousness helps transform NiFe&#8208;ANR into highly active hydroxyhydroxides, and its many fine&#8208;grain boundaries increase active sites. More importantly, as proved by experiments and finite element analysis, the nanoreactor structure alters the spatial curvature and the mass transfer over the catalyst, thereby enriching OH&#8722; in the catalyst surface and inner part. Thus, the catalyst with the structure of amorphous nanoreactors gained excellent activity, far superior to the NiFe catalyst with the structure of crystalline nanoreactor or amorphous non&#8208;nanoreactor. This work provides new insights into the applications and mechanisms of amorphousness and nanoreactors, embodying the &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergy of crystalline state and morphology.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Probe for Nuclear ATP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first small&#8208;molecule probe for nuclear ATP is reported. The probe, a ZnII complex of a push&#8208;full type benzocoumarin dye bearing a dipicolylamine ligand, reversibly binds to nuclear ATP with a turn&#8208;on fluorescence response. Using the probe, we observed markedly higher levels of nuclear ATP in organ tissues of a tumor&#8208;xenografted mouse by two&#8208;photon microscopy, which is ascribed to aggressive cell progression in the mitosis phase.







Abstract
Fluorescence monitoring of ATP in different organelles is now feasible with a few biosensors developed, which, however, show low sensitivity, limited biocompatibility, and accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule ATP probes that alleviate those limitations thus have received much attention recently, leading to a few ATP probes that target several organelles except for the nucleus. We disclose the first small&#8208;molecule probe that selectively detects nuclear ATP through reversible binding, with 25&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH&#8197;7.4 and excellent selectivity against various biologically relevant species. Using the probe, we observed 2.1&#8211;3.3&#8208;fold and 3.9&#8211;7.8&#8208;fold higher nuclear ATP levels in cancerous cell lines and tumor tissues compared with normal cell lines and tissues, respectively, which are explained by the higher nuclear ATP level in the mitosis phase. The probe has great potential for studying nuclear ATP&#8208;associated biology.

         <title>Tricrilactones A&#8211;H, Potent Antiosteoporosis Macrolides with Distinctive Ring Skeletons from Trichocladium crispatum, an Alpine Moss&#8208;Associated Fungus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides, tricrilactones A&#8211;H, was isolated from the moss&#8208;derived fungus T.&#8197;crispatum. Intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments provided evidence for their proposed biosynthetic pathway. The compounds were found to be potent antiosteoporosis agents in vivo, whereby tricrilactone G (top right&#8208;hand structure) restored bone formation&#8208;resorption homeostasis and promoted cartilage and skeletal development.







Abstract
Tricrilactones A&#8211;H (1&#8211;8), a new family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides featuring collectively five unique ring skeletons, were isolated from a hitherto unexplored fungus, Trichocladium crispatum. Compounds 1 and 7 contain two unconventional bridged (aza)tricyclic core skeletons, 2, 3, 5, and 6 share an undescribed tetracyclic 9/5/6/6 ring system, 4 bears an uncommon 9/5/6/10/3&#8208;fused pentacyclic architecture, and 8 is a dimer bridged by an unexpected C&#8722;C linkage. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, quantum chemical calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Importantly, the absolute configuration of the highly flexible side chain of 1 was resolved by the asymmetric synthesis of its four stereoisomers. The intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments facilitated the proposal of the biosynthetic pathway for these macrolides. In addition, their antiosteoporosis effects were evaluated in vivo (zebrafish).

         <title>Unequal Perylene Diimide Twins in a Quadruple Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a quadruple assembly (POP)4, two identical perylene diimide (PDI) units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550). The two groups of spectrally distinct PDI units provide a rapid gradient&#8208;directed energy transfer from P520 to P550.







Abstract
Natural light&#8208;harvesting (LH) systems can divide identical dyes into unequal aggregate states, thereby achieving intelligent &#8220;allocation of labor&#8221;. From a synthetic point of view, the construction of such kinds of unequal and integrated systems without the help of proteinaceous scaffolding is challenging. Here, we show that four octatetrayne&#8208;bridged ortho&#8208;perylene diimide (PDI) dyads (POPs) self&#8208;assemble into a quadruple assembly (POP)4 both in solution and in the solid state. The two identical PDI units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550) in (POP)4. The two extreme pools of PDI chromophores were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. To interpret the formation of the discrete quadruple assembly, we also developed a two&#8208;step cooperative model. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations indicate the existence of multiple couplings within and across P520 and P550, which can satisfactorily describe the photophysical properties of the unequal quadruple assembly. This finding is expected to help advance the rational design of dye stacks to emulate functions of natural LH systems.

         <title>Spatial Localization of Two Enzymes at Pickering Emulsion Droplet Interfaces for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different enzymes were precisely localized at the inner and outer interfaces of Pickering emulsion droplets with the aid of an asymmetrically modified mesoporous nanosheet. This unique system exhibited significantly enhanced cascading efficiency in oxidation reactions by creating reaction microenvironments appropriate for the different enzymes and enabling efficient intermediate transportation at the droplet interfaces.







Abstract
Developing biocatalytic cascades in abiological conditions is of utmost significance, but such processes often suffer from low reaction efficiency because of incompatible reaction environments and suppressed intermediate transportation. Herein we report a new type of biocatalytic cascade by localizing two different enzymes separately in the outer and inner interfacial layers of Pickering emulsion droplets. This versatile approach enables the localization of two enzymes in their preferred reaction microenvironments and simultaneously in nanoscale proximity of each other. The thus&#8208;designed interfacial biocatalytic cascades show outstanding catalytic efficiency in alkene epoxidation and thioether oxidation with in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions, 6.9&#8211;13.6 times higher than the catalytic efficiency of the free enzymes in solution and their multi&#8208;enzymatic counterparts. The remarkable interfacial effect of Pickering droplets was found to be responsible for the significantly enhanced cascading efficiency.

         <title>Stable Operation of Lithium Metal Batteries with Aggressive Cathode Chemistries at 4.9&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries pose severe challenges for the matching of electrolytes with electrodes. The modified electrolyte in this work shows excellent stability against highly active lithium metal anode and aggressive high&#8208;voltage cathode. It presents great potential for practical use considering fire retardancy and low&#8208;temperature tolerance, ensuring a long life span without safety hazards even under extreme conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) pose severe challenges for the matching of electrolytes with aggressive electrodes, especially at low temperatures. Here, we report a rational modification of the Li+ solvation structure to extend the voltage and temperature operating ranges of conventional electrolytes. Ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;dipole interactions as well as the electrochemical window of solvents were tailored to improve oxidation stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, robust and elastic B and F&#8208;rich interphases are formed on both electrodes. Such optimization enables Li||LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells (90.2&#8201;% retention after 400 cycles) and Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cells (74.0&#8201;% retention after 200 cycles) to cycle stably at an ultra&#8208;high voltage of 4.9&#8197;V. Moreover, NCM622 cells deliver a considerable capacity of 143.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, showing great potential for practical uses. The proposed strategy sheds light on further optimization for high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>In situ Interweaved Binder Framework Mitigating the Structural and Interphasial Degradations of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ interweaved binder with multiple binder&#8208;cathode chemical interactions and robust mechanical strength enables a strong cathode framework. By coordinating with transition&#8208;metal ions and preventing the continuous electrolyte attack, the cathode structural integrity and the chemistry/architecture of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase are improved, thus enabling high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading high&#8208;nickel cathodes with excellent stability.







Abstract
The practical viability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes is compromised by the interphasial and structural degradations. Herein, we demonstrate that by applying an in situ interweaved binder, the cycling stability of high&#8208;nickel cathodes can be significantly improved. Specifically, the results show that the resilient binder network immobilizes the transition&#8208;metal ions, suppresses electrolyte oxidative decomposition, and mitigates cathode particles pulverization, thus resulting in suppressed cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode chemical crossover and ameliorated chemistry and architecture of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. Pouch full cells with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes achieve 0.02&#8201;% capacity decay per cycle at 1&#8197;C rate over 1&#8201;000 deep cycles at 4.4&#8197;V (vs. graphite). This work demonstrates a rational structural and compositional design strategy of polymer binders to mitigate the structural and interphasial degradations of high&#8208;Ni cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Intermolecular Charge Separation of Cationic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high contrast to other dimerization modes of ionic radicals, the cationic radical Pyr&#8208;BA.+ demonstrates unparalleled spontaneous symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation, generating the mixed valence complex of Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8722;q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Such a unique phenomenon sheds new light on fundamental concepts and uncharted material science.







Abstract
A quadrupolar compound Pyr&#8208;BA with two pyrrole&#8208;type nitrogen atoms doped externally was prepared in this work. In high contrast with other &#960; ionic radicals, its cationic radical Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+ undergoes unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), generating the mixed valence complex of Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8722;q&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) single&#8208;crystal analysis, absorption and EPR experiments all confirmed that aggregation and lower temperature would help to facilitate this SB&#8208;CS process. Gibbs energy calculations and gauge&#8208;including magnetically induced current simulation both validate that, for Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+, SB&#8208;CS behavior is more favorable than the conventional dimerization mode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows solid single&#8208;crystal evidence for spontaneous SB&#8208;CS between identical ionic radicals. Such a unique phenomenon is of great significance both in terms of fundamental aspects and uncharted material science.

         <title>Directed Evolution of an Iron(II)&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase for Site&#8208;Selective Azidation of Unactivated Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bonds

Directed evolution is used to engineer variants of the dioxygenase SadX that catalyze site&#8208;selective azidation of succinylated amino acids and a succinylated amine as a result of mutations throughout the SadX structure. This result provides a promising starting point for evolving additional variants with activity on structurally distinct substrates and for enabling enzymatic C&#8722;H functionalization with other non&#8208;native functional groups.







Abstract
FeII&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenases and oxygenases can catalyze site&#8208;selective functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds via a variety of C&#8722;X bond forming reactions, but achieving high chemoselectivity for functionalization using non&#8208;native functional groups remains rare. The current study shows that directed evolution can be used to engineer variants of the dioxygenase SadX that address this challenge. Site&#8208;selective azidation of succinylated amino acids and a succinylated amine was achieved as a result of mutations throughout the SadX structure. The installed azide group was reduced to a primary amine, and the succinyl group required for azidation was enzymatically cleaved to provide the corresponding amine. These results provide a promising starting point for evolving additional SadX variants with activity on structurally distinct substrates and for enabling enzymatic C&#8722;H functionalization with other non&#8208;native functional groups.

         <title>Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Nonlinear Optical Switch with a Linearly Tunable Tc Spanning a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a series of isostructural solid&#8208;solution crystals [Ag(NH3)2]2SxSe1&#8722;xO4 that represent the first NLO switch material exhibiting a linearly tunable phase transition temperature, the switching temperature can be linearly tuned from 430 to 356&#8197;K. This originates from a linear decrease in the phase transition energy barrier that is predominantly controlled by the internal energy difference between phases.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) switch materials that turn on/off second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at a phase transition temperature (Tc) are promising for applications in the fields of photoswitching and optical computing. However, precise control of Tc remains challenging, mainly because a linearly tunable Tc has not been reported to date. Herein, we report a unique selenate, tetragonal P
21c [Ag(NH3)2]2SeO4 with a=b=8.5569(2)&#8197;&#197; and c=6.5208(2)&#8197;&#197; that exhibits a strong SHG intensity (1.3&#215;KDP) and a large birefringence (&#916;nobv.=0.08). This compound forms a series of isostructural solid&#8208;solution crystals [Ag(NH3)2]2SxSe1&#8722;xO4 (x=0&#8211;1.00) that exhibit excellent NLO switching performance and an unprecedented linearly tunable 
 spanning 430 to 356&#8197;K. The breaking of localized hydrogen bonds between SeO42&#8722; and the cation triggers a phase transition accompanied by hydrogen bond length changes with increasing x and a linear change in the enthalpy

         <title>Engineered Metallacycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Photosensitizers for Effective Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of high&#8208;performance photosensitizers (PSs) was designed and synthesized using a molecular engineering approach for building blocks of RuII metallacycles. Subsequently, the photosensitizer with the highest reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency, biocompatibility, and phototoxicity index (PI), RuD, was selected for safe and effective photodynamic therapy in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Although metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedicine, their clinical translation is still hindered by their inherent dark toxicity. Herein, we report what to our knowledge is the first example of a molecular engineering approach to building blocks of metallacycles for constructing a series of supramolecular PSs (RuA&#8211;RuD), with the aim of simultaneously reducing dark toxicity and enhancing phototoxicity, and consequently obtaining high phototoxicity indexes (PI). Detailed in vitro investigations demonstrate that RuA&#8211;RuD display high cancer cellular uptake and remarkable antitumor activity even under hypoxic conditions. Notably, RuD exhibited no dark toxicity and displayed the highest PI value (&#8776;406). Theoretical calculations verified that RuD has the largest steric hindrance and the lowest singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST, 0.61&#8197;eV). Further in vivo studies confirmed that RuD allows safe and effective phototherapy against A549 tumors.

         <title>ESIPT&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Mode Photoswitches with Fast Molecular Isomerization in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast photoisomerization of a new photoswitchable molecule through excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer can be clearly characterized by the dual&#8208;mode (color and fluorescence) optical behaviors in the solid state. The good photochromism performance and high&#8208;contrast makes it a highly promising tool in the fields of dual&#8208;mode information encryption and high&#8208;density data storage.







Abstract
Photoswitchable materials have attracted considerable attention in various fields. Developing excellent solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;mode photoswitches is an important but challenging task. Herein, we propose a new strategy to construct an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) inspired photoswitch (DiAH&#8208;pht) that possesses aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features and displays a fast molecular isomerization process characterized by dual&#8208;mode behavior in the solid state. Mechanistic studies indicate that introduction of a bulky group can create a folded molecular conformation that provides adequate volume to facilitate photoisomerization and the enhanced ESIPT effect can boost the isomerization process. The feasibility of our strategy was further demonstrated by the activated photoisomerization performance of the Schiff base derivatives. Furthermore, DiAH&#8208;pht shows good performance in the fields of dual&#8208;mode information encryption and high&#8208;density data storage.

         <title>Inside Cover: Ultra&#8208;fast One&#8208;Handed Helix Induction and Its Static Helicity Memory in a Poly(biphenylylacetylene) with a Catalytic Amount of Chiral Ammonium Salts (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 15/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalytic ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and its static helicity memory in a poly(biphenylylacetylene) were achieved by using chiral ammonium salts, as reported by Katsuhiro Maeda, Eiji Yashima, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202217020). The remarkable acceleration of the helix&#8208;induction rate accompanied by strong chiral amplification relies on crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like specific intermolecular complex formation of the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants with chiral ammonium species.

The application of cellulose separators in sodium&#8208;ion batteries faces several challenges. In their Research Article (e202300258), Xing&#8208;Long Wu and co&#8208;workers prepare a composite separator (CP@PPC) using cellulose paper (CP) cured by impregnation with polypropylene carbonate (PPC). With the assistance of PPC, CP@PPC not only opens up additional Na+ migration paths through a new &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; transport mechanism, but also provides a flexible, safe, and environmentally friendly high&#8208;performance separator.

Covalent triazine frameworks were designed as metal&#8208;free and recyclable photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene into benzaldehyde or styrene oxide. As reported by Kai&#8197;A.&#8197;I. Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202216159), the product formation selectivity was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species in pure water.

         <title>Excited State Mixed&#8208;Valence Complexes: From the Special Pair to the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcitation of the low&#8208;lying metal&#8208;bridge charge transfer (MBCT) transition in the homovalent analogue of the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion generates an excited state mixed&#8208;valence species {Ru(III&#8722;&#948;)}(&#956;&#8208;pz.&#8722;){Ru(II+&#948;)} with a delocalized electronic structure and remarkably long lifetime (2.8&#8197;ns), permitting intermolecular electron transfer and hinting at potential for designs of artificial photosynthetic systems.







Abstract
Compounds and complexes with mixed&#8208;valence electronic ground states, such as the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, have proven to be excellent vehicles through which to study intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer processes. In a recent contribution by Cadranel and co&#8208;workers, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveals photo&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;bridge charge transfer within the homovalent analogue of the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, [{(NH3)5Ru}(&#956;&#8208;pz){Ru(NH3)5}]4+, giving rise to two closely lying excited states with mixed&#8208;valence character, one with a shorter lifetime (&#964;=136&#8197;ps) and weakly&#8208;coupled (Robin&#8208;Day Class II) character, the other a longer&#8208;lived (&#964;=2.8&#8197;ns) configurational isomer with more delocalized electronic structure. Electron transfer reactions from the longer&#8208;lived species demonstrate analogies with the photo&#8208;induced reactions of the photosynthetic special pair, suggesting this state as a reference system for excited state mixed&#8208;valency, and a framework from which to explore photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer and Spin&#8208;Flip States: Thriving as Complements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer excited states have been at the focus of inorganic photochemistry for decades, together with their strongest opponents: detrimental metal&#8208;centered states. In recent years, interest in metal&#8208;centered spin&#8208;flip states was reignited by a new type of photoactive chromium(III) complex. This Review delineates similarities and unique features of charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states, from fundamentals to applications.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes with photoactive charge&#8208;transfer excited states are pervasive throughout the literature. In particular, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), with its metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer emission, has been established as a key complex. Meanwhile, interest in so&#8208;called spin&#8208;flip metal&#8208;centered states has risen dramatically after the molecular ruby [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd=N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) led to design principles to access strong, long&#8208;lived emission from photostable chromium(III) complexes. This Review contrasts the properties of emissive charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states by using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ as prototypical examples. We discuss the relevant excited states, the tunability of their energy and lifetimes, and their response to external stimuli. Finally, we identify strengths and weaknesses of charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states in applications such as photocatalysis and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Regulating Spin States in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. Regulating spin state of active centers could influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. This minireview summarizes approaches for the characterization and regulation of spin states as a basis for the design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable transition metal oxides catalysts for energy conversion processes such as oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction is one of the key measures to solve the problem of energy shortage. The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. In an octahedral structure of transition metal oxides, the spin state of active centers could be regulated by adjusting the splitting energy and the electron pairing energy. Regulating spin state of active centers could directly modulate the d orbitals occupancy, which influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. In this review, we clarified the significance of regulating spin state of the active centers. Subsequently, we discussed several characterization technologies for spin state and some recent strategies to regulate the spin state of the active centers. Finally, we put forward some views on the future research direction of this vital field.

         <title>Complementary Design in Multicomponent Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction: Beyond the Leverage in Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating distinct yet complementary electronic structures of elements in different blocks, this concept is revolutionary in that it breaks the limitations of scaling relations, synchronously achieving high activity and selectivity for electrochemical nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is promising in place of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for artificial N2 fixation. However, the high activity and selectivity of eNRR are challenging to achieve simultaneously due to the scaling relations. Such &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity has severely restricted eNRR. To overcome this bottleneck, the complementary design of electronic structures in multicomponent electrocatalysts has been recently pursued, aiming to maximize the advantages of each component and optimize the multistep reactions, which has stood at the cutting edge in this aspect. Here, we present a minireview of the design, performance, and mechanism of multicomponent electrocatalysts with complementary electronic structures. We particularly emphasize the interactions between N2 and elements from d&#8208;, p&#8208;, and s&#8208;blocks, which are essential for understanding how these electrocatalysts are beyond the &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity.

Photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction provide a promising way to alleviate energy crisis and environmental issues. This review summarizes recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). In addition, the fundamentals of the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs and several advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the photocatalytic process and mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provide promising solutions to global energy and environmental issues. In recent years, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous solids featuring well&#8208;defined and tailorable structures as well as high surface areas, have captured great interest toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction. In this review, the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs is first discussed. We then summarize the recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over MOF&#8208;based materials and focus on the unique advantage of MOFs for clarifying the structure&#8208;property relationship in photocatalysis. In addition, some representative characterization techniques have been presented to unveil the photocatalytic kinetics and reaction intermediates in MOF&#8208;based systems. Finally, the challenges, and perspectives for future directions are proposed.

         <title>Deacylative Thiolation by Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Fragmentation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach has been developed to realize deacylative thiolation of common ketones, which provides a unique method to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.







Abstract
Herein we report the development of deacylative thiolation of diverse methyl ketones. The reaction is redox&#8208;neutral, and heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free, which provides a new way to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. It also features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, thus allowing late&#8208;stage derivatization. The process benefits from efficient condensation between the activation reagent and ketone substrates, which triggers aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;C fragmentation and rapid radical coupling with thiosulfonates. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Chiral Z&#8208;Allylamides by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Sequential Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric sequential hydrogenations of conjugated enynes have been developed. The precise synthesis of chiral Z&#8208;allylamides has been realized in high activity (up to 1000&#8197;S/C) and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanism experiment and theoretical calculation supported a reasonable cationic CoI/CoIII redox catalytic cycle, and explained the difference in reactivity between Ph&#8208;BPE&#8208;Co and QuinoxP*&#8208;Co.







Abstract
Asymmetric sequential hydrogenations of conjugated enynes have been developed using a Ph&#8208;BPE&#8208;CoI catalyst for the precise synthesis of chiral Z&#8208;allylamides in high activity (up to 1000 substrate/catalyst (S/C)) and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee)). Mechanism experiments and theoretical calculations support a cationic CoI/CoIII redox catalytic cycle. The catalytic activity difference between cobalt complexes of Ph&#8208;BPE and QuinoxP* was explained by the process decomposition of rate&#8208;determining step in the second hydrogenation.

         <title>Correlative Cellular Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Amperometry Show Dose Dependent Changes in Lipid Composition and Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel analytical tools &#8212; single cell amperometry (SCA), intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC), and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) imaging &#8212; were combined to provide a link between the complex etiology of neurodegenerative diseases and lipidomic information.







Abstract
Aberrant functioning of the proteasome has been associated with crucial pathologic conditions including neurodegeneration. Yet, the complex underlying causes at the cellular level remain unclear and there are conflicting reports of neuroprotective to neurodegenerative effects of proteasomal inhibitors such as lactacystin that are utilised as models for neurodegenerative diseases. The conflicting results may be associated with different dose regimes of lactacystin and hence we have performed a dose dependent study of the effects of lactacystin to identify concurrent changes in the cell membrane lipid profile and the dynamics of exocytosis using a combination of surface sensitive mass spectrometry and single cell amperometry. Significant changes of negatively charged lipids were associated with different lactacystin doses that showed a weak correlation with exocytosis while changes in PE and PE&#8722;O lipids showed dose dependent changes correlated with initial pore formation and total release of vesicle content respectively.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;LYTACs for Targeted Degradation of Extracellular and Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer&#8208;LYTACs have been developed by conjugating aptamers to tri&#8208;GaINAc to realize liver&#8208;cell&#8208;specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins. This platform can efficiently and quickly degrade the extracellular protein PDGF and the membrane protein PTK7 through the lysosomal degradation pathway, providing a new method for targeted protein degradation.







Abstract
Recently, lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have emerged as a promising technology that expands the scope of targeted protein degradation to extracellular targets. However, the preparation of chimeras by conjugation of the antibody and trivalent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (tri&#8208;GalNAc) is a complex and time&#8208;consuming process. The large uncertainty in number and position and the large molecular weights of the chimeras result in low internalization efficiency. To circumvent these problems, we developed the first aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (Apt&#8208;LYTAC) to realize liver&#8208;cell&#8208;specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins by conjugating aptamers to tri&#8208;GalNAc. Taking advantage of the facile synthesis and low molecular weight of the aptamer, the Apt&#8208;LYTACs can efficiently and quickly degrade the extracellular protein PDGF and the membrane protein PTK7 through a lysosomal degradation pathway. We anticipate that the novel Apt&#8208;LYTACs will expand the usage of aptamers and provide a new dimension for targeted protein degradation.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Triplet Inversions in Non&#8208;Alternant Hydrocarbons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of molecules displaying an inversion of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states has been identified through computational screening of synthesized structures. This observed behavior is attributed to a high&#8208;symmetry pentalene core motif, which is stabilized via aromaticity.







Abstract
Molecules with inversion of the singlet and triplet excited&#8208;state energies are highly promising for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To date, azaphenalenes are the only class of molecules where these inversions have been identified. Here, we screen a curated database of organic crystal structures to identify existing compounds for violations of Hund's rule in the lowest excited states. We identify two further classes with this behavior. The first, a class of zwitterions, has limited relevance to molecular emitters as the singlet&#8208;triplet inversions occur in the third excited singlet state. The second class consists of two D2h&#8208;symmetry non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons, a fused azulene dimer and a bicalicene, whose lowest excited singlet states violate Hund's rule. Due to the connectivity of the polycyclic structure, they achieve this symmetry through aromatic stabilization. These hydrocarbons show promise as the next generation of building blocks for OLED emitters.

         <title>Peptide Bond Formation in the Protonated Serine Dimer Following Vacuum UV Photon&#8208;Induced Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While collision induced dissociation of protonated serine dimers leads only to cluster breakup, clear evidence that irradiation by Vacuum UV (PID) light leads to intra&#8208;cluster bond formation is presented. Furthermore, comparison with the PID of serine dipeptides suggests that peptide bond formation is involved in the process.







Abstract
Possible routes for intra&#8208;cluster bond formation (ICBF) in protonated serine dimers have been studied. We found no evidence of ICBF following low energy collision&#8208;induced dissociation (in correspondence with previous works), however, we do observe clear evidence for ICBF following photon absorption in the 4.6&#8211;14&#8197;eV range. Moreover, the comparison of photon&#8208;induced dissociation measurements of the protonated serine dimer to those of a protonated serine dipeptide provides evidence that ICBF, in this case, involves peptide bond formation (PBF). The experimental results are supported by ab initio molecular dynamics and exploration of several excited state potential energy surfaces, unraveling a pathway for PBF following photon absorption. The combination of experiments and theory provides insight into the PBF mechanisms in clusters of amino acids, and reveals the importance of electronic excited states reached upon UV/VUV light excitation.

         <title>Deuterodehalogenation Under Net Reductive or Redox&#8208;Neutral Conditions Enabled by Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific introduction of deuterium is important in organic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the deuterodehalogenation of aryl and heteroaryl benzylic halides, using inexpensive deuterium oxide as the deuterium source. We also uncover a sequential paired electrolysis regime, which permits switching between net reductive and overall redox&#8208;neutral reactions of sulfur&#8208;containing substrates.







Abstract
Interest in deuterated active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is increasing as deuteration holds promise for kinetic isotope effect (KIE) regulated fine&#8208;tuning of API performance. Moreover, deuterium isotope labeling is frequently carried out to study organic and bioorganic reaction mechanisms and to facilitate complex target synthesis. As such, methods for highly selective deuteration of organic molecules are highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the selective deuterodehalogenation of benzylic halides via a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, using inexpensive deuterium oxide (D2O) as the deuterium source. We demonstrate broad functional group compatibility across a range of aryl and heteroaryl benzylic halides. Furthermore, we uncover a sequential paired electrolysis regime, which permits switching between net reductive and overall redox&#8208;neutral reactions of sulfur&#8208;containing substrates simply by changing the identity of the sacrificial reductant employed.

         <title>Synthesis of Multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;Sultines by a Photoinduced Radical Addition&#8211;Polar Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed multifluoromethyl radical addition/SO2 incorporation/polar cyclization cascade approach to multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;sultines has been developed. The reaction proceeds with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and good yields. Key to the success of the protocol is use of oxidizable multifluoroalkanesulfinates as bifunctional reagents.







Abstract
Despite the significance of sultines in synthesis, medicine, and materials science, the chemistry of sultines has remained unexplored due to their inaccessibility. Herein, we demonstrate the development of a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed multifluoromethyl radical addition/SO2 incorporation/polar cyclization cascade approach to multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;sultines. The reactions proceed by single electron transfer induced multifluoromethyl radical addition to an alkene followed by SO2 incorporation, and single&#8208;electron reduction for polar 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet cyclization. Key to the success of the protocol is the use of easily oxidizable multifluoroalkanesulfinates as bifunctional reagents. The reactions proceed with excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance to deliver &#947;&#8208;sultines in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Nanostructuring of Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets as Long&#8208;range Ordered Arrays in the Framework of Organic Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first compound with long&#8208;range ordered single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) encapsulated in protective framework was synthesized and its structure and magnetic properties were investigated. This work provides a method to control the nanostructuring of SMM within protective frameworks and further the development of molecular spintronics.







Abstract
The nanostructuring of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) on substrates, in nanotubes and periodic frameworks is highly desired for the future magnetic recording devices. However, the ability to organize SMMs into long&#8208;range ordered arrays in these systems is still lacking. Here, we report the incorporation of magnetic (RECl2(H2O)6)+ (RE=rare earths) molecular groups into the framework of an organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP)&#8212;(H2dabco)CsCl3. Intriguingly, we show the incorporated rare&#8208;earth groups self&#8208;organized into long&#8208;range ordered arrays that uniformly and periodically distributed in the A sites of OMHP. The ordered (RECl2(H2O)6)+ groups serve as SMMs in the perovskite frameworks, exhibiting large effective magnetic moment, moderate magnetic anisotropy and two&#8208;step relaxation behavior. With the additional merit of great structural flexibility and multifunction of OMHPs, the preparation of the first SMMs@OMHP magnetic materials furthers the development of molecular spintronics.

         <title>A Spiro Phosphamide Catalyzed Enantioselective Proton Transfer of Ylides in a Free Carbene Insertion into N&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective free carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond of amines has been achieved. Newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, chiral spiro phosphamides, were found to be key and promote the proton transfer of the ylide intermediates and control the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The reaction provides a new approach to amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
Free carbene readily causes multiple side reactions due to its high energy, thus its asymmetric transformation is very difficult. We present here our findings of high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts that enable free carbene insertion into N&#8722;H bonds of amines to prepare chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantioselectivity. Under irradiation with visible light, diazo compounds produce high&#8208;energy free carbenes that are captured by amines to form free ylide intermediates, and then the newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acids, chiral spiro phosphamides, promote the proton transfer of ylides to afford the products. Computational and kinetic studies uncover the principle for the rational design of proton&#8208;transfer catalysts and explain how the catalysts accelerate this transformation and provide stereocontrol.

         <title>Manipulation of the Buried Interface for Robust Formamidinium&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells with NiOx Hole&#8208;Transport Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly efficient and stable formamidinium&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb (FASn0.5Pb0.5I3) perovskite solar cell with NiOx hole&#8208;transport layer, which is realized by manipulating the buried NiOx/perovskite interface with multifunctional 4&#8208;hydroxyphenethyl ammonium halide (OH&#8208;PEAX, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; or I&#8722;) interlayer.







Abstract
Low band gap tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8722;Pb PSCs) are expected to achieve higher efficiencies than Pb&#8208;PSCs and regarded as key components of tandem PSCs. However, the realization of high efficiency is challenged by the instability of Sn2+ and the imperfections at the charge transfer interfaces. Here, we demonstrate an efficient ideal band gap formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb (FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3) PSC, by manipulating the buried NiOx/perovskite interface with 4&#8208;hydroxyphenethyl ammonium halide (OH&#8208;PEAX, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8722;) interlayer, which exhibits fascinating functions of reducing the surface defects of the NiOx hole transport layer (HTL), enhancing the perovskite film quality, and improving both the energy level matching and physical contact at the interface. The effects of different halide anions have been elaborated and a 20.53&#8201;% efficiency is obtained with OH&#8208;PEABr, which is the highest one for FA&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb PSCs using NiOx HTLs. Moreover, the device stability is also boosted.

         <title>A Highly Stable Organic Luminescent Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variable&#8208;temperature EPR measurements as well as theoretical calculations have been carried out on a highly stable room&#8208;temperature luminescent M&#252;ller hydrocarbon. The results indicate that the hydrocarbon has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a diradical character of 90&#8201;%, with the small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap enabling thermal excitation to a triplet state.







Abstract
It is very challenging to obtain stable room&#8208;temperature luminescent open&#8208;shell singlet diradicals. Herein we report the first stable M&#252;ller's hydrocarbon TTM&#8208;PhTTM with luminescent properties. Variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations show that TTM&#8208;PhTTM has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a diradical character of 90&#8201;%. Because of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, the open&#8208;shell singlet ground state can be thermally excited to a triplet state. TTM&#8208;PhTTM shows room&#8208;temperature deep&#8208;red emission in various solutions. Unusually high stability of TTM&#8208;PhTTM was also observed owing to effective steric hindrance and spin delocalization. Our results are beneficial to the rational design and discovery of more stable luminescent diradical materials.

         <title>Diazadiboraacenes: Synthesis, Spectroscopy and Computations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a series of diazadiborabenzo[b]triphenylenes as novel B,N&#8208;acenes via a stable biradical is presented. Characterization of their photophysical properties revealed that the emission spectra can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron atom. In addition, short&#8208;lived phosphorescence has been demonstrated.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms into hydrocarbon compounds greatly expands the chemical space of molecular materials. In this context, B&#8722;N doping takes a center stage due to its isosterism with a C=C&#8208;bond. Herein, we present a new and modular synthetic concept to access novel diazadiborabenzo[b]triphenylenes 7&#8201;a&#8211;h using the B&#8722;N doped biradical 16 as intermediate. Characterization of the photophysical properties revealed the emission spectra of the diazadibora benzo[b]triphenylenes 7&#8201;a&#8211;h can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron&#8208;atom. All of the diazadibora compounds show a short life&#8208;time phosphorescence. Additionally, we were able to rationalize the excited&#8208;state relaxation of the diazadiboraacene 7&#8201;a via intersystem crossing by quantum chemical calculations. The new synthetic strategy provides an elegant route to various novel B&#8722;N doped acenes with great potential for applications in molecular materials.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral bilayer nanographene (EP9H) containing a pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized with an extended &#960;&#8208;system perpendicular to the helical axis of [9]helicene. Furthermore, the structure extension induced significant improvements in the fluorescence quantum yield and circularly polarized luminescence, as evident from the large glum and BCPL values.







Abstract
A novel chiral nanographene (i.e. EP9H) with a pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized and fully characterized.

         <title>Synthesis of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 Chalcogenide Perovskite Films Using Single&#8208;Phase Molecular Precursors at Moderate Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a single&#8208;phase, solution&#8208;processed approach to create thin films of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 at temperatures of 575&#8201;&#176;C with sulfurization times as short as 20&#8197;min. To create molecular precursor inks, we utilized known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to synthesize Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates and extended this chemistry to create species such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have not been reported before.







Abstract
Chalcogenide perovskites have garnered interest for applications in semiconductor devices due to their excellent predicted optoelectronic properties and stability. However, high synthesis temperatures have historically made these materials incompatible with the creation of photovoltaic devices. Here, we demonstrate the solution processed synthesis of luminescent BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 chalcogenide perovskite films using single&#8208;phase molecular precursors at sulfurization temperatures of 575&#8201;&#176;C and sulfurization times as short as one hour. These molecular precursor inks were synthesized using known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to create Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates, and this chemistry was extended to create species, such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have never been reported before. These findings, with added future research, have the potential to yield fully solution processed thin films of chalcogenide perovskites for various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion Enabled by Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Triatomic Sites in Partially Oxidized Bimetallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two metallic sites in a pristine bimetallic sulfide do not form sufficiently tight bonds with the C2 intermediate during CO2 photoreduction, which results in an incomplete C&#8722;C coupling, thus giving mixtures of C1 and C2 products. Partial oxidation of the bimetallic sulfide leads to the formation of triatomic sites, enabling enhanced C&#8722;C coupling of the key intermediates to selectively generate C2 products.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction into C2 fuels under mild conditions suffers from low product yield and poor selectivity owing to the kinetic challenge of C&#8722;C coupling. Here, triatomic sites are introduced into bimetallic sulfide to promote C&#8722;C coupling for selectively forming C2 products. As an example, FeCoS2 atomic layers with different oxidation degrees are first synthesized, demonstrated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Both experiment and theoretical calculation verify more charges aggregate around the introduced oxygen atom, which enables the original Co&#8722;Fe dual sites to turn into Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe triatomic sites, thus promoting C&#8722;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates. Accordingly, the mildly oxidized FeCoS2 atomic layers exhibit C2H4 formation rate of 20.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, with the product selectivity and electron selectivity of 82.9&#8201;% and 96.7&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts under similar conditions.

         <title>Chiral Calix[3]pyrrole Derivatives: Synthesis, Racemization Kinetics, and Ring Expansion to Calix[9]&#8208; and Calix[12]pyrrole Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently chiral calix[3]pyrrole derivative was synthesized from a polyketone precursor. Although the macrocycle racemizes through ring inversion at room temperature, N&#8208;methylation effectively suppressed the racemization, allowing chiral resolution of the enantiomers. Ring expansion reaction allowed access to calix[9]&#8208; and calix[12]pyrrole&#8208;type macrocycles, the largest of which was characterized by an X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Chiral pyrrolic macrocycles continue to attract interest. However, their molecular design remains challenging. Here, we report a calixpyrrole&#8208;based chiral macrocyclic system, calix[1]furan[1]pyrrole[1]thiophene (1), synthesized from an oligoketone. Macrocycle 1 adopts a partial cone conformation in the solid state, and undergoes racemization via ring inversion. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that inversion of the thiophene is the rate determining step. Pyrrole N&#8208;methylation suppressed racemization and permitted chiral resolution. Enantioselective N&#8208;methylation also occurred in the presence of a chiral ammonium salt, although the stereoselectivity is modest. A unique feature of 1 is that it acts as a useful synthetic precursor to yield several calix[n]furan[n]pyrrole[n]thiophene products (n=2&#8211;4), including a calix[12]pyrrole analogue that to our knowledge constitutes the largest calix[n]pyrrole&#8208;like species to be structurally characterized.

         <title>Highly Strained Oxygen&#8208;Doped Chiral Molecular Belts of the Zigzag&#8208;Type with Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy has been used to synthesize depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag&#8208;type. The approach involved the closure of fjords at the upper rim and the growth of fused rings at the lower rim of resorcin[4]arene derivatives to afford highly strained chiral belts having excellent CPL properties, with |glum| up to 0.022.







Abstract
Herein we report a two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag&#8208;type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phenalenes has been developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O&#8208;doped C2&#8208;symmetric belt. The enantiomers of the acquired compounds exhibited excellent chiroptical properties. The calculated parallelly aligned electric (&#956;) and magnetic (m) transition dipole moments are translated to the high dissymmetry factor (|glum| up to 0.022). This study provides not only an appealing and useful strategy for the synthesis of strained molecular belts but also a new paradigm for the fabrication of belt&#8208;derived chiroptical materials with high CPL activities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a two-directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth-expanded oxygen-doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag-type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3-dihydro-1H-phenalenes has been developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring-closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O-doped C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric belt. The enantiomers of the acquired compounds exhibited excellent chiroptical properties. The calculated parallelly aligned electric (&lt;b&gt;&#956;&lt;/b&gt;) and magnetic (&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;) transition dipole moments are translated to the high dissymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 0.022). This study provides not only an appealing and useful strategy for the synthesis of strained molecular belts but also a new paradigm for the fabrication of belt-derived chiroptical materials with high CPL activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
