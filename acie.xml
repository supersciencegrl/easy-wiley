         <title>A donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymer for fast storage of anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials have attracted a lot interest in batteries in recent years. However, most of them still suffer from low performance such as low electrode potential, slow reaction kinetics, and short cycle life. In this work, we report a strategy of fabricating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers for facilitating the charge transfer and therefore accelerating the reaction kinetics by using the copolymer (p&#8208;TTPZ) of dihydrophenazine (PZ) and thianthrene (TT) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The D&#8208;A conjugated polymer as p&#8208;type cathode could store anions and exhibited high discharge voltages (two plateaus at 3.82 V, 3.16 V respectively), a reversible capacity of 152 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 124.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1 (~50C) and remarkable cyclability. The performance, especially the rate capability was much higher than that of its counterpart homopolymers without D&#8208;A structure. As a result, the p&#8208;TTPZ//graphite full cells showed a high output voltage (3.26 V), a discharge specific capacity of 139.1 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1 and excellent rate performance. This work provides a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>NeuM: A Neuon&#8208;Selective Probe Incorporates into Live Neuronal Membranes via Enhanced Cathrin&#8208;Mediated Endocytosis in Primary Neurons.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a small&#8208;molecule probe designed to selectively target&#160;neurons would enhance the exploration of intricate neuronal structures and functions. Among such probes, NeuO stands out as the pioneer and has gained significant traction in the field of research. Nevertheless, neither the mechanism behind neuron&#8208;selectivity nor the cellular localization has been determined. Here, we introduce NeuM, a derivative of NeuO, designed to target neuronal cell membranes. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism behind the selective neuronal membrane trafficking that distinguishes neurons. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM autonomously assembles into micellar structures, leading to the quenching of its fluorescence (&#934;&#160;=0.001). Upon exposure to neurons, NeuM micelles were selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes via clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Through the endocytic recycling pathway, NeuM micelles integrate into neuronal membrane, dispersing fluorescent NeuM molecules in the membrane (&#934; =0.61). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that NeuM, in comparison to NeuO, possesses optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers. The stable integration of NeuM within neuronal membrane allows the prolonged monitoring of neurons, as well as the visualization of intricate neuronal structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter with Ultra&#8208;Pure Green Emission and High Electroluminescence Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with narrow emission spectra have garnered significant attention in future organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. However, current C=O/N&#8208;embedded MR&#8208;TADF systems still lack satisfactory performance in terms of electroluminescence bandwidths and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). In this study, a C=O/N&#8208;embedded green MR&#8208;TADF emitter, featuring two acridone units incorporated in a sterically protected 11&#8208;ring fused core skeleton, is successfully synthesized through finely controlling the reaction selectivity. The superior combination of multiple intramolecular fusion and steric wrapping strategies in the design of the emitter not only imparts an extremely narrow emission spectrum and a high fluorescence quantum yield to the emitter but also mitigates aggregation&#8208;induced spectral broadening and fluorescence quenching. Therefore, the emitter exhibits leading green OLED performance among C=O/N&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF systems, achieving an EQE of up to 37.2%, a full width at half maximum of merely 0.11 eV (24 nm), and a Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage coordinate of (0.20, 0.73). This study marks a significant advance in the realization of ideal C=O/N&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters and holds profound implications for the design and synthesis of other MR&#8208;TADF systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy and Ruthenium Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Pairs to Boost the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous optimization of the energy level of water dissociation, hydrogen and hydroxide desorption is the key to achieving fast kinetics for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the well&#8208;dispersed Ru clusters on the surface of amorphous/crystalline CeO2&#8208;&#948; (Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948;) is demonstrated to be an excellent electrocatalyst for significantly boosting the alkaline HER kinetics owing to the presence of unique oxygen vacancy (VO) and Ru Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs (LABPs). The representative Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948; exhibits an outstanding mass activity of 7180 mA mgRu&#8208;1&#160;that is approximately 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C at the potential of &#8208;0.1 V (V vs RHE) and an extremely low overpotential of 21.2 mV at a geometric current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the VO as Lewis acid sites facilitate the adsorption of H2O and cleavage of H&#8208;OH bonds, meanwhile, the weak Lewis basic Ru clusters favor for the hydrogen desorption. Importantly, the desorption of OH from VO sites is accelerated via a water&#8208;assisted proton exchange pathway, and thus boost the kinetics of alkaline HER. This study sheds new light on the design of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts with LABPs for the enhanced alkaline HER.</dc:description>

         <title>A Homopolymer of Xanthenoxanthene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Heteroaromatic for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient perovskite solar cells typically rely on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as a hole transporter, achieving a 25.7% efficiency record. However, these cells are susceptible to harsh 85&#176;C conditions. Here, we present a peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based semiconducting homopolymer (p&#8208;TNI2) with matched energy levels and a high molecular weight of 388 kDa, synthesized nearly quantitatively through facile oxidative polymerization. Compared to established materials, p&#8208;TNI2 excels in hole mobility, morphology, modulus, and waterproofing. Implementing p&#8208;TNI2 as the hole transport layer results in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6%, rivaling 24.4% for the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD control cells under identical conditions. Furthermore, the p&#8208;TNI2&#8208;based cells exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#176;C and operational robustness.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Single&#8208;stranded DNA Encoding and Programmable Assembly of Molecular Nanostructures for NIR&#8208;II Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular nanotechnology promises to offer privileged access to developing NIR&#8208;II materials with precise structural and functional manipulation for transformable theranostic applications. However, the lack of an affordable, yet general, method makes this goal currently inaccessible. By virtue of the intriguing nucleic acid chemistry, here we present an artificial base&#8208;directed topological single&#8208;strand DNA encoding design that enables one&#8208;step synthesis of valence&#8208;controlled NIR&#8208;II molecular nanostructures and spatial assembly of these nanostructures to modulate their behaviors in living systems. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies, we construct ultrasmall Ag2S quantum dots and pH&#8208;responsive, size&#8208;tunable CuS assemblies for in vivo NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and deep tumor photothermal therapy.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular nanotechnology promises to offer privileged access to developing NIR-II materials with precise structural and functional manipulation for transformable theranostic applications. However, the lack of an affordable, yet general, method makes this goal currently inaccessible. By virtue of the intriguing nucleic acid chemistry, here we present an artificial base-directed topological single-strand DNA encoding design that enables one-step synthesis of valence-controlled NIR-II molecular nanostructures and spatial assembly of these nanostructures to modulate their behaviors in living systems. As proof-of-concept studies, we construct ultrasmall Ag2S quantum dots and pH-responsive, size-tunable CuS assemblies for in vivo NIR-II fluorescence imaging and deep tumor photothermal therapy. This work paves a new way for creating functionally diversified architectures and broadens the scope of DNA-encoded material engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoswitchable Macrocycle Controls Anion&#8208;Templated Pseudorotaxane Formation and Axle Relocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Important biological processes, such as signaling and transport, are regulated by dynamic binding events. The development of artificial supramolecular systems in which binding between different components is controlled could help emulate such processes. Herein, we describe stiff&#8208;stilbene containing macrocycles that can be switched between (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;isomers by light, as demonstrated by UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The (Z)&#8208;isomers can be effectively threaded by pyridinium halide axles to give pseudorotaxane complexes, as confirmed by 1H NMR titration studies and single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The overall stability of these complexes can be tuned by varying the templating counteranion. However, upon light&#8208;induced isomerization to the (E)&#8208;isomer, the threading capability is drastically reduced. The axle component, in addition, can form a heterodimeric complex with a secondary isophthalamide host. Therefore, when all components are combined, light irradiation triggers axle exchange between the macrocycle and this secondary host, which has been monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy and simulated computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Sulfur Sites in Tetraoxygen Tetrahedral Coordination Structure for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion regulation strategy is regarded as a promising pathway for designing transition metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with improved activity and stability. Precise anion conditioning can accurately change the anionic environment so that the acid radical ions (SO42&#8208;, PO32&#8208;, SeO42&#8208;, etc.), regardless of their state (inside the catalyst, on the catalyst surface, or in the electrolyte), can optimize the electronic structure of the cationic active site and further increase the catalytic activity. Here in, we report a new approach to encapsulate S atoms at the tetrahedral sites of the NaCl&#8208;type oxide NiO to form a tetraoxo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination structure (S&#8208;O4) inside the NiO (S&#8208;NiO&#8208;I). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando vibrational spectroscopy proves that this kind of unique structure could achieve the S&#8208;O4 and Ni&#8208;S structure stable well in S&#8208;NiO&#8208;I. Combining mass spectroscopy characterization, it could be confirmed that the S&#8208;O4 structure exhibits as the key factor for triggering the lattice oxygen exchange to participate in OER process. This work demonstrates that the formation of tetraoxygen tetrahedral structure is a generalized key for boosting the OER performances of transition metal oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanism for alcohol electrooxidation on nickel&#8208;based electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to outstanding performances, nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts are commonly used in electrochemical alcohol oxidation reactions (AORs), and the active phase is usually vacancy&#8208;rich nickel oxide/hydroxide (NiOxHy) species. However, researchers are not aware of the catalytic role of atom vacancy in AORs. Here, we study vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanisms for AORs on NiOxHy species. As to AORs on oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;poor &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, the only redox mediator is electrooxidation&#8208;induced electrophilic lattice oxygen species, which can only catalyze the dehydrogenation process (e.g., the electrooxidation of primary alcohol to carboxylic acid) instead of the C&#8208;C bond cleavage. Hence, vicinal diol electrooxidation reaction involving the C&#8208;C bond cleavage is not feasible with oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;poor &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. Only through oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced adsorbed oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism, can oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich NiOxHy species catalyze the electrooxidation of vicinal diol to carboxylic acid and formic acid accompanied with the C&#8208;C bond cleavage. Crucially, we examine how vacancies and vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanisms work during AORs on NiOxHy species.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Modification Strategy to Modulate Reaction Microenvironment for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer modification electrodes with a super&#8208;hydrophobic microenvironment show outstanding performance for electroreduction of CO2 with enhancing activity, selectivity and stability simultaneously.







Abstract
Modulation of the microenvironment on the electrode surface is one of the effective means to improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (eCO2RR). To achieve high conversion rates, the phase boundary at the electrode surface should be finely controlled to overcome the limitation of CO2 solubility in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we developed a simple and efficient method to structure electrocatalyst with a superhydrophobic surface microenvironment by one&#8208;step co&#8208;electrodeposition of Cu and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on carbon paper. The super&#8208;hydrophobic Cu&#8208;based electrode displayed a high ethylene (C2H4) selectivity with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 67.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.25&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an H&#8208;type cell, which is 2.5&#8197;times higher than a regular Cu electrode without PTFE. By using PTFE as a surface modifier, the activity of eCO2RR is enhanced and water (proton) adsorption is inhibited. This strategy has the potential to be applied to other gas&#8208;conversion electrocatalysts.

         <title>Insight into the Role of Fluoroethylene Carbonate on the Stability of Sb||Graphite Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries in Propylene Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the addition of FEC, a robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase formed on the surface of Sb anode and graphite cathode, inhibiting the pulverization of Sb and the expansion of graphite. The formation of FEC&#8208;rich anions solvation structure facilitates the insertion of PF6&#8722;, which significantly improves the reversible capacity. Thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced performance of high voltage and power density Sb||graphite dual&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have attracted increasing attention due to their high operative voltages and low&#8208;cost raw materials. However, the practical applications of Na&#8208;DIBs are still hindered by the issues, such as low capacity and poor Coulombic efficiency, which is highly correlated with the compatibility between electrode and electrolyte but rarely investigated. Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into the electrolyte to regulate cation/anion solvation structure and the stability of cathode/anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase of Na&#8208;DIBs. The FEC modulates the environment of PF6&#8722; solvation sheath and facilitates the interaction of PF6&#8722; on graphite. In addition, the NaF&#8208;rich interphase caused by the preferential decomposition of FEC effectively inhibits side reactions and pulverization of anodes with the electrolyte. Consequently, Sb||graphite full cells in FEC&#8208;containing electrolyte achieve an improved capacity, cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency. This work elucidates the underlying mechanism of bifunctional FEC and provides an alternative strategy of building high&#8208;performance dual ion batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of activity&#8208;based protease sensors, termed DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes afford over 100&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity compared to conventional fluorophore&#8208;quencher&#8208;based probes, allow for multiplexed detection of disease&#8208;relevant proteases, and enable the monitoring of active proteases in cancer cells obtained from colorectal cancer patients.







Abstract
We report the development of a new class of protease activity sensors called DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes are comprised of gold nanoparticles functionalized with peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates (GPDs), where the peptide is a substrate of the protease of interest. The DNA acts as a barcode identifying the peptide and facilitates signal amplification. Protease&#8208;mediated peptide cleavage frees the DNA from the nanoparticle surface, which is subsequently measured via a CRISPR/Cas12a&#8208;based assay as a proxy for protease activity. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we show activity&#8208;based, multiplexed detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;associated protease, 3CL, and the apoptosis marker, caspase 3, with high sensitivity and selectivity. GPDs yield &gt;25&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals, 100&#8208;fold improved response compared to commercial probes, and detection limits as low as 58&#8197;pM at room temperature. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of proteases can be detected visually by leveraging the aggregation&#8208;dependent color change of the gold nanoparticles. We showcase the clinical potential of GPDs by detecting a colorectal cancer&#8208;associated protease, cathepsin B, in three different patient&#8208;derived cell lines. Taken together, GPDs detect physiologically relevant concentrations of active proteases in challenging biological samples, require minimal sample processing, and offer unmatched multiplexing capabilities (mediated by DNA), making them powerful chemical tools for biosensing and disease diagnostics.

         <title>Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2: A New Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material Derived from KBe2BO3F2 with High Performance and Excellent Water&#8208;Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first alkaline earth metal NLO malonic Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2 was synthesized by taking KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) as parent structure. It has a unique two&#8208;dimensional NLO&#8208;favorable electroneutral [Mg(C3O4H2)3(H2O)2]&#8734; layer, resulting in the rare coexistence of a strong SHG response of 3&#215;KDP (@1064&#8197;nm) and short phase&#8208;matching wavelength of 200&#8197;nm. More importantly, it has excellent water resistance, which is rare in ionic organic NLO crystals.







Abstract
Acquiring high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that simultaneously exhibit a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients, as short as possible SHG phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and non&#8208;hygroscopic properties has consistently posed a significant challenge. Herein, through multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), an excellent UV NLO crystal, Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2, was successfully synthesized in malonic system. This material possesses a unique 2D NLO&#8208;favorable electroneutral [Mg(C3O4H2)3(H2O)2]&#8734; layer, resulting in the rare coexistence of a strong SHG response of 3&#215;KDP (@1064&#8197;nm) and short PM wavelength of 200&#8197;nm. More importantly, it exhibits exceptional water resistance, which is rare among ionic organic NLO crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that its excellent water&#8208;resistant may be originated from its small available cavity volumes, which is similar to the famous LiB3O5 (LBO). Therefore, excellent NLO properties and stability against air and moisture indicate it should be a promising UV NLO crystal.

         <title>Extending Ring&#8208;Chain Coupling Empirical Law to Lithium&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work extends an interesting empirical electrolyte design law (ring&#8208;chain coupling law) to the lithium&#8208;mediated ammonia electrochemical synthesis system, which succeeds in improving the nitrogen fixation performance. Systematic theoretical calculation and experimental evidence jointly decipher the potential correlation between such strategy and enhanced performance from the angle of thermodynamics and mass transfer dynamics.







Abstract
With its efficient nitrogen fixation kinetics, electrochemical lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR) holds promise for replacing Haber&#8211;Bosch process and realizing sustainable and green ammonia production. However, the general interface problem in lithium electrochemistry seriously impedes the further enhancement of LMNRR performance. Inspired by the development history of lithium battery electrolytes, here, we extend the ring&#8208;chain solvents coupling law to LMNRR system to rationally optimize the interface during the reaction process, achieving nearly a two&#8208;fold Faradaic efficiency up to 54.78&#177;1.60&#8201;%. Systematic theoretical simulations and experimental analysis jointly decipher that the anion&#8208;rich Li+ solvation structure derived from ring tetrahydrofuran coupling with chain ether successfully suppresses the excessive passivation of electrolyte decomposition at the reaction interface, thus promoting the mass transfer of active species and enhancing the nitrogen fixation kinetics. This work offers a progressive insight into the electrolyte design of LMNRR system.

         <title>Hot or Not? Reassessing Mechanisms of Photocurrent Generation in Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8216;hot&#8217; field of much recent interest, plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis offers possibilities for improving selectivity and rates in small molecule activation via non&#8208;thermal &#8216;hot carriers&#8217;. However, critical identification of thermal contributions is often insufficient. Here, we summarise the origins of observed photocurrents and present guidelines to experimentalists for differentiating between enhancement mechanisms.







Abstract
It is now widely accepted that certain effects arising from localised surface plasmon resonance, such as enhanced electromagnetic fields, hot carriers, and thermal effects, can facilitate electrocatalytic processes. This newly emerging field of research is commonly referred to as plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC) and is attracting increasing interest from the research community, particularly regarding harnessing the high energy of hot carriers. However, this has led to a lack of critical analysis in the literature, where the participation of hot carriers is routinely claimed due to their perceived desirability, while the contribution of other effects is often not sufficiently investigated. As a result, correctly differentiating between the possible mechanisms at play has become a key point of contention. In this review, we specifically focus on the mechanisms behind photocurrents observed in PEEC and critically evaluate the possibility of alternative sources of current enhancement in the reported PEEC systems. Furthermore, we present guidelines for the best experimental practices and methods to distinguish between the various enhancement mechanisms in PEEC.

         <title>Ultralight Ultrafast Enzymes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An M9 minimum media based on 13C&#8208;depleted glucose and 15N&#8208;depleted salt dissolved in D,18O&#8208;depleted water (Depleted media) was formulated. E. coli bacteria grow faster in Depleted media compared with isotopically natural media (Normal media). In addition, four different enzymes recombinantly produced in Depleted media showed faster kinetics compared with the enzymes produced in Normal media.







Abstract
Inorganic materials depleted of heavy stable isotopes are known to deviate strongly in some physicochemical properties from their isotopically natural counterparts. Here we explored for the first time the effect of simultaneous depletion of the heavy carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes on the bacterium E. coli and the enzymes expressed in it. Bacteria showed faster growth, with most proteins exhibiting higher thermal stability, while for recombinant enzymes expressed in depleted media, faster kinetics was discovered. At room temperature, luciferase, thioredoxin and dihydrofolate reductase and Pfu DNA polymerase showed up to a 250&#8201;% increase in activity compared to the native counterparts, with an additional &#8764;50&#8201;% increase at 10&#8201;&#176;C. Diminished conformational and vibrational entropy is hypothesized to be the cause of the accelerated kinetics. Ultralight enzymes may find an application where extreme reaction rates are required.

         <title>Stabilizing Undercoordinated Zn Active Sites through Confinement in CeO2 Nanotubes for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;based catalysts hold great potential to replace the noble metal&#8208;based ones for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Undercoordinated Zn (Zn&#948;+) sites may serve as the active sites for enhanced CO production by optimizing the binding energy of *COOH intermediates. However, there is relatively less exploration into the dynamic evolution and stability of Zn&#948;+ sites during CO2 reduction process. Herein, we present ZnO, Zn&#948;+/ZnO and Zn as catalysts by varying the applied reduction potential. Theoretical studies reveal that Zn&#948;+ sites could suppress HER and HCOOH production to induce CO generation. And Zn&#948;+/ZnO presents the highest CO selectivity (FECO 70.9% at &#8208;1.48 V vs. RHE) compared to Zn and ZnO. Furthermore, we propose a CeO2 nanotube with confinement effect and Ce3+/Ce4+ redox to stabilize Zn&#948;+ species. The hollow core&#8208;shell structure of the Zn&#948;+/ZnO/CeO2 catalyst enables to extremely expose electrochemically active area while maintaining the Zn&#948;+ sites with long&#8208;time stability. Certainly, the target catalyst affords a FECO of 76.9% at &#8208;1.08 V vs. RHE and no significant decay of CO selectivity in excess of 18 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of photoswitchable moieties into biological macromolecules has emerged as a promising approach to manipulate and study complex processes in living organisms. In this review, we emphasize recent advancements in the field of photochromic nucleosides and provide an overview of design principles, synthetic strategies, analytical challenges, as well as structure&#8211;property relationships and applications.







Abstract
Photochromism is a reversible phenomenon wherein a material undergoes a change in color upon exposure to light. In organic photochromes, this effect often results from light&#8208;induced isomerization reactions, leading to alterations in either the spatial orientation or electronic properties of the photochrome. The incorporation of photochromic moieties into biomolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, has become a prevalent approach to render these biomolecules responsive to light stimuli. Utilizing light as a trigger for the manipulation of biomolecular structure and function offers numerous advantages compared to other stimuli, such as chemical or electrical treatments, due to its non&#8208;invasive nature. Consequently, light proves particularly advantageous in cellular and tissue applications. In this review, we emphasize recent advancements in the field of photochromic nucleosides and oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the design principles of different classes of photochromes, synthetic strategies, critical analytical challenges, as well as structure&#8211;property relationships. The applications of photochromic nucleic acid derivatives encompass diverse domains, ranging from the precise photoregulation of gene expression to the controlled modulation of the three&#8208;dimensional structures of oligonucleotides and the development of DNA&#8208;based fluorescence modulators. Moreover, we present a future perspective on potential modifications and applications.

         <title>Diborodichloromethane as Versatile Reagent for Chemodivergent Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of boron reagents is crucial for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a scalable and practical synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) reagent through the reaction of trichloromethyllithium with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The resulting DBDCM reagent serves as a basic synthetic unit for the construction of various structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8208;Cl functionalizations. Moreover, we have developed consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM for the construction of diverse tertiary and quaternary carbon&#8208;centered molecules. The use of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;chloroform and 10B2pin2 enables the synthesis of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents, which are beneficial for the convenient synthesis of carbon&#8208;13 and boron&#8208;10 molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorinated Solid&#8208;state&#8208;electrolyte Interface Layer Guiding Fast Zinc&#8208;ion Oriented Deposition in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries are gaining popularity due to their high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, random deposition of zinc ions on the anode and sluggish migration of zinc ions on the interface would lead to the growth of zinc dendrites and poor cycling performance. To address these challenges, we developed a fluorinated solid&#8208;state&#8208;electrolyte interface layer composed of Ca5(PO4)3F/Zn3(PO4)2 via an in&#8208;situ ion exchange strategy to guide zinc&#8208;ion oriented deposition and fast zinc ion migration on the anode during cycling. The introduction of Ca5(PO4)3F (FAP) can increase the nucleation sites of zinc ions and guide the oriented deposition of zinc ions along the (002) crystal plane, while the in&#8208;situ formation of Zn3(PO4)2 during cycling can accelerate the migration of zinc ions. Benefited from our design, the assembled &#160;Zn//V2O5&#8231;H2O batteries based on FAP&#8208;protected Zn anode (FAP&#8208;Zn) achieve a higher capacity retention of 84% (220 mAh g&#8208;1) than that of bare&#8208;Zn based batteries, which have a capacity retention of 23% (97 mAh g&#8208;1) at 3.0 A g&#8208;1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a new solution for the rational design and development of the solid&#8208;state electrolyte interface layer to achieve high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have great potential for in vivo imaging because they can circumvent the autofluorescence of biological tissues. In this study, a class of organic&#8208;doped long&#8208;wavelength (~600 nm) RTP materials with benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole as a guest was constructed. Both host and guest molecules have simple structures and can be directly purchased commercially at a low cost. Owing to the long phosphorescence wavelength of the doping system, it exhibited good tissue penetration (10 mm). Notably, these RTP nanoparticles were successfully used to image atherosclerotic plaques, with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of 44.52. This study provides a new approach for constructing inexpensive red organic phosphorescent materials and a new method for imaging cardiovascular diseases using these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Peptide Nanofibrils for Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for ablating undruggable targets. A PROTAC degrader achieves targeted protein degradation (TPD) through the simultaneous binding of a protein of interest (POI) and an E3 ligase to form a ternary complex. Nanofibril&#8208;based PROTAC strategy to form a polynary (E3)m:PROTAC:(POI)n complex has not been reported in the TPD field. A recent innovation shows that a POI ligand and E3 ligase ligand don&#8217;t have to be within a fused degrader molecule. Instead, they can be recruited to cellular proximity by a self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driving peptide and click chemistry. The resulting nanofibril can recruit multiple POI and E3 ligase molecules to form a polynary complex as a degradation center. The Nano&#8208;PROTAC provides a novel approach for TPD in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Method to Access Sterically Encumbered Geminal Bis(boronates) via Formal Umpolung Transformation of Terminal Diboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>General methods for the preparation of geminal bis(boronates) are of great interest due to their widespread applications in organic synthesis. While the terminal gem&#8208;diboron compounds are readily accessible, the construction of the sterically encumbered, internal analogues has remained a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a formal umpolung strategy to access these valuable building blocks. The readily available 1,1&#8208;diborylalkanes were first converted into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;halogenated derivatives, which then serve as electrophilic components, undergoing a formal substitution with a diverse array of nucleophiles to form a series of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;N bonds. This protocol features good tolerance to steric hindrance and a wide variety of functional groups and heterocycles. Notably, this strategy can also be extended to the synthesis of diaryl and terminal gem&#8208;diboron compounds, therefore providing a general approach to various types of geminal bis(boronates).</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Dynamics and Modular Peripheral Binding in Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 Host:Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of versatile 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 host/guest complexes has been prepared by combining cucurbit[n]urils with symmetric, linear diviologens. These assemblies have properties typical of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes, but also show a new type of supramolecular translational&#8208;rotational coupling, peripheral complexation amenable to proximal or distal binding, and controllable peripheral ring translocation.







Abstract
Now that the chemistry of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host:guest complexes is well&#8208;established, it is surprising to note that higher stoichiometry (oligomeric) complexes, especially those with excess host, remain largely unexplored. Yet, proteins tend to oligomerize, affording new functions for cell machinery. Here, we show that cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) macrocycles combined with symmetric, linear di&#8208;viologens form unusual 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 host:guest complexes exhibiting remarkable dynamic properties, host self&#8208;sorting, and external ring&#8208;translocation. These results highlight the structural tunability of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) based 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 host:guest complexes in water and their responsiveness toward several stimuli (chemicals, pH, redox).

Lithiation and trapping at convenient temperatures (0/&#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C) of five cyclic sulfides such as tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiopyrans and a thiomorpholine enables straightforward &#945;&#8208;functionalisation.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Hydrogen: Pushing the Limit of Multicentre Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom has been predicted for the first time in the global minimum D4h geometry of In4H+ cluster.







Abstract
Among the list of planar tetracoordinate atoms, the smallest element hydrogen is missing. No experimental and theoretical evidence have ever been put forwarded. Herein, we introduce the first planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom (ptH) in the global minimum geometry of In4H+ cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is acting like a proton and significant charge transfer from the surrounding In4 framework results in a negative charge of the central hydrogen atom. The proposed global minimum geometry possesses &#963;&#8208;aromaticity and the central hydrogen atom forms unusual multicentre bond with more than three centres.

         <title>Paired Electrosynthesis of Formaldehyde Derivatives from CO2 Reduction and Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical system for the paired electrosynthesis of formaldehyde derivatives through cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic methanol oxidation was constructed. At the cathode, the non&#8208;reducible formic acid was activated by esterification to methyl formate, which was then reduced again to form stable formaldehyde derivatives.







Abstract
Utilizing CO2&#8208;derived formaldehyde derivatives for fuel additive or polymer synthesis is a promising approach to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions. Existing methodologies involve converting CO2 to methanol by thermal hydrogenation, followed by electrochemical or thermochemical oxidation to produce formaldehyde. Adding to the conventional methanol oxidation pathway, we propose a new electrochemical approach to simultaneously generate formaldehyde derivatives at both electrodes by partial methanol oxidation and the direct reduction of CO2. To achieve this, a method to directly reduce CO2 to formaldehyde at the cathode is required. Still, it has been scarcely reported previously due to the acidity of the formic acid intermediate and the facile over&#8208;reduction of formaldehyde to methanol. By enabling the activation and subsequent stabilization of formic acid and formaldehyde respectively in methanol solvent, we were able to implement a strategy where formaldehyde derivatives were generated at the cathode alongside the anode. Further mechanism studies revealed that protons supplied from the anodic reaction contribute to the activation of formic acid and the stabilization of the formaldehyde product. Additionally, it was found that the cathodic formaldehyde derivative Faradaic efficiency can be further increased through prolonged electrolysis time up to 50&#8201;% along with a maximum anodic formaldehyde derivative Faradaic efficiency of 90&#8201;%.

         <title>A Nanoinhibitor Targeting cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway to Reverse the Homeostatic Imbalance of Inflammation in Psoriasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum&#8208;doped positively charged carbon dots (Pt&#8208;CDs) act as nanoscavengers of cell&#8208;free DNA and reactive oxygen species, inhibiting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which forms a positive feedback loop between macrophages and keratinocytes and amplifies the inflammatory response in psoriasis.







Abstract
Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammation characterized by dysregulated crosstalk between immune cells and keratinocytes. Here we show that the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a key regulator of psoriatic inflammation in a mouse model. Platinum&#8208;doped positively charged carbon dots (Pt&#8208;CDs) were designed to inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. By inhibiting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages was reduced, and the proinflammatory cytokines&#8208;induced breakdown of immunological tolerance and overexpression of chemokines in keratinocytes was restored, which reversed the homeostatic imbalance through breaking these cytokines&#8208;mediated intercellular positive feedback loop. Topical Pt&#8208;CDs treatment exhibited therapeutic effects in imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mice without noticeable toxicity. The reversal of elevated expression of STING, phosphorylated STING, and downstream genes within psoriatic lesions indicates that Pt&#8208;CDs effectively inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. This work suggests a promising strategy for psoriasis treatment by targeting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs nanoinhibitor to restore skin homeostatic balance.

The reversal of elevated expression of STING, phosphorylated STING, and downstream genes within psoriatic lesions indicates that Pt-CDs effectively inhibit the cGAS-STING pathway. This work suggests a promising strategy for psoriasis treatment by targeting the cGAS-STING pathway with Pt-CDs nanoinhibitor to restore skin homeostatic balance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene Incorporated Thiazole Imide&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenophene substitution is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials, because it can realize higher mobility, lower&#8208;lying LUMO level compared with thiophene analogues. Here, we synthesize a thiazole imide&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer with maximum selenophene content and achieve a champion conductivity of 164.0&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is more than twice of that of selenophene&#8208;free analogue.







Abstract
Developing polymers with high electrical conductivity (&#963;) after n&#8208;doping is a great challenge for the advance of the field of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we report a series of thiazole imide&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers by gradually increasing selenophene content in polymeric backbone. Thanks to the strong intramolecular noncovalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interaction and enhanced intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se interaction, with the increase of selenophene content, the polymers show gradually lowered LUMOs, more planar backbone, and improved film crystallinity versus the selenophene&#8208;free analogue. Consequently, polymer PDTzSI&#8722;Se with the highest selenophene content achieves a champion &#963; of 164.0&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 49.0&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in the series when applied in OTEs after n&#8208;doping. The &#963; value is the highest one for n&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor OTE materials reported to date. Our work indicates that selenophene substitution is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OTE materials and selenophene incorporated thiazole imides offer an excellent platform in enabling n&#8208;type polymers with high backbone coplanarity, deep&#8208;lying LUMO and enhanced mobility/conductivity.

         <title>Inside Cover: Designing Sulfate Crystals with Strong Optical Anisotropy through &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Tailoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy for significantly enhancing the polarizability anisotropy of isotropic tetrahedra in sulfate crystals is reported by Zhiyong Bai and Kang Min Ok in their Research Article (e202315311). This strategy involves chemically alternating tetrahedral [SO4]2&#8722;&#160;units with&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated organic groups. Experimental validation of the approach utilized 3&#8208;pyridinesulfonate anion functional building blocks for crystal synthesis.

         <title>Design of Chiral &#946;&#8208;Double Helices from &#947;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal and solution conformations have been engineered of right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed &#946;&#8208;double helices derived from a concatenation of achiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids and chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids. The structural analogy of these new &#946;&#8208;double helices with natural peptide double helices, and their ion&#8208;transport activities are also discussed.







Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature, and homochirality is manifested in many biomolecules. Although &#946;&#8208;double helices are rare in peptides and proteins, they consist of alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids. No peptide double helices with homochiral amino acids have been observed. Here, we report chiral &#946;&#8208;double helices constructed from &#947;&#8208;peptides consisting of alternating achiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 4,4&#8208;dimethyl &#947;&#8208;amino acids and chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids in both single crystals and in solution. The two independent strands of the same peptide intertwine to form a &#946;&#8208;double helix structure, and it is stabilized by inter&#8208;strand hydrogen bonds. The peptides with chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids derived from &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;amino acids adopt a (P)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helix, whereas peptides consisting of (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids derived from &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;amino acids adopt an (M)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helix conformation. The circular dichroism (CD) signature of the (P) and (M)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helices and the stability of these peptides at higher temperatures were examined. Furthermore, ion transport studies suggested that these peptides transport ions across membranes. Even though the structural analogy suggests that these new &#946;&#8208;double helices are structurally different from those of the &#945;&#8208;peptide &#946;&#8208;double helices, they retain ion transport activity. The results reported here may open new avenues in the design of functional foldamers.

         <title>Formation of a Reactive [Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV)] Species and its Facile Equilibrium with Related Mn(IV)(OX) (X = Sc or H) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;bound high&#8208;valent manganese&#8208;oxo species are important in understanding the role of Ca(II) ion in photosystem II. We present the synthesis and spectroscopic assessment of a novel Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV) species. This species opens up a new pathway for the synthesis of Mn(IV)&#8722;O&#8722;Sc(III) and Mn(IV)&#8722;OH, which are relevant to photosystem II.







Abstract
Lewis acid&#8208;bound high valent Mn&#8208;oxo species are of great importance due to their relevance to photosystem II. Here, we report the synthesis of a unique [(BnTPEN)Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV)(NO3)4]+ adduct (2) by the reaction of (BnTPEN)Mn(II) (1) with 4&#8197;eq. ceric ammonium nitrate. 2 has been characterized using UV/Vis, NMR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry. Treatment of 2 with Sc(III)(OTf)3 results in the formation of (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8722;O&#8722;Sc(III) (3), while HClO4 addition to 2 forms (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8722;OH (4), reverting to 2 upon Ce(III)(NO3)3 addition. 2 can also be prepared by the oxidation of 1&#8197;eq. Ce(III)(NO3)3 with [(BnTPEN)Mn(IV)=O]2+ (5). In addition, the EPR spectroscopy revealed the elegant temperature&#8208;dependent equilibria between 2 and Mn(IV) species. The binding of redox&#8208;active Ce(IV) boosts electron transfer efficiency of 2 towards ferrocenes. Remarkably, the newly characterized Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV) species can carry out O&#8208;atom and H&#8208;atom transfer reactions.

         <dc:description>
Complementary aqueous emulsions stabilized by oppositely charged polyelectrolytes form films that adhere many plastic and other surfaces well. However, at both high and low pH these films can be detached, creating a reversible adhesive. Such a glue has many possibilities to change how industries recycle end&#8208;of&#8208;life components. The glue can coat surfaces just like a paint, has a long shelf life, and does not degrade in humid environments, as reported by Mark Geoghegan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310750).

         <title>Cover Picture: Dynamic Stereochemistry of M8Pd6 Supramolecular Cages Based on Metal&#8208;Center Lability for Differential Chiral Induction, Resolution, and Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fruitful stereochemical scenario of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) is demonstrated by Cheng&#8208;Yong Su et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202315053). Based on the intrinsic dynamics of different metal ions, it is shown how the dynamic stereochemistry of the cages is correlated with the coordination lability of the metal centers, and how their chiral induction, resolution and recognition behaviors can be maneuvered through multiple guest interactions, which may enable rational design, control and application of chiral&#8208;MOC containers.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for the Selective Functionalization of Carbon Nanodots Allow Optically Communicating Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface of Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) stands as a rich chemical platform, able to regulate the interactions between particles and external species. Performing selective functionalization of these nanoscale entities is of practical importance, however, it still represents a considerable challenge. In this work, we exploited the organic chemistry toolbox to install target functionalities on the CND surface, while monitoring the chemical changes on the material&#8217;s outer shell through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Following this, we investigated the use of click chemistry to covalently connect CNDs of different nature en&#8208;route towards covalent suprastructures with unprecedent molecular control. The different photophysical properties of the connected particles allowed their optical communication in the excited state. This work paves the way for the development of selective and addressable CND building blocks which can act as modular nanoscale synthons that mirror the long&#8208;established reactivity of molecular organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse Adsorption Separation of N2O/CO2 in AgZK&#8208;5 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrous oxide (N2O), as the third largest greenhouse gas in the world, also has great applications in daily life and industrial production, like anesthetic, foaming agent, combustion supporting agent, N or O atomic donor. The capture of N2O in adipic acid tail gas is of great significance but remains challenging due to the similarity with CO2 in molecular size and physical properties. Herein, the influence of cation types on CO2&#8208;N2O separation in zeolite was studied comprehensively. In particular, the inverse adsorption of CO2&#8208;N2O was achieved by AgZK&#8208;5, which preferentially adsorbs N2O over CO2, making it capable of trapping N2O from an N2O/CO2 mixture. AgZK&#8208;5 shows a recorded N2O/CO2 selectivity of 2.2, and the breakthrough experiment indicates excellent performance for N2O/CO2 separation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that Ag+ has stronger adsorption energy with N2O, and the kinetics of N2O is slightly faster than that of CO2 on AgZK&#8208;5.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Regulated Active Hydrogen Behavior on Molybdenum Disulfide for Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of nitrate waste is promising for environmental remediation and ammonia preparation. This process includes multiple hydrogenation steps, and thus the active hydrogen behavior on the surface of the catalyst is crucial. The crystal phase refers to the atomic arrangements in crystals that have a great effect on active hydrogen, but the influence of the crystal phase on nitrate reduction is still unclear. Herein, enzyme&#8208;mimicking MoS2 in different crystal phases (1T and 2H) are used as models. The Faradaic efficiency of ammonia reaches ~90% over 1T&#8208;MoS2, obviously outperforming that of 2H&#8208;MoS2 (27.31%). In situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations reveal that 1T&#8208;MoS2 produces more active hydrogen on edge S sites at a more positive potential and conducts an effortless pathway from nitrate to ammonia instead of multiple energetically demanding hydrogenation steps (such as *HNO to *HNOH) performed on 2H&#8208;MoS2.</dc:description>

         <title>Confined Lewis Pairs: Investigation of the X&#8208;&#8594;Si20&#160;Interaction in Halogen&#8208;Encapsulating Silafulleranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A joint theoretical and experimental study on 32 endohedral silafullerane derivatives [X@Si20Y20]&#8211; (X&#8211; = F&#8211; &#8208;I&#8211; ; Y = F&#8208;I, H, Me, Et) and Th&#8208;[Cl@Si20H12Y8]&#8211; (Y = F&#8208;I) is presented. First, we evaluated the structure&#8208;determining template effect of Cl&#8211; in a systematic series of concave silapolyquinane model systems. Second, we investigated the X&#8211; &#8594;Si20 interaction energy (Eint) as a function of X&#8211; and Y and found the largest Eint&#160;values for electron&#8208;withdrawing exohedral substituents Y. Given that X&#8211; ions can be considered as Lewis bases and empty Si20Y20 clusters as Lewis acids, we classify our inseparable host&#8208;guest complexes [X@Si20Y20]&#8211; as &#8220;confined Lewis pairs&#8221;. Third, 35Cl NMR spectroscopy proved to be highly diagnostic for
an experimental assessment of the Cl&#8211; &#8594;Si20 interaction as the paramagnetic shielding and, in turn, &#948;(35Cl) of the endohedral Cl&#8211; ion correlate inversely with Eint. Finally, we disclose the synthesis of [PPN][Cl@Si20Y20] (Y = Me, Et, Br) and provide a thorough characterization of these new silafulleranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated [3+1] Fragmentation of White Phosphorus: Access to Acylcyanophosphanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the accessibility of numerous transition metal polyphosphido complexes through transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated activation of white phosphorus, the targeted functionalization of Pn ligands to obtain functional monophosphorus species remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a new [3+1] fragmentation procedure for cyclo&#8208;P4 ligands, leading to the discovery of acylcyanophosphanides and &#8208;phosphanes. Treatment of the complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4)] ([K(18c&#8208;6)]3, BIAN = 1,2&#8208;bis(arylimino)acenaphthene diimine) with acyl chlorides results in the formation of acylated tetraphosphido complexes [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4C(O)R)] (R = tBu, Cy, 1&#8208;Ad, Ph; 4a&#8208;d). Subsequent reaction of 4a&#8208;d with cyanide salts yields acylated cyanophosphanides [RC(O)PCN]&#8722; (9a&#8208;d&#8722;) and the cyclo&#8208;P3 cobaltate anion [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;3&#8208;P3)(CN)]&#8722; (8&#8722;). Further reactions of 4a&#8208;d with trimethylsilyl cyanide (Me3SiCN) and isocyanides provide insight into a plausible mechanism of this [3+1] fragmentation reaction, as these reagents partially displace the P4C(O)R ligand from the cobalt center. Several potential intermediates of the [3+1] fragmentation were characterized. Additionally, the introduction of a second acyl substituent was achieved by treating [K(18c&#8208;6)]9b with CyC(O)Cl, resulting in the first bis(acyl)monocyanophosphine (CyC(O))2PCN (10).</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite the accessibility of numerous transition metal polyphosphido complexes through transition-metal-mediated activation of white phosphorus, the targeted functionalization of Pn ligands to obtain functional monophosphorus species remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a new [3+1] fragmentation procedure for cyclo-P4 ligands, leading to the discovery of acylcyanophosphanides and -phosphanes. Treatment of the complex [K(18c-6)][(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4-P4)] ([K(18c-6)]3, BIAN = 1,2-bis(arylimino)acenaphthene diimine) with acyl chlorides results in the formation of acylated tetraphosphido complexes [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4-P4C(O)R)] (R = tBu, Cy, 1-Ad, Ph; 4a-d). Subsequent reaction of 4a-d with cyanide salts yields acylated cyanophosphanides [RC(O)PCN]&#8722; (9a-d&#8722;) and the cyclo-P3 cobaltate anion [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;3-P3)(CN)]&#8722; (8&#8722;).

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Anhydrous Rare&#8208;Earth Trichlorides from their Oxides in Chloridoaluminate Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wide applications of anhydrous rare&#8208;earth (RE) trichlorides RECl3 in organometallic chemistry, for the synthesis of optical and magnetic materials and as catalysts require a facile approach for their synthesis. The known methods use or produce toxic substances, are complicated and have limited reliability and upscaling. It has been shown that task&#8208;specific ionic liquids (ILs) can dissolve many metal oxides without special reaction conditions at moderate temperature, making the metals accessible to downstream chemistry. Using imidazolium chloridoaluminate ILs, pure crystalline anhydrous RECl3 (RE = La&#8208;Nd, Sm&#8208;Dy) can be synthesized in one step from RE oxides in high yield. The Lewis acidic IL acts as solvent and reaction partner. The by&#8208;product [Al4O2Cl10]2&#8722;, which was detected spectroscopically, remains in solution. The reacted IL can be removed quantitatively by washing. ILs with various imidazolium cations and AlCl3 content and the effect of temperature and reaction time were tested.</dc:description>

         <title>Counterion Effect in Cobaltate&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that countercations exert a remarkable influence on the ability of anionic cobaltate salts to catalyze challenging alkene hydrogenations. An evaluation of the catalytic properties of &#160;[Cat][Co(&#951;4&#8209;cod)2] (Cat = K (1), Na (2), Li (3), (Depnacnac)Mg (4), and N(nBu)4 (5); cod&#160;=&#160;1,5&#8209;cyclooctadiene, Depnacnac = {2,6&#8209;Et2&#8211;C6H3&#8211;N=C(CH3)}2C)]) demonstrated that the lithium salt 3 and magnesium salt 4 drastically outperform the other catalysts. Complex 4 gave the most active catalyst, which readily promotes the hydrogenation of highly congested alkenes under mild conditions. A plausible catalytic mechanism is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations. Furthermore, combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and DFT studies were used to examine the turnover&#8209;limiting migratory insertion step. These results suggest an active co&#8208;catalytic role of the counterion in the hydrogenation reaction through the coordination to cobalt hydride intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor 2&#8208;Tagged Aptamer Chimeras (ITACs) Modular Assembly for Targeted and Efficient Degradation of Two Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overexpression of pathogenic membrane proteins drives abnormal proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Various strategies of durably knockdown membrane proteins with heterobifunctional degraders have been successfully developed, including LYTAC, KineTAC, and AbTAC. However, challenges including complicated synthesis procedures and inability to simultaneously degrade multiple pathogenic proteins still exist. Herein, we developed insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) that link the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;targeting receptor IGF2R and membrane proteins of interest based on specific recognition of aptamers to membrane proteins of interest, and high&#8208;affinity binding of IGF2 to IGF2R. We demonstrated that ITACs exhibit robust degradation efficiency of various membrane proteins in multiple cell lines. Furthermore, systematic studies revealed that moderate IGF2R level in cell surface is responsible for an excellent degradation performance of ITACs. Importantly, we further established a modular assembly strategy that allows assembly of one IGF2 with precise stoichiometry of two aptamers (dITACs), which enables cooperative and simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins. Collectively, this work provides an efficient and facile target membrane protein degradation platform and will shed light on the treatment of diseases related to the over&#8208;expression of membrane proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Self&#8208;assembly: From Passive to Active System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly fundamentally implies small sub&#8208;units organized into large structures or patterns without intervention with specific local interactions. This process is commonly observed in nature, occurring at various scales ranging from atomic/molecular assembly to the formation of complex biological structures. Colloidal particles may serve as micrometer&#8208;scale surrogates for studying assembly, particularly for the poorly understood kinetic and dynamic processes at the atomic scale. Recent advances in colloidal self&#8208;assembly have enabled the programmable creation of novel materials with tailored properties. We here provide an overview and comparison of both passive and active colloidal self&#8208;assembly. In passive colloidal assembly, many impressive and important structures have been realized, including colloidal molecules, one&#8208;dimensional chains, two&#8208;dimensional lattices, and three&#8208;dimensional crystals. In contrast, active colloidal self&#8208;assembly, driven by optical, electric, or chemical fields, involves more intricate dynamic processes, offering more flexibility and potential new applications. A comparative analysis underscores the critical distinctions between passive and active colloidal assemblies, highlighting the unique collective behaviors emerging in active systems. These behaviors encompass collective motion, motility&#8208;induced phase segregation, and exotic properties arising from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics. Through this comparison, we aim to grasp the future opportunities in active assembly research, which may suggest new application domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Double Angstrom&#8208;Scale Confinement in Ti&#8208;deficient Ti0.87O2 Nanosheet Membranes for Ultrahigh&#8208;performance Osmotic Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Osmotic power, a clean energy source, can be harvested from the salinity difference between seawater and river water. However, the output power densities are hampered by the tradeoff between ion selectivity and ion permeability. Here we propose an effective strategy of double angstrom&#8208;scale confinement (DAC) to design ion&#8208;permselective channels with enhanced ion selectivity and permeability simultaneously. The fabricated DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2 membranes possess both Ti atomic vacancies and an interlayer free spacing of ~2.2 &#197;, which not only generates a profitable confinement effect for Na+ ions to enable high ion selectivity but also induces a strong interaction with Na+ ions to benefit high ion permeability. Consequently, when applied to osmotic power generation, the DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2 membranes achieved an ultrahigh power density of 17.8 W m&#8722;2 by mixing 0.5/0.01M NaCl solution and up to 114.2 W m&#8722;2 with a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, far exceeding all the reported macroscopic&#8208;scale membranes. This work highlights the potential of the construction of DAC ion&#8208;permselective channels for two&#8208;dimensional materials in high&#8208;performance nanofluidic energy systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength Selective Photocontrol of Hybrid Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran Photoswitches with Overlapping Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds with multiple photoswitching units are appealing for complex photochemical control of molecular materials and nanostructures. Herein, we synthesized novel meta&#8208; and para&#8208; connected (related to the nitrogen of the indoline) azobenzene&#8209;spiropyran dyads, in which the central benzene unit is shared by both switches. We investigated their photochemistry using static and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations. In the meta&#8209;compound, the individual components are photochemically decoupled due to the meta&#8208;pattern. In the para&#8208;compound the spiro&#8208;connectivity leads to a bifunctional photoswitchable system with a red&#8208;shifted absorption. The azobenzene and the spiropyran can thus be addressed and switched independently by light of appropriate wavelength. Through the different connectivity patterns two different orthogonally photoswitchable systems have been obtained which are promising candidates for complex applications of light control.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Compounds with multiple photoswitching units are appealing for complex photochemical control of molecular materials and nanostructures. Herein, we synthesized novel meta- and para- connected (related to the nitrogen of the indoline) azobenzene&#8209;spiropyran dyads, in which the central benzene unit is shared by both switches. We investigated their photochemistry using static and time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations. In the meta&#8209;compound, the individual components are photochemically decoupled due to the meta-pattern. In the para-compound the spiro-connectivity leads to a bifunctional photoswitchable system with a red-shifted absorption.

         <title>Photochemical [2+4]&#8208;Dimerization Reaction From The Excited State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;maleimides undergo a novel [2+4]&#8208;photodimerization instead of the expected [2+2]&#8208;photodimerization under both direct irradiation with visible light and under sensitized energy transfer conditions. This new excited state reactivity in aryl&#8208;maleimides is deciphered through photochemical, photophysical, and spectroscopic studies. The stereochemistry of the photodimer depends on the type of non&#8208;bonding interactions prevalent during photodimerization which is in turn dictated by the substituents on the maleimide ring. More importantly, the stereochemistry of the photodimer formed is complementary to the product observed under thermal conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Activation of a Microtubule Polymerization Inhibitor via Amide Functionalization of the Ruthenium Photocage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that kills cancer cells via photochemical uncaging of a cytotoxic drug. Most ruthenium&#8208;based photocages used for PACT are activated with blue or green light, which penetrates sub&#8208;optimally into tumor tissues. Here, we report amide functionalization as a tool to fine&#8208;tune the toxicity and excited states of a terpyridine&#8208;based ruthenium photocage. Due to conjugation of the amide group with the terpyridine&#160;&#960;&#160;system in the excited state, the absorption of red light (630 nm) increased 8&#8208;fold, and the photosubstitution rate rose 5&#8208;fold. In vitro, red light activation triggered inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which led to apoptotic cell death both in normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) cancer cells. In vivo, red light irradiation of tumor&#8208;bearing mice demonstrated significant tumor volume reduction (45%) with improved biosafety, thereby demonstrating the clinical potential of this compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Partially Ion&#8208;Paired Solvation Structure Design for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving increased energy density under extreme operating conditions remains a major challenge in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an all&#8208;fluorinated ester&#8208;based electrolyte comprising partially fluorinated carboxylate and carbonate esters. This electrolyte exhibits temperature&#8208;resilient physicochemical properties and moderate ion&#8208;paired solvation, leading to a half solvent&#8208;separated and half contact&#8208;ion pair in a sole electrolyte. As a result, facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anions/fluorinated co&#8208;solvents for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity (&gt; 1 mS cm&#8208;1 even at &#8208;40 &#176;C). These advantageous features were found to apply to both lithium metal and sulfur&#8208;based electrodes even under extreme operating conditions, allowing stable cycling of Li||sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) full cells with high SPAN loading (&gt; 3.5 mAh cm&#8208;2) and thin Li anode (50 &#181;m) at &#8208;40, 23 and 50 &#176;C. This work offers a promising path for designing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes to support high energy density Li metal batteries operating in extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells: The Important Role of Seed Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive engineering has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Among additives, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have a similar chemical composition and matched lattice structure with the perovskite matrix, which can effectively enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, relevant studies remain limited, and most of them focus on bromide&#8208;involved perovskite NCs, which may undergo dissolution and ion exchange within the FAPbI3 host, potentially resulting in an enlarged bandgap. In this work, we employ butylamine&#8208;capped CsPbI3 NCs (BPNCs) as additives in PSCs, which can be well maintained and serve as seeds for regulating the crystallization and growth of perovskite films. The resultant perovskite film exhibits larger domain sizes and fewer grain boundaries without compromising the bandgap. Moreover, BPNCs can alleviate lattice strain and reduce defect densities within the active layer. The PSCs incorporating BPNCs show a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.41%, well over both Control of 22.09% and oleic acid/oleylamine capped CsPbI3 NC (PNC)&#8208;based devices of 23.11%. This work illustrates the key role of nanosized seed surfaces in achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple and Efficient Synthesis of Novel Tetramers with Enhanced Glass Transition Temperature for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomer acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered substantial attention owing to their impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability. However, the simple and efficient synthesis of oligomer acceptors with higher glass transition temperatures (Tg) remains a formidable challenge.&#160;In this study, we propose an innovative strategy for the synthesis of tetramers, denoted as Tet&#8208;n,&#160;with elevated Tgs, achieved through only two consecutive Stille coupling reactions. Importantly, our strategy significantly reduces the redundancy in reaction steps compared to conventional methods for linear tetramer synthesis, thereby improving both reaction efficiency and yield. Furthermore, the OSC based on PM6:Tet&#8208;1 attains a&#160;high PCE of&#160;17.32%, and&#160;the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:Tet&#8208;1 ternary device achieves an even more higher&#160;PCE of 19.31%. Remarkably, the binary device based on the Tet&#8208;1 tetramer demonstrates outstanding operational stability, retaining 80% of the initial efficiency (T80) even after 1706 h of continuous illumination, which is primarily attributed to the enhanced Tg&#160;(247 &#186;C) and lower diffusion coefficient (1.56 &#180;&#160;10&#8208;27&#160;cm2&#160;s&#8208;1).&#160;This work&#160;demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in the straightforward and efficient synthesis of tetramers materials with higher Tgs, thus offering a viable pathway for developing high&#8208;efficiency&#160;and stable OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Growth Regulation of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites via Self&#8208;Assembly of Semiconductor Spacers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal growth and orientation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite films significantly impact solar cell performance. Here, we incorporated robust quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions to govern the crystal growth of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites. This was achieved through the development of two unique semiconductor spacers,&#160; namely PTMA and 5FPTMA, with different dipole moments. The ((5FPTMA)0.1(PTMA)0.9)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n = 5, 5F/PTMA&#8208;Pb) film shows a preferred vertical orientation, reduced grain boundaries, and released residual strain compared to (PTMA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n=5, PTMA&#8208;Pb), resulting in a decreased exciton binding energy and reduced electron&#8208;phonon coupling coefficients. In contrast to PTMA&#8208;Pb device with an efficiency of 15.66%, the 5F/PTMA&#8208;Pb device achieved a champion efficiency of 18.56%, making it among the best efficiency for 2D RP perovskite solar cells employing an MA&#8208;based semiconductor spacer. This work offers significant insights into comprehending the crystal growth process of 2D RP perovskite films through the utilization of quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions between semiconductor spacers.</dc:description>

The ((5FPTMA)0.1(PTMA)0.9)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n = 5, 5F/PTMA-Pb) film shows a preferred vertical orientation, reduced grain boundaries, and released residual strain compared to (PTMA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n=5, PTMA-Pb), resulting in a decreased exciton binding energy and reduced electron-phonon coupling coefficients. In contrast to PTMA-Pb device with an efficiency of 15.66%, the 5F/PTMA-Pb device achieved a champion efficiency of 18.56%, making it among the best efficiency for 2D RP perovskite solar cells employing an MA-based semiconductor spacer. This work offers significant insights into comprehending the crystal growth process of 2D RP perovskite films through the utilization of quadrupole-quadrupole interactions between semiconductor spacers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Design of a Participatory Peptide Nucleic Acid Duplex Crosslinker to Enhance the Stiffness of Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are employed in the design of a participatory duplex PNA&#8208;peptide crosslinking agent. Biophysical and mechanical studies show that crosslinkers present during peptide assembly leading to hydrogelation participate in the formation of fibrils while simultaneously installing crosslinks into the higher&#8208;order network that constitutes the peptide gel. The addition of 2 mol% crosslinker into the assembling system results in a ~100% increase in mechanical stiffness without affecting the rate of peptide assembly or the local morphology of fibrils within the gel network. Stiffness enhancement is realized by only affecting change in the elastic component of the viscoelastic gel. A synthesis of the PNA&#8208;peptide duplex crosslinkers is provided that allows facile variation in peptide composition and addresses the notorious hydrophobic content of PNAs. This crosslinking system represents a new tool for modulating the mechanical properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Drives the Electrochemical Oxidation of Silane to Silanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), characterized by a four&#8208;electron transfer kinetic process, represents a significant bottleneck in improving the efficiency of hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Consequently, extensive research efforts have been directed towards identifying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with exceptional OER performance. Despite the comprehensive understanding of the OER mechanism, its application to other valuable synthetic reactions has been limited. Herein, we leverage the MOOH intermediate, a key species in the Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalyst (Mn&#8208;SA@NC), which can be cyclically delivered in the OER. We exploit this intermediate's capability to facilitate electrophilic transfer with silane, enabling efficient silane oxidation under electrochemical conditions. The SAC electrocatalytic system exhibits remarkable performance with catalyst loadings as low as 600 ppm and an exceptional turnover number of 9132. Furthermore, the catalytic method demonstrates stability under a 10 mmol flow chemistry setup. By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn&#8208;SA@NC drives the entire reaction, establishing a practical Mn SAC&#8208;catalyzed organic electrosynthesis system. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Exchange in 3D Cell Culture Hydrogels Based on Crosslinking of Cyclic Thiosulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic polymer materials are highly valued substrates for 3D cell culture due to their time&#8208;dependent mechanical properties, such as viscoelasticity, that can be tuned to resemble the energy dissipation of native tissues. Herein, we report coupling of a cyclic thiosulfinate, mono&#8208;S&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;methyl asparagusic acid, to a 4&#8208;arm PEG to prepare disulfide&#8208;based dynamic covalent hydrogels with the addition of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;thiol. Ring opening of the cyclic&#160;thiosulfinate by nucleophilic substitution results in the rapid formation of a network showing a viscoelastic fluid&#8208;like behaviour and relaxation rates modulated by thiol content through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange, whereas its viscoelastic behaviour upon application as a small molecule linear crosslinker is solid&#8208;like. Further introduction of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;vinylsulfone in the network yields a hydrogel with weeks&#8208;long cell culture stability, permitting 3D culture of cell types that lack robust proliferation such as human pluripotent stem cell derived&#8208;cardiomyocytes (hPSC&#8208;CMs). These cells display native behaviours such as cell elongation and spontaneous beating as a function of the hydrogel mechanical properties. We demonstrate that the mode of dynamic cyclic thiosulfinate crosslinker presentation within the network can result in different stress relaxation profiles opening the door to model tissues with disparate mechanics in 3D cell culture.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoscale Clusters in the Crystallisation of Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The early stages of the molecular self&#8208;assembly pathway leading to crystal nucleation have a significant influence on the properties and purity of organic materials. This mini review collates the work on organic mesoscale clusters and discusses their importance in nucleation processes, with a particular focus on their critical properties and susceptibility to sample treatment parameters. This is accomplished by a review of detection methods, including dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Considering the challenges associated with crystallization of flexible and large&#8208;molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients, the dynamic nature of mesoscale clusters has the potential to expand the discovery of novel crystal forms. By collating literature on mesoscale clusters for organic molecules, a more comprehensive understanding of their role in nucleation will evolve and can guide further research efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Aqueous Micellar Organometallic Catalysis: Methane Functionalization as a Case Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations is a powerful tool that provide a 3D perspective of the dynamical behavior of chemical system. Herein the first MD study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic system, in micellar media, is presented. The challenging methane catalytic functionalization into ethyl propionate through a silver&#8208;catalyzed process has been targeted as the case study. The intimate nature of the micelles formed with the surfactants sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and potassium perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been ascertained, as well as the relative distribution of the main actors in this transformation, namely methane, the diazo reagent and the silver catalyst, the latter in two different forms: the initial compound and a silver&#8208;carbene intermediate. Catalyst deactivation occurs with halide containing surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and Triton X&#8208;100. Computed simulations allow explaining the experimental results, indicating that micelles behave differently regarding the degree of accumulation and the local distribution of the reactants and their effect in the molecular collisions leading to net reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Approach for Sustainable Urea Synthesis via Intermediate Assembly at the Electrode/Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic C&#8211;N coupling process is indeed a sustainable alternative for direct urea synthesis and co&#8208;upgrading of carbon dioxide and nitrate wastes. However, the main challenge lies in the unactivated C&#8211;N coupling process. Here, we proposed a strategy of intermediate assembly with alkali metal cations to activate C&#8211;N coupling at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Urea synthesis activity follows the trend of Li+ &lt; Na+ &lt; Cs+ &lt; K+. In the presence of K+, a world&#8208;record performance was achieved with a urea yield rate of 212.8&#177;10.6 mmol h&#8211;1 g&#8211;1 on a single&#8208;atom Co supported TiO2 catalyst at &#8211;0.80 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Theoretical calculations and operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the energy barriers of C&#8211;N coupling were significantly decreased via K+ mediated intermediate assembly. By applying this strategy to various catalysts, we demonstrate that intermediate assembly at the electrode/electrolyte interface is a universal approach to boost sustainable urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Iminophosphorane Catalyzed Amide Enolization for Enantioselective Cyclohexadienone Desymmetrisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the organocatalytic enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding 3D fused N&#8208;heterocycles. The transformation represents the first nucleophilic activation of carboxamides via &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective reaction, and can be achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Bioorthogonal Reaction Enable the Enrichment of Photosensitizers and Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors for Pretargeted Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a tumor&#8208;pretargted theranostic approach for multimodality imaging&#8208;guided synergistic cancer PDT by cascade alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Using the enzymatic catalysis of ALP that continuously catalyses the dephosphorylation and self&#8208;assembly of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO)&#8208;bearing P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO, a high density of fluorescent and magnetic TCO&#8208;containing nanoparticles (FMNPs&#8208;TCO) can be synthesized and retained on the membrane of tumor cells. They can act as &#8216;artificial antigens&#8217; amenable to concurrently capture lately administrated tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;decorated PS (775NP&#8208;Tz) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor (SA&#8208;Tz) via the fast IEDDA reaction. This two&#8208;step pretargeting process can further induce FMNPs&#8208;TCO regrowth into microparticles (FMNPs&#8208;775/SA) directly on tumor cell membranes, which is analyzed by bio&#8208;SEM and fluorescence imaging. Thus, efficient enrichment of both SA&#8208;Tz and 775NP&#8208;Tz in tumors can be achieved, allowing to alleviate hypoxia by continuously inhibiting CA activity and improving PDT of tumors. Findings show that subcutaneous HeLa tumors could be completely eradicated and no tumor recurred after irradiation with an 808 nm laser (0.33 W cm&#8208;2, 10 min). This pretargeted approach may be applied to enrich other therapeutic agents in tumors to improve targeted therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Heteromorphosis Multi&#8208;Cavity Cages: Tension&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Expansion Strategy for Controllable Enhancement of Complexity in Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordinative supramolecular cages with adjustable cavities have found extensive applications in various fields, but the cavity modification strategies for multi&#8208;functional structures are still challenging. Here, we present a tension&#8208;driven self&#8208;expansion strategy for construction of multi&#8208;cavity cages with high structural complexity. Under the regulation of strain&#8208;induced capping ligands, unprecedented heteromorphosis triple&#8208;cavity cages S2/S4 were obtained based on a metallo&#8208;organic ligand (MOL) scaffold. The heteromorphosis cages exhibited significant higher cavity diversity than the homomorphous double&#8208;cavity cages S1/S3; all of the cages were thoroughly characterized through various analytical techniques including (1D and 2D) NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, TWIM&#8208;MS, AFM, and SAXS analyses. Furthermore, the encapsulation of porphyrin in the cavities of these multi&#8208;cavity cages were investigated. This research opens up new possibilities for the architecture of heteromorphosis supramolecular cages via precisely controlled &#8220;scaffold&#8208;capping&#8221; assembly with preorganized ligands, which could have potential applications in the development of multifunctional structures with higher complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Electrochemical Liberation of Hydrogen from Sodium Borohydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has earned recognition as a promising hydrogen carrier, attributed to its exceptional hydrogen storage capacity, boasting a high theoretical storage capacity of 10.8 wt%. Nonetheless, the utilization of traditional pyrolysis and hydrolysis methods still presents a formidable challenge in achieving controlled hydrogen generation especially under ambient conditions. In this work, we report an innovative electrochemical strategy for production H2 by coupling NaBH4 electrooxidation reaction (BOR) at anode in alkaline media with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathode in acidic media. To implement this, we have developed a bifunctional electrocatalyst denoted as Pd&#8208;Mo2C@CNTs, wherein Pd nanoparticles are grown in&#8208;situ on Mo2C embedded within N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes. This electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in catalyzing both alkaline BOR and acidic HER. We have developed a hybrid acid/alkali cell, utilizing Pd/Mo2C@CNTs as the anode and cathode electrocatalysts. This configuration showcases remarkable capabilities for self&#8208;sustained, precise, and uninterrupted indirect release of H2 stored in NaBH4, even at high current densities of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 with a Faraday efficiency approaching 100%. Additionally, this electrochemical device exhibits significant promise as a fuel cell, with the ability to deliver a maximum power density of 20 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ultraviolet Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Resonance Phosphine Oxide Polycyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient ultraviolet (UV) electroluminescent materials remain a great challenge, since short peak wavelength &lt;400 nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) &lt;50 nm are simultaneously required. In this sense, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring narrow&#8208;band emissions hold the promise for UV applications. Herein, a novel MR&#8208;TADF skeleton featuring carbazole&#8208;phosphine oxide (P=O) fused aromatics is developed to construct the first two UV MR emitters named CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO. In addition to synergistic resonance effects of P=O and N atom, sp3&#8208;hybrid P atom renders the curved polycyclic planes of CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO, giving rise to their narrowband UV emissions with peak wavelengths &lt;390 nm and FWHM&lt;35 nm. Besides configuration quasi&#8208;planarization for radiation enhancement and quenching suppression, P=O moiety further enhances singlet&#8208;triplet coupling to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence quantum yield of 62% in tBCzP2PO doped films. As consequence, tBCzP2PO endowed its UV organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with the peak at 382 nm and FWHM of 32 nm, and especially the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.1% among all kinds of UV devices. Our results demonstrate great potential of P=O based MR emitters in practical applications including optoelectronics, biology and medicine science.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Natural Potent HMG&#8208;CoA Reductase Degraders for Lowering Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploitation of key protected wild plant resources makes great sense, but their limited populations become the major barrier. A particular strategy for breaking this barrier was inspired by the exploration of a resource&#8208;saving fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23, which inhabits the key protected wild plant Schisandra macrocarpa. Chemical studies on the cultures of this strain afforded eight novel indole diterpenoids, schipenindolenes A&#8211;H (1&#8211;8), belonging to six diverse skeleton types. Importantly, the ingenious semisyntheses implied some key nonenzymatic reactions constructing these molecules, and acquired targeted ones especially schipenindolene A (Spid A, 1) with low natural abundance. Remarkably, Spid A was the most potent HMG&#8208;CoA reductase (HMGCR) degrader among the indole diterpenoid family, degraded statin&#8208;induced accumulation of HMGCR protein, decreased cholesterol level and acted synergistically with statin to further lower cholesterol. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling suggested that Spid A potentially activated the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to enhance the degradation of HMGCR, and simultaneously inhibited statin&#8208;activated expressions of many key enzymes in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis pathway, thereby strengthening the efficacy of statins and potentially reducing the side effects of statins. Collectively, this study suggests the potential of Spid A for treating cardiovascular disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;aggregation as A Simple Strategy for Preparing Fluorogenic Tetrazine Probes with On&#8208;demand Fluorogen Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life science has progressed with applications of fluorescence probes &#8212; fluorophores linked to functional units responding to biological events. To meet the varied demands across experiments, simple organic reactions to connect fluorophores and functional units have been developed, enabling the on&#8208;demand selection of fluorophore&#8208;functional unit combinations. However, organic synthesis requires professional equipment and skills, standing as a daunting task for life scientists. In this study, we present a simple, fast, and convenient strategy for probe preparation: co&#8208;aggregation of hydrophobic molecules. We focused on tetrazine &#8212; a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;prepare yet useful functional unit that provides effective bioorthogonal reactivity and strong fluorogenicity. Simply mixing the tetrazine molecules and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens in water, co&#8208;aggregation is induced, and the emission of AIE luminogens is quenched. Subsequent click reaction bioorthogonally turns on the emission, identifying these coaggregates as fluorogenic probes. Thanks to this bioorthogonal fluorogenicity, we established a new time&#8208;gated fluorescence bioimaging technique to distinguish overlapping emission signals, enabling multi&#8208;organelle imaging with two same&#8208;color fluorophores. Our study showcases the potential of this co&#8208;aggregation method for the on&#8208;demand preparation of fluorescent probes as well as protocols and molecular design principles in this approach, offering an effective solution to evolving needs in life science research.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel vanadium hydroxide&#8208;phosphate, NH4VPO4OH, was synthesized hydrothermally in V2O5&#8211;NH4H2PO4&#8211;citric acid system at 230&#176;C. It was characterized by XRD, TG&#8208;DSC, TEM&#8208;EDX, SEM, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. NH4VPO4OH is isostructural with NH4GaPO4OH and features edge&#8208;sharing chains of VO6 octahedra. These chains running along [010] direction of the unit cell are connected by phosphate tetrahedra to form infinite layers parallel to the (100) plane. Ammonium cations are embedded between the heteropolyhedral layers. According to the thermodynamic and NMR measurements supported by the first&#8208;principles calculations, NH4VPO4OH presents a rare case of Haldane spin system with spin S=1 based on V3+ ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Bridged Benzazepines via Photo&#8208;Induced Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient protocol is developed to convert simple aromatic substrates into value&#8208;added and structurally complex bridged benzazepines via a photocatalytic dearomatization. The switchable diastereoselectivity could be furnished by the manipulation of base&#8208;promoted or photoinduced intramolecular hydroamination.







Abstract
Bridged benzazepine scaffolds, possessing unique structural and physicochemical activities, are widespread in various natural products and drugs. The construction of these skeletons often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Herein, we develop a simple and divergent approach for constructing various bridged benzazepines by a photocatalytic intermolecular dearomatization of naphthalene derivatives with readily available &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The bridged motif is created via a cascade sequence involving photocatalytic 1,4&#8208;hydroaminoalkylation, alkene isomerization and cyclization. Interestingly, the diastereoselectivity can be regulated through different reaction modes in the cyclization step. Moreover, aminohydroxylation and its further bromination have also been demonstrated to access highly functionalized bridged benzazepines. Preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to get insights into the mechanism. This method provides a divergent synthetic approach for construction of highly functionalized bridged benzazepines, which have been otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Combinatorial Ligand Assisted Simultaneous Control of Axial and Central Chirality in Highly Stereoselective C&#8722;H Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of converging multiple stereocenters in asymmetric catalysis brings exciting avenues for expanding the &#8216;chiral pool&#8217;. With this aim, a dual&#8208;cooperative ligand system was developed for controlling two distinct stereo&#8208;environment in an atropselective C&#8722;H allylation of biaryls. The system leverages a chiral amino acid as a transient&#8208;ligand source and chiral phosphoric acid for the early C&#8722;H activation step. The DFT studies present a rich mechanistic model, authenticating the extensive experimental findings.







Abstract
The significance of stereoselective C&#8722;H bond functionalization thrives on its direct application potential to pharmaceuticals or complex chiral molecule synthesis. Complication arises when there are multiple stereogenic elements such as a center and an axis of chirality to control. Over the years cooperative assistance of multiple chiral ligands has been applied to control only chiral centers. In this work, we harness the essence of cooperative ligand approach to control two different stereogenic elements in the same molecule by atroposelective allylation to synthesize axially chiral biaryls from its racemic precursor. The crucial roles played by chiral phosphoric acid and chiral amino acid ligand in concert helped us to obtain one major stereoisomer out of four distinct possibilities.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeting Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanocomposites for Amplified Theranostics of Bone Metastasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;targeting biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanocomposite is developed for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis. The nanocomposite enables efficient tumor homing after dual&#8208;targeting effect towards both cancer cells and osteoclasts, and thus achieves bone metastasis diagnosis and effective inhibition of tumor growth via mediating dual&#8208;model imaging at bone metastasis sites and a combined therapy against cancer cells and osteoclasts.







Abstract
Bone metastasis is a type of metastatic tumors that involves the spreads of malignant tumor cells into skeleton, and its diagnosis and treatment remain a big challenge due to the unique tumor microenvironment. We herein develop osteoclast and tumor cell dual&#8208;targeting biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanocomposites (SPFeNOC) for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis. SPFeNOC contain semiconducting polymer and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles inside core and surface camouflaged hybrid membrane of cancer cells and osteoclasts. The hybrid membrane camouflage enables their targeting to both metastatic tumor cells and osteoclasts in bone metastasis through homologous targeting mechanism, thus achieving an enhanced nanoparticle accumulation in tumors. The semiconducting polymer mediates near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and Fe3O4 nanoparticles are used for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Because both cancer cells and osteoclasts are killed synchronously via the combinational action of SDT and CDT, the vicious cycle in bone metastasis is broken to realize high antitumor efficacy. Therefore, 4T1 breast cancer&#8208;based bone metastasis can be effectively detected and cured by using SPFeNOC as dual&#8208;targeting theranostic nanoagents. This study provides an unusual biomimetic nanoplatform that simultaneously targets osteoclasts and cancer cells for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-targeting biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanocomposite is developed for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis. The nanocomposite enables efficient tumor homing after dual-targeting effect towards both cancer cells and osteoclasts, and thus achieves bone metastasis diagnosis and effective inhibition of tumor growth via mediating dual-model imaging at bone metastasis sites and a combined therapy against cancer cells and osteoclasts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone metastasis is a type of metastatic tumors that involves the spreads of malignant tumor cells into skeleton, and its diagnosis and treatment remain a big challenge due to the unique tumor microenvironment. We herein develop osteoclast and tumor cell dual-targeting biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanocomposites (SPFeN&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis. SPFeN&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; contain semiconducting polymer and iron oxide (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles inside core and surface camouflaged hybrid membrane of cancer cells and osteoclasts. The hybrid membrane camouflage enables their targeting to both metastatic tumor cells and osteoclasts in bone metastasis through homologous targeting mechanism, thus achieving an enhanced nanoparticle accumulation in tumors. The semiconducting polymer mediates near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles are used for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Because both cancer cells and osteoclasts are killed synchronously via the combinational action of SDT and CDT, the vicious cycle in bone metastasis is broken to realize high antitumor efficacy. Therefore, 4T1 breast cancer-based bone metastasis can be effectively detected and cured by using SPFeN&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; as dual-targeting theranostic nanoagents. This study provides an unusual biomimetic nanoplatform that simultaneously targets osteoclasts and cancer cells for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Determination of Reaction Kinetics by Time&#8208;Resolved Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering during Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: Direct Evidence for Monomer&#8208;Swollen Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic SAXS model for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) formulations has been developed by applying the law of conservation of mass. Time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data are analyzed to determine the kinetics of polymerization directly during the synthesis of spherical nanoparticles. This new analytical approach enables calculation of the mass transport of monomer and solvent in and out of the growing nanoparticles.







Abstract
The kinetics of heterogeneous polymerization is determined directly using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). This important advancement is exemplified for the synthesis of sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate (BzMA) in mineral oil at 90&#8201;&#176;C. The principle of mass balance is invoked to derive a series of equations for the analysis of the resulting time&#8208;resolved SAXS patterns. Importantly, there is a continuous change in the X&#8208;ray scattering length density for the various components within the reaction mixture. This enables the volume fraction of unreacted BzMA monomer to be calculated at any given time point, which enables the polymerization kinetics to be monitored in situ directly without relying on supplementary characterization techniques. Moreover, SAXS enables the local concentration of both monomer and solvent within the growing swollen nanoparticles to be determined during the polymerization. Data analysis reveals that the instantaneous rate of BzMA polymerization is proportional to the local monomer concentration within the nanoparticles. In principle, this powerful new time&#8208;resolved SAXS approach can be applicable to other heterogeneous polymerization formulations.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Promoted Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer for the Synthesis of Hydrazines and Triazanes through N&#8208;Amidation of Arylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky alkylphosphines (PtBu3) can switch the roles from actor to spectator ligands to promote the FeCl2&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;amidation reaction of arylamines with dioxazolones leading to hydrazides in high efficiency and chemoselectivity. The new ligand&#8208;promoted N&#8208;amidation protocols offer a convenient way to access various challenging triazane compounds via double or sequential N&#8208;amidation of primary arylamines.







Abstract
Herein, we report that bulky alkylphosphines such as PtBu3 can switch the roles from actor to spectator ligands to promote the FeCl2&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;amidation reaction of arylamines with dioxazolones, giving hydrazides in high efficiency and chemoselectivity. Mechanistic studies indicated that the phosphine ligands could facilitate the decarboxylation of dioxazolones on the Fe center, and the hydrogen bonding interactions between the arylamines and the ligands on Fe nitrenoid intermediates might play a role in modulating the delicate interplay between the phosphine ligand, arylamine, and acyl nitrene N, favoring N&#8722;N coupling over N&#8722;P coupling. The new ligand&#8208;promoted N&#8208;amidation protocols offer a convenient way to access various challenging triazane compounds via double or sequential N&#8208;amidation of primary arylamines.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Incargranine A Enabled by Bifunctional Iminophosphorane and Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;incargranine A has been completed in nine steps. An enantioselective, organocatalysed dienone desymmetrising Michael addition and an iridium&#8208;catalysed reductive cyclisation were developed to access a key hemiaminal intermediate that was used to initiate a biomimetic cascade towards the natural product.







Abstract
Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;incargranine A, in nine steps. The total synthesis was enabled by an enantioselective intramolecular organocatalysed desymmetrising Michael addition of a malonamate ester to a linked dienone substrate that established pivotal stereocentres with excellent enantio&#8208; and complete diastereoselectivity. Furthermore, a key hemiaminal intermediate was accessed by developing an iridium&#8208;catalysed reductive cyclisation, and the scope of this transformation was explored to produce a range of bicyclic hemiaminal motifs. Once installed, the hemiaminal motif was used to initiate a biomimetic cascade to access the natural product directly in a single step.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;bridged Fe&#8208;Cu Atomic Pair Sites for Efficient Electrochemical Ammonia Production and Electricity Generation with Zn&#8208;NO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed nitrogen&#8208;bridged Fe&#8208;Cu atomic pair sites exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for producing ammonia from nitrite electroreduction. The constructed Zn&#8208;nitrite battery can generate electricity and manufacture ammonia directly and simultaneously.







Abstract
The development of environmentally sustainable and highly efficient technologies for ammonia production is crucial for the future advancement of carbon&#8208;neutral energy systems. The nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) for generating NH3 is a promising alternative to the low&#8208;efficiency nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), owing to the low N=O bond energy and high solubility of nitrite. In this study, we designed a highly efficient dual&#8208;atom catalyst with Fe&#8208;Cu atomic pair sites (termed FeCu DAC), and the as&#8208;developed FeCu DAC was able to afford a remarkable NH3 yield of 24,526&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) for NH3 production of 99.88&#8201;%. The FeCu DAC also exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in a Zn&#8208;NO2 battery, achieving a record&#8208;breaking power density of 23.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maximum NH3 FE of 92.23&#8201;% at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical simulation demonstrated that the incorporation of the Cu atom changed the energy of the Fe 3d orbital and lowered the energy barrier, thereby accelerating the NO2RR. This study not only demonstrates the potential of galvanic nitrite&#8208;based cells for expanding the field of Zn&#8208;based batteries, but also provides fundamental interpretation for the synergistic effect in highly dispersed dual&#8208;atom catalysts.

Non&#8208;metallic NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage is reported in high&#8208;redox&#8208;active carbonyls fully exposed organic superstructures, which conquers the kinetics barrier of sluggish Zn2+ ions and structural instability of repeated Zn2+ insertion in aqueous electrolytes. A two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron NH4+/H+ co&#8208;coordination mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, superior rate capability and ultralong life.







Abstract
Compared with Zn2+ storage, non&#8208;metallic charge carrier with small hydrated size and light weight shows fast dehydration and diffusion kinetics for Zn&#8208;organic batteries. Here we first report NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage in self&#8208;assembled organic superstructures (OSs) by intermolecular interactions of p&#8208;benzoquinone (BQ) and 2, 6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DQ) polymer through H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. BQ&#8208;DQ OSs exhibit exposed quadruple&#8208;active carbonyl motifs and super electron delocalization routes, which are redox&#8208;exclusively coupled with high&#8208;kinetics NH4+/H+ but exclude sluggish and rigid Zn2+ ions. A unique 4e&#8722; NH4+/H+ co&#8208;coordination mechanism is unravelled, giving BQ&#8208;DQ cathode high capacity (299&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current tolerance (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ultralong life (50,000 cycles). This strategy further boosts the capacity to 358&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 by modulating redox&#8208;active building units, giving new insights into ultra&#8208;fast and stable NH4+/H+ storage in organic materials for better Zn batteries.

         <title>Integrating Host Design and Tailored Electronic Effects of Yolk&#8211;Shell Zn&#8722;Mn Diatomic Sites for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly accessible yolk&#8211;shell structure and tailored electronic effects of the dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalyst (DASC) Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC endow it with excellent performance in the conversion of CO2 into CO in both an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell. Robust interactions with the Zn&#8722;Mn dual site, which shows an ideal adsorption strength for COOH*, effectively decrease the energy barrier of the reaction, thereby enhancing the inherent activity of CO2 reduction on the DASC.







Abstract
Modulating the surface and spatial structure of the host is associated with the reactivity of the active site, and also enhances the mass transfer effect of the CO2 electroreduction process (CO2RR). Herein, we describe the development of two&#8208;step ligand etch&#8211;pyrolysis to access an asymmetric dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalyst (DASC) composed of a yolk&#8211;shell carbon framework (Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC) derived from S,N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8722;Mn dimers anchored on a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC, the electronic effects of the S/N&#8722;Zn&#8722;Mn&#8722;S/N configuration are tailored by strong interactions between Zn&#8722;Mn dual sites and co&#8208;coordination with S/N atoms, rendering structural stability and atomic distribution. In an H&#8208;cell, the Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC DASC shows a low onset overpotential of 50&#8197;mV and high CO Faraday efficiency of 97&#8201;% with a low applied overpotential of 343&#8197;mV, thus outperforming counterparts, and in a flow cell, it also reaches a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V, benefitting from the high structure accessibility and active dual sites. DFT simulations showed that the S,N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8722;Mn diatomic site with optimal adsorption strength of COOH* lowers the reaction energy barrier, thus boosting the intrinsic CO2RR activity on DASC. The structure&#8208;property correlation found in this study suggests new ideas for the development of highly accessible atomic catalysts.

         <title>A Rigid Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Core Toward Stable Electroluminescence and Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising rigid and stable multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence lasing core CzBN was proposed. Benefitting from the enhanced molecular rigidity, photo&#8208;, thermal&#8208;stability, and effective separation of excited&#8208;state absorptions, its derivative CzBNPh demonstrated a low lasing threshold of 0.68&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in distributed feedback resonators. Furthermore, CzBNPh exhibited much improved stability in electroluminescent and lasing performance.







Abstract
The investigation of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic laser devices with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is emerging due to the potential of harnessing triplets. In this work, a boron/nitrogen multiple&#8208;resonance TADF polycyclic framework fusing carbazole units (CzBNPh) was proposed. CzBNPh exhibited a narrowband emission (&lt;30&#8197;nm), a unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and a fast radiative rate. Consequently, CzBNPh demonstrated a low distributed feedback (DFB) lasing threshold of 0.68&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the stimulated emission zone of CzBNPh was effectively separated from its singlet and triplet absorption, thereby minimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation under long&#8208;pulsed excitation ranging from 20&#8197;&#956;s to 2.5&#8197;ms. Significantly, the enhanced rigid molecular conformation, thermal stability, and photo&#8208;stability resulted in improved lasing and electroluminescence stability compared to that of 5,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene (DABNA)&#8208;core. These findings indicate the potential of CzBN&#8208;core as a promising framework for achieving long&#8208;pulsed wave and electrically&#8208;pumped lasing in the future.

         <title>Defects&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Atom Anchoring on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical strategy was applied to fabricate the defects on MOFs. And the defects further induced the anchoring of Ru single atoms. The photocatalytic activity in N2 reduction to produce ammonia has been greatly improved to 53.28&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 on Ru1/d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.34&#8201;% at 300&#8197;nm and 0.04&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Aiming to improve the photocatalytic activity in N2 fixation to produce ammonia, herein, we proposed a photochemical strategy to fabricate defects, and further deposition of Ru single atoms onto UiO&#8208;66 (Zr) framework. Electron&#8208;metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) were built between Ru single atoms and the support via a covalently bonding. EMSI were capable of accelerating charge transfer between Ru SAs and UiO&#8208;66, which was favorable for highly&#8208;efficiently photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic production rate of ammonia improved from 4.57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 to 16.28&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with the fabrication of defects onto UiO&#8208;66, and further to 53.28&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with Ru&#8208;single atoms loading. From the DFT results, it was found that d&#8208;orbital electrons of Ru were donated to N2 &#960;&#10038;&#8208;antibonding orbital, facilitating the activation of the N&#8801;N triple bond. A distal reaction pathway was probably occurred for the photocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia on Ru1/d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (single Ru sites decorated onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66), and the first step of hydrogenation of N2 was the reaction determination step. This work shed a light on improving the photocatalytic activity via feasibly anchoring single atoms on MOF, and provided more evidences to understand the reaction mechanism in photocatalytic reduction of N2.

         <title>Corner Engineering: Tailoring Enzymes for Enhanced Resistance and Thermostability in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directed evolution strategy called corner engineering was developed to tailor enzyme resistance towards deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and high temperatures.







Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), heralded for their synthesis simplicity, economic viability, and reduced volatility and flammability, have found increasing application in biocatalysis. However, challenges persist due to a frequent diminution in enzyme activity and stability. Herein, we developed a general protein engineering strategy, termed corner engineering, to acquire DES&#8208;resistant and thermostable enzymes via precise tailoring of the transition region in enzyme structure. Employing Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA) as a model, we delineated the engineering process, yielding five multi&#8208;DESs resistant variants with highly improved thermostability, such as K88E/N89&#8197;K exhibited up to a 10.0&#8208;fold catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) increase in 30&#8201;% (v/v) choline chloride (ChCl): acetamide and 4.1&#8208;fold in 95&#8201;% (v/v) ChCl: ethylene glycol accompanying 6.7&#8208;fold thermal resistance improvement than wild type at &#8776;50&#8201;&#176;C. The generality of the optimized approach was validated by two extra industrial enzymes, endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,4&#8208;glucanase PvCel5A (used for biofuel production) and esterase Bs2Est (used for plastics degradation). The molecular investigations revealed that increased water molecules at substrate binding cleft and finetuned helix formation at the corner region are two dominant determinants governing elevated resistance and thermostability. This study, coupling corner engineering with obtained molecular insights, illuminates enzyme&#8208;DES interaction patterns and fosters the rational design of more DES&#8208;resistant and thermostable enzymes in biocatalysis and biotransformation.

         <title>Preserving Structurally Labile Peptide Nanosheets After Molecular Functionalization of the Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a unique way to preserve structurally labile nanosheets after conjugation of a variety of molecules to the self&#8208;assembling peptides. The sheet&#8208;forming peptides afford a staggered alignment for simultaneous separation of external molecules from each other and from the underlying assembly motifs. This strategy allows the functionalization of historically challenging fragile assemblies while maintaining their overall morphology.







Abstract
A significant challenge in creating supramolecular materials is that conjugating molecular functionalities to building blocks often results in dissociation or undesired morphological transformation of their assemblies. Here we present a facile strategy to preserve structurally labile peptide assemblies after molecular modification of the self&#8208;assembling peptides. Sheet&#8208;forming peptides are designed to afford a staggered alignment with the segments bearing chemical modification sites protruding from the sheet surfaces. The staggered assembly allows for simultaneous separation of attached molecules from each other and from the underlying assembly motifs. Strikingly, using PEGs as the external molecules, PEG400&#8208; and PEG700&#8208;peptide conjugates directly self&#8208;associate into nanosheets with the PEG chains localized on the sheet surfaces. In contrast, the sheet formation based on in&#8208;register lateral packing of peptides does not recur upon the peptide PEGylation. This strategy allows for fabrication of densely modified assemblies with a variety of molecules, as demonstrated using biotin (hydrophobic molecule), c(RGDfK) (cyclic pentapeptide), and nucleic acid aptamer (negatively charged ssDNA). The staggered co&#8208;assembly also enables extended tunability of the amount/density of surface molecules, as exemplified by screening ligand&#8208;appended assemblies for cell targeting. This study paves the way for functionalization of historically challenging fragile assemblies while maintaining their overall morphology.

         <title>Breaking the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;Ru Symmetry of a RuO2 Catalyst for Sustainable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In active structure exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance for acid oxygen evolution reaction, which is significantly enhanced by the contracted Ru&#8722;O bond compared to RuO2.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a highly promising hydrogen production technique for sustainable energy supply, however, achieving a highly active and durable catalyst for acidic water oxidation still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a local microenvironment regulation strategy for precisely tuning In&#8722;RuO2/graphene (In&#8722;RuO2/G) catalyst with intrinsic electrochemical activity and stability to boost acidic water oxidation. The In&#8722;RuO2/G displays robust acid oxygen evolution reaction performance with a mass activity of 671&#8197;A gcat&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V, an overpotential of 187&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;lasting stability of 350&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which arises from the asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In local structure interactions. Further, it is unraveled theoretically that the asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In structure breaks the thermodynamic activity limit of the traditional adsorption evolution mechanism which significantly weakens the formation energy barrier of OOH*, thus inducing a new rate&#8208;determining step of OH* absorption. Therefore, this strategy showcases the immense potential for constructing high&#8208;performance acidic catalysts for water electrolyzers.

         <title>Metal&#8208;DNA Nanocomplexes Enhance Chemo&#8208;dynamic Therapy by Inhibiting Autophagy&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating multivalent nucleic acid aptamers and DNAzyme sequences into long single&#8208;stranded DNA and further forming metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes using rolling circle amplification (RCA) technology, researchers have successfully established a DNA drug delivery platform that combined chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy (CDT) and autophagy inhibition therapies. The platform overcame the shortcomings of short&#8208;stranded DNA, such as poor stability under physiological conditions, short blood circulation time, and easy clearance by the organism.







Abstract
Chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy (CDT) based on the Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reaction has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, autophagy&#8208;mediated self&#8208;protection mechanisms of cancer cells pose a significant challenge to the efficacy of CDT. Herein, we developed metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes (DACs&#8208;Mn) to enhance CDT via DNAzyme inhibition of autophagy. Specifically, Mn&#8208;based catalyst in DACs&#8208;Mn was used to generate highly hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) that kill cancer cells, while the ATG5 DNAzyme incorporated into DACs&#8208;Mn inhibited the expression of autophagy&#8208;associated proteins, thereby improving the efficacy of CDT. By disrupting the self&#8208;protective pathway of cells under severe oxidative stress, this novel approach of DACs&#8208;Mn was found to synergistically enhance CDT in both in vitro and in vivo models, effectively amplifying tumor&#8208;specific oxidative damage. Notably, the Metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes can also induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis. Specifically, in a bilateral tumor model in mice, the combined approach of CDT and autophagy inhibition followed by immune checkpoint blockade therapy shown significant potential as a novel and effective treatment modality for primary and metastatic tumors.

Cyclic azasilole derivatives undergo ring&#8208;opening with 18F&#8211; anions under mild conditions and with high radiochemical yield. They represent a novel class of Silicon Fluoride Acceptor systems (CycloSiFA) and hold great potential for convenient kit&#8208;like labelling procedures in different medicinal applications.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening Si&#8208;fluorination of a variety of azasilole derivatives cyclo&#8208;1&#8208;(iPr2Si)&#8722;4&#8208;X&#8722;C6H3&#8722;2&#8208;CH2NR (4: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=H; 4&#8201;a: R=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, X=H; 9: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=tBuMe2SiO; 10: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=OH; 13: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=HCCCH2O; 22: R=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, X=tBuMe2SiCH2O) with different 19F&#8208;fluoride sources was studied, optimized and the experience gained was used in a translational approach to create a straightforward 18F&#8208;labelling protocol for the azasilole derivatives [18F]6 and [18F]14. The latter constitutes a potential clickable CycloSiFA prosthetic group which might be used in PET tracer development using Cu&#8208;catalysed triazole formation. Based on our findings, CycloSiFA has the potential to become a new entry into non&#8208;canonical labelling methodologies for radioactive PET tracer development.

         <title>Dominant Role of Hole Transport Pathway in Achieving Record High Photoconductivity in Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanisms of photoinduced charge transport and electron dynamics in conductive 2D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their correlation with photoconductivity are investigated using multiple spectroscopy techniques. A through&#8208;space hole transport mechanism through the interlayer sheet &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction is identified, where the photoinduced hole state resides in the HHTP ligand and the electronic state is localized at the metal center.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with mobile charges have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in photoelectric devices, chemical resistance sensors, and catalysis. However, fundamental understanding of the charge transport pathway within the framework and the key properties that determine the performance of conductive MOFs in photoelectric devices remain underexplored. Herein, we report the mechanisms of photoinduced charge transport and electron dynamics in the conductive 2D M&#8722;HHTP (M=Cu, Zn or Cu/Zn mixed; HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) MOFs and their correlation with photoconductivity using the combination of time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy, optical transient absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We identify the through&#8208;space hole transport mechanism through the interlayer sheet &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, where photoinduced hole state resides in HHTP ligand and electronic state is localized at the metal center. Moreover, the photoconductivity of the Cu&#8722;HHTP MOF is found to be 65.5&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1, which represents the record high photoconductivity for porous MOF materials based on catecholate ligands.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination of Tau Amyloids Promoted by the E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>

The E3 ligase CHIP promotes ubiquitination of preformed Tau filaments in vitro and in living cellular models. The structural conformations of the fibrils restrict ubiquitination to specific regions of Tau. Tau seeding activity is not impaired by ubiquitination.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of Tau are emerging as key players in determining the onset and progression of different tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, and are recognized to mediate the structural diversity of the disease&#8208;specific Tau amyloids. Here we show that the E3 ligase CHIP catalyzes the site&#8208;specific ubiquitination of Tau filaments both in vitro and in cellular models, proving that also Tau amyloid aggregates are direct substrate of PTMs. Transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry analysis on ubiquitin&#8208;modified Tau amyloids revealed that the conformation of the filaments restricts CHIP&#8208;mediated ubiquitination to specific positions of the repeat domain, while only minor alterations in the structure of the fibril core were inferred using seeding experiments in vitro and in a cell&#8208;based tauopathy model. Overexpression of CHIP significantly increased the ubiquitination of exogenous PHF, proving that the ligase can interact and modify Tau aggregates also in a complex cellular environment.

The novel dual&#8208;network design strategy is proposed to prepare a high&#8208;performance cellulosic composite bioplastic metafilm with exceptional mechanical toughness (23.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), flame retardance, and solvent resistance. Moreover, it has a high maximum usage temperature (245&#8201;&#176;C), lower thermal expansion coefficient (15.19&#8197;ppm&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1), good biocompatibility, and natural biodegradation, which is competitive for plastic substitute.







Abstract
With the escalating environmental and health concerns over petroleum&#8208;based plastics, sustainable and biodegradable cellulosic materials are a promising alternative to plastics, yet remain unsatisfied properties such as fragility, inflammability and water sensitivity for practical usage. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;network design strategy to address these limitations and fabricate a high&#8208;performance cellulosic composite bioplastic metafilm with the exceptional mechanical toughness (23.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), flame retardance, and solvent resistance by in situ growth of cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;bridged organosilica network within bacterial cellulose matrix. The phosphorus, nitrogen&#8208;containing organosilica network, verified by the experimental and theoretical results, plays a triple action on significantly enhancing tensile strength, toughness, flame retardance and water resistance of composite bioplastic metafilm. Furthermore, cellulosic bioplastic composite metafilm demonstrates a higher maximum usage temperature (245&#8201;&#176;C), lower thermal expansion coefficient (15.19&#8197;ppm&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1), and better solvent resistance than traditional plastics, good biocompatibility and natural biodegradation. Moreover, the composite bioplastic metafilm have a good transparency of average 74&#8201;% and a high haze over 80&#8201;%, which can serve as an outstanding substrate substitute for commercial polyethylene terephthalate film to address the demand of flexible ITO films. This work paves a creative way to design and manufacture the competitive bioplastic composite to replace daily&#8208;used plastics.

         <title>Tweaking Photo CO2 Reduction by Altering Lewis Acidic Sites in Metalated&#8208;Porous Organic Polymer for Adjustable H2/CO Ratio in Syngas Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn and Co based POP with different Lewis acidity has been developed for controlling water splitting and CO2 reduction under sunlight. Low&#8208;cost option of syngas production with adjustable H2/CO ratio was demonstrated obtained by skipping the use of any sacrificial electron donors (SEDs), cocatalysts, or photo&#8208;sensitizers.







Abstract
Herein, we have specifically designed two metalated porous organic polymers (Zn&#8208;POP and Co&#8208;POP) for syngas (CO+H2) production from gaseous CO2. The variable H2/CO ratio of syngas with the highest efficiency was produced in water medium (without an organic hole scavenger and photosensitizer) by utilizing the basic principle of Lewis acid/base chemistry. Also, we observed the formation of entirely different major products during photocatalytic CO2 reduction and water splitting with the help of the two catalysts, where CO (145.65&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and H2 (434.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) production were preferentially obtained over Co&#8208;POP &amp; Zn&#8208;POP, respectively. The higher electron density/better Lewis basic nature of Co&#8208;POP was investigated further using XPS, XANES, and NH3&#8208;TPD studies, which considerably improve CO2 activation capacity. Moreover, the structure&#8211;activity relationship was confirmed via in situ DRIFTS and DFT studies, which demonstrated the formation of COOH* intermediate along with the thermodynamic feasibility of CO2 reduction over Co&#8208;POP while water splitting occurred preferentially over Zn&#8208;POP.

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;benzamide Directed Formation of a Single Crystalline Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Crosslinked Organic Framework and Its Boron Trifluoride Uptake and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystalline ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;benzamide directed hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;50) has been synthesized for BF3 adsorption and demonstrates a record&#8208;high capacity of 14.2&#8197;mmol/g. The formed HCOF&#8208;50&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BF3 complex showed controlled BF3&#8208;releasing for more controlled cationic vinyl ether polymerization.







Abstract
Boron trifluoride (BF3) is a highly corrosive gas widely used in industry. Confining BF3 in porous materials ensures safe and convenient handling and prevents its degradation. Hence, it is highly desired to develop porous materials with high adsorption capacity, high stability, and resistance to BF3 corrosion. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Lewis basic single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bond crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;50) for BF3 storage and its application in catalysis. Specifically, we introduced self&#8208;complementary ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;benzamide hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties to direct the formation of highly organized hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks, which were subsequently photo&#8208;crosslinked to generate HCOFs. The HCOF&#8208;50 features Lewis basic thioether linkages and electron&#8208;rich pore surfaces for BF3 uptake. As a result, HCOF&#8208;50 shows a record&#8208;high 14.2&#8197;mmol/g BF3 uptake capacity. The BF3 uptake in HCOF&#8208;50 is reversible, leading to the slow release of BF3. We leveraged this property to reduce the undesirable chain transfer and termination in the cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers. Polymers with higher molecular weights and lower polydispersity were generated compared to those synthesized using BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O. The elucidation of the structure&#8211;property relationship, as provided by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, combined with the high BF3 uptake capacity and controlled sorption, highlights the molecular understanding of framework&#8208;guest interactions in addressing contemporary challenges.

         <title>Photoenzymatic Enantioselective Synthesis of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Benzo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining photocatalysis and biocatalysis allows for the repurposing of the &#8216;ene&#8217;&#8208;reductase enzyme GluER to achieve the enantioselective synthesis of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, and various benzoxepinones, chromanone and indanone were specifically afforded in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities after protein engineering of GluER.







Abstract
New&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis in organic synthesis has recently emerged as a green and powerful strategy for the preparation of valuable chiral products, among which chiral oxygen&#8208;containing benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles are important structural motifs in pharmaceutical industry. However, the asymmetric synthesis of these compounds through radical&#8208;mediated methods is challenging. Herein, a novel asymmetric radical&#8208;mediated photoenzymatic synthesis strategy is developed to realize the efficient enantioselective synthesis of oxygen&#8208;containing benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles through structure&#8208;guided engineering of a flavin&#8208;dependent &#8216;ene&#8217;&#8208;reductase GluER. It shows that variant GluER&#8208;W100H could efficiently produce various benzoxepinones, chromanone and indanone with different benzo&#8208;fused rings in high yields with great stereoselectivities under visible light. Moreover, these results are well supported by mechanistic experiments, revealing that this photoenzymatic process involves electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex formation, single electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer. Therefore, we provide an alternative green approach for efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of important chiral skeletons of bioactive pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Stability Investigations on a Pt@HGS Catalyst as a Model Material for Fuel Cell Applications: The Role of the Local pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of the oxygen reduction reaction in accelerated stress tests using a Pt@HGS model catalyst on the catalyst degradation is investigated using RDE, IL&#8208;STEM grid and single entity electrochemical measurements. We demonstrate the importance of considering the modulation of the local pH when performing accelerated stress tests.







Abstract
Increasing the resistance of catalysts against electrochemical degradation is one of the key requirements for the wider use of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Here, we study the degradation of one entity of a highly stable catalyst, Pt@HGS, on a nanoelectrode under accelerated mass transport conditions. We find that the catalyst degrades more rapidly than expected based on previous ensemble measurements. Corroborated by identical location transmission electron microscopy and catalyst layer experiments, we deduce that locally different pH values are likely the reason for this difference in stability. Ultimately, this work provides insights into the actual conditions present in a PEMFC and raises questions about the applicability of accelerated stress tests usually performed to evaluate catalyst stability, particularly when they are performed in half&#8208;cell setups under inert gas.

         <title>Unravelling the Roles of Solvophobic Effects and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Stacking Interactions in the Formation of [2]Catenanes Featuring Di&#8208;(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different effects have been shown to control the formation of [2]catenanes with different bridges between pyridine donors. The formation of [2&#8208;IL](OTf)4 is aided by solvophobic effects and [3&#8208;IL](OTf)4 is stabilized by solvophobic effects and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking. The &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking between the pyrene groups is essential for the formation of [4&#8208;IL](PF6)4 and [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4, where the enhanced stability of [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4 is based on the more stable Au&#8722;CNHC bonds.







Abstract
A series of [2]catenanes has been prepared from di&#8208;NHC building blocks by utilizing solvophobic effects and/or &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. The dinickel naphthobiscarbene complex syn&#8208;[1] and the kinked biphenyl&#8208;bridged bipyridyl ligand L2 yield the [2]catenane [2&#8208;IL](OTf)4 by self&#8208;assembly. Solvophobic effects are pivotal for the formation of the interlocked species. Substitution of the biphenyl&#8208;linker in L2 for a pyromellitic diimide group gave ligand L3, which yielded in combination with syn&#8208;[1] the [2]catenane [3&#8208;IL](OTf)4. This assembly exhibits enhanced stability in diluted solution, aided by additional &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. The &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking was augmented by the introduction of a pyrene bridge between two NHC donors in ligand L4. Di&#8208;NHC precursor H2&#8208;L4(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O to give the [Ag2L42]2 [2]catenane [4&#8208;IL](PF6)4, which shows strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions between the pyrene groups. This assembly was readily converted into the [Au2L42]2 gold species [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4, which exhibits exceptional stability based on the strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and the enhanced stability of the Au&#8208;CNHC bonds.

         <title>S&#8208;Block Potassium Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalyst with K&#8722;N4 Configuration Derived from K+/Polydopamine for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An s&#8208;block Potassium single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with a K&#8208;N4 configuration was prepared and used as a highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The excellent ORR activity is attributed to K/C atoms acting as dual adsorption sites, which can synergistically optimize the free energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and tune the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Currently, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) research mainly focuses on transition metal atoms as active centers. Due to their delocalized s/p&#8208;bands, the s&#8208;block main group metal elements are typically regarded as catalytically inert. Herein, an s&#8208;block potassium SAC (K&#8722;N&#8722;C) with K&#8208;N4 configuration is reported for the first time, which exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability under alkaline conditions. Specifically, the half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) is up to 0.908&#8197;V, and negligible changes in E1/2 are observed after 10,000 cycles. In addition, the K&#8722;N&#8722;C offers an exceptional power density of 158.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability up to 420&#8197;h in a Zn&#8208;air battery. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that K&#8722;N&#8722;C has bifunctional active K and C sites, can optimize the free energy of ORR reaction intermediates, and adjust the rate&#8208;determining steps. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) results showed that the s orbitals of K played a major role in the adsorption of intermediates, which was different from the d orbitals in transition metals. This work significantly guides the rational design and catalytic mechanism research of s&#8208;block SACs with high ORR activity.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence CuI/CuIII Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Non&#8208;innocent Ligand for Multielectron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metal&#8211;organic frameworks with formally Cu(I)/Cu(III) mixed valency are reported. These bench stable Cu(III)&#8208;containing frameworks coordinated by a non&#8208;innocent ligand are characterized and investigated for multielectron redox properties, unveiling the redox&#8208;active sites at both the copper and organic ligand. This is also the first time that formally Cu(III) species are witnessed in metal&#8211;organic extended solids.







Abstract
We report two novel three&#8208;dimensional copper&#8208;benzoquinoid metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu4L3]n and [Cu4L3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cu(iq)3]n (LH4=1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahydroxybenzene, iq=isoquinoline). Spectroscopic techniques and computational studies reveal the unprecedented mixed valency in MOFs, formal Cu(I)/Cu(III). This is the first time that formally Cu(III) species are witnessed in metal&#8211;organic extended solids. The coordination between the mixed&#8208;valence metal and redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent ligand L, which promotes through&#8208;bond charge transfer between Cu metal sites, allows better metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap of the d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, leading to strong long&#8208;range delocalization and semiconducting behavior. Our findings highlight the significance of the unique mixed valency between formal Cu(I) and highly&#8208;covalent Cu(III), non&#8208;innocent ligand, and pore environments of these bench stable Cu(III)&#8208;containing frameworks on multielectron transfer and electrochemical properties.

&lt;p&gt;We report two novel three-dimensional copper-benzoquinoid metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and [Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cu(iq)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (LH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=1,4-dicyano-2,3,5,6-tetrahydroxybenzene, iq=isoquinoline). Spectroscopic techniques and computational studies reveal the unprecedented mixed valency in MOFs, formal Cu(I)/Cu(III). This is the first time that formally Cu(III) species are witnessed in metal&#8211;organic extended solids. The coordination between the mixed-valence metal and redox-non-innocent ligand L, which promotes through-bond charge transfer between Cu metal sites, allows better metal-ligand orbital overlap of the d-&#960; conjugation, leading to strong long-range delocalization and semiconducting behavior. Our findings highlight the significance of the unique mixed valency between formal Cu(I) and highly-covalent Cu(III), non-innocent ligand, and pore environments of these bench stable Cu(III)-containing frameworks on multielectron transfer and electrochemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Polyolefin Hydrogenolysis by a Single&#8208;Site Organo&#8208;Tantalum Catalyst on a Super&#8208;Acidic Support: Structure and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cationic organo&#8208;tantalum catalyst AlS/TaNp3 (94&#8201;%) and AlS/TaNp2_AlNp (6&#8201;%) was synthesized via Np3Ta=CHtBu chemisorption on Br&#248;nsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). The proposed structures are in good agreement with SSNMR, DRIFTS, XANES, EXAFS, and DFT computation. Highly efficient AlS/Ta&#8208;mediated hydrogenolysis of diverse pre&#8208; and post&#8208;consumer polyolefin plastics to lighter alkanes is achieved.







Abstract
The novel electrophilic organo&#8208;tantalum catalyst AlS/TaNpx (1) (Np=neopentyl) is prepared by chemisorption of the alkylidene Np3Ta=CHtBu onto highly Br&#248;nsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). The proposed catalyst structure is supported by EXAFS, XANES, ICP, DRIFTS, elemental analysis, and SSNMR measurements and is in good agreement with DFT analysis. Catalyst 1 is highly effective for the hydrogenolysis of diverse linear and branched hydrocarbons, ranging from C2 to polyolefins. To the best of our knowledge, 1 exhibits one of the highest polyolefin hydrogenolysis activities (9,800 (CH2 units)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol(Ta)&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C/17&#8197;atm H2) reported to date in the peer&#8208;reviewed literature. Unlike the AlS/ZrNp2 analog, the Ta catalyst is more thermally stable and offers multiple potential C&#8722;C bond activation pathways. For hydrogenolysis, AlS/TaNpx is effective for a wide variety of pre&#8208; and post&#8208;consumer polyolefin plastics and is not significantly deactivated by standard polyolefin additives at typical industrial concentrations.

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of an Antiviral Cinnamoylphloroglucinol Collection from Cleistocalyx operculatus: A Synthetic Strategy Based on Biogenetic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel cinnamoylphloroglucinol dimers were discovered from C. operculatus. Biomimetic syntheses of these and two known dimers were developed through a strategy in which the activation of stable biogenetic building blocks was a crucial step and key features included a unique cascade reaction and a rare inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. One of the dimers showed activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 through a new mode of action.







Abstract
A synthetic strategy based on biogenetic building blocks for the collective and divergent biomimetic synthesis of cleistoperlones A&#8722;F, a cinnamoylphloroglucinol collection discovered from Cleistocalyx operculatus, has been developed. These syntheses proceeded successfully in only six to seven steps starting from commercially available 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriol and involving oxidative activation of stable biogenetic building blocks as a crucial step. Key features of the syntheses include a unique Michael addition/ketalization/1,6&#8208;addition/enol&#8208;keto tautomerism cascade reaction for the construction of the dihydropyrano[3,2&#8208;d]xanthene tetracyclic core of cleistoperlones A and B, and a rare inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition for the establishment of benzopyran ring in cleistoperlones D&#8722;F. Moreover, cleistoperlone A exhibited significant antiviral activity against acyclovir&#8208;resistant strains of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV&#8208;1/Blue and HSV&#8208;1/153).

         <title>A NIR Programmable In Vivo miRNA Magnifier for NIR&#8208;II Imaging of Early Stage Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 980/808&#8197;nm NIR programmed in vivo miRNA magnifier is developed by conjugating an activatable DNAzyme walker set to rare&#8208;earth nanoparticles, which detects tumors earlier than size&#8208;monitoring techniques. The 980&#8208;nm excitation&#8208;activated DNA nanomachine for miRNA&#8208;21 recognition and signal amplification to suppress &#8220;false positive&#8221; signals, and imaging in the NIR&#8208;II region under 808&#8197;nm excitation provided deeper penetration and lower background.







Abstract
Aberrant expressions of biomolecules occur much earlier than tumor visualized size and morphology change, but their common measurement strategies such as biopsy suffer from invasive sampling process. In vivo imaging of slight biomolecule expression difference is urgently needed for early cancer detection. Fluorescence of rare earth nanoparticles (RENPs) in second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region makes them appropriate tool for in vivo imaging. However, the incapacity to couple with signal amplification strategies, especially programmable signal amplification strategies, limited their application in lowly expressed biomarkers imaging. Here we develop a 980/808&#8197;nm NIR programmed in vivo microRNAs (miRNAs) magnifier by conjugating activatable DNAzyme walker set to RENPs, which achieves more effective NIR&#8208;II imaging of early stage tumor than size monitoring imaging technique. Dye FD1080 (FD1080) modified substrate DNA quenches NIR&#8208;II downconversion emission of RENPs under 808&#8197;nm excitation. The miRNA recognition region in DNAzyme walker is sealed by a photo&#8208;cleavable strand to avoid &#8220;false positive&#8221; signal in systemic circulation. Upconversion emission of RENPs under 980&#8197;nm irradiation activates DNAzyme walker for miRNA recognition and amplifies NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery of RENPs via DNAzyme catalytic reaction to achieve in vivo miRNA imaging. This strategy demonstrates good application potential in the field of early cancer detection.

         <title>Nanosheet&#8208;Assembled Zirconium&#8208;Porphyrin Frameworks Enabling Surface&#8208;Confined, Initiator&#8208;Free Photosynthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polymers</title>

Nanosheet&#8208;assembled Zr&#8208;porphyrin hexagonal prisms exhibit broadband photon harvesting and excellent photocatalytic ability, enabling controlled photosynthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight (Mn&gt;1,500,000) polymers with low dispersity (&#272;&#8776;1.5) in an initiator&#8208;free, oxygen&#8208;tolerant reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization system regulated by full&#8208;range visible light and natural sunlight.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks with well&#8208;organized low&#8208;dimensional architectures provide significant thermodynamic and/or kinetic benefits for diverse applications. We present here the controlled synthesis of a novel class of hierarchical zirconium&#8208;porphyrin frameworks (ZrPHPs) with nanosheet&#8208;assembled hexagonal prism morphology. The crystal growth behaviors and structural evolution of ZrPHPs in an additive&#8208;modulated solvothermal synthesis are examined, showing an &#8220;assembly&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;reassembly&#8221; mechanism towards the formation of 2D nanosheets with ordered arrangement. Because of the highly&#8208;accessible active sites harvesting broadband photons, ZrPHPs serve as adaptable photocatalysts to regulate macromolecular synthesis under full&#8208;range visible light and natural sunlight. An initiator&#8208;free, oxygen&#8208;tolerant photopolymerization system is established, following a distinctive mechanism involving direct photo&#8208;induced electron transfer to dormant species and hole&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation. Specifically, ZrPHPs provide a surface&#8208;confined effect towards the propagating chains which inhibits their recombination termination, enabling the highly&#8208;efficient synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight polymers (Mn &gt;1,500,000) with relatively low dispersity (&#272;&#8776;1.5).

&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;1,500,000) polymers with low dispersity (&lt;i&gt;&#272;&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;1.5) in an initiator-free, oxygen-tolerant reversible-deactivation radical polymerization system regulated by full-range visible light and natural sunlight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks with well-organized low-dimensional architectures provide significant thermodynamic and/or kinetic benefits for diverse applications. We present here the controlled synthesis of a novel class of hierarchical zirconium-porphyrin frameworks (&lt;b&gt;ZrPHPs&lt;/b&gt;) with nanosheet-assembled hexagonal prism morphology. The crystal growth behaviors and structural evolution of &lt;b&gt;ZrPHPs&lt;/b&gt; in an additive-modulated solvothermal synthesis are examined, showing an &#8220;assembly-hydrolysis-reassembly&#8221; mechanism towards the formation of 2D nanosheets with ordered arrangement. Because of the highly-accessible active sites harvesting broadband photons, &lt;b&gt;ZrPHPs&lt;/b&gt; serve as adaptable photocatalysts to regulate macromolecular synthesis under full-range visible light and natural sunlight. An initiator-free, oxygen-tolerant photopolymerization system is established, following a distinctive mechanism involving direct photo-induced electron transfer to dormant species and hole-mediated reversible deactivation. Specifically, &lt;b&gt;ZrPHPs&lt;/b&gt; provide a surface-confined effect towards the propagating chains which inhibits their recombination termination, enabling the highly-efficient synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight polymers (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt;1,500,000) with relatively low dispersity (&lt;i&gt;&#272;&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;1.5).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Sites and Ligation in Amine&#8208;capped CdSe Nanocrystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amine ligands have been widely used to tailor surface properties of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) for facilitating their synthesis, performances and processing, but detailed understanding of their interaction has remained a challenge. Here, a strategy based on detecting 113Cd, 77Se and 15N NMR signatures augmented with DFT modeling was developed. It enables to identify distinct surface sites and the corresponding ligation of amines in CdSe NCs.







Abstract
Converting colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) into devices for various applications is facilitated by designing and controlling their surface properties. One key strategy for tailoring surface properties is thus to choose tailored surface ligands. In that context, amines have been universally used, with the goal to improve NCs synthesis, processing and performances. However, understanding the nature of surface sites in amine&#8208;capped NCs remains challenging, due to the complex surface compositions as well as surface ligands dynamic. Here, we investigate both surface sites and amine ligation in CdSe NCs by combining advanced NMR spectroscopy and computational modelling. Notably, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced 113Cd and 77Se 1D NMR helps to identify both bulk and surface sites of NCs, while 113Cd 2D NMR spectroscopy enables to resolve amines terminated sites on both Se&#8208;rich and nonpolar surfaces. In addition to directly bonding to surface sites, amines are shown to also interact through hydrogen&#8208;bonding with absorbed water as revealed by 15N NMR, augmented with computations. The characterization methodology developed for this work provides unique molecular&#8208;level insight into the surface sites of a range of amine&#8208;capped CdSe NCs, and paves the way to identify structure&#8208;function relationships and rational approaches towards colloidal NCs with tailored properties.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Enables Efficient Pure Red Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of eco&#8208;friendly PEA2SnI4 perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) lags far behind that of lead&#8208;based PeLEDs. We demonstrated a ligand engineering strategy that uses GSH as a surface ligand to strongly interact with I&#8722; and Sn2+ in perovskites, which thus reduces the film crystallization rate and suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+ ions. Pure red PeLEDs based on the modified PEA2SnI4 achieve a record EQEmax of 9.32&#8201;%.







Abstract
With increasing ecological and environmental concerns, tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are competitive candidates for future displays because of their environmental friendliness, excellent photoelectric properties, and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. Nonetheless, their electroluminescence (EL) performance still lags behind that of lead (Pb)&#8208;based PeLEDs due to the fast crystallization rate of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films and undesired oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, leading to poor film morphology and coverage, as well as high density defects. Here, we propose a ligand engineering strategy to construct high&#8208;quality phenethylammonium tin iodide (PEA2SnI4) perovskite films by using L&#8208;glutathione reduced (GSH) as surface ligands toward efficient pure red PEA2SnI4&#8208;based PeLEDs. We show that the hydrogen&#8208;bond and coordinate interactions between GSH and PEA2SnI4 effectively reduce the crystallization rate of the perovskites and suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and formation of defects. The improved pure red perovskite films not only show excellent uniformity, density, and coverage but also exhibit enhanced optical properties and stability. Finally, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 9.32&#8201;% in the field of PEA2SnI4&#8208;based devices. This work demonstrates that ligand engineering represents a feasible route to enhance the EL performance of Sn&#8208;based PeLEDs.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Multiblock 1D Supramolecular Copolymers of Ir(III) Complexes with Controllable Sequences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;component multiblock 1D supramolecular copolymers with up to 9 blocks have been successfully synthesized by precise control of the pathway complexity of Ir(III) complexes. The segmented structures of the multiblock copolymers could be characterized by both TEM and SEM. These three&#8208;component block copolymers with tunable block sequences will advance the development of functional block copolymers.







Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular block copolymers (BCPs) have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities, but examples of three&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs are rare. Herein, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;component multiblock 1D supramolecular copolymers of Ir(III) complexes 1&#8211;3 by a sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization approach. Precise control over the kinetically trapped species via the pathway complexity of the monomers is the key to the successful synthesis of BCPs with up to 9 blocks. Furthermore, 5&#8208;block BCPs with different sequences could be synthesized by changing the addition order of the kinetic species during a sequentially seeded process. The corresponding heterogeneous nucleation&#8208;elongation process has been confirmed by the UV/Vis absorption spectra, and each segment of the multiblock copolymers could be characterized by both TEM and SEM. Interestingly, the energy transfer leads to weakened emission of 1&#8208;terminated and enhanced emission of 3&#8208;terminated BCPs. This study will be an important step in advancing the synthesis and properties of three&#8208;component BCPs.

         <title>Parallel Planar Heterojunction Strategy Enables Sb2S3 Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 8&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy boosts the efficiency of Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;%, by integrating the distinctive structures of Sb2S3 layer and the duplexity of CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation. The PPHJ device consists of the conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on inorganic heterojunctions provide a potential approach to the efficient, stable and low&#8208;cost solar cells required for the terrestrial generation of photovoltaic energy. Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising photovoltaic absorber. Here, an easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy and related principle are developed to prepare efficient multiple planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, and the PPHJ strategy boosts the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;% that is the highest amongst Sb2S3 devices. The Sb2S3&#8208;based PPHJ device consists of two kinds of conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection: Sb2S3&#8208;based PHJ subcells dominating the absorption and charge generation and CH3NH3PbI3&#8208;based PHJ subcells governing the electron transport towards collection electrode, but it belongs to an Sb2S3 device in nature. The resulting PPHJ device combines together the distinctive structural features of Sb2S3 absorbing layer as a main absorber and the duplexity of well&#8208;crystallized/oriented CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation as an additional absorber, while the presence of perovskite does not affect device stability. The PPHJ strategy maintains the facile preparation by the conventional sequential depositions of multiple layers, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.

&lt;p&gt;Solution-processed solar cells based on inorganic heterojunctions provide a potential approach to the efficient, stable and low-cost solar cells required for the terrestrial generation of photovoltaic energy. Antimony trisulfide (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a promising photovoltaic absorber. Here, an easily solution-processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy and related principle are developed to prepare efficient multiple planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, and the PPHJ strategy boosts the efficiency of solution-processed Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;% that is the highest amongst Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; devices. The Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based PPHJ device consists of two kinds of conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection: Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based PHJ subcells dominating the absorption and charge generation and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based PHJ subcells governing the electron transport towards collection electrode, but it belongs to an Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; device in nature. The resulting PPHJ device combines together the distinctive structural features of Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; absorbing layer as a main absorber and the duplexity of well-crystallized/oriented CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer in charge transportation as an additional absorber, while the presence of perovskite does not affect device stability. The PPHJ strategy maintains the facile preparation by the conventional sequential depositions of multiple layers, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Uranium Diazomethanediide Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of metal (uranium) diazomethanediide complexes containing bridging and/or terminal isocyanoimido groups (U=NNC) are presented. By a combined experimental and computational study, unique reactivity patterns were identified and this gained knowledge provides the first insights into the reactivity of complexes containing a metal isocyanoimido (M=NNC) fragment.







Abstract
Uranium diazomethanediide complexes can be prepared and their synthesis, structure and reactivity were explored. Reaction of the uranium imido compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2U=N(p&#8208;tolyl)(dmap) (1) or [&#951;5&#8208;1,3&#8208;(Me3C)2C5H3]2U=N(p&#8208;tolyl)(dmap) (4) with Me3SiCHN2 cleanly yields the first isocyanoimido metal complexes [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2U(=NNC)(&#956;&#8208;CNN=)U(dmap)[&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3Si)3C5H2]2 (2) and {[&#951;5&#8208;1,3&#8208;(Me3C)2C5H3]2U[&#956;&#8208;(=NNC)]}6 (5), respectively. Both compounds exhibit remarkable thermal stability and were fully characterized. According to density functional theory (DFT) studies the bonding between the Cp2U2+ and [NNC]2&#8722; moieties is strongly polarized with a significant 5&#8201;f orbital contribution, which is also reflected in the reactivity of these complexes. For example, complex 5 acts as a nucleophile toward alkylsilyl halides and engages in a [2+2] cycloaddition with CS2, but no reaction occurs in the presence of internal alkynes.

         <title>Electrochemical Modification of Polypeptides at Selenocysteine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical selenoetherification (e&#8208;SE) methodology that enables efficient and selective functionalization of polypeptides is described. e&#8208;SE employs mild reaction conditions to facilitate the formation of stable selenoether&#8208;linked conjugates through contraction of diselenide bonds. Compatibility with diverse functionalities and complex cargoes is demonstrated through assembly of valuable bioactive polypeptide conjugates.







Abstract
Mild strategies for the selective modification of peptides and proteins are in demand for applications in therapeutic peptide and protein discovery, and in the study of fundamental biomolecular processes. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical selenoetherification (e&#8208;SE) platform for the efficient site&#8208;selective functionalization of polypeptides. This methodology utilizes the unique reactivity of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine, to effect formation of valuable bioconjugates through stable selenoether linkages under mild electrochemical conditions. The power of e&#8208;SE is highlighted through late&#8208;stage C&#8208;terminal modification of the FDA&#8208;approved cancer drug leuprolide and assembly of a library of anti&#8208;HER2 affibody conjugates bearing complex cargoes. Following assembly by e&#8208;SE, the utility of functionalized affibodies for in vitro imaging and targeting of HER2 positive breast and lung cancer cell lines is also demonstrated.

         <title>Glutathione Mediates Control of Dual Differential Bio&#8208;orthogonal Labelling of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical modification at precise sites within biomolecules is essential to assist in understanding their function. The incorporation of bio&#8208;orthogonal reactive groups provides a strategy for selective tagging, however cross&#8208;reactivity is problematic when dual modification is required. Glutathione (GSH) is used to control the reactivity of ynamine and cyclooctyne reagents in sequential (3+2) cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
Traditional approaches to bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction discovery have focused on developing reagent pairs that react with each other faster than they are metabolically degraded. Glutathione (GSH) is typically responsible for the deactivation of most bio&#8208;orthogonal reagents. Here we demonstrate that GSH promotes a Cu&#8208;catalysed (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between an ynamine and an azide. We show that GSH acts as a redox modulator to control the Cu oxidation state in these cycloadditions. Rate enhancement of this reaction is specific for ynamine substrates and is tuneable by the Cu:GSH ratio. This unique GSH&#8208;mediated reactivity gradient is then utilised in the dual sequential bio&#8208;orthogonal labelling of peptides and oligonucleotides via two distinct chemoselective (3+2) cycloadditions.

         <title>Lewis Acid Supported Nickel Nitrenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise metalation of a polynucleating ligand generated heterobimetallic clusters featuring two redox inactive Lewis acids (Zn2+) and one transition metal (Ni). Reduction of the [Zn2Ni] cluster and reaction with a nitrene transfer reagent yielded [K(THF)3][(F,tbsL)Zn2Ni(&#956;3&#8208;NAd)]. Ni K&#8208;edge XAS (X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy) studies support the assignment of the primary redox pair as a divalent nickel coupled to an imidyl ligand.







Abstract
Metalation of the polynucleating ligand F,tbsLH6 (1,3,5&#8208;C6H9(NC6H3&#8722;4&#8208;F&#8722;2&#8208;NSiMe2tBu)3) with two equivalents of Zn(N(SiMe3)2)2 affords the dinuclear product (F,tbsLH2)Zn2 (1), which can be further deprotonated to yield (F,tbsL)Zn2Li2(OEt2)4 (2). Transmetalation of 2 with NiCl2(py)2 yields the heterometallic, trinuclear cluster (F,tbsL)Zn2Ni(py) (3). Reduction of 3 with KC8 affords [KC222][(F,tbsL)Zn2Ni] (4) which features a monovalent Ni centre. Addition of 1&#8208;adamantyl azide to 4 generates the bridging &#956;3&#8208;nitrenoid adduct [K(THF)3][(F,tbsL)Zn2Ni(&#956;3&#8208;NAd)] (5). EPR spectroscopy reveals that the anionic cluster possesses a doublet ground state (S = 
). Cyclic voltammetry of 5 reveals two fully reversible redox events. The dianionic nitrenoid [K2(THF)9][(F,tbsL)Zn2Ni(&#956;3&#8208;NAd)] (6) was isolated and characterized while the neutral redox isomer was observed to undergo both intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8208;atom abstraction processes. Ni K&#8208;edge XAS studies suggest a divalent oxidation state for the Ni centres in both the monoanionic and dianionic [Zn2Ni] nitrenoid complexes. However, DFT analysis suggests Ni&#8208;borne oxidation for 5.

&lt;p&gt;Metalation of the polynucleating ligand &lt;sup&gt;F,tbs&lt;/sup&gt;LH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (1,3,5-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(NC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;4-F&#8722;2-NSiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with two equivalents of Zn(N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affords the dinuclear product (&lt;sup&gt;F,tbs&lt;/sup&gt;LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which can be further deprotonated to yield (&lt;sup&gt;F,tbs&lt;/sup&gt;L)Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Transmetalation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields the heterometallic, trinuclear cluster (&lt;sup&gt;F,tbs&lt;/sup&gt;L)Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(py) (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Reduction of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; affords [KC&lt;sub&gt;222&lt;/sub&gt;][(&lt;sup&gt;F,tbs&lt;/sup&gt;L)Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) which features a monovalent Ni centre. Addition of 1-adamantyl azide to &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; generates the bridging &#956;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-nitrenoid adduct [K(THF)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][(&lt;sup&gt;F,tbs&lt;/sup&gt;L)Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(&#956;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-NAd)] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). EPR spectroscopy reveals that the anionic cluster possesses a doublet ground state (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; = 
). Cyclic voltammetry of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; reveals two fully reversible redox events. The dianionic nitrenoid [K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;][(&lt;sup&gt;F,tbs&lt;/sup&gt;L)Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(&#956;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-NAd)] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) was isolated and characterized while the neutral redox isomer was observed to undergo both intra- and intermolecular H-atom abstraction processes. Ni K-edge XAS studies suggest a divalent oxidation state for the Ni centres in both the monoanionic and dianionic [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni] nitrenoid complexes. However, DFT analysis suggests Ni-borne oxidation for &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Endowed by Interfacial Ni&#8208;O Bonding in S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 and Imine Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel doping introduces spin&#8208;polarized electrons and weakens H&#8722;S bonds, resulting in enhanced H2 production. Moreover, the interfacial Ni&#8722;O bond significantly strengthens the built&#8208;in electric field (E) and reduces the energy barrier. Benefiting from doping and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction engineering, TiO2/Ni0.08&#8208;Zn0.2Cd0.8S quantum dots (QDs) show good charge transfer and separation, leading to improved H2 production and benzylamine oxidation.







Abstract
Cooperative coupling of H2 evolution with oxidative organic synthesis is promising in avoiding the use of sacrificial agents and producing hydrogen energy with value&#8208;added chemicals simultaneously. Nonetheless, the photocatalytic activity is obstructed by sluggish electron&#8208;hole separation and limited redox potentials. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped Zn0.2Cd0.8S quantum dots are chosen after screening by DFT simulation to couple with TiO2 microspheres, forming a step&#8208;scheme heterojunction. The Ni&#8208;doped configuration tunes the highly active S site for augmented H2 evolution, and the interfacial Ni&#8722;O bonds provide fast channels at the atomic level to lower the energy barrier for charge transfer. Also, DFT calculations reveal an enhanced built&#8208;in electric field in the heterojunction for superior charge migration and separation. Kinetic analysis by femtosecond transient absorption spectra demonstrates that expedited charge migration with electrons first transfer to Ni2+ and then to S sites. Therefore, the designed catalyst delivers drastically elevated H2 yield (4.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine production rate (3.35&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into the coordinated modulation of active sites and built&#8208;in electric fields in step&#8208;scheme heterojunction for ameliorative photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Unraveling the Solvent Effect on Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,2&#8208;diethoxyethane (DEE) molecule promotes the moderate Na+&#8208;DEE coordination, thus leading to the uniform and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, as proved by the cryogenic electron microscopy characterizations. Consequently, the Na metal anode is highly stable in the NaPF6/DEE&#8208;based electrolyte with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are considered as an ideal electrolyte system for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their superior compatibility with the sodium metal anode (SMA). However, the selection principle of ether solvents and the impact on solid electrolyte interphase formation are still unclear. Herein, we systematically compare the chain ether&#8208;based electrolyte and understand the relationship between the solvation structure and the interphasial properties. The linear ether solvent molecules with different terminal group lengths demonstrate remarkably distinct solvation effects, thus leading to different electrochemical performance as well as deposition morphologies for SMBs. Computational calculations and comprehensive characterizations indicate that the terminal group length significantly regulates the electrolyte solvation structure and consequently influences the interfacial reaction mechanism of electrolytes on SMA. Cryogenic electron microscopy clearly reveals the difference in solid electrolyte interphase in various ether&#8208;based electrolytes. As a result, the 1,2&#8208;diethoxyethane&#8208;based electrolyte enables a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%, which also realizes the stable cycling of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a mass loading of &#8776;9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 500&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Crystallizing Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Ultrafast Proton Transport in Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;standing COF membrane was prepared for ultrafast proton conduction in flow battery. The &#8722;SO3H groups in macromolecule chains offer sites to interact with the precursors of COF and function as long&#8208;range ordering growing template to enhance the crystallinity of self&#8208;standing COF membrane. Well&#8208;defined channels of COF membranes promised high proton conductivity and excellent battery performance.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) display great potential to be assembled into proton conductive membranes for their uniform and controllable pore structure, yet constructing self&#8208;standing COF membrane with high crystallinity to fully exploit their ordered crystalline channels for efficient ionic conduction remains a great challenge. Here, a macromolecular&#8208;mediated crystallization strategy is designed to manipulate the crystallization of self&#8208;standing COF membrane, where the &#8722;SO3H groups in introduced sulfonated macromolecule chains function as the sites to interact with the precursors of COF and thus offer long&#8208;range ordered template for membrane crystallization. The optimized self&#8208;standing COF membrane composed of highly&#8208;ordered nanopores exhibits high proton conductivity (75&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 100&#8201;% relative humidity and 20&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent flow battery performance, outperforming Nafion 212 and reported membranes. Meanwhile, the long&#8208;term run of membrane is achieved with the help of the anchoring effect of flexible macromolecule chains. Our work provides inspiration to design self&#8208;standing COF membranes with ordered channels for permselective application.

         <title>Glycan Metabolic Fluorine Labeling for In Vivo Visualization of Tumor Cells and In Situ Assessment of Glycosylation Variations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy called glycan MEtabolic Fluorine LAbeling (glycan MEFLA) for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. It allows for efficient and selective labeling of tumor cells by fluorinated monosaccharide&#8208;based probes (Ac4ManNTfe and Ac4GalNTfa), enabling in vivo visualization of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes via 19F MRI with high sensitivity and deep penetration.







Abstract
The abnormality in the glycosylation of surface proteins is critical for the growth and metastasis of tumors and their capacity for immunosuppression and drug resistance. This anomaly offers an entry point for real&#8208;time analysis on glycosylation fluctuations. In this study, we report a strategy, glycan metabolic fluorine labeling (MEFLA), for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. As a proof of concept, we synthesized two fluorinated unnatural monosaccharides with distinctive 19F chemical shifts (Ac4ManNTfe and Ac4GalNTfa). These two probes could undergo selective uptake by tumor cells and subsequent incorporation into surface glycans. This approach enables efficient and specific 19F labeling of tumor cells, which permits in vivo tracking of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes by 19F MRI. The efficiency and specificity of our probes for labeling tumor cells were verified in vitro with A549 cells. The feasibility of our method was further validated with in vivo experiments on A549 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Moreover, the capacity of our approach for assessing glycosylation changes of tumor cells was illustrated both in vitro and in vivo. Our studies provide a promising means for visualizing tumor cells in vivo and assessing their glycosylation variations in situ through targeted multiplexed 19F MRI.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a strategy called glycan MEtabolic Fluorine LAbeling (glycan MEFLA) for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. It allows for efficient and selective labeling of tumor cells by fluorinated monosaccharide-based probes (Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ManNTfe and Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;GalNTfa), enabling in vivo visualization of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes via &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F MRI with high sensitivity and deep penetration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abnormality in the glycosylation of surface proteins is critical for the growth and metastasis of tumors and their capacity for immunosuppression and drug resistance. This anomaly offers an entry point for real-time analysis on glycosylation fluctuations. In this study, we report a strategy, glycan metabolic fluorine labeling (MEFLA), for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. As a proof of concept, we synthesized two fluorinated unnatural monosaccharides with distinctive &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F chemical shifts (Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ManNTfe and Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;GalNTfa). These two probes could undergo selective uptake by tumor cells and subsequent incorporation into surface glycans. This approach enables efficient and specific &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F labeling of tumor cells, which permits in vivo tracking of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes by &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F MRI. The efficiency and specificity of our probes for labeling tumor cells were verified in vitro with A549 cells. The feasibility of our method was further validated with in vivo experiments on A549 tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, the capacity of our approach for assessing glycosylation changes of tumor cells was illustrated both in vitro and in vivo. Our studies provide a promising means for visualizing tumor cells in vivo and assessing their glycosylation variations in situ through targeted multiplexed &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Interacting Ni and Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Pair Sites in N&#8208;Doped Carbon Catalysts for Efficient Concentrating Solar&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8722;Fe dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) with adjacent Ni&#8722;N4 and Fe&#8722;N4 pair sites was developed for concentrating solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction. This work demonstrated that constructing an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms via an N&#8208;bridged Ni&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;Fe configuration was conducive to the main *COOH and *HCO3 dissociation processes for solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion under weak solar irradiation is generally difficult to meet the heat demand of CO2 reduction. Herein, a new concentrated solar&#8208;driven photothermal system coupling a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) with adjacent Ni&#8722;N4 and Fe&#8722;N4 pair sites is designed for boosting gas&#8208;solid CO2 reduction with H2O under simulated solar irradiation, even under ambient sunlight. As expected, the (Ni, Fe)&#8722;N&#8722;C DSAC exhibits a superior photothermal catalytic performance for CO2 reduction to CO (86.16&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), CH4 (135.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and CH3OH (59.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which are equivalent to 1.70&#8208;fold, 1.27&#8208;fold and 1.23&#8208;fold higher than those of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst, respectively. Based on theoretical simulations, the Fermi level and d&#8208;band center of Fe atom is efficiently regulated in non&#8208;interacting Ni and Fe dual&#8208;atom pair sites with electronic interaction through electron orbital hybridization on (Ni, Fe)&#8722;N&#8722;C DSAC. Crucially, the distance between adjacent Ni and Fe atoms of the Ni&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;Fe configuration means that the additional Ni atom as a new active site contributes to the main *COOH and *HCO3 dissociation to optimize the corresponding energy barriers in the reaction process, leading to specific dual reaction pathways (COOH and HCO3 pathways) for solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction to initial CO production.

         <title>A Gene&#8208;Editable Palladium&#8208;Based Bioorthogonal Nanoplatform Facilitates Macrophage Phagocytosis for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gene&#8208;editable palladium&#8208;based bioorthogonal nanoplatform was developed to improve tumor management, which can polarize macrophages to the anti&#8208;tumoral M1 phenotype, reprogram tumor cells to suppress anti&#8208;phagocytic signals, and induce the activation of sequestered prodrugs through bioorthogonal catalysis, thereby facilitating macrophage phagocytosis and allowing for more effective tumor treatment.







Abstract
Macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells has emerged as an attractive strategy for tumor therapy. Nevertheless, immunosuppressive M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and the high expression of anti&#8208;phagocytic signals from tumor cells impede therapeutic efficacy. To address these issues and improve the management of malignant tumors, in this study we developed a gene&#8208;editable palladium&#8208;based bioorthogonal nanoplatform, consisting of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system&#8208;linked Pd nanoclusters, and a hyaluronic acid surface layer (HBPdC). This HBPdC nanoplatform exhibited satisfactory tumor&#8208;targeting efficiency and triggered Fenton&#8208;like reactions in the tumor microenvironment to generate reactive oxygen species for chemodynamic therapy and macrophage M1 polarization, which directly eliminated tumor cells, and stimulated the antitumor response of macrophages. HBPdC could reprogram tumor cells through gene editing to reduce the expression of CD47 and adipocyte plasma membrane&#8208;associated protein, thereby promoting their recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, HBPdC induced the activation of sequestered prodrugs via bioorthogonal catalysis, enabling chemotherapy and thereby enhancing tumor cell death. Importantly, the Pd nanoclusters of HBPdC were sufficiently cleared through basic metabolic pathways, confirming their biocompatibility and biosafety. Therefore, by promoting macrophage phagocytosis, the HBPdC system developed herein represents a highly promising antitumor toolset for cancer therapy applications.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Reactor Partitioning Enzyme and Prodrug by ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;for NADPH&#8208;Sensitive In Situ Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel core&#8211;shell reactor partitioning CYP450 and prodrug by ZIF&#8208;8 is proposed to improve the efficacy, selectivity, and safety of enzyme&#8208;prodrug therapy. Here, cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is immobilized in ZIF&#8208;8, and the antitumor drug dacarbazine (DTIC) is coordinated and deposited in its outer layer, leading to a high drug loading capacity of 43.6&#177;0.8&#8201;%. This reactor exhibits NADPH&#8208;sensitive in situ prodrug activation specificity in tumor cells, which achieves high prodrug conversion efficiency of 36.5&#177;1.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;prodrug therapies have shown unique advantages in efficiency, selectivity, and specificity of in vivo prodrug activation. However, precise spatiotemporal control of both the enzyme and its substrate at the target site, preservation of enzyme activity, and in situ substrate depletion due to low prodrug delivery efficiency continue to be great challenges. Here, we propose a novel core&#8211;shell reactor partitioning enzyme and prodrug by ZIF&#8208;8, which integrates an enzyme with its substrate and increases the drug loading capacity (DLC) using a prodrug as the building ligand to form a Zn&#8208;prodrug shell. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is immobilized in ZIF&#8208;8, and the antitumor drug dacarbazine (DTIC) is coordinated and deposited in its outer layer with a high DLC of 43.6&#177;0.8&#8201;%. With this configuration, a much higher prodrug conversion efficiency of CYP450 (36.5&#177;1.5&#8201;%) and lower IC50 value (26.3&#177;2.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) are measured for B16&#8208;F10 cells with a higher NADPH concentration than those of L02 cells and HUVECs. With the tumor targeting ability of hyaluronic acid, this core&#8211;shell enzyme reactor shows a high tumor suppression rate of 96.6&#177;1.9&#8201;% and provides a simple and versatile strategy for enabling in vivo biocatalysis to be more efficient, selective, and safer.

A polymerizable organic molecule monomer, N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;propan&#8208;2&#8208;ylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enamide (Apronal), is introduced into the perovskite precursor to form a polymer (P&#8208;Apronal) through thermal crosslinking, which can effectively interact with shallow defects, leading to enhance crystallinity and reduced lattice strain, especially inhibiting the migration of I&#8722;, thus resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
The migration of ions is known to be associated with various detrimental phenomena, including current density&#8208;voltage hysteresis, phase segregation, etc., which significantly limit the stability and performance of perovskite solar cells, impeding their progress toward commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose incorporating a polymerizable organic small molecule monomer, N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;propan&#8208;2&#8208;ylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enamide (Apronal), into the perovskite film to form a crosslinked polymer (P&#8208;Apronal) through thermal crosslinking. The carbonyl and amino groups in Apronal effectively interact with shallow defects, such as uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide vacancies, leading to the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity and reduced lattice strain. Furthermore, the introduction of P&#8208;Apronal improves energy level alignment, and facilitates charge carrier extraction and transport, resulting in a champion efficiency of 25.09&#8201;%. Importantly, P&#8208;Apronal can effectively suppress the migration of I&#8722; ions and improve the long&#8208;term stability of the devices. The present strategy sets forth a path to attain long&#8208;term stability and enhanced efficiency in perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Increasing Chemical Diversity of B2N2 Anthracene Derivatives by Introducing Continuous Multiple Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach has been developed to introduce multiple main group heteroatoms at the zigzag edge of the anthracene framework. BN annulation has led to a naphthalene derivative with an NBO bond. A subsequent BO annulation has been used to extend the fused aromatic ring to afford an anthracene derivative featuring an NBOB system. Changing the NBOB to an NBNB system has further increased the chemical diversity.







Abstract
Increasing the chemical diversity of organic semiconductors is essential to develop efficient electronic devices. In particular, the replacement of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds with isoelectronic boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8722;N) bonds allows precise modulation of the electronic properties of semiconductors without significant structural changes. Although some researchers have reported the preparation of B2N2 anthracene derivatives with two B&#8722;N bonds, no compounds with continuous multiple BN units have been prepared yet. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a B2N2 anthracene derivative with a BNBN unit formed by converting the BOBN unit at the zigzag edge. Compared to the all&#8208;carbon analogue 2&#8208;phenylanthracene, BNBN anthracene exhibits significant variations in the C&#8722;C bond length and a larger highest occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap. The experimentally determined bond lengths and electronic properties of BNBN anthracene are confirmed through theoretical calculations. The BOBN anthracene organic light&#8208;emitting diode, used as a blue host, exhibits a low driving voltage. The findings of this study may facilitate the development of larger acenes with multiple BN units and potential applications in organic electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes Enabling Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Configurational entropy (compositional disorder in the anion sublattice) shows a direct correlation with ionic conductivity in lithium argyrodite superionic solid electrolytes.







Abstract
Superionic solid electrolytes (SEs) are essential for bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) applications. Multicomponent SEs are recently attracting attention for their favorable charge&#8208;transport properties, however a thorough understanding of how configurational entropy (&#916;Sconf) affects ionic conductivity is lacking. Here, we successfully synthesized a series of halogen&#8208;rich lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li5.5PS4.5ClxBr1.5&#8208;x (0&#8804;x&#8804;1.5). Using neutron powder diffraction and 31P magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the S2&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; occupancy on the anion sublattice was quantitatively analyzed. We show that disorder positively affects Li&#8208;ion dynamics, leading to a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 22.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (9.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in cold&#8208;pressed state) for Li5.5PS4.5Cl0.8Br0.7 (&#916;Sconf=1.98R). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that configurational entropy of the anion sublattice correlates with ion mobility. Our results indicate the possibility of improving ionic conductivity in ceramic ion conductors by tailoring the degree of compositional complexity. Moreover, the Li5.5PS4.5Cl0.8Br0.7 SE allowed for stable cycling of single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.06Mn0.04O2 (s&#8208;NCM90) composite cathodes in SSB cells, emphasizing that dual&#8208;substituted lithium argyrodites hold great promise in enabling high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Fully Non&#8208;fused Ring Acceptor Enables Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Modules for Multi&#8208;Scene Applications</title>

A fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptor, GS60, is synthesized to improve photostability and reduce material costs in Organic Solar Cells. By blending with non&#8208;fused ring polymer, PTVT&#8722;T, the obtained active layers possess favorable morphology and suppressive charge recombination. Encouragingly, manufactured large&#8208;area organic photovoltaic modules exhibit outstanding photostability and power conversion efficiency under various light conditions.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, with highly tunable light&#8208;response ranges, offer significant potential for use in driving low&#8208;power consumption off&#8208;grid electronics in multi&#8208;scenarios. However, development of photoactive layer materials that can meet simultaneously the requirements of diverse irradiation conditions is a still challenging task. Herein, a low&#8208;cost fully non&#8208;fused acceptor (denoted as GS60) featuring well&#8208;matched absorption spectra with solar, scattered light and artificial light radiation was designed and synthesized. Systematic characterizations revealed that GS60 possessed outstanding photoelectron properties and ideal morphology, which resulted in reduced voltage loss and suppressed charge recombination. By blending with a non&#8208;fused ring polymer PTVT&#8722;T, the as&#8208;obtained GS60 based OPV cells achieved a good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.1&#8201;%, a high value for the cells based on non&#8208;fused ring bulk heterojunction. Besides, manufactured large&#8208;area OPV modules based on PTVT&#8722;T:GS60 yielded PCEs of 11.2&#8201;%, 11.8&#8201;%, 12.1&#8201;%, 23.1&#8201;%, and 20.3&#8201;% under irradiation of AM 1.5G, natural light of cloudy weather, natural light in shadow, laser and indoor, respectively. The PTVT&#8722;T:GS60 devices exhibited considerable potential in terms of improving photostability and reducing material cost. Overall, this work provides novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost non&#8208;fused ring acceptors, and extended potential of medium band gap acceptors based OPV cells used in various application scenarios.

Inspired by pressure cooker principles, we employ high&#8208;pressure methods to address challenges in processing high molecular weight polymers. Successfully dissolving HW&#8208;D18 in chloroform at 100&#8201;&#176;C within pressure vials, heightened vapor pressure elevates boiling point and solubility of chloroform. This enables the creation of blend films with superior properties, ultimately achieving an excellent PCE of 19.65&#8201;%, setting a new record for binary OSCs.







Abstract
In this work, inspired by the principles of a pressure cooker, we utilized a high&#8208;pressure method to address the processing challenges associated with high molecular weight polymers. Through this approach, we successfully dissolved high molecular weight D18 in chloroform at 100&#8201;&#176;C within a pressure&#8208;tight vial. The increased steam pressure raised the boiling point and dissolving capacity of chloroform, enabling the creation of a hybrid film with superior properties, including more ordered molecular arrangement, increased crystallinity, extended exciton diffusion length, and improved phase morphology. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO prepared using this high&#8208;pressure method achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, setting a new record for binary devices to date. Furthermore, this high&#8208;pressure method was successfully applied to fabricate OSCs based on other common systems, leading to significant enhancements in device performance. In summary, this research introduces a universal method for processing high molecular weight D18 materials, ultimately resulting in the highest performance reported for binary organic solar cells.

         <title>Directly Knitted Hierarchical Porous Organometallic Polymer&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Site Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical porous hyper&#8208;crosslinked organometallic polymer containing Ir&#8208;abnormal NHC&#8208;based single&#8208;site molecular catalyst centers was designed and developed for CO2 hydrogenation&#8208;to&#8208;formate salt production in water that delivered an extremely high single&#8208;run TON of 50816, and excellent reusability with a cumulative TON of 285400 in 10&#8197;cycles with just 1.6&#8201;% activity loss/cycle.







Abstract
In recent times, heterogenization of homogeneous molecular catalysts onto various porous solid support structures has attracted significant research focus as a method for combining the advantages of both homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalysis. The design of highly efficient, structurally robust and reusable heterogenized single&#8208;site catalysts for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction is a critical challenge that needs to be accomplished to implement a sustainable and practical CO2&#8208;looped renewable energy cycle. This study demonstrated a heterogenized catalyst [Ir&#8208;HCP&#8208;(B/TPM)] containing a molecular Ir&#8208;abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Ir&#8208;aNHC) catalyst self&#8208;supported by hierarchical porous hyper&#8208;crosslinked polymer (HCP), in catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to inorganic formate (HCO2&#8722;) salt that is a prospective candidate for direct formate fuel cells (DFFC). By employing this unique and first approach of utilizing a directly knitted HCP&#8208;based organometallic single&#8208;site catalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCO2&#8722; in aqueous medium, extremely high activity with a single&#8208;run turnover number (TON) up to 50816 was achieved which is the highest so far considering all the heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction in water. Additionally, the catalyst featured excellent reusability furnishing a cumulative TON of 285400 in 10&#8197;cycles with just 1.6&#8201;% loss in activity per cycle. Overall, the new catalyst displayed attributes that are important for developing tangible catalysts for practical applications.

Moving from homoleptic triple helical erbium complexes to heteroleptic adducts boosts the quantum yield of near&#8208;infrared to visible molecular&#8208;based light&#8208;upconversion by three orders of magnitude in solution at room temperature.







Abstract
Previously limited to highly symmetrical homoleptic triple&#8208;helical complexes [Er(Lk)3]3+, where Lk are polyaromatic tridentate ligands, single&#8208;center molecular&#8208;based upconversion using linear optics and exploiting the excited&#8208;state absorption mechanism (ESA) greatly benefits from the design of stable and low&#8208;symmetrical [LkEr(hfa)3] heteroleptic adducts (hfa&#8722;=hexafluoroacetylacetonate anion). Depending on (i) the extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, (ii) the flexibility and (iii) the heavy atom effect brought by the bound ligand Lk, the near&#8208;infrared (801&#8197;nm) to visible green (542&#8197;nm) upconversion quantum yield measured for [LkEr(hfa)3] in solution at room temperature can be boosted by up to three orders of magnitude.

         <title>Heterogeneous Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling for Sustainable Synthesis of Chiral Allenes: Application to the Synthesis of Allenic Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of propargylic mesylates and Grignard reagents for the synthesis of diverse chiral allenes catalyzed by a recyclable heterogeneous nanocopper catalyst is reported. The synthetic utility of this sustainable methodology was further demonstrated by its application to the asymmetric total synthesis of 5 valuable allenic natural products.







Abstract
Classical Crabb&#233; type SN2' substitutions of propargylic substrates has served as one of the standard methods for the synthesis of allenes. However, the stereospecific version of this transformation often requires either stoichiometric amounts of organocopper reagents or special functional groups on the substrates, and the chirality transfer efficiency is also capricious. Herein, we report a sustainable methodology for the synthesis of diverse 1,3&#8208;di and tri&#8208;substituted allenes by using a simple and cheap cellulose supported heterogeneous nanocopper catalyst (MCC&#8208;Amp&#8208;Cu(I/II)). This approach represents the first example of heterogeneous catalysis for the synthesis of chiral allenes. High yields and excellent enantiospecificity (up to 97&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee) were achieved for a wide range of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted allenes bearing various functional groups. It is worth noting that the applied heterogeneous catalyst could be recycled at least 5&#8197;times without any reduced reactivity. To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the developed protocol, we have applied it to the total synthesis of several chiral allenic natural products.

         <title>T Cell Antigen Recognition and Discrimination by Electrochemiluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a label&#8208;free approach for imaging immune synapses of T cells by electrochemiluminescence microscopy, which allows us to discriminate specific T cell receptor (TCR)/peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) recognition, as well as the role of auxiliary molecules (costimulatory and adhesion molecules). The results would be useful in the development of tumour vaccines and adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Adoptive T lymphocyte (T cell) transfer and tumour&#8208;specific peptide vaccines are innovative cancer therapies. An accurate assessment of the specific reactivity of T cell receptors (TCRs) to tumour antigens is required because of the high heterogeneity of tumour cells and the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. In this study, we report a label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging approach for recognising and discriminating between TCRs and tumour&#8208;specific antigens by imaging the immune synapses of T cells. Various T cell stimuli, including agonistic antibodies, auxiliary molecules, and tumour&#8208;specific antigens, were modified on the electrode's surface to allow for their interaction with T cells bearing different TCRs. The formation of immune synapses activated by specific stimuli produced a negative (shadow) ECL image, from which T cell antigen recognition and discrimination were evaluated by analysing the spreading area and the recognition intensity of T cells. This approach provides an easy way to assess TCR&#8208;antigen specificity and screen both of them for immunotherapies.

&lt;p&gt;We report a label-free approach for imaging immune synapses of T cells by electrochemiluminescence microscopy, which allows us to discriminate specific T cell receptor (TCR)/peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) recognition, as well as the role of auxiliary molecules (costimulatory and adhesion molecules). The results would be useful in the development of tumour vaccines and adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins on a Silicon Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins to a silicon surface is investigated revealing an adsorption in the ylide form drastically depending on the N&#8208;substituents. Large N&#8208;substituents lead to upright molecules and ordered monolayers while for small N&#8208;substituents a flat&#8208;lying geometry is favored. The geometry is found to have a strong influence on the properties of the films, e.g. their work function.







Abstract
The adsorption of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) on silicon is investigated in a combined scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory study. We find that both of the studied NHOs bind covalently, with ylidic character, to the silicon adatoms of the substrate and exhibit good thermal stability. The adsorption geometry strongly depends on the N&#8208;substituents: for large N&#8208;substituents, an upright adsorption geometry is favored, while a flat&#8208;lying geometry is found for the NHO with smaller wingtips. These different geometries strongly influence the quality and properties of the obtained monolayers. The upright geometry leads to the formation of ordered monolayers, whereas the flat&#8208;lying NHOs yield a mostly disordered, but denser, monolayer. The obtained monolayers both show large work function reductions, as the higher density of the flat&#8208;lying monolayer is found to compensate for the smaller vertical dipole moments. Our findings offer new prospects in the design of tailor&#8208;made ligand structures in organic electronics and optoelectronics, catalysis, and material science.

         <title>Nucleation and Crystallization in 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskites using Formamidinium&#8208;based Organic Semiconductor Spacers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based semiconductor spacers, namely TTFA and BTFA, respectively, were successfully developed for two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskite solar cells. The nucleation and crystallization kinetics of 2D perovskite films were systematically investigated and understood using in situ optical microscopy and in situ grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements. The device based on (TTFA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=5) achieved a record efficiency of 19.41&#8201;%.







Abstract
The conjugated organic semiconductor spacers have drawn wide attention in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites and formamidinium (FA) has been widely used as A&#8208;site cation in high&#8208;performance 3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the FA&#8208;based semiconductor spacers have rarely been investigated in 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites. Here, we developed two FA&#8208;based spacers containing thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (TT) and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene (BT) units, namely TTFA and BTFA, respectively, for 2D RP PSCs. The nucleation and crystallization kinetics of TTFA&#8208;Pb and BTFA&#8208;Pb from sol&#8208;gel to film were investigated using in situ optical microscopy and in situ grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. It is found that the TTFA spacer could reduce the energy barrier of nucleation and induces crystal vertical orientation of 2D perovskite by forming larger clusters in precursor solution, resulting in much improved film quality. Benefiting from the enlarged crystal grains, reduced exciton binding energy, and decreased electron&#8208;phonon coupling coefficient, the photovoltaic device based on (TTFA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=5) achieved a champion efficiency of 19.41&#8201;%, which is a record for 2D RP PSCs with FA&#8208;based spacers. Our work provides deep understanding of the nucleation and crystallization process of 2D RP perovskite films and highlights the great potential of FA&#8208;based semiconductor spacers in highly efficient 2D PSCs.

         <dc:description>
A reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allylic carbonates under Ni&#8208;catalysis provides access to unique 1,5&#8208;dienes featuring a quaternary stereogenic center under high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;control. Mechanistic studies align well with a catalytic cycle based on a Ni(0)/Ni(II) couple with a crucial role for divalent Zn boosting the overall kinetics and selectivity while favoring a key bimetallic C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis of small molecules comprising quaternary stereogenic carbon centers represents a challenging objective. Here regio&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes featuring quaternary stereocenters is reported via nickel&#8208;promoted by reductive homoallylic coupling. The developed methodology features an atypical preference for the formation of unusual branched regioisomers (rr &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1) in a sterically challenging allylic substitution event and furnishes the products with enantiomeric ratios of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 and with high chemo&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivity. A range of experimental evidences suggest that zinc plays a dual role to generate electrophilic and nucleophilic Ni(II)&#8208;allyl intermediates empowering a unique formal bimetallic cross&#8208;electrophile manifold in two separate kinetic regimes.

         <title>Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Discrete DNA Valences for Precisely Controlled Transport at the Subcellular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile in situ strategy to precisely control DNA aptamer valences on the surface of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window and further demonstrated that not only the tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies but also the subcellular transport of AuNPs show precise valence dependence.







Abstract
Ultrasmall luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with excellent capabilities to cross biological barriers offer great promise in designing intelligent model nanomedicines for investigating structure&#8211;property relationships at the subcellular level. However, the strict surface controllability of ultrasmall AuNPs is challenging because of their small size. Herein, we report a facile in situ method for precisely controlling DNA aptamer valences on the surface of luminescent AuNPs with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window using a phosphorothioate&#8208;modified DNA aptamer, AS1411, as a template. The discrete DNA aptamer number of AS1411&#8208;functionalized AuNPs (AS1411&#8208;AuNPs, &#8776;1.8&#8197;nm) with emission at 1030&#8197;nm was controlled in one aptamer (V1), two aptamers (V2), and four aptamers (V4). It was then discovered that not only the tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies but also the subcellular transport of AS1411&#8208;AuNPs were precisely dependent on valences. A slight increase in valence from V1 to V2 increased tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies and resulted in higher nucleus accumulation, whereas a further increase in valence (e.g., V4) significantly increased tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies and led to higher cytomembrane accumulation. These results provide a basis for the strict surface control of nanomedicines in the precise regulation of in vivo transport at the subcellular level and their translation into clinical practice in the future.

The discrete DNA aptamer number of AS1411-functionalized AuNPs (AS1411-AuNPs, &#8776;1.8&#8197;nm) with emission at 1030&#8197;nm was controlled in one aptamer (V1), two aptamers (V2), and four aptamers (V4). It was then discovered that not only the tumor-targeting efficiencies but also the subcellular transport of AS1411-AuNPs were precisely dependent on valences. A slight increase in valence from V1 to V2 increased tumor-targeting efficiencies and resulted in higher nucleus accumulation, whereas a further increase in valence (e.g., V4) significantly increased tumor-targeting efficiencies and led to higher cytomembrane accumulation. These results provide a basis for the strict surface control of nanomedicines in the precise regulation of in vivo transport at the subcellular level and their translation into clinical practice in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Closed&#8208;Heterohelicenes Interconvertible between Their Monomeric and Dimeric Forms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of closed&#8208;[7]helicenes with [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene gave the corresponding dimers connected at the &#946;&#8208;positions of the pyrrole units through a remarkably elongated C&#8722;C bond of about 1.60&#8197;&#197;. Homolytic bond dissociation took place upon UV irradiation to reform its monomeric form. The interconversion between monomeric and dimeric forms is associated with a turn&#8208;on of circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Oxidative fusion reaction of cyclic heteroaromatic pentads consisting of pyrrole and thiophene gave closed&#8208;heterohelicene monomers and dimers depending on the oxidation conditions. Specifically, oxidation with [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) gave closed&#8208;[7]helicene dimers connected at the &#946;&#8208;position of one of the pyrrole units with remarkably elongated C&#8722;C bonds of about 1.60&#8197;&#197;. Although this bond was intact against thermal and physical activations, homolytic bond dissociation took place in DMSO upon irradiation with UV light to give the corresponding monomers. Thus, interconversion between the closed&#8208;helicene monomer and dimer was achieved. The optically pure dimer was photo&#8208;dissociated into the monomers associated with a turn&#8208;on of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

         <title>Hydrogenation Catalysis by Hydrogen Spillover on Platinum&#8208;Functionalized Heterogeneous Boronic Acid&#8208;Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular colloids based on polyoxometalates functionalized with boronic acids are modified with Pt particles to yield high&#8208;performance hydrogenation catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that the systems operate by a hydrogen spillover mechanism, enabling efficient hydrogenation of olefins to alkanes and nitroarenes to amines under mild conditions.







Abstract
The activation of molecular hydrogen is a key process in catalysis. Here, we demonstrate how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based heterogeneous compounds functionalized with Platinum particles activate H2 by synergism between a hydrogen spillover mechanism and electron&#8208;proton transfer by the POM. This interplay facilitates the selective catalytic reduction of olefins and nitroarenes with high functional group tolerance. A family of polyoxotungstates covalently functionalized with boronic acids is reported. In the solid&#8208;state, the compounds are held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions (&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding). The resulting heterogeneous nanoscale particles form stable colloidal dispersions in acetonitrile and can be surface&#8208;functionalized with platinum nanoparticles by in situ photoreduction. The resulting materials show excellent catalytic activity in hydrogenation of olefins and nitrobenzene derivatives under mild conditions (1&#8197;bar H2 and room temperature).

         <title>A Single&#8208;Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single chiral emitter can induce the reversal of the cholesteric helix direction at a macroscopic level through a concentration&#8208;dependent effect at the molecular scale. This exceptional capacity endows the system with the extraordinary ability to seamlessly toggle the sign of circularly polarized luminescence, thus bestowing unparalleled mastery over the upconversion/downshift processes associated with the donor and acceptor moieties.







Abstract
The helical twisting tendency of liquid crystals (LCs) is generally governed by the inherent configuration of the chiral emitter. Here, we introduce the multistage inversion of supramolecular chirality as well as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by manipulating the ratio of single enantiomeric emitters (R&#8208;PCP) to LC monomers (5CB). Increasing the content of R&#8208;PCP from 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% to 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% inverted the helix of LCs from left&#8208;handed to right&#8208;handed, accompanying a CPL sign changed from positive to negative. The biaxiality of chiral emitters, as well as the steric effect of chiral&#8208;chiral and chiral&#8208;achiral interaction, were identified as the reasons for helical sense inversion. Due to the strong helical twisting power, 4&#8197;wt&#8201;% R&#8208;PCP drove the photonic band gap (PBG) of chiral LCs to match up with their emission range, leading to an inversion of the CPL again with a high dissymmetry factor (&#8776;1.2). Directly adjusting the PBG using chiral emitters is seldom achieved in cholesteric LCs. On this basis, an achiral sensitizer PtTPBP was assembled into the helical superstructure. The generation of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation&#8208;induced upconverted CPL from R&#8208;PCP and the downshifting CPL from PtTPBP with opposite rotation was achieved in a single chiral LC system by tuning the position of the PBG.

Through in situ tannic acid (TA) molecule regulating the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based material, CO2 reduction to C2H4 products with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 63.6&#8201;% over 497.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved. The excellent performance can be attributed to TA induced adaptive Cu&#948;+/Cu0 interface is beneficial to lower the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling, as well as the key COH intermediate stabilized through the hydrogen bond by the hydroxyl group in TA.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over Cu catalysts exhibits enormous potential for efficiently converting CO2 to ethylene (C2H4). However, achieving high C2H4 selectivity remains a considerable challenge due to the propensity of Cu catalysts to undergo structural reconstruction during CO2RR. Herein, we report an in situ molecule modification strategy that involves tannic acid (TA) molecules adaptive regulating the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based material to a pathway that facilitates CO2 reduction to C2H4 products. An excellent Faraday efficiency (FE) of 63.6&#8201;% on C2H4 with a current density of 497.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell was achieved, about 6.5&#8197;times higher than the pristine Cu catalyst which mainly produce CH4. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman studies reveal that the hydroxyl group in TA stabilizes Cu&#948;+ during the CO2RR. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Cu&#948;+/Cu0 interfaces lower the activation energy barrier for *CO dimerization, and hydroxyl species stabilize the *COH intermediate via hydrogen bonding, thereby promoting C2H4 production. Such molecule engineering modulated electronic structure provides a promising strategy to achieve highly selective CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Arylations of Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalytic system has been developed for selective (hetero)arylation, alkenylation and alkynylation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides. The high functional group compatibility and application to the synthesis of cyclic peptides either by cyclization or stapling demonstrate the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.







Abstract
Here we report a simple electrochemical route towards the synthesis of S&#8208;arylated peptides by a site selective coupling of peptides with aryl halides under base free conditions. This approach demonstrates the power of electrochemistry to access both highly complex peptide conjugates and cyclic peptides.

         <title>Dimensional and Optoelectronic Tuning of Lead&#8208;free Perovskite Cs3Bi2I9&#8722;nBrn Single Crystals for Enhanced Hard X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon doping bromine into zero&#8208;dimensional Cs3Bi2I9 (space group P63/mmc), the crystal structure transforms into a two&#8208;dimensional layer structure as the bromine content reaches Cs3Bi2I8Br. At this optimized composition the Cs3Bi2I8Br single crystal has an outstanding detection performance in terms of record sensitivity for 100&#8197;keV hard X&#8208;rays, ultralow detection limit, and excellent imaging capability at 75&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Inorganic Bi&#8208;based perovskites have shown great potential in X&#8208;ray detection for their large absorption to X&#8208;rays, diverse low&#8208;dimensional structures, and eco&#8208;friendliness without toxic metals. However, they suffer from poor carrier transport properties compared to Pb&#8208;based perovskites. Here, we propose a mixed&#8208;halogen strategy to tune the structural dimensions and optoelectronic properties of Cs3Bi2I9&#8722;nBrn (0&#8804;n&#8804;9). Ten centimeter&#8208;sized single crystals are successfully grown by the Bridgman technique. Upon doping bromine to zero&#8208;dimensional Cs3Bi2I9, the crystal transforms into a two&#8208;dimensional structure as the bromine content reaches Cs3Bi2I8Br. Correspondingly, the optoelectronic properties are adjusted. Among these crystals, Cs3Bi2I8Br exhibits negligible ion migration, moderate resistivity, and the best carrier transport capability. The sensitivities in 100&#8197;keV hard X&#8208;ray detection are 1.33&#215;104 and 1.74&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 75&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, which are the highest among all reported bismuth perovskites. Moreover, the lowest detection limit of 28.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and ultralow dark current drift of 9.12&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1 are obtained owing to the high ionic activation energy. Our work demonstrates that Br incorporation is an effective strategy to enhance the X&#8208;ray detection performance by tuning the dimensional and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Localized Anion&#8208;Cation Aggregated Aqueous Electrolytes with Accelerated Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous electrolytes using Zn(BF4)2 as the salt and THF as the diluent are developed to improve the low&#8208;temperature performance of Zn&#8208;metal batteries. THF promotes the anion&#8208;cation aggregation and disrupts H&#8208;bond network, resulting in ZnF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and facilitating the desolvation process at low temperatures.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their high safety, rich material resources and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolytes hinders low&#8208;temperature operation of the batteries. Here, aqueous localized anion&#8208;cation aggregated electrolytes composed of Zn(BF4)2 as the salt and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the diluent, are developed to improve the low&#8208;temperature performance of the Zn anode. THF promotes the inclusion of BF4&#8722; in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, facilitating the formation of ZnF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. THF also affects the hydrogen bonding between neighboring H2O molecules, effectively lowering the freezing point. Therefore, the full cells of Zn||polyaniline (PANI) exhibit an ultralong cycle life of 8000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.99&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, the pouch cells display a high capacity retention of 86.2&#8201;% after 500 cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which demonstrates the great prospect of such electrolytes in cold regions. This work provides new insights for the design of low&#8208;temperature aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Synergistic Nitrogen Binding Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient N2/O2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic nitrogen binding site is constructed using adjacent open Cr(III) and F in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). It gives benchmark N2/O2 selectivity and the highest high&#8208;purity oxygen productivity reported to date.







Abstract
Porous materials with d3 electronic configuration open metal sites have been proved to be effective adsorbents for N2 capture and N2/O2 separation. However, the reported materials remain challenging to address the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we report a robust MOF, MIL&#8208;102Cr, that features two binding sites, can synergistically afford strong interactions for N2 capture. The synergistic adsorption site exhibits a benchmark Qst of 45.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for N2 among the Cr&#8208;based MOFs, a record&#8208;high volumetric N2 uptake (31.38&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3), and highest N2/O2 selectivity (13.11) at 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar. Breakthrough experiments reveal that MIL&#8208;102Cr can efficiently capture N2 from a 79/21&#8197;N2/O2 mixture, providing a record 99.99&#8201;% pure O2 productivity of 0.75&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In situ infrared spectroscopy and computational modelling studies revealed that a synergistic adsorption effect by open Cr(III) and fluorine sites was accountable for the strong interactions between the MOF and N2.

Photo&#8208;driven quasi&#8208;topological transformation exposing active nitrogen cation sites in a 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione&#8208;based triazine&#8208;cored COF power continuous and stable charge separation/transfer, broaden visible&#8208;light adsorption, and provide strong Lewis acid sites for promoting O2 adsorption.

Abstract
Herein, the exposure of highly&#8208;active nitrogen cation sites has been accomplished by photo&#8208;driven quasi&#8208;topological transformation of a 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF), which contributes to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis during the 2&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. The exposed nitrogen cation sites with photo&#8208;enhanced Lewis acidity not only act as the electron&#8208;transfer motor to adjust the inherent charge distribution, powering continuous and stable charge separation, and broadening visible&#8208;light adsorption, but also providing a large number of active sites for O2 adsorption. The optimal catalyst shows a high H2O2 production rate of 11965&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, better than most of the previously reported COF photocatalysts. This work provides new insights for designing photo&#8208;switchable nitrogen cation sites as catalytic centers toward efficient solar to chemical energy conversion.

Two novel Cu(I)/Cu(III) mixed&#8208;valence metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are synthesized from Cu(II) and redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent ligand 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahydroxybenzene, as reported by Watchareeya Kaveevivitchai, Teng&#8208;Hao Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312494). The coordination between the mixed&#8208;valence metal and redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent ligand promotes through&#8208;bond charge transfer between Cu metal sites, leading to semiconducting behavior and multielectron transfer.

Zinc is commonly known to provide colorless complexes. A yellow colored dinuclear zinc(II) complex showing visible light absorption has now been unveiled by Yoshimasa Wada, Yusuke Sunada, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202310571). The introduced Zn&#8211;Zn orbital interaction, stemming from the two coordinatively unsaturated zinc(II) centers in close proximity, enables the complex to achieve visible light absorption.

         <title>Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Chemical Regulation of Reactive X Species for Versatile Disease Treatments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides a summary of the chemistry and mechanisms governing reactive species (RXS) based nanomedicine, focusing on metabolic regulation, the role of nanomedicine in RXS generation and elimination. The challenges and future prospects associated with RXS for disease treatments are further discussed, aiming to facilitate the clinical translation of RXS&#8208;based nanomedicine and open new avenues for improved therapeutic interventions.







Abstract
Reactive X species (RXS), encompassing elements such as O, N, C, S, Se, Cl, Br, I, and H, play vital roles in cell biology and physiological function, impacting cellular signal transduction, metabolic regulation, and disease processes. The redox unbalance of RXS is firmly implicated in an assortment of physiological and pathological disorders, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the intricate nature and multifactorial dependence of RXS pose challenges in comprehending and precisely modulating their biological behavior. Nanomaterials with distinct characteristics and biofunctions offer promising avenues for generating or scavenging RXS to maintain redox homeostasis and advance disease therapy. This minireview provides a tutorial summary of the relevant chemistry and specific mechanisms governing different RXS, focusing on cellular metabolic regulation, stress responses, and the role of nanomedicine in RXS generation and elimination. The challenges associated with chemically regulating RXS for diverse disease treatments are further discussed along with the future prospects, aiming to facilitate the clinical translation of RXS&#8208;based nanomedicine and open new avenues for improved therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Comprehensive Comparisons between Directing and Alternating Current Electrolysis in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to DC electrolysis, alternating current (AC) features polarity reversal and periodic variation, and will provide more chances and potentials for organic synthesis. This minireview delineates the unfolding landscape of recent progress in AC&#8208;driven organic transformations and endeavors to dissect disparities between DC and AC electrolytic patterns from their physical principles, reaction features and selectivity control.







Abstract
Organic electrosynthesis has consistently aroused significant interest within both academic and industrial spheres. Despite the considerable progress achieved in this field, the majority of electrochemical transformations have been conducted through the utilization of direct&#8208;current (DC) electricity. In contrast, the application of alternating current (AC), characterized by its polarity&#8208;alternating nature, remains in its infancy within the sphere of organic synthesis, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive theoretical framework. This minireview offers an overview of recent advancements in AC&#8208;driven organic transformations and seeks to elucidate the differences between DC and AC electrolytic methodologies by probing into their underlying physical principles. These differences encompass the ability of AC to preclude the deposition of metal catalysts, the precision in modulating oxidation and reduction intensities, and the mitigation of mass transfer processes.

         <title>Harnessing Transition Metal Scaffolds for Targeted Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious threats to public health but the problem is compounded by the lack of new drugs with new modes of action in the development pipeline. In this review, we spotlight four emerging antibacterial strategies that take advantages of the unique chemical properties of transition metal complexes, namely Trojan horse, triggered warhead release, &#8220;new&#8208;to&#8208;nature&#8221; chemistry, and biomimetic reactions. We further propose that transition metal complexes can replenish this diminishing stockpile of drug candidates by providing compounds with unique properties that are not easily accessible using pure organic scaffolds.







Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance, caused by persistent adaptation and growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to overprescribed antibiotics, poses one of the most serious and urgent threats to global public health. The limited pipeline of experimental antibiotics in development further exacerbates this looming crisis and new drugs with alternative modes of action are needed to tackle evolving pathogenic adaptation. Transition metal complexes can replenish this diminishing stockpile of drug candidates by providing compounds with unique properties that are not easily accessible using pure organic scaffolds. We spotlight four emerging strategies to harness these unique properties to develop new targeted antibacterial agents.

         <title>Catalytic Photochemical Deracemization via Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical deracemization offers a unique opportunity to directly obtain enantiopure compounds from their racemates. Short&#8208;lived intermediates play a key role in the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The review covers comprehensively the research performed in the area and discusses current developments.







Abstract
Upon irradiation in the presence of a suitable chiral catalyst, racemic compound mixtures can be converted into enantiomerically pure compounds with the same constitution. The process is called photochemical deracemization and involves the formation of short&#8208;lived intermediates. By opening different reaction channels for the forward reaction to the intermediate and for the re&#8208;constitution of the chiral molecule, the entropically disfavored process becomes feasible. Since the discovery of the first photochemical deracemization in 2018, the field has been growing rapidly. This review comprehensively covers the research performed in the area and discusses current developments. It is subdivided according to the mode of action and the respective substrate classes. The focus of this review is on the scope of the individual reactions and on a discussion of the mechanistic details underlying the presented reaction.

         <title>Visible Light Responsive Dinuclear Zinc Complex Consisting of Proximally Arranged Two d10&#8208;Zinc Centers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear Zn complex showing anomalous visible&#8208;light absorption using Zn orbitals is developed. Key to the success of the low&#8208;energy absorption is the short distance between coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers, which enables the Zn&#8722;Zn orbital interactions to dramatically decrease the energy gap of the complex. Such Zn&#8722;Zn interactions facilitate untapped photo&#8208;functions of a group&#8197;12 Zn metal.







Abstract
So far, Zn(II)&#8208;based d10 complexes have been known to be colorless unless they are accompanied by chromophoric groups, and therefore both fundamental and advanced photophysical performance of Zn centers of complexes, especially in visible&#8208;light regions has been unexplored. Here, we first demonstrate a dinuclear Zn(II) complex that shows visible light absorption using an orbital distributed over closely contacted two Zn centers experimentally determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A contrastive study demonstrated that intermetallic orbital interaction in dinuclear Zn(II) complex is responsible for capturing visible light to exhibit orangish yellow color, whereas an analogous one without such an interaction is colorless. This work demonstrates that introduction of Zn&#8722;Zn interactions to Zn(II) molecules contradicts the common notion that Zn is unresponsive to visible light and expands the photophysical field of zinc chemistry.

         <title>Stabilization and Binding of [V4O12]4&#8722; and Unprecedented [V20O54(NO3)]n&#8722; to Lysozyme upon Loss of Ligands and Oxidation of the Potential Drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2</title>

         <dc:description>
The promising anti&#8208;diabetic and anti&#8208;cancer drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 in the presence of lysozyme undergoes ligand exchange, partial or complete oxidation of VIV to VV to give two polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V4O12]4&#8722; and the unprecedented [V20O54(NO3)]n&#8722;, based on the unusual [V18O46(NO3)]n&#8722; cage. They are stabilized by non&#8208;covalent or covalent interactions with the protein.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution crystal structures of lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 under two different experimental conditions have been solved. The crystallographic study reveals the loss of the ligands, the oxidation of VIV to VV and the subsequent formation of adducts of the protein with two different polyoxidovanadates: [V4O12]4&#8722;, which interacts with lysozyme non&#8208;covalently, and the unprecedented [V20O54(NO3)]n&#8722;, which is covalenty bound to the side chain of an aspartate residue of symmetry related molecules.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Tunable Phase Behavior and Intrinsic Fluorescence in Dynamically Interacting Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de&#8208;novo rational design of short peptide motifs that assemble into fluorescent condensates with sequence&#8208;dependent phase behavior is investigated. Integrating experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the role of sidechain solvation, n&#8208;&#960;* interactions, and hydrogen bonding are highlighted through systematic sequence variations on an identical peptide backbone scaffold.







Abstract
A conceptual framework towards understanding biological condensed phases is emerging, derived from biological, biomimetic, and synthetic sequences. However, de novo peptide condensate design remains a challenge due to an incomplete understanding of the structural and interactive complexity. We designed peptide modules based on a simple repeat motif composed of tripeptide spacers (GSG, SGS, GLG) interspersed with adhesive amino acids (R/H and Y). We show, using sequence editing and a combination of computation and experiment, that n&#8594;&#960;* interactions in GLG backbones are a dominant factor in providing sufficient backbone structure, which in turn regulates the water interface, collectively promoting liquid droplet formation. Moreover, these R(GLG)Y and H(GLG)Y condensates unexpectedly display sequence&#8208;dependent emission that is a consequence of their non&#8208;covalent network interactions, and readily observable by confocal microscopy.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics on Electrosynthesis and Assembly of Conjugated Metallopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report nanoarchitectonics of end&#8208;on conjugated metallopolymers by surface&#8208;initiated one&#8208;by&#8208;one electrochemical addition and assembly of bifunctional monomers with electroactive oxidation and reduction units under alternative positive and negative potentials. Rapid electrosynthesis can be potentially automated as an electrochemically assisted assembly or printing technique while reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability.







Abstract
In contrast to edge&#8208;on and face&#8208;on orientations, end&#8208;on uniaxial conjugated polymers have the theoretical possibility of providing a macroscopic crystalline film. However, their fabrication is insurmountable due to sluggishly thermodynamic equilibrium states. Herein, we report the programmatic pathway to fabricate nanoarchitectonics on end&#8208;on uniaxial conjugated metallopolymers by surface&#8208;initiated simultaneous electrosynthesis and assembly. Self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) with bottom&#8208;up oriented electroactive molecules as a temple allows orientation, stacking, and reactive addition of monomers triggered by switching alternative redox reactions as well as crystallization of small molecules. Repeating the same reaction can repair the unreactive site on the SAM and dynamically and statistically ensure maximum iterative coverage with ideal linear coefficients between optical or electrical responses and iterative times. The resulting nanoarchitectonics on uniaxially assembled end&#8208;on polymers over centimeter&#8208;sized areas have a subnanometer&#8208;uniform morphology and exhibit ultrahigh modulus as well as an inorganic indium tin oxides and the highest conductance among conjugated molecular monolayers. Their memristive devices provide quantitative electrical and optical responses as a function of molecular length, bias, and iterative junctions. Precise processing of nanoarchitectonics as an electrically assisted assembly or printing technique can present sophisticated optoelectric functions and dimensional batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency for micro&#8208;sized organic materials and electronics.

         <title>Favoring CO Intermediate Stabilization and Protonation by Crown Ether for CO2 Electromethanation in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing CO2 electroreduction in acidic media is reported via anchoring potassium ions near the Cu electrode decorated with an 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 molecule. This strategy could simultaneously favor *CO intermediate stabilization and protonation to improve the CH4 selectivity and CO2 utilization efficiency.







Abstract
The large&#8208;scale deployment of CO2 electroreduction is hampered by deficient carbon utilization in neutral and alkaline electrolytes due to CO2 loss into (bi)carbonates. Switching to acidic media mitigates carbonation, but suffers from low product selectivity because of hydrogen evolution. Here we report a crown ether decoration strategy on a Cu catalyst to enhance carbon utilization and selectivity of CO2 methanation under acidic conditions. Macrocyclic 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 is found to enrich potassium cations near the Cu electrode surface, simultaneously enhancing the interfacial electric field to stabilize the *CO intermediate and accelerate water dissociation to boost *CO protonation. Remarkably, the mixture of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and Cu nanoparticles affords a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 51.2&#8201;% and a single pass carbon efficiency of 43.0&#8201;% toward CO2 electroreduction in electrolyte with pH=2. This study provides a facile strategy to promote CH4 selectivity and carbon utilization by modifying Cu catalysts with supramolecules.

         <title>Stereospecific Conversion of Boronic Esters into Enones using Methoxyallene: Application in the Total Synthesis of 10&#8208;Deoxymethynolide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot strategy for the stereospecific conversion of boronic esters into enones has been developed using methoxyallene as a commercially available, three&#8208;carbon building block. The methodology is suitable for primary, secondary, and tertiary boronic esters and has been applied to a 14&#8208;step total synthesis of the polyketide 10&#8208;deoxymethynolide.







Abstract
Enones are widely utilized linchpin functional groups in chemical synthesis and molecular biology. We herein report the direct conversion of boronic esters into enones using commercially available methoxyallene as a three&#8208;carbon building block. Following boronate complex formation by reaction of the boronic ester with lithiated&#8208;methoxyallene, protonation triggers a stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration before oxidation generates the enone. The protocol shows broad substrate scope and complete enantiospecificity is observed with chiral migrating groups. In addition, various electrophiles could be used to induce 1,2&#8208;migration and give a much broader range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized enones. Finally, the methodology was applied to a 14&#8208;step synthesis of the enone&#8208;containing polyketide 10&#8208;deoxymethynolide.

HYPNOESYS (Hyperpolarized NOE System) has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy in the solution state. We show that 2D NMR spectra can be obtained from HYPNOESYS&#8208;polarized samples, using single&#8208;scan acquisition methods, paving the way to a sensitive, information&#8208;rich and affordable analytical method.







Abstract
The HYPNOESYS method (Hyperpolarized NOE System), which relies on the dissolution of optically polarized crystals, has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy in the solution state. However, HYPNOESYS is a single&#8208;shot method that is not generally compatible with multidimensional NMR. Here we show that 2D NMR spectra can be obtained from HYPNOESYS&#8208;polarized samples, using single&#8208;scan acquisition methods. The approach is illustrated with a mixture of terpene molecules and a benchtop NMR spectrometer, paving the way to a sensitive, information&#8208;rich and affordable analytical method.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;allylarylsilyl)aryl triflates has been developed to give tetrahydrophenanthrosiloles via 1,5&#8208;C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange. The reaction pathways can be switched by tuning the reaction conditions to give fused dihydrodibenzosilepin derivatives from the same starting materials. The inspection of the reaction conditions revealed the importance of carboxylates in promoting the C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;allylarylsilyl)aryl triflates has been developed to give highly fused tetrahydrophenanthrosilole derivatives via unprecedented 1,5&#8208;C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange. The reaction pathways can be switched toward 4&#8208;membered ring&#8208;forming C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation by tuning the reaction conditions to give completely different products, fused dihydrodibenzosilepin derivatives, from the same starting materials. The inspection of the reaction conditions revealed the importance of carboxylates in promoting the C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange.

         <title>Synergistic Activation of Nitrite and Thiocarbonyl Compounds Affords NO and Sulfane Sulfur via (Per)thionitrite (SNO&#8722;/SSNO&#8722;)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic interactions between nitrite anion and the thiocarbonyl functionality in various biologically relevant stable organosulfur motifs are shown to result in the formation of sulfane sulfur (S0) as well as NO gas. Spectroscopic investigations unequivocally suggest the involvement of metastable (per)thionitrite (SNO&#8722;/SSNO&#8722;) species.







Abstract
(Per)thionitrite (SNO&#8722;/SSNO&#8722;) intermediates play vital roles in modulating nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) dependent bio&#8208;signalling processes. Whilst the previous preparations of such intermediates involved reactive H2S/HS&#8722; or sulfane sulfur (S0) species, the present report reveals that relatively stable thiocarbonyl compounds (such as carbon disulfide (CS2), thiocarbamate, thioacetic acid, and thioacetate) react with nitrite anion to yield SNO&#8722;/SSNO&#8722;. For instance, the reaction of CS2 and nitrite anion (NO2&#8722;) under ambient condition affords CO2 and SNO&#8722;/SSNO&#8722;. A detailed investigation involving UV/Vis, FTIR, HRMS, and multinuclear NMR studies confirm the formation of SNO&#8722;/SSNO&#8722;, which are proposed to form through an initial nucleophilic attack by nitrite anion followed by a transnitrosation step. Notably, reactions of CS2 and nitrite in the presence of thiol RSH show the formation of organic polysulfides R&#8208;Sn&#8208;R, thereby illustrating that the thiocarbonyls are capable of influencing the pool of bioavailable sulfane sulfurs. Furthermore, the availability of both NO2&#8722; and thiocarbonyl motifs in the biological context hints at their synergistic metal&#8208;free activations leading to the generation of NO gas and various reactive sulfur species via SNO&#8722;/SSNO&#8722;.

Spectroscopic investigations unequivocally suggest the involvement of metastable (per)thionitrite (SNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/SSNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Per)thionitrite (SNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/SSNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) intermediates play vital roles in modulating nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) dependent bio-signalling processes. Whilst the previous preparations of such intermediates involved reactive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/HS&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or sulfane sulfur (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) species, the present report reveals that relatively stable thiocarbonyl compounds (such as carbon disulfide (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), thiocarbamate, thioacetic acid, and thioacetate) react with nitrite anion to yield SNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/SSNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. For instance, the reaction of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrite anion (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) under ambient condition affords CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/SSNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. A detailed investigation involving UV/Vis, FTIR, HRMS, and multinuclear NMR studies confirm the formation of SNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/SSNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which are proposed to form through an initial nucleophilic attack by nitrite anion followed by a transnitrosation step. Notably, reactions of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrite in the presence of thiol RSH show the formation of organic polysulfides R-S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-R, thereby illustrating that the thiocarbonyls are capable of influencing the pool of bioavailable sulfane sulfurs. Furthermore, the availability of both NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and thiocarbonyl motifs in the biological context hints at their synergistic metal-free activations leading to the generation of NO gas and various reactive sulfur species via SNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/SSNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Irreparable Interphase Chemistry Degradation Induced by Temperature Pulse in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sudden operating temperature change (T pulse) results in a faster capacity fade of graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (Gr|NMC811) pouch full cells. Comprehensive post&#8208;mortem analyses unveil that the T pulse mainly causes a deterioration of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase architecture and chemistry, which in turn accelerates anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase degradation due to aggregated chemical crossover from the cathode during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
While it is widely recognized that the operating temperature significantly affects the energy density and cycle life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the consequence of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry to sudden environmental temperature changes remains inadequately understood. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of a temperature pulse (T pulse) on the electrochemical performance of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) pouch full cells. By utilizing advanced characterization tools, such as time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, we reveal that the T pulse can lead to an irreversible degradation of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry and architecture. Despite negligible immediate impacts on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anode, aggregated cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode chemical crossover gradually degrades the SEI by catalyzing electrolyte reduction decomposition and inducing metallic dead Li formation because of insufficient cathode passivation after the T pulse. Consequently, pouch cells subjected to the T pulse show an inferior cycle stability to those free of the T pulse. This work unveils the effects of sudden temperature changes on the interphase chemistry and cell performance, emphasizing the importance of a proper temperature management in assessing performance.

         <title>Combining Nitridoborates, Nitrides and Hydrides&#8212;Synthesis and Characterization of the Multianionic Sr6N[BN2]2H3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel strontium nitridoborate hydride Sr6N[BN2]2H3 was obtained by a solid&#8208;state synthesis, extending the family of multinary hydrides. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data revealed the crystal structure containing nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions. Impedance spectroscopy shows hydride ion conductivity and MAS NMR as well as vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the structural analysis of our compound.







Abstract
Multianionic metal hydrides, which exhibit a wide variety of physical properties and complex structures, have recently attracted growing interest. Here we present Sr6N[BN2]2H3, prepared in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction at 800&#8201;&#176;C, as the first combination of nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions within a single compound. The crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data in space group P21/c (no.&#8197;14), revealing a three&#8208;dimensional network of undulated layers of nitridoborate units, strontium atoms and hydride together with nitride anions. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calculations further confirm the structure model. Electrochemical measurements suggest the existence of hydride ion conductivity, allowing the hydrides to migrate along the layers.

         <title>Neutral and Anionic Square Planar Palladium(0) Complexes Stabilized by a Silicon Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first neutral and anionic square planar (sp) Pd(0) (ate) complexes are synthesized and fully characterized. Such species, which have been proposed as intermediates in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions, are stabilized using a Si(IV) based Lewis acidic ambiphilic Z&#8208;type ligand, which causes a strong Pd&#8722;Si Z&#8208;type interaction as confirmed by DFT derived methods.







Abstract
Anionic [Pd(0)&#8722;X]&#8722; ate complex were proposed as key intermediates in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling for decades, but their isolation remained elusive. Herein, a chelating Lewis acidic bis(amidophenolato)silane is introduced as a strong Z&#8208;type ligand which enables the characterization of the first anionic [Pd(0)&#8722;X]&#8722; ate complex. Intriguingly, these compounds and the neutral L&#8722;Pd(0) analogs exhibit a square planar coordination that is highly unusual for a d10 metal. Theoretical methods scrutinize the interaction between the Lewis acidic Si(IV) center and the late transition metal, while reactivity studies shed light on the potential role of anionic additives in oxidative addition reactions.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Responsive Flexible Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Based on Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breakthrough in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission performance was realized in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix with a low glass transition temperature. Polymorph&#8208;dependent RTP emission in the PVDF matrix endows a 2.45&#8197;GHz microwave stimulus responsiveness to the material.







Abstract
The development of flexible, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials remains challenging owing to the quenching of their unstable triplet excitons via molecular motion. Therefore, a polymer matrix with Tg higher than room temperature is required to prevent polymer segment movement. In this study, a RTP material was developed by incorporating a 4&#8208;biphenylboronic acid (BPBA) phosphor into a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix (Tg=&#8722;27.1&#8201;&#176;C), which exhibits a remarkable UV&#8208;light&#8208;dependent oxygen consumption phosphorescence with a lifetime of 1275.7&#8197;ms. The adjustable RTP performance is influenced by the crystallinity and polymorph (&#945;, &#946;, and &#947; phases) fraction of PVDF, therefore, the low Tg of the PVDF matrix enables the polymeric segmental motion upon microwave irradiation. Consequently, a reduction in the crystallinity and an increase in the &#945; phase fraction in PVDF film induces RTP after 2.45&#8197;GHz microwave irradiation. These findings open up new avenues for constructing crystalline and phase&#8208;dependent RTP materials while demonstrating a promising approach toward microwave detection.

         <title>Chemical Imaging of RNA&#8208;Tau Amyloid Fibrils at the Nanoscale Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is used to map polyadenosine (polyA)&#8208;induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution. It proves that polyA lies on the surface of the fibril core &#946;&#8208;sheets but remains wrapped by the random&#8208;coiled fuzzy coat. TERS also shows the colocalization of positively charged amino acids with the anionic polyA cofactor, which is an important step to clarify the role of RNA cofactors in the fibril formation.







Abstract
In the presence of cofactors, tau protein can form amyloid deposits in the brain which are implicated in many neurodegenerative disorders. Heparin, lipids, and RNA are used to recreate tau aggregates in vitro from recombinant protein. However, the mechanism of interaction of these cofactors and the interactions between cofactors and tau are poorly understood. Herein, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the spatial distribution of adenine, protein secondary structure, and amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine) in single polyadenosine (polyA)&#8208;induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution (&lt;10&#8211;20&#8197;nm). Based on reference unenhanced and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra, we show that the polyA anionic cofactor is incorporated in the fibril structure and seems to be superficial to the &#946;&#8208;sheet core, but nonetheless enveloped within the random&#8208;coiled fuzzy coat. TERS images also prove the colocalization of positively charged arginine, lysine, and histidine amino acids and negatively charged polyA, which constitutes an important step forward to better comprehend the action of RNA cofactors in the mechanism of formation of toxic tau fibrils. TERS appears as a powerful technique for the identification of cofactors in individual tau fibrils and their mode of interaction.

         <title>Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective NMR Experiments with Preserved Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;scan ultraselective experiments, based on the GEMSTONE (gradient&#8208;enhanced multiplet&#8208;selective targeted&#8208;observation NMR experiment) element, are a powerful approach to extract detailed information from complex NMR spectra. We describe an approach allowing to dramatically reduce signal losses due to translational diffusion, for applications to structure elucidation and mixture analysis.







Abstract
Selective NMR experiments provide rapid access to important structural information, and are essential to tackle the analysis of large molecules and complex mixtures. Single&#8208;scan ultraselective experiments are particularly useful, as they can rapidly select signals that overlap with other signals. Here, we describe a novel type of single&#8208;scan ultraselective NMR experiments that is robust against the effects of translational molecular diffusion, and thus make it possible to improve significantly the sensitivity of the experiment. This will largely broaden the applicability of this powerful class of experiments.

         <title>A Subtle Change in the Flexible Achiral Spacer Does Matter in Supramolecular Chirality: Two&#8208;Fold Odd&#8208;Even Effect in Polymer Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negligible changes of flexible spacers enable remarkable change of supramolecular chirality and anisotropic topology in azobenzene polymer assemblies. The phase transition from amorphous to LC phase can cause the chiroptical inversion in supramolecular assemblies, leading to two types of chiral arrangements with opposite helicity.







Abstract
Precise control over the chirality and morphologies of polymer assemblies, a remaining challenge for both chemists and materials scientists, is receiving ever&#8208;increasing attention in the recent years. Herein, we report the subtle manipulation of the achiral spacers from the chiral stereocenter to the azobenzene (Azo) unit, of which the chiroptical consistency or chiroptical inversion of self&#8208;assemblies could be successfully controlled and present &#8220;two&#8208;fold&#8221; odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, morphological transitions from 0D spherical micelles, 1D worms, and nanowires to 3D vesicles, spindle&#8208; and dumbbell&#8208;shaped vesicles were also unexpectedly found to exhibit odd&#8208;even correlations. These observations were collectively elucidated by mesomorphic properties, stacking modes, chiroptical dynamics, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors. Negligible modifications to the spacer structures can enable remarkable modulation of supramolecular chirality and anisotropic topologies in polymer assemblies, which is of great significance for the design of complex chiral functional polymers.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of BiVO4 for Photochemical Sensing of H2S Gas at Ultra&#8208;low Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octadecahedron BiVO4, which was obtained by facet engineering, was employed as a photochemical sensing material for the selective detection of H2S at an ultralow concentration due to its larger proportion of (110) and (011) facets as well as the formation of the additional (111) facets. The insights into the interaction between H2S and BiVO4 under photoactivation were investigated.







Abstract
We report a photochemical bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) sensing material, which possesses a large proportion of (110) and (011) facets combined with the additional (111) facets, for the selective detection of ultra&#8208;low concentration hydrogen sulfide (H2S) driven by visible light. Specifically, the obtained octadecahedron BiVO4 (Octa&#8208;BiVO4) performs a high response value (67) and short response time (47.4&#8197;s) to 100&#8197;ppm H2S with good stability for nearly 100&#8197;days, as well as undisturbedness by moist air. With the combination of experimental and theoretical calculation results, the adsorption and carrier transfer behaviors of H2S molecules on the Octa&#8208;BiVO4 crystal surface are investigated. By adjusting the ratio of different crystal facets and controlling the facets with characteristic adsorption, we achieve improved anisotropic photoinduced carrier separation and high selectivity for a specific gas. Furthermore, this facial facet engineering can be extended to the synthesis of other sensing materials, offering huge opportunities for fundamental research and technological applications.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Capsule for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble tetrahedral Fe4L6 metal&#8208;organic cage has been successfully used to separate propane and propylene under ambient conditions. Mixed gases of C3H6 and C3H8 were captured by Fe4L6 at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in a U&#8208;shaped glass tube. Governed by the guest binding affinity, C3H6 is released first after transport of the gases to the receiving arm of the tube.







Abstract
The development of energy&#8208;saving technology for the efficient separation of olefin and paraffin is highly important for the chemical industry. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 capsule containing a hydrophobic cavity, which can be used to encapsulate and separate propylene/propane. The successful encapsulation of propylene and propane by the Fe4L6 cage in a water solution was documented by NMR spectroscopy. The binding constants K for the Fe4L6 cage toward propylene and propane were determined to be (5.0&#177;0.1)&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and (2.1&#177;0.7)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in D2O at 25&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the cage exhibited multiple weak interactions with propylene and propane. The polymer&#8208;grade propylene (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) can be obtained from a mixture of propylene and propane by using the Fe4L6 cage as a separation material in a U&#8208;shaped glass tube. This work provides a new strategy for the separation of olefin/paraffin.

&lt;p&gt;The development of energy-saving technology for the efficient separation of olefin and paraffin is highly important for the chemical industry. Herein, we report a self-assembled Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; capsule containing a hydrophobic cavity, which can be used to encapsulate and separate propylene/propane. The successful encapsulation of propylene and propane by the Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cage in a water solution was documented by NMR spectroscopy. The binding constants &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; for the Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cage toward propylene and propane were determined to be (5.0&#177;0.1)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and (2.1&#177;0.7)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at 25&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the cage exhibited multiple weak interactions with propylene and propane. The polymer-grade propylene (&amp;gt;99.5&#8201;%) can be obtained from a mixture of propylene and propane by using the Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cage as a separation material in a U-shaped glass tube. This work provides a new strategy for the separation of olefin/paraffin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Decarboxylative Acylation: Rapid, Modular Access to &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones

         <dc:description>
A new approach to the enantiocontrolled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino ketone derivatives is disclosed by employing a nickel&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative acylation strategy. Starting from readily available acyl chlorides and &#945;&#8208;amino acids&#8208;derived redox&#8208;active esters, the reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, easy scalability, and is applied to dramatically simplify the synthesis of several known structures.







Abstract
A new approach to the enantiocontrolled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino ketone derivatives is disclosed by employing a decarboxylative acylation strategy. Thus, when an acyl chloride and an &#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;containing redox&#8208;active ester are exposed to a nickel catalyst, chiral ligand, and metal reductant, &#945;&#8208;amido ketones are produced in good yield and high ee. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, can be easily scaled up, and is applied to dramatically simplify the synthesis of several known structures.

         <title>Naphthyl Substituted Impurities Induce Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 50, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of yellow&#8208;green room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of triphenylamine from commercial sources has been clarified for the first time, which inspires a general and convenient approach to construct bicomponent host/guest organic RTP materials, that is, doping naphthyl substituted analogues into the host molecule.







Abstract
Accidentally, it was found that triphenylamine (TPA) from commercial sources shows ultralong yellow&#8208;green room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) like commercial carbazole, which however disappears for lab&#8208;synthesized TPA with high purity. Herein, we for the first time identify the impurity types that cause RTP of commercial TPA, which are two N, N&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;naphthylamine isomers. Due to similar molecular polarity and very trace amount (&#8776;0.8&#8197;&#8240;, molar ratio), these naphthyl substituted impurities can be easily overlooked. We further show that even at an extremely low amount (1000000&#8201;:&#8201;1, mass ratio) of impurities, RTP emission is still generated, attributed to the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism. Notably, this doping strategy is also applicable to the triphenylphosphine and benzophenone host systems, of which strong RTP emission can be activated by simply doping the corresponding naphthyl substituted analogues into them. This work therefore provides a general and efficient host/guest strategy toward high performance and diverse organic RTP materials.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the teams of Dana D. Medina, LMU Munich, Germany; Laura M. Salonen, CINBIO, University of Vigo, Spain ; Tim Kowalczyk, Western Washington University, Bellingham, USA; Jo&#227;o Rocha, CICECO, University of Aveiro, Portugal; and Akshay Rao, University of Cambridge, UK. They recently published an article on a three&#8208;component synthesis strategy for the formation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing extended fused aromatics, which enables the synthesis of the building blocks and COF on a similar time scale. The methodology was also successfully applied to produce highly crystalline, preferentially oriented thin films with nanostructured surfaces on various substrates. &#8220;Building Blocks and COFs Formed in Concert&#8211;Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacene Covalent Organic Framework in the Bulk and as Films&#8221;, L.

         <title>Reference&#8208;Quality Free Energy Barriers in Catalysis from Machine Learning Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, we report calculations of the free energies of activation of cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes that combine several different electronic structure methods with molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the use of a high level of theory (here Random Phase Approximation &#8208; RPA) is necessary to bridge the gap between experimental and computed values. These transformations, catalyzed by zeolites and proceeding via cationic intermediates and transition states, are building blocks of many chemical transformations for valorization of long chain paraffins originating, e.g., from plastic waste, vegetable oils, Fischer&#8208;Tropsch waxes or crude oils. Compared with the free energy barriers computed at the PBE+D2 production level of theory via constrained ab initio molecular dynamics, the barriers computed at the RPA level by the application of Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory (MLPT) shows a significant decrease for isomerization reaction and an increase of a similar magnitude for cracking, yielding an unprecedented agreement with the results obtained by experiments and kinetic modeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and energy transfer in carbon dots embedded thylakoids for photonic hybrid capacitor applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanohybrid photosystems have advantages in converting solar energy into electricity, while natural photosystems based solar&#8208;powered energy&#8208;storage device is still under developed. Here, we fabricate a new kind of photo&#8208;rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) benefiting from light&#8208;harvesting carbon dots (CDs) and natural thylakoids for realizing solar energy harvesting and storage simultaneously. Under solar light irradiation, the embedded CDs in thylakoids (CDs/Thy) can convert the less absorbed green light into highly absorbed red light for thylakoids, besides, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CDs and Thy also occurs, which facilitates the photoelectrons generation during thylakoids photosynthesis, thereby resulting in 6&#8208;fold photocurrent output in CDs/Thy hybrid photosystem, compared to pristine thylakoids. Using CDs/Thy as photocathode in ZHCs, the photonic hybrid capacitor shows photoelectric conversion and storage features. CDs can improve the photo&#8208;charging voltage response of ZHCs to ~1.2 V with a remarkable capacitance enhancement of 144% under solar light. This study provides a promising strategy for designing plant&#8208;based photonic and electric device for solar energy harvesting and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances and Prospects in Understanding London Dispersion Interactions in Molecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>London dispersion (LD) interactions are the main contribution of the attractive part of the van der Waals potential. Even though LD effects are the driving force for molecular aggregation and recognition, the role of these omnipresent interactions in structure and reactivity had been largely underappreciated over decades. However, in the recent years considerable efforts have been made to thoroughly study LD interactions and their potential as a chemical design element for structures and catalysis. This was made possible through a fruitful interplay of theory and experiment. This review highlights recent results and advances in utilizing LD interactions as a structural motif to understand and utilize intra&#8208; and intermolecularly LD&#8208;stabilized systems. Additionally, we focus on the quantification of LD interactions and their fundamental role in chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Oxygen Vacancy and High Porosity of Nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for Enhanced Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports that a low&#8208;temperature thermal calcination strategy was adopted to modulate the electronic structure and attain an abundance of surface&#8208;active sites while maintaining the crystal morphology. All the experiments demonstrate that the new photocatalyst nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 obtained by thermal calcination strategy has abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area. This facilitates the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The photocatalytic NH3 yield over MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 is enhanced to 156.9 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, over twice higher than the parent MIL&#8208;125(Ti) (76.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Combined with density function theory (DFT), it shows that the N2 adsorption pattern on the active sites tends to be from &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, which is thermodynamically favourable. Moreover, the electrochemical tests demonstrate that the high atomic ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ can enhance carrier separation, which also promotes the efficiency of photocatalytic N2 fixation. This work may offer new insights into the design of innovative photocatalysts for various chemical reduction reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Measurement of Accumulation of Antibiotics to Staphylococcus aureus in Phagosomes of Live Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) has evolved the ability to persist after uptake into host immune cells. This intracellular niche enables S. aureus to potentially escape host immune responses and survive the lethal actions of antibiotics. While the elevated tolerance of S. aureus to small&#8208;molecule antibiotics is likely to be multifactorial, we pose that there may be contributions related to permeation of antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles, which would require translocation across two mammalian bilayers. To empirically test this, we adapted our recently developed permeability assay to determine the accumulation of FDA&#8208;approved antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles of live macrophages. Bioorthogonal reactive handles were metabolically anchored within the surface of S. aureus, and complementary tags were chemically added to antibiotics. Following phagocytosis of tagged S. aureus cells, we were able to specifically analyze the arrival of antibiotics within the phagosomes of infected macrophages. Our findings enabled the determination of permeability differences between extra&#8208; and intracellular S. aureus, thus providing a roadmap to dissect the contribution of antibiotic permeability to intracellular pathogens.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha alumina (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3) are inert materials with outstanding thermal, chemical and mechanical stability. Herein, we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 monoliths at centimeter scale to endow them with high catalytic activity while maintaining their stability.  We reduce PSC &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 monoliths to create oxygen vacancies in lattice and stabilize them by the ordered lattice to construct unsaturated Al&#8208;O coordination structures for enhancing the catalytic activity. The generation of oxygen vacancy at 18e wyckoff position contribute to the unsaturated Al&#8208;O coordination. As a case study, we demonstrate the outstanding performance with conversion (~34%) and selectivity (~95%) toward non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene at 700 &#176;C. We achieve the outstanding performance without obvious degradation even after a continuous operation over 1000 hours at 700 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effect Shifts CO2 to CO Reduction by Iron Porphyrin from Fe0 to FeI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron porphyrins are among the most studied molecular catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and their reactivity is constantly being enhanced through the implementation of chemical functionalities in the second coordination sphere inspired by the active sites of enzymes. In this study, we were intrigued to observe&#160;that a multipoint hydrogen bonding scheme provided by embarked urea groups could also shift the redox activation step of CO2&#160;from the well&#8208;admitted Fe(0) to the Fe(I) state. Using EPR, resonance Raman, IR and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopies, we underpinned a two&#8208;electron activation step of CO2&#160;starting from the Fe(I) oxidation state to form, after protonation, an Fe(III)&#8210;COOH species. The addition of another electron and a proton to the latter species converged to the cleavage of a C&#8210;O bond with the loss of water molecule resulting in an Fe(II)&#8210;CO species. The DFT analyses of these postulated intermediates is in good agreement with our collected spectroscopic data, thus allowing us to propose an alternative pathway in the catalytic CO2reduction with iron porphyrin catalyst. Such a remarkable shift opens new lines of research in the design of molecular catalysts to reach low overpotentials in performing multi&#8208;electronic CO2&#160;reduction catalysis.</dc:description>

Such a remarkable shift opens new lines of research in the design of molecular catalysts to reach low overpotentials in performing multi-electronic CO2&#160;reduction catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Lithium Chloride Oxidation by Covalent Organic Frameworks for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable Li&#8208;Cl2 battery is a promising high energy density battery system. However, reasonable cycle life could only be achieved under low specific capacities due to the sluggish oxidation of LiCl to Cl2. Herein, we propose an amine&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) with catalytic activity, namely COF&#8208;NH2, that significantly decreases the oxidation barrier of LiCl and accelerates the oxidation kinetics of LiCl in Li&#8208;Cl2 cell. The resulting Li&#8208;Cl2 cell using COF&#8208;NH2 (Li&#8208;Cl2@COF&#8208;NH2) simultaneously exhibits low overpotential, ultrahigh discharge capacity up to 3500 mAh/g and a promoted utilization ratio of deposited LiCl at the first cycle (UR&#8208;LiCl) of 81.4%, which is the highest report value to date. Furthermore, the Li&#8208;Cl2@COF&#8208;NH2 cell could be stably cycled for over 200 cycles when operating at a capacity of 2000 mAh/g at &#8208;20 &#176;C with a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of ~100% and a discharge plateau of 3.5 V. Impressively, the Li&#8208;Cl2@COF&#8208;NH2 pouch cell delivers an attractive energy density of &gt;400&#8201;Wh/kg based on the cathode, anode and utilized electrolyte for 50 cycles with an average CE of ~95%. Our superior Li&#8208;Cl2 batteries enabled by organocatalyst enlighten an arena towards high&#8208;energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptor Featuring Unique Self&#8208;Regulation Effect for Organic Solar Cells with 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The blend nanomorphology of electron&#8208;donor (D) and &#8208;acceptor (A) materials is of vital importance to achieving highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Exogenous additives especially aromatic additives are always needed to further optimize the nanomorphology of blend films, which is hardly compatible with industrial manufacture. Herein, we proposed a unique approach to meticulously modulate the aggregation behavior of NFAs in both crystal and thin film nanomorphology via self&#8208;regulation effect. Nonfullerene acceptor Z9 was designed and synthesized by tethering phenyl groups on the inner side chains of the Y6 backbone. Compared with Y6, the tethered phenyl groups participated in the molecular aggregation via the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of phenyl&#8208;phenyl and phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile&#160;(IC&#8208;2F) groups, which induced 3D charge&#160;transport with&#160;phenyl&#8208;mediated&#160;super&#8208;exchange electron coupling. Moreover, ordered molecular packing with suitable phase separation&#160;was observed in Z9&#8208;based blend films. High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.0% (certified PCE of 18.6%) for Z9&#8208;based devices were achieved&#160;without additives, indicating the great potential of&#160;the self&#8208;regulation strategy in NFA design.</dc:description>

         <title>Ba12[BN2]6.67H4 &#8211; A Disordered Anti&#8208;Skutterudite Filled with Nitridoborate Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skutterudites are of high interest in current research due their diversity of structures comprising empty, partially filled and filled variants, mostly based on metallic compounds. We herein present Ba12[BN2]6.67H4, forming a non&#8208;metallic filled anti&#8208;skutterudite. It is accessed in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction from barium subnitride, boron nitride and barium hydride at 750&#160;&#176;C. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data allowed to elucidate the structure in the cubic space group Im&#8208;3 (no. 204). The barium and hydride atoms form a three&#8208;dimensional network consisting of corner&#8208;sharing HBa6 octahedra and Ba12 icosahedra. Slightly bent [BN2]3&#8722; units are located in the icosahedra and the voids in&#8208;between. 1H and 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments and vibrational spectroscopy further support the structure model. Quantum chemical calculations coincide well with experimental results and provide information about the electronic structure of Ba12[BN2]6.67H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Magnetic Dipole Transition Moment Be Engineered?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chiral compounds with enhanced chiroptical properties is an important challenge to improve device applications. To that end, an optimization of the electric and magnetic dipole transition moments of the molecule is necessary. Nevertheless, the relationship between chemical structure and such quantum mechanical properties is not always clear. That is the case of magnetic dipole transition moment (m) for which no general trends for its optimization have been suggested. In this work we propose a general rationalization for improving the magnitude of m in different families of chiral compounds. Performing a clustering analysis of hundreds of transitions, we have been able to identify a single group in which &#9474;m&#9474; value is maximized along the helix axis. More interestingly, we have found an accurate linear relationship (up to R2 = 0.994) between the maximum value of this parameter and the area of the inner cavity of the helix, thus resembling classical behavior of solenoids. This research provides a tool for the rationalized synthesis of compounds with improved chiroptical responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Defect Engineering Synergistically Boost High Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion Efficiency of Cerium oxide/Au Hollow Nanomushrooms for Nitrogen Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cerium oxide nanosheets with abundant strain&#8208;VO defects were anchored on Au hollow nanomushroom through atomically sharp interfaces to construct a novel semiconductor/plasmonic metal hollow nanomushroom&#8208;like heterostructure (cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au) for N2 photofixation. Benefitting from judicious structural and defect engineering, the cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au exhibit great nitrogen photofixation performance with a SCC efficiency of 0.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation using solar illumination under ambient conditions is a promising strategy for production of the indispensable chemical NH3. However, due to the catalyst&#8216;s limitations in solar energy utilization, loss of hot electrons during transfer, and low nitrogen adsorption and activation capacity, the unsatisfactory solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiencies of most photocatalysts limit their practical applications. Herein, cerium oxide nanosheets with abundant strain&#8208;VO defects were anchored on Au hollow nanomushroom through atomically sharp interfaces to construct a novel semiconductor/plasmonic metal hollow nanomushroom&#8208;like heterostructure (denoted cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au). Plasmonic Au extended the absorption of light from the visible to the second near&#8208;infrared region. The superior interface greatly enhanced the transfer efficiency of hot electrons. Abundant strain&#8208;VO defects induced by interfacial compressive strain promoted adsorption and in situ activation of nitrogen, and such synergistic promotion of strain and VO defects was further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The judicious structural and defect engineering co&#8208;promoted the efficient nitrogen photofixation of the cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au heterostructures with a SCC efficiency of 0.1&#8201;% under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination, which is comparable to the average solar&#8208;to&#8208;biomass conversion efficiency of natural photosynthesis by typical plants, thus exhibiting significant potential as a new candidate for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Analgesic Buxus alkaloids with Enhanced Selectivity for the Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Gated Calcium Channel Cav3.2&#8201;over Cav3.1&#8201;through a New Binding Mode</title>

         <dc:description>
It is important to explore modulators with heightened selectivity index (SI) for a subtype of low&#8208;voltage&#8208;gated Ca2+ channels (Cav3.1&#8211;3.3) for drug development. Among 23 Buxus alkaloids featuring three distinct carbon skeletons, 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artane&#8208;type compounds 9 and 10 were identified as a novel type of Cav3.2 inhibitor. With a unique binding mode, they exhibit highly enhanced preference for Cav3.2 over Cav3.1 and robust analgesic effects.







Abstract
Low&#8208;voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (LVGCCs; Cav3.1&#8208;3.3) represent promising drug targets for epilepsy, pain, and essential tremor. At present, modulators with heightened selectivity for a subtype of LVGCCs are still highly desired. In this study we explored three classes of Buxus alkaloids and identified 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artanes Buxusemine H and Buxusemine L (BXSL) as an unprecedented type of Cav3.2 inhibitors. Particularly, BXSL exhibited Cav3.2 inhibition comparable to Z944, a non&#8208;subtype&#8208;selective LVGCCs inhibitor under clinical trial. While lacking specificity for Cav3.3, BXSL showed a 30&#8208;fold selectivity of Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. As compared to several well&#8208;known inhibitors, the experimental and computational studies suggested BXSL exhibits a distinct binding mode to Cav3.2, notably through the essential interaction with serine&#8208;1543 in domain III. Furthermore, BXSL showed minimal impact on various recombinant and native nociceptive ion channels, while significantly reducing the excitability of isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Animal studies in wild&#8208;type and Cav3.2 knock&#8208;out mice revealed that BXSL (5&#8197;mg/kg), by inhibiting Cav3.2, exhibits an analgesic effect equivalent to Z944 (10&#8197;mg/kg) or mibefradil (10&#8197;mg/kg). Moreover, we proposed a structural rationale for the high selectivity of 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artane&#8208;type alkaloids towards Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. This study introduces a novel analgesic agent and valuable molecular insight for structure&#8208;based innovative Cav3.2 drug development.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Halogenation of Unsaturated Halide and Triflate Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint experimental and theoretical techniques highlighted three main catalytic events in an electrochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange reaction of aryl halides: Oxidative addition of Ar&#8722;X to a Ni(0) species first delivers a Ni(II)ArX, which undergoes salt metathesis with chloride to afford Ni(II)ArCl. The latter is electrochemically oxidized to a Ni(III) species, enabling the formation of the product upon reductive elimination.







Abstract
A robust electrochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange of unsaturated halides and triflates (Br to Cl, I to Cl, I to Br, and OTf to Cl) is reported. A combination of NiCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;glyme as the precatalyst, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as a ligand, NMP as the solvent, and electrochemistry allowed the generation of a nickel species that promotes reductive elimination of the desired product. This paired electrochemical halogenation is compatible with a range of unsaturated halides and triflates, including heterocycles, dihaloarenes, and alkenes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Joint experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations highlighted three catalytic events: i) oxidative addition of the aryl halide to a Ni(0) species to deliver a Ni(II) intermediate; ii) halide metathesis at Ni(II); iii) electrochemical oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) to enable the formation of the desired aryl halide upon reductive elimination. This methodology allows the replacement of heavy halogens (I or Br) or polar atoms (O) with the corresponding lighter and more lipophilic Cl group to block undesired reactivity or modify the properties of drug and agrochemical candidates.

         <title>Tandem Electro&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Catalysis for the Oxidative Aminocarbonylation of Arylboronic Acids to Amides from CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic system that couples overall CO2 electroreduction with thermocatalytic oxidative aminocarbonylation was reported to produce various value&#8208;added amides.







Abstract
Direct CO2 electroreduction to valuable chemicals is critical for carbon neutrality, while its main products are limited to simple C1/C2 compounds, and traditionally, the anodic O2 byproduct is not utilized. We herein report a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic system that fully utilizes both cathodic (i.e., CO) and anodic (i.e., O2) products during overall CO2 electrolysis to produce valuable organic amides from arylboronic acids and amines in a separate chemical reactor, following the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation mechanism. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT)&#8208;incorporated silver and nickel hydroxide carbonate electrocatalysts were prepared for efficient coproduction of CO and O2 with Faradaic efficiencies of 99.3&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. Systematic experiments, operando attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical studies reveal that HMT promotes *CO2 hydrogenation/*CO desorption for accelerated CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, and O2 inhibits reductive deactivation of the Pd(II) catalyst for enhanced oxidative aminocarbonylation, collectively leading to efficient synthesis of 10 organic amides with high yields of above 81&#8201;%. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic strategy for economically attractive CO2 conversion and amide synthesis, representing a new avenue to explore the full potential of CO2 utilization.

         <title>New Reaction Pathway of Superoxide Disproportionation Induced by a Soluble Catalyst in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium tris(bipyridine) (RB) cations promote the intramolecular charge transfer of O2&#8722; dimers and accelerate their disproportionation in discharge and charge processes. This facilitates the reaction kinetics and simultaneously mitigates O2&#8722; and 1O2 related side reactions to endow the Li&#8208;O2 battery with small overvoltages and prolonged cycling stability.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery has attracted considerable interest for high theoretical energy density, however the disproportionation of the intermediate of superoxide (O2&#8722;) during discharge and charge leads to slow reaction kinetics and large voltage hysteresis. Herein, the chemically stable ruthenium tris(bipyridine) (RB) cations are employed as a soluble catalyst to alternate the pathway of O2&#8722; disproportionation and its kinetics in both the discharge and charge processes. RB captures O2&#8722; dimer and promotes their intramolecular charge transfer, and it decreases the energy barrier of the disproportionation reaction from 7.70 to 0.70&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This facilitates the discharge and charge processes and simultaneously mitigates O2&#8722; and singlet oxygen related side reactions. These endow the Li&#8208;O2 battery with reduced discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.72&#8197;V and prolonged lifespan for over 230 cycles when coupled with RuO2 catalyst. This work highlights the vital role of superoxide disproportionation for Li&#8208;O2 battery.

         <dc:description>The first asymmetric total synthesis of the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid arboduridine has been accomplished. The tricyclic A/B/D ring system is constructed by an enantioselective Michael reaction followed by intramolecular nucleophilic addition. Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;amination of ketone is employed to forge the piperidine ring, while a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction is used to form the pyrrolidine ring. A reduction cyclization cascade leads to formation of the tetrahydrofuran ring.</dc:description>

Intramolecular &#945;-amination of ketone is employed to forge the piperidine ring, while a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction is used to form the pyrrolidine ring. A reduction cyclization cascade leads to formation of the tetrahydrofuran ring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Electroreduction of O2 into H2O2 over ZnCo Bimetallic Triazole Frameworks Promoted by Ligand Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnCo bimetal&#8208;triazole framework has been developed as high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts. The unique ligand effect of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole optimizes the electronic structure of Co sites and enables an asymmetric &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; adsorption mode of O2 molecule, resulting in an excellent 2e&#8722; ORR performance with a selectivity of &#8776;100&#8201;% and an H2O2 production rate of 5.55&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Co&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) are highly promising for H2O2 production, but suffer from the intrinsic activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report a ZnCo bimetal&#8208;triazole framework (ZnCo&#8208;MTF) as high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the coordination between 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and Co increases the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy on the Co&#8722;N bond, promoting the activation of Co center. Besides, the adjacent Zn&#8722;Co sites on 1,2,3&#8208;triazole enable an asymmetric &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; adsorption mode of O2, favoring the reduction of O2 molecules and desorption of OOH* intermediate. By virtue of the unique ligand effect, the ZnCo&#8208;MTF exhibits a 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of &#8776;100&#8201;%, onset potential of 0.614&#8197;V and H2O2 production rate of 5.55&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zeolite imidazole frameworks. Our work paves the way for the design of 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts with desirable coordination and electronic structure.

         <title>Tuning the Aggregates of Thiophene&#8208;based Trimers by Methyl Side&#8208;chain Engineering for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the aggregation of 4,7&#8208;bis(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzothiadiazole (TBT)&#8208;based conjugated trimers and their photocatalytic activity was systematically investigated by methyl side&#8208;chain engineering. TBT&#8208;3 with the smallest size of aggregates and highest crystallinity exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, which is due to the shorter charge carrier transport distance and solid long&#8208;range order.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors (OCSs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional inorganic materials for photocatalysis. However, the aggregation of OCSs in photocatalytic aqueous solution caused by self&#8208;assembly, which closely relates to the photocatalytic activity, has not yet been studied. Here, the relationship between the aggregation of 4,7&#8208;Bis(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzothiadiazole (TBT) and the photocatalytic activity was systematically investigated by introducing and varying the position of methyl side chains on the two peripheral thiophene units. Experimental and theoretical results indicated that the introduction of &#8208;CH3 group at the 3&#8208;position of TBT resulted in the smallest size and best crystallinity of aggregates compared to that of TBT, 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions. As a result, TBT&#8208;3 exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity towards H2 evolution, ascribed to the shorten charge carrier transport distance and solid long&#8208;range order. These results suggest the important role of aggregation behavior of OCSs for efficient photocatalysis.

         <title>Olefination of Aromatic Carbonyls via Site&#8208;Specific Activation of Cycloalkanone Ketals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple substrate design allows site&#8208;specific activation of cyclic ketones for olefination reaction of aromatic carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Skeletal editing is an important strategy in organic synthesis as it modifies the carbon backbone to tailor molecular structures with precision, enabling access to compounds with specific desired properties. Skeletal editing empowers chemists to transform synthetic approaches of target compounds across diverse applications from drug discovery to materials science. Herein, we introduce a new skeletal editing method to convert readily available aromatic carbonyl compounds into valuable unsaturated carboxylic acids with extended carbon chains. Our reaction setup enables a cascade reaction of enolization&#8208;[2+2]cycloaddition&#8208;[2+2]cycloreversion between aromatic carbonyl compounds and ketals of cyclic ketones to generate unsaturated carboxylic acids as ring&#8208;opening products. Through a simple design, our substrates are specifically activated to react at predetermined positions to enhance selectivity and efficiency. This practical method offers convenient access to versatile organic building blocks as well as provides fresh insights into manipulating traditional reaction pathways for new synthetic applications.

Abstract
Constructing ambient&#8208;stable, single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials with atomic precision and understanding their underlying stability mechanisms are challenging. Here, stable single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanoclusters of Pd were synthesized and precisely characterized through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. A pseudo&#8208;pentalene&#8208;like Pd8 unit was found in the nanocluster, interacting with two syn PPh units through nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal &#8208;ring coordination. The unexpected coordination, which is distinctly different from the typical organoring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination in half&#8208;sandwich&#8208;type organometallic compounds, contributes to the ambient stability of the as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanocluster as revealed through theoretical and experimental analyses. Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations revealed dominant electron transition along the horizontal x&#8208;direction of the Pd8 plane, indicating high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the nanocluster, which was verified by the experimental PCE of 73.3&#8201;%. Therefore, this study unveils the birth of a novel type of compound and the finding of the unusual nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal &#8208;ring coordination and has important implications for future syntheses, structures, properties, and structure&#8211;property correlations of single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Active Sites of Cobalt Phthalocyanine in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic and spectroscopic characterizations of cobalt phthalocyanine on carbon nanotubes (CoPc/CNT) and its catalyst analogs are reported. The results help us understand the nature of the active site for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol.







Abstract
Many metal coordination compounds catalyze CO2 electroreduction to CO, but cobalt phthalocyanine hybridized with conductive carbon such as carbon nanotubes is currently the only one that can generate methanol. The underlying structure&#8211;reactivity correlation and reaction mechanism desperately demand elucidation. Here we report the first in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterization, combined with ex situ spectroscopic and electrocatalytic measurements, to study CoPc&#8208;catalyzed CO2 reduction to methanol. Molecular dispersion of CoPc on CNT surfaces, as evidenced by the observed electronic interaction between the two, is crucial to fast electron transfer to the active sites and multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. CO, the key intermediate in the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol pathway, is found to be labile on the active site, which necessitates a high local concentration in the microenvironment to compete with CO2 for active sites and promote methanol production. A comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of structurally related porphyrins indicates that the bridging aza&#8208;N atoms of the Pc macrocycle are critical components of the CoPc active site that produces methanol. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identifies the active site as Co(I) and supports an increasingly non&#8208;centrosymmetric Co coordination environment at negative applied potential, likely due to the formation of a Co&#8722;CO adduct during the catalysis.

         <title>Promoting Piezocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water by Loading Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles on Graphitic Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezocatalyst for H2O2 production gives a yield of 120.21&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water and air. The metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) component enhances substrate (O2) and product (H2O2) adsorption via host&#8211;guest interaction and hinder the rapid H2O2 decomposition. The gold nanoparticle (AuNP) component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) component for O2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Piezocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production is a green synthesis method, but the rapid complexation of charge carriers in piezocatalysts and the difficulty of adsorbing substrates limit its performance. Here, metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles are anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4) via hydrogen bond to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient H2O2 production. Experiments and theoretical calculations prove that MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 simultaneously optimize three key parts of piezocatalytic H2O2 production: i) the MOC component enhances substrate (O2) and product (H2O2) adsorption via host&#8211;guest interaction and hinders the rapid decomposition of H2O2 on MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4, ii) the AuNP component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from g&#8208;C3N4 for O2 reduction reaction (ORR), iii) holes are used for H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) to produce O2 and H+ to further promote ORR. Thus, MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 can be used as an efficient piezocatalyst to generate H2O2 at rates up to 120.21&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in air and pure water without using sacrificial agents. This work proposes a new strategy for efficient piezocatalytic H2O2 synthesis by constructing multiple active sites in semiconductor catalysts via hydrogen bonding, by enhancing substrate adsorption, rapid separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs and preventing rapid decomposition of H2O2.

         <title>Regiodivergent Carbonylation of Alkenes: Selective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Linear and Branched Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first regioselective selenocarbonylation of alkenes is reported. This general protocol provides a variety of branched and linear selenoesters with wide functional group compatibility and tunable regioselectivity.







Abstract
An unprecedented regiodivergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of aromatic alkenes has been developed. Utilizing commercially available Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 in the presence of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenediyl&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphine) ligand L8 diverse selenoesters are obtained in a straightforward manner. Key to success for the control of the regioselectivity of the carbonylation step is the concentration of the acidic co&#8208;catalyst. This general protocol features wide functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the presence of stoichiometric amounts of acid changes the properties and coordination mode of the ligand leading to reversed regioselectivity.

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Alanine&#8208;Tyramine Conjugates into Versatile, Uniform, Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Organic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;loaded uniform hollow organic nanoparticles (NPs) can be prepared by enzymatic dimerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (e&#8208;DISA) by employing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and short alanine&#8208;tyramine conjugates. These NPs allowed efficient detection of salivary glucose levels through s fluorimetry assay of dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Surface modification of these NPs by using different phenolic additives (tyramine/tannic acid) was also possible.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel enzymatic dimerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (e&#8208;DISA) procedure that converts alanine&#8208;tyramine conjugates into highly uniform enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocontainers by the action of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in an aqueous medium under ambient conditions. The NP formation was possible with both enantiomers of alanine, and the average diameter could be varied from 150&#8197;nm to 250&#8197;nm (with a 5&#8211;12&#8201;% standard deviation of as&#8208;prepared samples) depending on the precursor concentration. About 60&#8201;% of the added HRP enzyme was entrapped within the NPs and was subsequently utilized for post&#8208;synthetic modification of the NPs with phenolic compounds such as tyramine or tannic acid. One&#8208;pot multi&#8208;enzyme entrapment of glucose oxidase (GOx) and peroxidase (HRP) within the NPs was also achieved. These GOx&#8208;HRP loaded NPs allowed multimodal detection of glucose, including that present in human saliva, with a limit of detection (LoD) of 740&#8197;nM through fluorimetry. The NPs exhibited good cytocompatibility and were stable to changes in pH (acidic to basic), temperature, ultrasonication, and even the presence of organic solvent (EtOH) to a certain extent, since they are stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960;, and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. The proposed e&#8208;DISA procedure can be widely expanded through the design of diverse enzyme&#8208;responsive precursors.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Propargyl&#8208;Aryl Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.







Abstract
Performing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions between propargylic electrophiles and aryl nucleophiles is a well&#8208;established method to build enantioenriched benzylic alkynes. Here, a catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. Propargylic chlorides were treated with aryl iodides as well as heteroaryl iodides in the presence of a chiral nickel complex, and manganese metal was used as a stoichiometric reductant, allowing for the construction of a propargyl C&#8208;aryl bond under mild conditions. An alternative dual nickel/photoredox catalytic protocol was also developed for this cross&#8208;electrophile coupling in the absence of a metal reductant. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.

&lt;p&gt;A catalytic enantioselective propargyl-aryl cross-coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing asymmetric cross-coupling reactions between propargylic electrophiles and aryl nucleophiles is a well-established method to build enantioenriched benzylic alkynes. Here, a catalytic enantioselective propargyl-aryl cross-coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. Propargylic chlorides were treated with aryl iodides as well as heteroaryl iodides in the presence of a chiral nickel complex, and manganese metal was used as a stoichiometric reductant, allowing for the construction of a propargyl C-aryl bond under mild conditions. An alternative dual nickel/photoredox catalytic protocol was also developed for this cross-electrophile coupling in the absence of a metal reductant. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal [4+1] Cyclization of Benzyl Alcohols and Benzaldimines: Facile Access to Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [4+1] annulation of benzyl alcohols and benzaldimines with secondary silanes has been achieved in excellent enantioselectivity to afford a range of sila&#8208;O&#8208; and sila&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles with silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers, where the rhodium catalyst plays a dual role in the O/N&#8208;Si and C&#8208;Si coupling.







Abstract
The carbon&#8208;to&#8208;silicon switch in formation of bioactive sila&#8208;heterocycles with a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center has garnered significant interest in drug discovery. However, metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of such scaffolds is still in its infancy. Herein, a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [4+1] cyclization of benzyl alcohols and benzaldimines has been realized by enantioselective difunctionalization of a secondary silane reagent, affording chiral&#8208;at&#8208;silicon cyclic silyl ethers and sila&#8208;isoindolines, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal a dual role of the rhodium&#8208;hydride catalyst. The coupling system proceeds via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;determining dehydrogenative OH silylation of the benzyl alcohol or hydrosilylation of the imine to give an enantioenriched silyl ether or silazane intermediate, respectively. The same rhodium catalyst also enables subsequent intramolecular cyclative C&#8722;H silylation directed by the pendent Si&#8208;H group. Experimental and DFT studies have been conducted to explore the mechanism of the OH bond silylation of benzyl alcohol, where the Si&#8208;O reductive elimination from a Rh(III) hydride intermediate has been established as the enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation Enables the Stereoselective Synthesis and Structure Revision of Indidene Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indane polyketides indidenes A and C were synthesized from a common intermediate through nickel&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, respectively. The common diol intermediate was obtained by palladium&#8208;catalyzed methylene C&#8722;H arylation, which was performed in both racemic and enantioselective modes. This study led to the revision of the absolute configuration of indidene C.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of two indane polyketides of the indidene family, namely (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A (11 steps, 1.7&#8201;%) and (+)&#8208;indidene C (13 steps, 1.3&#8201;%), is reported. The synthesis of the trans&#8208;configured common indane intermediate was enabled by palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation, which was performed in both racemic and enantioselective (e.r. 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) modes. Further elaboration of this common intermediate by nickel&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling allowed the rapid installation of the aroyl moiety of (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A. In parallel, the biphenyl system of (&#177;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;indidene C was constructed by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. These investigations led us to revise the structures of indidenes B and C.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an [M8L24]16+ Intertwined Cube and a Giant [M12L16]24+ Orthobicupola</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been used to create a giant orthobicupola and an intertwined &#8220;A&#8208;type cube&#8221;. The concept of generating intricate structures through the use of flexibility in the form of an elongated, flexible terphenyl&#8208;based tetratopic ligand (L2) in combination with a cis&#8208;blocked Pd(II) metal counterpart led to the formation of this uncommon water&#8208;soluble intertwined &#8220;A&#8208;type&#8221; cube.







Abstract
Through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, aesthetically captivating structures can be formed by tuning the length or flexibility of various components. The self&#8208;assembly of an elongated rigid terphenyl&#8208;based tetra&#8208;pyridyl ligand (L1) with a cis&#8208;Pd(II) acceptor produces an [M12L16]24+ triangular orthobicupola structure (1). When flexibility is introduced into the ligand by the incorporation of a &#8208;CH2&#8208; group between the dipyridylamine and terphenyl rings in the ligand (L2), anunique [M8L24]16+ water&#8208;soluble &#8216;intertwined cubic structure&#8217; (2) results. The inherent flexibility of ligand L2 might be the key factor behind the formation of the thermodynamically stable and &#8242;intertwined cubic structure&#8242; in this scenario. This research showcases the ability to design and fabricate novel, topologically distinctive molecular structures by a straightforward and efficient approach.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in 2D Chalcogenides: Structural Origin and Chemical Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenide rocksalt crystals are associated with metavalent bonding (MVB), a recent subject of debate. In this study, we investigate various 2D lattices of chalcogenides to understand MVB. Honeycomb lattices adhere to the 8&#8208;N rule and are covalently bonded. Square and orthorhombic structures display in&#8208;plane MVB, driven by p&#8208;p orbital interactions, with cationic lone pairs inducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane puckering.







Abstract
An unusual set of anomalous functional properties of rocksalt crystals of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenides were recently linked to a kind of bonding termed as metavalent bonding (MVB) which involves violation of the 8&#8208;N rule. Precise mechanisms of MVB and the relevance of lone pair of Group&#8197;IV cations are still debated. With restrictions of low dimensionality on the possible atomic coordination, 2D materials provide a rich platform for exploration of MVB. Here, we present first&#8208;principles theoretical analysis of the nature of bonding in five distinct 2D lattices of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenides MX (M: Sn, Pb, Ge and X: S, Se, Te), in which the natural out&#8208;of&#8208;plane expression of the lone pair versus in&#8208;plane bonding can be systematically explored. While their honeycomb lattices respecting the 8&#8208;N rule are shown to exhibit covalent bonding, their square and orthorhombic structures exhibit MVB only in&#8208;plane, with cationic lone pair activating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane structural puckering that controls their relative stability. Anomalies in Born&#8208;effective charges, dielectric constants, Gr&#252;neisen parameters occur only in their in&#8208;plane behaviour, confirming MVB is confined strictly to 2D and originates from p&#8208;p orbital interactions. Our work opens up directions for chemical design of MVB based 2D materials and their heterostructures.

This paper presents the development of nIR fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors for glucose imaging. The authors find that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the enzymatic activity but rather triggered by the substrate&#8208;enzyme binding. Leveraging this unique mechanism, the authors developed catalytically inactive nanosensors that enable glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.







Abstract
Continuous and non&#8208;invasive glucose monitoring and imaging is important for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management. However, glucose monitoring remains a technical challenge owing to the dearth of tissue&#8208;transparent glucose sensors. In this study, we present the development of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors directly functionalized with glucose oxidase (GOx) capable of immediate and reversible glucose imaging in biological fluids and tissues. We prepared GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors by facile sonication of SWCNT with GOx in a manner that&#8212;surprisingly&#8212;does not compromise the ability of GOx to detect glucose. Importantly, we find by using denatured GOx that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the catalytic oxidation of glucose but rather triggered by glucose&#8208;GOx binding. Leveraging the unique response mechanism of GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors, we developed catalytically inactive apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT that enables both sensitive and reversible glucose imaging, exhibiting a &#916;F/F0 of up to 40&#8201;% within 1&#8197;s of exposure to glucose without consuming the glucose analyte. We finally demonstrate the potential applicability of apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT in biomedical applications by glucose quantification in human plasma and glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.

         <title>Well&#8208;defined N3C1&#8208;anchored Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
N3C1&#8208;anchored single metal sites in well&#8208;defined molecules are studied to make up the structure&#8208;property correlation study challenge for carbon materials. The established volcano plots and the experimental catalysis results provide possibilities of fundamental understanding of asymmetric single metal active sites for electrochemical catalysis.







Abstract
N&#8208;, C&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal&#8208;sites (SMSs) have garnered significant attention due to the potential for significantly enhanced catalytic capabilities resulting from charge redistribution. However, significant challenges persist in the precise design of well&#8208;defined such SMSs, and the fundamental comprehension has long been impeded in case&#8208;by&#8208;case reports using carbon materials as investigation targets. In this work, the well&#8208;defined molecular catalysts with N3C1&#8208;anchored SMSs, i.e., N&#8208;confused metalloporphyrins (NCPor&#8208;Ms), are calculated for their catalytic oxygen reduction activity. Then, NCPor&#8208;Ms with corresponding N4&#8208;anchored SMSs (metalloporphyrins, Por&#8208;Ms), are synthesized for catalytic activity evaluation. Among all, NCPor&#8208;Co reaches the top in established volcano plots. NCPor&#8208;Co also shows the highest half&#8208;wave potential of 0.83&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much better than that of Por&#8208;Co (0.77&#8197;V vs. RHE). Electron&#8208;rich, low band gap and regulated d&#8208;band center contribute to the high activity of NCPor&#8208;Co. This study delves into the examination of well&#8208;defined asymmetric SMS molecular catalysts, encompassing both theoretical and experimental facets. It serves as a pioneering step towards enhancing the fundamental comprehension and facilitating the development of high&#8208;performance asymmetric SMS catalysts.

         <title>Fully Aromatic Self&#8208;Assembled Hole&#8208;Selective Layer toward Efficient Inverted Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells with Ultraviolet Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully aromatic carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer, denoted as MeO&#8208;PhPACz, is employed as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The fully aromatic configuration is crucial in promoting the formation of a dense and highly ordered HSL, improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. The optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.10&#8201;% and excellent UV resistance.







Abstract
Ultraviolet&#8208;induced degradation has emerged as a critical stability concern impeding the widespread adoption of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in the context of phase&#8208;unstable wide&#8208;band gap perovskite films. This study introduces a novel approach by employing a fully aromatic carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer, denoted as (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;PhPACz), as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap PSCs. Incorporating a conjugated linker plays a pivotal role in promoting the formation of a dense and highly ordered HSL on substrates, facilitating subsequent perovskite interfacial interactions, and fostering the growth of uniform perovskite films. The high&#8208;quality film could effectively suppress interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. Through these advancements, the optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs, featuring a band gap of 1.68&#8197;eV, attain an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.10&#8201;%. Remarkably, MeO&#8208;PhPACz demonstrates inherent UV resistance and heightened UV absorption capabilities, substantially improving UV resistance for the targeted PSCs. This characteristic holds significance for the feasibility of large&#8208;scale outdoor applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sufficient conversion of residual photoinstable PbI2 into robust 1D perovskite (EMIMPbI3) to improve device stability, while the formation of an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface can reduce the energetic mismatch via a single process. The optimized device delivers an efficiency of 24.28&#8201;% and a remarkable open circuit voltage of 1.19&#8197;V, accompanied with excellent humidity and operational stability.







Abstract
Eliminating the undesired photoinstability of excess lead iodide (PbI2) in the perovskite film and reducing the energy mismatch between the perovskite layer and heterogeneous interfaces are urgent issues to be addressed in the preparation of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by two&#8208;step sequential deposition method. Here, the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) is employed to convert superfluous PbI2 to more robust 1D EMIMPbI3 which can withstand lattice strain, while forming an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface to reconfigure the interfacial energy band structure and accelerate the charge extraction. Consequently, the unencapsulated PVSCs device attains a champion efficiency of 24.28&#8201;% with one of the highest open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.19&#8197;V). Moreover, the unencapsulated devices showcase significantly improved thermal stability, enhanced environmental stability and remarkable operational stability accompanied by 85&#8201;% of primitive efficiency retained over 1500&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination.

         <title>Carbon Oxyanion Self&#8208;Transformation on NiFe Oxalates Enables Long&#8208;Term Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carbon transformation (from C2O42&#8722; to CO32&#8722;) not only facilitates the generation of active sites but also defends the key active oxyhydroxides against surface chlorine chemistry during oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline seawater. Moreover, NiFe oxalates on Ni foam ((NiFe)C2O4/NF) outperforms reported catalysts by achieving 600&#8208;h operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with minimal potential losses.







Abstract
Seawater electrolysis is an attractive way of making H2 in coastal areas, and NiFe&#8208;based materials are among the top options for alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO). However, ample Cl&#8722; in seawater can severely corrode catalytic sites and lead to limited lifespans. Herein, we report that in situ carbon oxyanion self&#8208;transformation (COST) from oxalate to carbonate on a monolithic NiFe oxalate micropillar electrode allows safeguard of high&#8208;valence metal reaction sites in ASO. In situ/ex situ studies show that spontaneous, timely, and appropriate COST safeguards active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during ASO even at an ampere&#8208;level current density (j). Our NiFe catalyst shows efficient and stable ASO performance, which requires an overpotential as low as 349&#8197;mV to attain a j of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the NiFe catalyst with protective surface CO32&#8722; exhibits a slight activity degradation after 600&#8197;h of electrolysis under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. This work reports effective catalyst surface design concepts at the level of oxyanion self&#8208;transformation, acting as a momentous step toward defending active sites in seawater&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion systems.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) not only facilitates the generation of active sites but also defends the key active oxyhydroxides against surface chlorine chemistry during oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline seawater. Moreover, NiFe oxalates on Ni foam ((NiFe)C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NF) outperforms reported catalysts by achieving 600-h operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with minimal potential losses.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seawater electrolysis is an attractive way of making H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in coastal areas, and NiFe-based materials are among the top options for alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO). However, ample Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater can severely corrode catalytic sites and lead to limited lifespans. Herein, we report that in situ carbon oxyanion self-transformation (COST) from oxalate to carbonate on a monolithic NiFe oxalate micropillar electrode allows safeguard of high-valence metal reaction sites in ASO. In situ/ex situ studies show that spontaneous, timely, and appropriate COST safeguards active sites against Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; attack during ASO even at an ampere-level current density (&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;). Our NiFe catalyst shows efficient and stable ASO performance, which requires an overpotential as low as 349&#8197;mV to attain a &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the NiFe catalyst with protective surface CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits a slight activity degradation after 600&#8197;h of electrolysis under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in alkaline seawater. This work reports effective catalyst surface design concepts at the level of oxyanion self-transformation, acting as a momentous step toward defending active sites in seawater-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gram&#8208;level NH3 Electrosynthesis via NOx reduction on a Cu Activated Co Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical ammonia (NH3) synthesis from NOx on a Cu&#8208;activated Co foam electrode was developed as a promising alternative for the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. The new synthesis can convert pollutants into elevated value&#8208;added NH3 applicable for agriculture, energy storage, etc., imposing a sustainable nitrogen cycle.







Abstract
Ambient electrochemical ammonia (NH3) synthesis is one promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch route. However, the industrial requirement for the electrochemical NH3 production with amperes current densities or gram&#8208;level NH3 yield remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report the high&#8208;rate NH3 production via NO2&#8722; reduction using the Cu activated Co electrode in a bipolar membrane (BPM) assemble electrolyser, wherein BPM maintains the ion balance and the liquid level of electrolyte. Benefited from the abundant Co sites and optimal structure, the target modified Co foam electrode delivers a current density of 2.64&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the Faradaic efficiency of 96.45&#8201;% and the high NH3 yield rate of 279.44&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H&#8208;type cell using alkaline electrolyte. Combined with in situ experiments and theoretical calculations, we found that Cu optimizes the adsorption behavior of NO2&#8722; and facilitates the hydrogenation steps on Co sites toward a rapid NO2&#8722; reduction process. Importantly, this activated Co electrode affords a large NH3 production up to 4.11&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a homemade reactor, highlighting its large&#8208;scale practical feasibility.
