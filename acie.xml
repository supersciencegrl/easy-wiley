         <title>One&#8208;Step Solvent&#8208;Assisted Cation Exchange Approach to Hollow Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanoreactors with Orderly Distributed Active Sites for Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional hollow MOF nanoreactor, Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which contains precisely encapsulated Pd nanoparticles inside cavities, was controllably synthesized through one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange method. Micro&#8208;mesoporous shell thicknesses in the range of 22&#8211;73&#160;nm are controlled by easily tuning Pd2+ loading. The resulting Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 has the ability of size&#8208;selective molecular recognition and tandem catalysis.








Abstract
Biological membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles, in which cascade reactions promoted by multiple enzymes occur, have inspired widespread interest in the design of spatially confined nanoreactors for tandem catalytic transformations. Because of their accessible compartmentalized environments and large framework diversity, hollow metal&#8211;organic frameworks (H&#8208;MOFs) are ideal platforms for the development of new multi&#8208;functionalized nanoreactors. However, simple methodologies for fabrication of hollow MOFs, which possess functionalities that are precisely localized and encapsulated of active sites like those found in biological membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles, is a considerable challenge. Herein, a facile, one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange method was firstly developed for controlled synthesis of multifunctional H&#8208;MOF, Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which contains precisely encapsulated Pd nanoparticles (NPs) inside cavities. Micro&#8208;mesoporous shell thicknesses in the range of 22&#8211;73&#160;nm are effectively controlled by easily tuning Pd2+ loading. Impressively, the delicate nanoarchitecture and precise encapsulation of Pd NPs give Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 a propensity for size&#8208;selective molecular recognition in catalytic hydrogenation reactions and ability to catalyze tandem processes. Observations made in this effort suggest that one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange protocol might serve as general avenue for the design and construction of multi&#8208;functionalized H&#8208;MOFs, which can be employed in diverse applications in the fields of material chemistry.

         <title>Stable Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Domains for Selective Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultramicroporous pores of TUB41 selectively host water and CO2 molecules at distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments without competition. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the thermal and chemical stability, and the gas adsorption behavior, of a mixed&#8208;linker phosphonate MOF, [Cu(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)0.5(1,4&#8208;NDPAH2)], namely TUB41 (where bpy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine and NDPAH4&#160;=&#160;naphthalenediphosphonic acid). TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1&#8211;11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80&#160;&#176;C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO2 and H2O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO2 at a loading 0.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 and H2O at a loading of 0.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 are &#8722;41 and &#8722;38&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H2O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean&#8208;squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO2 reduction under challenging conditions.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI, Electrophoresis&#8208;Correlative Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with AI&#8208;Based Data Processing Broadens Access to Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affordable single&#8208;cell proteomics workflow combines capillary electrophoresis, real&#8208;time ion sorting, and AI&#8208;aided spectral deconvolution to profile early Xenopus embryonic cells. Despite using a legacy Orbitrap, this strategy matches or exceeds the sensitivity of modern instruments, uncovering proteome dynamics at sub&#8208;nanogram scale.








Abstract
Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry (MS) offers unprecedented sensitivity for profiling cellular proteomes, yet widespread adoption is hindered by the cost of advanced instrumentation. Here, we broaden access to single&#8208;cell proteomics by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE), data&#8208;dependent acquisition (DDA) with electrophoresis&#8208;correlative (Eco) ion sorting, and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted spectral deconvolution via CHIMERYS (Eco&#8211;AI). This &#8220;Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI&#8221; workflow was implemented on a custom&#8208;built CE platform coupled to a legacy hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus). Despite slower scan speed, lower resolution, and inferior ion transmission efficiency, real&#8208;time Eco&#8208;DDA sampling and CHIMERYS processing enabled identification of up to &#8764;15 peptides per spectrum&#8212;performance on par with modern Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid systems. From 1&#160;ng of HeLa digest, 2142 proteins were identified, surpassing the 969 proteins detected on a contemporary nanoLC Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. Even from &#8764;250 pg (a single&#8208;cell equivalent), 1799 proteins were identified in &lt;15&#160;min of effective separation, raising a theoretical throughput of 48 samples per day. As proof of principle, Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI profiled 1524 proteins from single precursor cells (50&#8211;75&#160;&#181;m diameter) in Xenopus laevis blastulae, revealing proteome asymmetry during neural versus epidermal fate specification. These results establish Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI as a budget&#8208;conscious yet powerful strategy for single&#8208;cell proteomics using CE&#8211;MS.

         <title>A Modular Three&#8208;Component Asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction Enabled by Cooperative Palladium/Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel three&#8208;component asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reaction was realized by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid catalysis for the straightforward construction of enantioenriched diversely functionalized allylic compounds from organic feedstocks of aldehydes, allylboronates, and nucleophiles. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. Finally, the protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids.








Abstract
Asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reactions, named as the Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction, stand as a landmark in modern organic synthesis. The merge of AAS reactions with the concept of multicomponent modular synthesis could allow flexible customization of molecular architectures from fundamental feedstocks, which remains underdeveloped. Herein, we disclose our recent observations on a novel three&#8208;component asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction enabled by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid (LA) catalysis. This &#8216;1C&#160;+&#160;2C&#160;+&#160;NuH&#8217; approach starts from fundamental organic feedstocks, i.e., aldehyde, allylboronate, and a nucleophile with the in situ formation of a C&#9552;C double bond. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component AAS reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. The protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids. Mechanistic studies suggest that the three&#8208;component AAS approach proceeds via a reaction sequence of LA&#8208;catalyzed allylation of aldehyde, olefin shift under palladium catalysis, and Pd/LA&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution.

Mechanistic studies suggest that the three-component AAS approach proceeds via a reaction sequence of LA-catalyzed allylation of aldehyde, olefin shift under palladium catalysis, and Pd/LA-cocatalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Coupling to Form &#946;2,2,3&#8208;Amino Acid Esters by Synergistic Chiral Phosphoric Acid and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, modular approach is described for the stereocontrolled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acid esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acids&#8212;characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter&#8212;represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical&#8208;radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, &#946;&#8208;keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox&#8208;active NHPI esters derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids are reduced via SET to form &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross&#8208;coupling to afford &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Maxwell Protocol for Non&#8208;Destructive Health Diagnosis of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diagnostic protocol&#8212;based on the Maxwell relations&#8212;that combines entropymetry and volumetry is proposed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Entropymetry mirrors the delithiation heterogeneity in cathode materials, whereas volumetry reflects the internal porosity in the electrode. This quantitative diagnostic approach allows used cells to be classified as reusable, or requiring reconditioning or recycling for a sustainable battery ecosystem.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) exhibit distinct degradation dynamics characterized by intricate interfacial cascade reactions that differ markedly from those of conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Despite being technologically promising, these systems currently lack robust health diagnostic frameworks to capture their critical failure mechanisms. Various physicochemical analyses based on cell disassembly are available and provide useful health&#8208;related information; but, because of their destructive nature, they render cells unusable for continuous health monitoring over long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, we present a nondestructive diagnostic methodology founded on the Maxwell relations. This approach enables the precise detection of the delithiation heterogeneity in cathode active materials and quantifies internal void formation by measuring changes in the open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) in response to temperature and pressure variations, respectively, without perturbing the cell operation. Our comprehensive thermodynamics analysis protocol establishes systematic criteria for classifying cells into one of three categories: reuse, recondition, or recycle. This nondestructive diagnostic methodology enables the sustainable utilization of ASSB technology based on efficient resource management.

         <title>Photochemical and Redox&#8208;Controlled ON&#8211;OFF Switching in Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ON/OFF switching of PCET. Light and redox&#8208;induced PCET ON&#8211;OFF switching was investigated in a series of ruthenium complexes. Photosubstitution triggers the conformational from a nonaqua to a PCET&#8208;active aqua complex, while oxidation induces a reverse conformational change.








Abstract
We report a reversible ON&#8211;OFF proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) switch based on ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, triggered by both light and redox stimuli. Upon photoirradiation, a carboxylate&#8208;ligated Ru(II) complex undergoes photosubstitution to generate a metastable, PCET&#8208;active aqua complex. This metastable complex exhibits redox&#8208;induced conformational change, regenerating the original carboxylate complex. The switching behavior enables external control of PCET activity, directly modulating electrocatalytic water oxidation. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses reveal that the mechanism is governed by a pH&#8208;dependent interplay between intramolecular conformational change and bimolecular electron exchange. Importantly, the rate&#8208;determining step shifts from unimolecular conformational change near neutral pH to bimolecular electron exchange under acidic conditions. These findings establish a strategy for designing tunable molecular switches and redox&#8208;responsive functional materials.

         <title>In Situ Click Chemistry Screen Facilitated by an On&#8208;Nanoparticle DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Identifies Highly Selective and Potent Peptoid Ligands for a Phosphatase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of ligands that selectively target closely related protein families or isoforms remains a critical challenge. A protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy, enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL), yielded nanomolar, highly selective inhibitors of PTP1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site.








Abstract
Capture agents that selectively bind to biological targets are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutics, and biomedical research. However, discovering such capture agents, particularly for structurally conserved or challenging targets, remains a challenge. Here, we describe a protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL) platform. The nanoDEL enables the construction and screening of vastly large, chemically diverse combinatorial libraries with high redundancy, far exceeding the scale and throughput of conventional approaches, such as one&#8208;bead&#8208;one&#8208;compound and solution&#8208;phase in situ click methods. Thus, this enables the rapid and efficient identification of high&#8208;affinity, high&#8208;selectivity ligands in a single selection round, eliminating the need for iterative screening. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we performed an in situ click screening of a 27&#8208;million&#8208;member nanoDEL of azido&#8208;functionalized peptoids, in the presence of a weak and promiscuous alkyne&#8208;bearing anchor ligand. This yielded bidentate inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site. These inhibitors exhibited nanomolar potency and exceptional selectivity over closely related phosphatases. This work represents a broadly applicable strategy for discovering high&#8208;performance capture agents, particularly for selectively targeting closely related protein families or isoforms where achieving selectivity remains a critical challenge.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalyst/Initiator for Precise Synthesis of Polycarbonates and Copolymers with Unprecedented Activity and Molecular Weights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate highly efficient synthesis of polycarbonates via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, and their gradient or block copolymers with lactide in one&#8208;pot reactions, using the single&#8208;component catalyst/initiator comprising a thiourea moiety and alkoxide.








Abstract
The development of efficient and selective catalytic methods for synthesizing well&#8208;defined polycarbonates and their copolymers represents a significant advancement toward sustainable polymer production. In this study, we report a series of innovative single&#8208;molecule hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts/initiators for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, enabling rapid and precise synthesis of polycarbonates and their copolymers with polylactide. These catalysts uniquely facilitate simultaneous activation of both monomer and chain&#8208;end within a single molecular architecture, demonstrating superior activity compared to conventional multicomponent hydrogen&#8208;bonding initiating systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that alkyl substitution plays a critical role in enhancing catalytic activity for ROP by reducing the energy barrier relative to aryl&#8208;substituted analogues. The modular design of these catalysts allows for facile structural optimization and performance tuning. Notably, Cat. 1 exhibits high catalytic efficiency at 25&#160;&#176;C, producing polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and high molecular weights (Mn up to 164.8&#160;kDa, &#208; of 1.37). We further demonstrate versatile copolymerization strategies: one&#8208;step copolymerization yields gradient polycarbonate&#8208;g&#8208;polylactide copolymers, whereas sequential monomer addition in one&#8208;pot reactions produces well&#8208;defined block polycarbonate&#8208;b&#8208;polylactide copolymers within minutes. These block copolymers exhibit high molecular weights (Mn up to 189.4&#160;kDa, &#208; of 1.37), precisely tunable thermal properties, and exceptional mechanical performance, highlighting their potential for advanced material applications.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Glycomimetics by Photocatalytic One&#8208;Pot C(sp3)&#9472;H Acylation and Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;acyl glycosides and carbasugars from readily accessible and bench&#8208;stable 1&#8208;deoxyglycosides was developed by photo&#8208;HAT/nickel dual catalysis. This one&#8208;pot reaction proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits high stereoselectivity across diverse glycosyl units. The approach was further applied to the synthesis of a challenging cyclopentanepentol, an analogue of calditol.








Abstract
Glycomimetics, structural mimics of natural carbohydrates such as C&#8208;glycosides and carbasugars, are important therapeutic leads for treating a variety of diseases. However, the structural and stereochemical complexity of glycomimetics poses daunting challenges to synthetic chemists and is incompatible with diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approaches. Herein, we develop a facile and general method for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;acyl glycosides and carbasugars from readily accessible and stable 1&#8208;deoxyglycosides via photo&#8208;HAT/nickel dual catalysis. The reaction proceeds in one&#8208;pot under mild conditions and exhibits high stereoselectivity across a wide range of glycosyl units, illustrating the potential of this method in the preparation of structurally diverse and densely functionalized carbasugars. The synthetic utility of this strategy is further demonstrated in the synthesis of challenging cyclopentanepentol, an analogue of calditol.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Modulation of Mg2+ Desolvation Beyond the Primary Solvation Shell in Magnesium Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the outer solvation sheath, the CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between 7&#8208;aminoindole (7AID) and solvent molecules counteract the coordination bonds between Mg2+ and solvent molecules. Meanwhile, in the bulk phase, 7AID reduces the availability of solvent molecules for Mg2+ coordination via hydrogen bonds and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. The interactions in dual sites reduce the Mg2+&#8208;desolvation energy barrier, thereby reducing the overpotential.








Abstract
High overpotential and instability of Mg anode reactions limit the development of halide&#8208;free Mg battery electrolytes. Here, we report 7&#8208;aminoindole (7AID), a predominantly noncoordinating additive that modulates solvation via CH&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with both Mg2+&#8208;bound and free ether solvents. These outer&#8208;shell and bulk&#8208;phase interactions weaken Mg2+&#183;&#183;&#183;solvent binding, enhance solvent mobility, and lower the desolvation barrier. As a result, Mg plating/stripping overpotentials are significantly reduced and interfacial stability is improved. Compared to strongly coordinating additives, this approach suppresses parasitic reactions and enables more stable cycling. This work presents a solvation&#8208;targeted additive design paradigm beyond the primary coordination shell for advancing multivalent battery electrolytes.

         <title>Regulating the Nanosheets Structures in Pitch&#8208;Derived Amorphous Carbons for Efficient Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a molecular engineering strategy, the nanosheets structure of the pitch&#8208;derived amorphous carbon (PDAC) anode material has been precisely regulated. The results demonstrate that extending the disordered amorphous carbon nanosheets and preventing intersheet spacing contraction not only increases sodium ion storage capacity but also enhances diffusion kinetics, significantly improving the rate capability of the amorphous carbon anode material.








Abstract
Amorphous carbon (AC), prized for their cost&#8208;effectiveness and excellent performance, are promising as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, its amorphous structure challenges balancing high rate capability with high capacity. This study regulates the nanosheets structure of pitch&#8208;derived&#8208;AC (PDAC) through pre&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons growth, enabling simultaneous enhancement of rate capability and maintenance of high capacity. The regulation of the nanosheets length to 12.27&#160;nm can increase the closed pore volume to 0.062&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, thereby facilitating the formation of quasi&#8208;metallic sodium clusters, which elevates the specific capacity of PDAC to 377.4&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 in an ester&#8208;based&#8208;electrolyte, with the plateau region contributing up to 68.0%. Furthermore, the extended nanosheets maintain a spacing of 0.396&#160;nm, overcoming the kinetics limitations inherent in accessing plateau capacity at high current. Consequently, a specific capacity of 357.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (incl. 248.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 plateau capacity) is achieved at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1, with retention of 253.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Additionally, the PDAC demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 90.4% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. The critical roles of extending nanosheets, maintaining interlayer spacing, and increasing closed pore volume in enabling efficient Na&#8314; storage and advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs are systematically elucidated.

         <title>Optimizing Electronic Structure to Achieve High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Layered Oxide Cathode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel P3&#8208;K0.7Fe0.3Ni0.15Mg0.03Ti0.02Mn0.5O2 (KFNMTMO) cathode is crafted for high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion batteries. By doping with low&#8208;valent ions, the oxidation state of Mn is elevated to avoid charge compensation, thereby suppressing the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. Concurrently, the low electronegativity of Mg2&#8314; enhances the bonding interactions between transition metals and oxygen, improving the stability of lattice structure. Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits high reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Layered Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes demonstrate great potential for application in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. However, issues such as Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of Mn and significant volume changes during K+ intercalation/removal severely limit their practical use. To address these challenges, we successfully synthesize the cathode material K0.7Fe0.3Ni0.15Mg0.03Ti0.02Mn0.5O2 (KFNMTMO) by introducing low&#8208;valence ions and incorporating active metal elements. The results show that the introduction of low&#8208;valence ions raises the average oxidation state of Mn to approximately +4, causing the projected density of states of Mn to shift above the Fermi level. This effectively suppresses the redox activity of Mn, making it primarily responsible for stabilizing layered structure. Meanwhile, electronic structure optimization considerably activates the redox couples of other active elements such as Ni2+/Ni3+ and Fe3+/Fe4+. This synergistic effect not only alleviates Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion but also, through the addition of the less electronegative Mg2+ ions, markedly enhances the orbital hybridization between transition metals and oxygen atoms, further improving the stability of crystal lattice. Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving a reversible capacity of 114.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1, an energy density of 328&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 81.5% after 800 cycles.

     alt="Optimizing Electronic Structure to Achieve High-Capacity and Long-Life Layered Oxide Cathode for Potassium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel P3-K&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (KFNMTMO) cathode is crafted for high-performance potassium-ion batteries. By doping with low-valent ions, the oxidation state of Mn is elevated to avoid charge compensation, thereby suppressing the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. Concurrently, the low electronegativity of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; enhances the bonding interactions between transition metals and oxygen, improving the stability of lattice structure. Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits high reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered Mn-based oxide cathodes demonstrate great potential for application in potassium-ion batteries. However, issues such as Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of Mn and significant volume changes during K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation/removal severely limit their practical use. To address these challenges, we successfully synthesize the cathode material K&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (KFNMTMO) by introducing low-valence ions and incorporating active metal elements. The results show that the introduction of low-valence ions raises the average oxidation state of Mn to approximately +4, causing the projected density of states of Mn to shift above the Fermi level. This effectively suppresses the redox activity of Mn, making it primarily responsible for stabilizing layered structure. Meanwhile, electronic structure optimization considerably activates the redox couples of other active elements such as Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. This synergistic effect not only alleviates Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion but also, through the addition of the less electronegative Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, markedly enhances the orbital hybridization between transition metals and oxygen atoms, further improving the stability of crystal lattice. Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving a reversible capacity of 114.3 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, an energy density of 328&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 81.5% after 800 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugated Base Assists Proton Stripping off Pt for Alkaline H2 Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present that, when proton acid is immobilized on carbon support, in alkaline solution, it will be deprotonated, forming numerous conjugated base surrounding Pt. Such surface anchored conjugated base will assist the stripping and interfacial transfer of H+ off Pt, thereby significantly enhancing alkaline HOR.








Abstract
Recent studies have revealed that slow transfer of the continuously formed H+ away from Pt surface can be a potential cause responsible for the extremely sluggish alkaline hydrogen oxidation (HOR). Herein, we show that anchoring mild oxyacid on carbon support is a generally effective approach to boost interfacial transfer of proton away from Pt. In alkaline solution, the surface anchored oxyacid is deprotonated generating affluent conjugated base surrounding Pt; taking C&#8208;PO42&#8208; as a typical example, the conjugated base can readily seize&#160;the as&#8208;formed H+ around Pt (Pt&#8208;H+ + C&#9472;PO42&#8208; &#8594; Pt&#160;+&#160;C&#9472;H2PO4) from HOR, which then are neutralized immediately by OH&#8722; in the bulk solution (C&#9472;H2PO4&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722; &#8594; C&#9472;PO42&#8722; + H2O). Via such repetitive protonation and deprotonation, the as&#8208;formed H+ from HOR is efficiently transported away from Pt surface, thereby significantly improving the HOR rates. This strategy is found both effective for developing home&#8208;made Pt electrocatalysts as well as for modification of those commercial Pt/C. This study emphasizes the importance of enhancing interfacial proton transfer along the pursuit of efficient Pt electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR and provides a straightforward and generally effective strategy to address the issue.

         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;free hydroaminomethylation of long&#8208;chain olefins in water is achieved by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;iridium catalyst without high&#8208;pressure H2 and organic solvent, affording linear amines with good yields and high linear/branch selectivities. This approach provides a simple, straightforward, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective method for the synthesis of higher (deuterium) amines and derivatives.








Abstract
Aqueous hydroaminomethylation (HAM) of olefins generally requires the use of organic solvents, additives, and high&#8208;pressure hydrogen to synthesize amines in satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we accomplish the HAM reactions of long&#8208;chain olefins in water without organic solvent or additives by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ir complex as the catalyst. A broad scope of long&#8208;chain olefins and amines is well compatible, affording corresponding higher amines in up to 99% yields with excellent linear/branched (l/b) selectivity (up to 94/6). Mechanistic investigations reveal that water acts as both solvent and hydrogen source. The protocol can be readily extended to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and deuterated analogues with excellent yields and deuterium rates. Moreover, the amine products are easily separated by extraction, and the recovered aqueous phase could be directly used and recycled. This protocol offers a sustainable, safe, and cost&#8208;effective approach for synthesizing higher amines.

         <title>Dual Co Sites in n&#9472;n Type Heterojunction Enable Selective Electrochemical Co&#8208;Valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Dual Co sites and built&#8208;in electric field in CoS/Co&#9472;N&#9472;C were used for selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#9472;N&#9472;C n&#9472;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12&#160;V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#9472;to&#9472;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#160;h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#9472;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#9472;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation. This work establishes a blueprint for developing multi&#8208;functional catalytic architectures that address the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges in coupled electrochemical systems, advancing the frontier of sustainable electrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Cyclochlorotine Hydroxylase CctR Reveals DUF3328 as a Family of Copper&#8208;Dependent Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DUF3328 is an enigmatic enzyme family implicated in diverse transformations in fungal natural product biosynthesis, yet its functions remain largely underexplored. Through biochemical characterization of the cyclochlorotine hydroxylase CctR, we define DUF3328 as a family of copper&#8208;dependent metalloenzymes. This study reveals key structural and mechanistic features shared across the family.








Abstract
DUF3328 is a protein family widely found in fungal natural product biosynthesis pathways. Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C(sp3)&#9472;H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane&#8208;associated copper&#8208;dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four&#8208;helix coiled coil, and C&#8208;terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x)nHxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen&#8208;dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper&#8208;dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.

Through biochemical characterization of the cyclochlorotine hydroxylase CctR, we define DUF3328 as a family of copper-dependent metalloenzymes. This study reveals key structural and mechanistic features shared across the family.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DUF3328 is a protein family widely found in fungal natural product biosynthesis pathways. Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane-associated copper-dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four-helix coiled coil, and C-terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;HxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen-dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper-dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Gated Amine Exchange in Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating aniline&#8208;type diarylethenes as core&#8208;enriched crosslinkers in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) based microgels enables photomodulation of their responsivity towards temperature and pH as well as covalent binding and release of functional amines via light&#8208;gated amine exchange reaction. This study highlights the potential of photoswitchable microgels for smart biomedical materials.








Abstract
The functionalization of microgels with photoswitchable moieties enables the construction of multi&#8208;responsive systems, which are highly interesting for biological applications, for example, in drug delivery. Controlling the reversible uptake of functional molecules, however, remains a major challenge. To address this, we developed a novel aniline&#8208;type diarylethene (DAE) crosslinker and prepared a series of corresponding poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam)&#8208;based microgels with varying degrees of DAE crosslinker. Upon UV light irradiation, the aniline (and thus enamine) motif of the DAE is converted to its imine form, thus allowing for reversible exchange with primary amines. Irradiating the DAE with blue light covalently locks the equilibrium and traps the amine in the microgels. The light&#8208;controlled covalent binding of fluorinated, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic amine derivatives was proven by dynamic light scattering and 19F NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, the impact of photoisomerization and amine binding on microgel properties was investigated and we were able to remotely control size as well as temperature and pH responsiveness by light. Overall, this study demonstrates optically gated uptake and release of functional amines in multi&#8208;responsive microgels and highlights their potential biological applications.

         <title>Molecular Junction Polyoxotungstate&#8208;based Copper&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular junction polyoxotungstate&#8208;based copper&#8208;organic frameworks (i.e., Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;1, Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;2, and Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared and characterized that can be utilized in efficient photocatalytic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes. The achieved reaction system enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis and operation under natural sunlight and air conditions. 








Abstract
The cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes is a vital catalysis step in the manufacture of C&#9472;C bonds. The traditional thermal catalysis, utilizing noble metal salts or toxic solvents, generally results in relatively low atom economy or unmet sustainable development prospect. The challenge of the CDC reactions lies in the simultaneous activation of C&#9472;H bonds in terminal alkynes and formation of free radical activation of tertiary amines to achieve the C&#9472;C coupling, which calls for novel catalytic techniques and powerful catalysts. For the first time, in exclusively green solvent (i.e., dimethyl carbonate), full light, and air, we have developed a series of molecular junction polyoxotungstate&#8208;based copper&#8208;organic frameworks (i.e., Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;1, Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;2, and Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3), each with unique topological dimension and well&#8208;regulated charge transfer ability that can be utilized in efficient photocatalytic CDC reactions. Notably, the optimal Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3 with the combination of polyoxotungstate and Cu sites within the 3D POMOF topological structure enables the simultaneous activation and C&#9472;C coupling of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes with 98% yield. In addition, the reaction system enables scale&#8208;up production (2.06&#160;g in a batch experiment) and operation under natural sunlight and air.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Azepines: A Cascade Strategy Featuring 1&#8208;Aza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breakthrough methodology has been developed for constructing chiral azepines through a relay catalysis system combining tetrapeptide bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salts (PBPSs) with a gold(I) catalyst. This strategy enables the first enantioselective, chiral intermediate&#8208;participated 1&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement. The key to this success lies in the rational design of a novel class of tetrapeptide&#8208;based bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salt (PBPS) catalysts, which exhibit significantly improved enantioselectivity and reaction efficiency compared to previous dipeptide&#8208;based phosphonium salt (PPS) systems.








Abstract
The 1&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement serves as a valuable method for constructing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds; however, its asymmetric variants remain largely underexplored due to unfavorable thermodynamics and reaction reversibility. To overcome these challenges, we developed a relay catalysis system comprising tetrapeptide bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salts (PBPSs) in combination with a gold(I) catalyst. This strategy incorporates a ring&#8208;opening process during the rearrangement to preserve stereocenters and facilitate product formation. Using this approach, we synthesized a variety of chiral azepines in excellent yields (up to 96%) and with high stereoselectivities (up to 98%&#160;ee and&gt;20:1&#160;dr). Mechanistic investigations clarified the origin of chirality and offered insights into the reaction pathway. This work presents a new strategy for constructing medium&#8208;sized chiral nitrogen heterocycles and highlights the broader potential of relay catalysis integrating transition metals with bioinspired peptide&#8211;phosphonium salts (PPSs).

         <title>Tailoring the Oxygen Vacancy Distribution in Se&#8208;Doped RuOx to Enhance Its Stability in Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of oxygen vacancy (VO) distribution on Ru oxide stability is unclear. We propose a strategy to tailor the distribution of VOs (VOs located away from Se dopants) via urea&#8208;assisted synthesis of Se&#8208;doped RuOx (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx), which optimizes the oxygen evolution mechanism pathway and inhibits Ru dissolution. Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx shows enhanced acidic water oxidation activity and stability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), surpassing the Se&#8208;RuOx with VO adjacent to Se.








Abstract
Developing durable ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) remains challenging due to irreversible Ru dissolution and lattice oxygen instability. Although elemental doping is a general method to improve stability, it inadvertently induces oxygen vacancies (VOs), which are randomly distributed in the nanocatalyst. Notably, the impact of VO distribution on the stability of Ru&#8208;based catalysts remains unresolved. Herein, we synthesized the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide via annealing the mixture of ruthenium (III) chloride and selenium (Se) in the air (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx) with the presence of urea, showing the VOs distributed away from Se dopants, which is significantly different from the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide synthesized without urea (Se&#8208;RuOx), showing VOs distributed relatively close to the Se dopants. The Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction performance over Se&#8208;RuOx. Particularly, Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx delivers a low working voltage (1.62&#160;V@1&#160;A cm&#8722;2) and excellent durability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in PEMWE tests. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that VOs engage in long&#8208;range cooperation with spatially decoupled Se dopants in Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx, synergistically enhancing reaction kinetics via an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, while inhibiting the lattice oxygen mechanism and suppressing Ru dissolution, which demonstrates a new strategy to break the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in promising Ru&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Multivariate Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Metal Azolate Frameworks with Tunable Flexibility for CO2 Capture from C2 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Suppressing flexibility for CO2 capture: The multivariate functionality approach precisely modulates the structural flexibility of sulfate&#8208;pillared metal azolate frameworks, enhancing their selective CO2 capture and separation from C2 hydrocarbons for sustainable carbon cycling.








Abstract
A series of sulfate&#8208;pillared metal azolate frameworks (MAFs) were synthesized via a multivariate (MTV) strategy to systematically tune framework flexibility and gas separation performance. The monotonic sulfate&#8208;pillared MAF, Zn2(daTz)2SO4 (where daTz = 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate), exhibits pronounced structural dynamics upon adaptive guest inclusions, driven by triazolate linker rotation and reversible Zn&#9472;O bonds rearrangement, enabling dynamic pore modulation for efficient CO2, C2H4, and C2H6 uptakes. Incorporation of an asymmetric, non&#8208;amino linker effectively suppresses framework flexibility by reducing intraframework hydrogen bonding, resulting in a locked structure with enhanced selectivity for CO2 over light hydrocarbons. Gas adsorption and breakthrough experiments demonstrate that the MTV approach enabled structural control, leading to exceptional CO2/C2H6 and CO2/C2H4 separation performance. Notably, Zn2(mTz)0.74(daTz)1.26SO4 (where mTz = 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate) achieves 17&#8208;fold enhancement in ethylene purification. Comprehensive structural analyses and interaction energy calculations reveal the molecular basis of flexibility regulation, offering valuable insights for designing next&#8208;generation porous materials for selective gas separation.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Azaarene Migration to &#945;&#8208;Azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Enabled by a Tailored Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective catalytic benzilic ester rearrangement of vicinal dicarbonyl compounds is reported, providing a variety of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters in good yields and high enantiopurities. This transformation features an asymmetric 1,2&#8208;azaarene shift, which is systematically investigated here for the first time. A newly designed chiral BOX ligand with extended and rigid side arms was critical for achieving effective stereocontrol.








Abstract
Despite their prevalence in bioactive molecules, the stereoselective construction of &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates remains a formidable challenge. Notably, although the benzilic ester rearrangement (BER) is an efficient approach to &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates, asymmetric catalytic BER remains poorly developed, largely due to poor stereorecognition of the vicinal diketone substituents by common chiral catalysts. In response to these issues, here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene&#8208;derived 1,2&#8208;diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five&#8208;membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2&#8208;nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2&#8208;azaarene migrations.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Programmed Sequential Fluorescence Encoding (VPSFE) Enables Multiplexed In Situ Proteo&#8208;Imaging with Electric&#8208;Field Turing Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Voltage&#8208;Programmed Sequential Fluorescence Encoding (VPSFE) pioneers electric&#8208;field Turing pattern for multiplexed in situ proteo&#8208;imaging, enabling 27&#8208;plex detection via single hybridization and voltage&#8208;controlled probe activation and removal (&#8764;4 minute per round) &#8212; eliminating iterative washing and achieving &#181;M&#8208;level probe tolerance.








Abstract
DNA barcode&#8208;based immunolabeling has revolutionized single&#8208;cell protein profiling. However, conventional multiplexed imaging methods are hindered by laborious probe exchange procedures involving buffer washing&#8208;based probe removal and prolonged hybridization cycles (requiring tens of minutes to 1.5&#160;h per cycle), which limit throughput, specificity, and universality. Here, we introduce an electrophoresis&#8208;based in situ probe removal method that achieves high&#8208;specificity iterative probe imaging without washing steps, utilizing 2&#8208;min low&#8208;voltage electrophoresis for excess probes removal and 3&#8208;min high&#8208;voltage electrophoresis for hybridized probes dissociation. The robustness was validated through 19 rounds of cyclic electrophoresis, 10 rounds of repetitive imaging, and simultaneous processing of 14 probes (&#181;M&#8208;level) across five rounds of multiprobe exchange, demonstrating exceptional specificity and efficiency. Applied to sequential color coding&#8208;based multiplexed imaging, this approach establishes voltage&#8208;programmed sequential fluorescence encoding (VPSFE), enabling multiplexed imaging of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT)&#8208;related proteins. Furthermore, we developed a VPSFE&#8208;based Turing pattern coding strategy for multiplexed detection that requires only a single multicolor probe hybridization step. Using three voltage conditions and three fluorescence channels, this system generates 27 unique fluorescence Turing patterns to encode 27 distinct targets. This electric&#8208;field Turing pattern coding strategy represents a novel probe exchange&#8208;free approach for rapid, universal, and highly specific multiplexed in situ imaging.

         <title>General Synthesis of 2D Mesoporous Multimetal Spinel Supracrystals for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general and modular strategy for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with well&#8208;defined mesoporous surfaces and compositions that range from unary to multinary oxides. Leveraging multimetal electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D geometry, mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are demonstrated as interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, which deliver exceptional electrochemical performance under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous metal oxide crystals that integrate atomic&#8208;level single crystallinity with ordered mesoporosity represent a promising but rarely realized class of materials, particularly in multicomponent systems. Here, we report a universal strategy for synthesizing freestanding 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with tunable compositions, spanning from unary to multinary spinel oxide systems. This approach decouples crystalline framework formation from mesopore generation, combining emulsion&#8208;mediated, on&#8208;surface crystallization of 2D nanocrystal superlattices with thermally&#8208;induced collective nanocrystal reorientation and facet&#8208;selective epitaxial fusion. Concurrent surface reconstruction exposes {110} facets along nanocrystal edges, which define the internal surfaces of vertically aligned mesopores. As a proof of concept, 2D mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are employed as functional interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. These interlayers demonstrate strong polysulfide adsorption, accelerated redox kinetics, and enhanced Li+ ion transport, enabled by their multimetal&#8208;induced electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D mesoporous architecture. As a result, Li&#8211;S cells equipped with FeMnCoO&#8208;modified separators deliver exceptional electrochemical performance, even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work addresses a longstanding challenge in reconciling ordered mesoporosity with crystallographic coherence in mesoporous materials, establishing a molecularly modular approach for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel crystals with programmable compositions and facet&#8208;engineered functionality.

A charge&#8208;rearrangement&#8208;averaged dye design was proposed to achieve high LE/TICT emission efficiency, exhibiting ratiometric dual&#8208;fluorescence with solvent&#8208;dependent emission modulation instead of quenching. Integrated into crosslinked polymers, these dyes enable precise mixed&#8208;solvent visualization and reusable heterogeneous detection. A portable sensor achieves self&#8208;calibrated ethanol tracking in E10 ethanol gasoline via smartphone photography, with a robust working curve.








Abstract
Although solvatochromic materials provide visual function to differentiate solvents, they fail to precisely monitor complex solvent environments where solvent composition varies dynamically, because of an insensitive absorptional shift in these environments. Relatively, their fluorescence signal change, which should be more sensitive, has always been inefficient, resulting from inherent challenges in excited&#8208;state dynamics. Here, we present a charge&#8208;rearrangement averaged dye design, instead of traditional donor&#8208;acceptor structures, to enable a high locally excited or twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission efficiency. A ratiometric dual&#8208;fluorescence behavior can be observed along with a solvent&#8208;dependent emission trade&#8208;off rather than complete quenching. In this case, the dyes can not only precisely visualize various mixed solvents but also enable heterogeneous detection with over hundreds of reuse cycles after being integrated into a crosslinked polymer. The leading portable material achieves a self&#8208;calibrated visual tracking of ethanol content (error&lt;0.2%) with a robust working curve (R2&#160;=&#160;0.9992) while applied to E10 ethanol gasoline, operable via user&#8208;friendly software analysis through mobile phone photography.

         <title>Organic Spin&#8208;State Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;state photoswitching has become a field of broad interest in the last decades due to unique physical and chemical properties accessible from controlling the spin state of a molecular entity. This review gives an overview of the different types of materials and classifies them into photoconformational and photochemical switches depending on the mechanism of action. It highlights milestones in the research over the years and gives a technological perspective for the future of spin&#8208;state photoswitches.








Abstract
Organic spin&#8208;state photoswitches represent an emerging class of molecular systems capable of reversibly modulating electronic spin states using light. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin&#8208;polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox&#8208;active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light&#8208;induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations. By exploring design principles and technological implications, this review underscores the unique position of all&#8208;organic spin&#8208;state photoswitches at the intersection of photochemistry, magnetism, and quantum materials development.

         <title>A Photon&#8208;Driven Unimolecular Immunostimulant for Self&#8208;Amplified Pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway by Destroying the Pyroptosis Checkpoint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed Bio&#8208;Cy conjugate emerges as an avant&#8208;garde molecular entity, adeptly activating the pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to heighten the cytocidal impact of photon&#8208;driven immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is a groundbreaking approach for clinically treating tumors, but its effectiveness is hindered by the tumor's immunosuppressive environment and lack of immune cell infiltration, enabling tumors to evade the immune system. Although the activation of both innate and adaptive immunities is a promising strategy to counteract this bottleneck, their synergy remains challenging. Therefore, we developed Bio&#8208;Cy, an unprecedented organic unimolecular photosensitive immunostimulant, which stimulates self&#8208;amplifying pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to enhance adaptive and innate immunity activation. Mechanistic studies have shown that Bio&#8208;Cy can target cancer cells and be transported to lysosomes via endocytosis, generating reactive oxygen species through a Type I photodynamic mechanism to destroy cancer cells, even under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this lysosomal disruption not only activates the caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;dependent pyroptosis of adaptive immunity through mitochondrial damage by releasing Ca2+, but also enhances the cGAS&#8208;STING innate immune pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA. More importantly, the initial lysosomal damage impairs protective cellular autophagy, destroying the pyroptosis checkpoint and thus preventing the clearance of damaged mitochondria and amplifying immune responses, ultimately boosting immunotherapy. This strategy effectively treats primary tumors and inhibits metastatic growth, offering a new paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ir(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrocarbonation of Allenes: Access to Branched Products with All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir(I) catalysts featuring the electron&#8208;deficient bisphosphine ligand dFppe promote the hydrocarbonation of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products. This reaction is highly effective with C(3)&#8208;dialkylcarboxamidepyrroles as well as with other C&#9472;H donors, such as furans and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxamides. Employing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes as partners enabled the access to challenging products featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. DFT computational analysis that offers relevant mechanistic insights.








Abstract
An iridium complex featuring the perfluorinated bisphosphine ligand dFppe can catalyze intermolecular hydrocarbonation reactions of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products instead of the more common linear derivatives. Using N&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;carboxamide pyrroles as C&#9472;H donors, the reaction gives exclusively C&#8208;4 substituted products, while furan analogues yield C&#8208;2 substituted derivatives. &#946;&#8208;Unsubstituted acrylamides can also be used as C&#9472;H sources to give chiral skipped dienes. The additions are equally efficient using monosubstituted and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes, enabling the efficient formation of products bearing tertiary and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. Moreover, a preliminary analysis with chiral bisphosphinite ligands confirms the feasibility of an enantioselective variant. Computational (DFT) studies provide relevant insights into this remarkable ligand&#8208;driven branched selectivity.

         <title>Bionic Design of Ni4+ Lewis Acid Site Based on Selective Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants for survival, we have designed an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich catalyst that can &#8220;ripen&#8221; to a highly active state (Ni4+). This state selectively attracts hydroxide ions and repels chloride ions, thereby achieving efficient and stable seawater electrolysis and avoiding corrosion.








Abstract
The side reaction caused by chloride ions and the toxicity to the active site have always been the hindrance to the electrocatalyst of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for seawater splitting. Herein, inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants, we designed a catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies (Ovac) and proved that Ovac can accelerate the formation of Ni3+ and further oxidize it to Ni4+, which we named as the &#8220;ripening&#8221; mechanism of Ovac. Ovac reduces the hydrogen proton desorption energy by regulating local charge redistribution, thus realizing the rapid transformation of Ni2+&#8594;Ni3+&#8594;Ni4+. Meanwhile, the hard Lewis acid Ni4+ has strong selectivity to OH&#8722;, avoiding the competitiveness and corrosiveness of chloride ions in seawater. This work provides an effective strategy for the simple and rapid construction of self&#8208;rebuilding high&#8208;valence Ni4+ electrocatalysts, and is expected to provide guidance for the development of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>N,O&#8208;Alternant Belt[3]arene Utilized for Construction of Multi&#8208;Color Supramolecular TADF Materials and Highly Selective Detection of 2&#8208;Cyanopyrazine</title>

Starting from a new macrocyclic arene, 3,6&#8208;dimethoxycalix[3]acridine (3,6&#8208;DMO&#8208;C[3]A), N,O&#8208;alternant belt[3]arene (NOAB[3]A) was conveniently synthesized and successfully utilized to construct multi&#8208;color supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Notably, the belt[3]arene was also employed for rapid visual and highly selective detection of 2&#8208;cyanopyrazine (2CP) with the detection limit of 1.7&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1. 








Abstract
In this work, 3,6&#8208;dimethoxycalix[3]acridine (3,6&#8208;DMO&#8208;C[3]A), as a new macrocyclic arene, was synthesized and then applied to the construction of a new kind of N,O&#8208;alternant belt[3]arene (NOAB[3]A) by the conversion approach from macrocycle to belt. NOAB[3]A has a regularly hexagonal structure and electron&#8208;rich cavity, and it can be successfully utilized as an electron donor to construct supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) materials with multi&#8208;color emissions by its complexation with electron acceptors with different electron&#8208;deficient abilities. Notably, due to the formation of STADF accompanied by fluorescence enhancement and redshift when NOAB[3]A combines with the cyanide&#8208;containing aromatic compounds, the belt[3]arene can also be directly used for highly selective, sensitive, and visual detection of 2&#8208;cyanopyrazine (2&#8208;CP) vapor at trace level. The limit of detection (LOD) concentration for 2&#8208;CP reached 1.7&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1, indicating that NOAB[3]A can serve as an excellent sensing platform for detecting 2&#8208;CP. This work not only expands the applications of functionalized belt[n]arenes but also provides an innovative insight into the detection application of the STADF strategy.

         <title>Fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; Induced Alkyne Concentrating and Orderly Arranged Sulfonate&#8208;Adjusted Interfacial Water Structure Promote Alkene Electrosynthesis at Large Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nafion ionomer&#8208;modified palladium nanotips are designed to achieve electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes with an 83% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; effect induces the alkyne concentrating around the electrode surface and the orderly arranged SO3&#8722; under bias potentials repels the water cation away from the electrode surface, which contributes to increasing the interfacial alkyne&#8211;water ratio, thus suppressing H2 evolution and improving the FE at a high current density.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with water at nearly industrial current densities is highly important. However, a low interfacial alkyne&#8211;water ratio leads to severe hydrogen evolution, making it extremely challenging to obtain alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, a strategy involving fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction&#8208;induced alkyne concentration and orderly arranged sulfonate&#8208;repelled interfacial water&#8208;cation is developed over commercial Nafion&#8208;modified palladium nanotips, enabling electrolysis of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) with up to 83% FE under &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; effect concentrates the alkyne via its adsorption enhancement, promotes electron transfer, and lowers the activation energy, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics. Under the bias potential, the side chain of Nafion undergoing rearrangement from disordered to nearly ordered significantly decreases the interfacial free water coverage and activity, thereby reducing the amount of in situ&#8208;generated surface&#8208;active hydrogen, which contributes to suppressing hydrogen evolution and improving the FE. An 82% FE and 18.9&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 reaction rate of MBE is achieved in a 10&#160;h continuous electrosynthesis at 1.25 A, demonstrating potential utility. Furthermore, the hydrogenation and deuteration of different alkynes with improved Faradaic efficiencies at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 rationalize the design concept.

         <title>Corral[n]Bicarbazoles: Redox&#8208;Active Chiral Macrocycles for Air&#8208;Stable Radical Cations Formation and Guest Capture/Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active macrocycles were synthesized employing axially chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole units, showing excellent chiropotical propreties and hosting ability. These macrocycles generate stable radical cations upon oxidation and enable redox&#8208;responsive guest capture/release via their electron&#8208;rich, deep cavity.








Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are pivotal in both supramolecular chemistry and materials science, as their preorganized cavities enable selective molecular recognition, while their cyclic frameworks facilitate electronic and spatial coupling of monomeric units to yield advanced optoelectronic and magnetic properties. However, macrocycles that combine exceptional host&#8211;guest recognition with these properties remain rare and challenging to design. Herein, we report the synthesis of three pairs of enantiopure, redox&#8208;active, conjugated macrocycles, termed corral[n]bicarbazole, employing axially chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole units. These macrocycles display strong blue emission (quantum yields up to 78% in THF) and pronounced circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 10&#8722;3). Notably, controlled oxidation of corral[n]bicarbazoles generates their mono&#8208; and polyradical cations with exceptional air stability (half&#8208;lives up to five days) and intriguing magnetic properties. The electron&#8208;rich deep&#8208;cavity of corral[4]bicarbazole confers strong hosting ability (Ka = 104&#8211;105 M&#8722;1) toward cationic guests, facilitating redox&#8208;responsive guest capture/release. By integrating a chiroptical, redox&#8208;active backbone with a switchable recognition cavity, corral[n]bicarbazoles offer a versatile platform for advancing interdisciplinary innovation, with potential applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and smart supramolecular materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Bioactive N&#8208;Functionalized Aziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses modern synthetic methods for the preparation of aziridine&#8208;containing small molecules, including biocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic strategies. We highlight the compatibility of various synthetic methods with control of the exocyclic N&#8208;substituent. These methods enable application of aziridines as activity&#8208;based probes for glycosidases, drug development, proteomics, and lipidomics. 








Abstract
Aziridines&#8212;three&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles that engage in strain&#8208;accelerated ring opening chemistry&#8212;are not common functional groups in bioactive natural products. As such, the discovery and optimization of predictable and general methods for the construction of aziridines is critical to the development, evaluation, and optimization of small molecules that contain aziridines. In this review, we discuss modern synthetic strategies for the construction of aziridines. Synthetic methods are categorized based on the synthetic logic used to assemble the aziridine ring: 1) Addition of nitrene equivalents to olefins, 2) addition of carbene equivalents to imines, and 3) intramolecular cyclization chemistry. Special emphasis is given to methods that allow modular control over the identity of the exocyclic nitrogen valence, which directly impacts the electrophilicity, and thus biological activity, of the resulting aziridines. After describing the state of the art in aziridine synthesis, we discuss established and emerging biological applications of aziridine&#8208;containing small molecules, including application as proteomics probes that enable liganding of nonstandard amino acid residues and application in lipidomics. Finally, extant synthetic challenges that must be addressed to realize the full potential of aziridine&#8208;based small molecules are described.

Electrochemical results indicate that the former acts as a robust molecular catalyst to facilitate 4&#8208;e WOR to produce O2 while the latter exhibits marginal catalytic activity on WOR, suggesting that the defective tri&#8208;nuclear cubical motif is most likely the active site of MnOx electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Manganese oxides (MnOx) are promising candidates for water oxidation catalysts. However, the true active centers remain elusive due to the dynamic nature of MnOx during electrolysis and/or activation, hindering progress in catalyst design and optimization. Herein, we aim to address such a challenge by preparing a defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese complex and a di&#8208;manganese complex to mimic the in&#8208;plane and on&#8208;edge subunits of birnessite&#8208;like heterogeneous MnOx electrocatalysts. Electrochemical results indicate that the defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese complex is a robust molecular catalyst to facilitate 4e&#8722; water oxidation to produce O2 with an optimal Faradic efficiency of 95% and an average rate of oxygen generation of 46.4&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest values of reported manganese&#8208;based molecular catalysts and is comparable with representative heterogeneous MnOx systems. In contrast, the di&#8208;manganese complex exhibits marginal catalytic activity. This work provides molecular insights into the true active centers of MnOx and aids in the precise design of more efficient MnOx water oxidation electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Transient Phenolate Enables Relaxation of Z&#8208;Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene to the Stable State in Seconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of a tetrafluoroazobenzene subunit in a spiropyran hybrid is controlled by the rate of merocyanine formation. Rate accelerations of 102&#8211;106 were observed for changes in solvent polarity, UV light irradiation and passage through silica. Rapid azobenzene isomerization occurs via a transient phenolate formed upon spiropyran ring&#8208;opening.








Abstract
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzenes (TFAs) exhibit several unique properties, including a large separation in the n&#8594;&#960;* absorption bands, which allows for efficient photoisomerization using green light, and exceptional thermal stability of their metastable Z&#8208;isomer. These features make them attractive for light&#8208;responsive applications, but controlling the thermal Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization has remained a challenge. In this work, we present a hybrid molecular system that couples a TFA subunit with a spiropyran photoswitch. The TFA subunit retains its ability to undergo selective photoisomerization with green light. Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization in the hybrid occurs approximately 1000 times faster than in a TFA model compound. This acceleration arises from a rate&#8208;determining step involving the formation of merocyanine&#8212;the ring&#8208;opened form of spiropyran. The transient phenolate form of merocyanine promotes rapid Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of the TFA, consistent with the known behavior of azobenzene phenolates. The thermodynamics of TFA isomerization are coupled with those of the spiropyran ring&#8208;opening, allowing the isomerization process to be regulated by external stimuli that influence the spiropyran&#8211;merocyanine equilibrium. In addition to observing a 100&#8211;1000&#8208;fold solvent&#8208;dependent rate increase, we demonstrate a 106&#8208;fold acceleration in TFA isomerization via either photochromism or adsorptiochromism.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on supramolecular polymers has advanced rapidly toward the development of synthetic multicomponent systems. This review highlights recent progress in understanding their assembly mechanisms and how these influence structural and functional properties. Emerging data&#8208;driven approaches, particularly machine learning, offer new opportunities for rational design and characterization, shaping the future of supramolecular chemistry.








Abstract
Inspired by the dynamic assembly of fibrillar proteins in biology, research on supramolecular polymers has progressed rapidly toward the development of synthetic multicomponent systems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the study of supramolecular polymers in solution, with an emphasis on how combined computational and experimental approaches deepen our understanding of these systems. In particular, these studies have elucidated the mechanisms of protein aggregation and provided insights into the characteristics of synthetic systems. We discuss the classification of these polymers and systems, highlighting how their different interaction modes and microstructures give rise to diverse structural and functional properties. In addition, we outline the emerging role of machine learning as a powerful tool to navigate the inherent complexity of these systems, thereby enhancing strategies for rational design and characterization. This review highlights how computational approaches, from traditional modeling to emerging machine learning techniques, enable the experimental characterization and understanding of supramolecular polymer chemistry.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Engineered Membranes Break the Conductivity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;Off in Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;based design strategy is proposed to address the dilemma of ion exchange membranes concerning the combination of ion conductivity and selectivity towards redox actives, as exemplified by the fluorinated poly(arylene alkylene) anion exchange membrane. It strikes a good balance between ion conductivity and selectivity toward actives, thus enabling a stable&#8208;cycling pH&#8208;neutral aqueous organic redox flow battery.








Abstract
Ion exchange membranes constitute critical components in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs), yet face a fundamental trade&#8208;off. High&#8208;ion&#8208;affinity membranes achieve high conductivity but endure swelling&#8208;induced low selectivity due to co&#8208;uptake of water and organic active species. To address it, we develop a fluorine&#8208;engineered polymer architecture strategy, demonstrated via fluorinated poly(arylene alkylene) anion exchange membranes. Fluorine incorporation 1) establishes interconnected ion channels with suppressed swelling, enabling competitive conductivity at low hydration (&#955;&#160;&lt;&#160;4.5), and 2) simultaneously reduces redox&#8208;active material affinity, yielding low permeabilities of, for example, 4.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;12 cm2 s&#8722;1 for methyl viologen, representing 50&#8208;fold and 425&#8208;fold lower permeability than those of fluorine&#8208;free counterpart and commercial DSV membranes, respectively. The optimized membrane enables a pH&#8208;neutral AORFB exhibiting a low&#8208;capacity decay rate (0.00077% per cycle)&#8211;outperforming existing systems by 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude. Our observations provide fundamental guidance for developing advanced membranes in electrochemical energy technologies.

         <title>Polysulfamates as &#8220;Macroisosteres&#8221; of Polyurethanes with Improved Degradability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the synthesis of polysulfamates&#8212;sulfur(VI) isomeric analogs of polyurethanes in which the carbonyl group (&#8211;CO&#8211;) in the repeating unit is replaced by a sulfonyl group (&#8211;SO2&#8211;). Analysis of these polyurethane &#8220;macroisosteres&#8221; revealed enhanced hydrolytic degradability, improved thermal stability, and retained mechanical properties.








Abstract
Addressing the environmental persistence of plastics requires the development of next&#8208;generation polymers that combine high performance with enhanced degradability. Progress toward this grand challenge has been impeded, in part, by the absence of a general blueprint for the macromolecular design of such materials. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;macroisostere&#8221; design strategy, where the carbonyl group (&#8211;CO&#8211;) in polyurethanes (PUs) is replaced with a sulfonyl group (&#8211;SO2&#8211;), resulting in a virtually unknown family of polymers called polysulfamates. This approach, inspired by the use of bioisosteres in drug discovery, aims to preserve key interchain interactions that contribute to thermomechanical performance while enhancing the hydrolytic lability of the polymer backbone. The optimization of a Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) polymerization allowed the synthesis of ten polysulfamates structurally analogous to common PUs. Comparative analysis of one PU and its polysulfamate analog showed that this isosteric substitution increases thermal stability, slightly lowers the glass transition temperature, and retains similar hardness and reduced Young's modulus. Notably, the S(VI)&#8208;based polysulfamate demonstrated significantly enhanced hydrolytic degradability. These results highlight the potential of the &#8220;macroisostere&#8221; approach as a generalizable strategy for designing high&#8208;performance, degradable alternatives to traditional plastics.

         <title>Accessing Strain Engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH from Prussian Blue Analogue Precatalyst for Efficient Anodic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to precisely modulate the electronic structure of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst to access a strain&#8208;engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst for anodic oxidation reactions. 








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising precatalysts to access active metal oxyhydroxide [M(O)OH] phases for anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this study, we have introduced a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of a VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst. Spectroscopic studies revealed the altered coordination and electronic features of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst compared to the FeFe&#8208;PBA counterpart. The electrochemical activation of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst led to the formation of a strained V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst. Notably, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH demonstrated exceptional performance, requiring a potential of only 1.56&#160;V versus RHE for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 1.42&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) at a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the Fe(O)OH. When employed in IOR&#8208;assisted water splitting, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH achieved an energy efficiency of 60% compared to overall water splitting. In&#8208;situ Raman studies reflected the potential dependent generation of active reaction intermediates, which participated in IOR to produce iodate. Mechanistic investigations suggested the involvement of a lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) facilitated by a proton&#8208;decoupled electron transfer (PDET) pathway.

Abstract
Water splitting represents a sustainable and environmentally benign approach for green hydrogen generation and future clean energy solutions. In this context, space&#8208;confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in&#8208;situ/operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D&#8208;3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in&#8208;situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;guided design and structure&#8211;property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in&#8208;situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Conjugated Alkylfluorene Bridged Naphthalimides Cathode Interlayer Enables Low&#8208;Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work delivers a universal design strategy of a novel nonfused conjugated small molecule, namely FNA, serving as CILs to realize highly sensitive NIR photodetectors. The FNA&#8208;based OPDs exhibit enhanced interfacial contact and augmented photoresponse, achieving a notably low dark current and high specific detectivity, outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as the CIL. This innovative approach offers profound insights into the development of high&#8208;performance photodetectors.








Abstract
The cathode interface layers (CILs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of organic photodiodes (OPDs). However, the poor film formation, the tendency of orientation and aggregation, and contact in the interface of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/CILs/electrode increase the dark current, leading to a limitation of light detection. In this study, we designed and synthesized a nonfused conjugated small molecule (FNA) with dioctyl fluorene (F) as the &#960;&#8208;bridge and N&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NA) as terminal groups. As the CIL, it significantly modifies the interfaces of BHJ/CILs/electrode and minimizes dark current density (Jd). Using PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F as the BHJ, FNA&#8208;based OPDs achieve a remarkably low Jd of 1.12&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8&#160;A cm&#8722;2 (at &#8722;0.5&#160;V) and a peak specific detectivity of 8.23&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones (940&#160;nm), outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as CIL. These improvements are attributed to lower Jd by modified interfacial contact and increased photoresponse by reducing depletion region width in FNA&#8208;based photodiodes. Furthermore, uniform photoresponse in 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 OPD pixel arrays further validates its potential for imaging applications.

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis Through D&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To excite electrons bound in d&#8208;band of Pt under light and thus exhibit photocatalysis function, the colloidosomes structure are designed and fabricated for light confinement. Non&#8208;photoresponsive Pt can be optically excited to generate hot electrons from its d&#8208;band structure and exhibit light&#8208;enhanced catalytic activity. NIR excited hot electrons in Pt colloidosomes can enhance the cascade catalysis efficiency of Pt as nanozymes for tumor therapy.








Abstract
Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by finite&#8208;different&#8208;time&#8208;domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100&#160;nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5&#160;nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.

Two paramagnetic Cr(I) complexes with homoleptic fac&#8208;bis(triarylisocyanide) ligands were prepared by chemical oxidation of the Cr(0) precursors and emission spectra with peak maximum at respective 568 and 525&#160;nm have been recorded with THF solutions of these two low&#8208;spin d5 metal complexes at 298&#160;K. Structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies revealed that the emission of the Cr(I) complexes could be tentatively assigned to be spin&#8208;allowed 2MLCT excited states. Femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra confirmed that the lifetimes of the excited states were in the tens of picoseconds, which could be explained by the fast nonradiative decay of 2MLCT state through low&#8208;lying quartet metal&#8208;centered (4MC) states. The Cr(I) complexes with luminescent 2MLCT excited states were distinct from the previously reported d5 Fe(III) complexes with luminescent 2LMCT excited states, enriching the diversity of emissive excited states of earth&#8208;abundant 3d transition metal complexes.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of &#916;AA&#8208;Peptides Using a Bioorthogonal pro&#8208;Amino Acid and Aqueous Flavin Photocatalyst: Green Light Enhances Catalyst Performance and Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We devise a new bioorthogonal amino acid, &#916;Sulf, that can be encoded into peptides and then reacted with carbon radicals, spawned from an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, boronic acids, and green LEDs to produce libraries of &#916;AA peptides. We use this platform to discover inhibitors of A&#946;42 aggregation for treating Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs) are vital building blocks in the design and optimization of peptide drugs. The exact olefin geometry, side chain chemotype, and ancillary &#946;&#8208;carbon substituents play a significant role. Unfortunately, general approaches to install these motifs into peptides are lacking, complicated by the instability of unsaturated residues during traditional amide&#8208;bond coupling and failure of divergent protocols, such as oxidative Heck and Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons, to accommodate a complete range of substrate classes. Herein, we conceive and interrogate an original bioorthogonal reagent, &#946;&#8208;sulfonyldehydroamino acid (&#916;Sulf), that can be site&#8208;specifically encoded into standard peptides through solid&#8208; or liquid&#8208;phase synthesis. When combined with an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, myriad boronic acids and 525&#160;nm light&#8212;a more biologically benign portion of the flavin visible absorption spectra that has not previously been exploited for flavin photoredox catalysis,&#8212;this latent residue becomes one of several (Z)&#8208;&#916;AA variants (aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic)&#160;via&#160;stereoretentive radical conjugate addition and &#946;&#8208;scission. The importance of green light is established through mechanistic studies showing that it tempers radical formation and discourages flavin&#8208;catalyzed isomerization, controlling product selectivity. We apply our original reagent and catalytic platform in a brief medicinal chemistry campaign to discover tetrapeptides that modulate A&#946;42 aggregation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Paired Pulse Electrocatalytic Conversion of Phenol for Co&#8208;Production of Cyclohexanol and Para&#8208;Benzoquinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed paired pulse system achieves the selective conversion of phenol in wastewater for co&#8208;production of valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone, with an unexpected Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of organic pollutants in wastewater into value&#8208;added chemicals presents a dual solution for water treatment and sustainable synthesis, yet achieving high Faradaic and energy efficiencies remains challenging. Here we, for the first time, report the paired electrolysis strategy to produce valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) simultaneously from phenol in wastewater. More importantly, to address the dilemma of mismatched operation conditions between cathodic hydrogenation and anodic oxidation, we propose a pulse current strategy with alternating high&#8208;/low&#8208;current periods, which ensures the reduction kinetics of phenol at the cathode while effectively preventing the over&#8208;oxidation of generated p&#8208;BQ at the anode. By using tailored PdRu/C and NiRu/C as the cathode and anode, the paired pulse system realizes 84.9% phenol conversion and 83.9% cyclohexanol yield at the cathode, alongside 100% phenol conversion and 68.5% p&#8208;BQ yield at the anode, with an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1. Carbon emission accounting and techno&#8208;economic analysis highlight its environmental benefits and economic feasibility (US$1.36 profit per kg phenol). This work offers a green and efficient route for environmental remediation and resource recovery.

         <title>Accelerated Porosity Screening Using a Multichannel Colorimetric Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput porosity screening method was developed for rapid porosity evaluation, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach to identifying candidate porous materials that is 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption methods with 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy. A multichannel six&#8208;dye array was used as a proxy measurement for porosity, eliminating false results that would result from the use of a single dye.








Abstract
Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single&#8208;port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a &#8220;quick&#8221; analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre&#8208;screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six&#8208;dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The method showed a 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre&#8208;screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Triazolate Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Water Oxidation Catalysts with Dual Photoanode Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal&#8208;substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) MOFs are reported as dual&#8208;function materials for light absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media, achieving a highest photocurrent of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 A cm&#8722;2 at bias&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is an emerging technology that achieves renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, from sunlight. Its realization depends on finding highly active and stable catalysts of water splitting and photoactive materials for light absorption. To be scalable, these should contain only abundant elements. Here, for the first time, Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are characterized as new dual&#8208;function materials for photo&#8208;absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media. The materials were studied by a range of structural, spectroscopic, and computational density functional theory (DFT) techniques. Fe(ta)2 and Fe&#8208;Mn(ta)2 were found to be highly active and stable in chemical and photochemical water oxidation, and in addition function as photoanodes, with photo&#8208;electrocatalytic currents (&#8764;2.00 x 10&#8722;3 Acm&#8722;2 at&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at pH&#160;=&#160;1. The possibility of a unique catalytic mechanism where O&#9472;O bond formation is possible from the coupling of two adjacent FeIV&#160;=&#160;O fragments was demonstrated by DFT analysis. Thus, Fe&#8208;triazolate MOF has been established as a new, stable, scalable, versatile, and efficient platform for sustainable energy conversion in the realm of artificial photosynthesis.

Fe(ta)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe-Mn(ta)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were found to be highly active and stable in chemical and photochemical water oxidation, and in addition function as photoanodes, with photo-electrocatalytic currents (&#8764;2.00 x 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; Acm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at &lt;i&gt;pH&#160;&lt;/i&gt;=&#160;1. The possibility of a unique catalytic mechanism where O&#9472;O bond formation is possible from the coupling of two adjacent Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;=&#160;O fragments was demonstrated by DFT analysis. Thus, Fe-triazolate MOF has been established as a new, stable, scalable, versatile, and efficient platform for sustainable energy conversion in the realm of artificial photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>HerTACs Enable Tumor&#8208;Selective Lysosomal Degradation of Membrane and Extracellular Proteins via HER2 Trafficking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI&#8208;guided design of HER2&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs) enables selective degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins in HER2+ tumors. These stapled peptide&#8208;based degraders harness HER2&#8208;mediated trafficking to deliver programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) into lysosomes, offering a broadly applicable and clinically promising strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). 








Abstract
Targeting extracellular and membrane proteins for degradation remains a frontier challenge in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), largely due to the intracellular confinement of existing proteolysis systems and reliance on bulky biologics. Here, we develop a novel TPD platform, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs), which co&#8208;opts the tumor overexpressed, endocytic, and lysosomal trafficking capability of HER2. Starting from the HER2&#8208;binding peptide LTVSPWY, we engineered the first&#8208;generation HerTAC (LP), a conjugate of the HER2&#8208;binding peptide and a PD&#8208;L1 ligand, to degrade programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) in HER2&#8208;positive cells. Guided by AlphaFold modeling and alanine scanning, we developed a stapled peptide&#8208;based HerTAC (L2,5P) with enhanced degradative&#160;efficacy (DC50&#160;=&#160;156&#160;nM), stability, and pharmacokinetics. HerTAC L2,5P showed potent antitumor activity and low systemic toxicity in HER2+ breast cancer animal models. The HerTAC strategy was further extended to other clinically relevant inaccessible membrane and extracellular targets (i.e., V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation [VISTA] and macrophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]), highlighting its generality and broad applicability. This work establishes a tumor&#8208;selective, lysosome&#8208;directed TPD strategy that expands the druggable proteome and offers a clinically transformable approach for precision oncology.

         <title>Preparation of Degradable Polymers Containing Tunable Ratios of Dithioacetals and Disulfides via Mixed Mode Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the preparation of redox degradable polymers containing tunable ratios of dithioacetals and disulfides via a one&#8208;pot mixed&#8208;mode reaction. The amount of dithioacetals is able to be increased by adding more of the methylene source.








Abstract
Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di&#8208;SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox&#8208;enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from &lt;1&#160;kDa to 16&#160;kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di&#8208;SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Screening&#8208;Guided Core&#8208;Shell RuO2@TaOx Nanorods Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the limitations of conventional experimental method, which are often time&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive, a multi&#8208;step systematic screening strategy guides the selection of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as protective layers for RuO2 in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The relevant core&#8208;shell structures are subsequently designed, where interfacial synergy promotes both catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
In the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the exploration of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is essential for the environmentally friendly production of hydrogen. Although RuO2 exhibits high catalytic activity, its solubility and corrosion in acidic environments are of concern. In this study, high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides were multi&#8208;step rationally screened as protective layers for RuO2 to identify their roles in the acidic OER process. Among them, Ta&#8208;related oxide was selected as the best candidate. To demonstrate the theoretical predictions, RuO2@TaOx with a core&#8208;shell structure was deployed, which exhibited low overpotentials of 163 and 232&#160;mV at 10&#160; and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In fact, the dense amorphous TaOx layer effectively prevented the dissolution of RuO2 and optimized the charge transfer through interfacial synergy, significantly improving both the activity and durability of OER. Meanwhile, the operando quick X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Quick&#8208;XAS) confirmed that Ru served as the active site during OER, while Ta inhibited the over&#8208;oxidation of Ru, correlating with theoretical considerations. This study provides a new paradigm using targeted computational screening to guide the design of advanced catalysts, and serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the deployment of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as a protective layer for RuO2 in the acidic OER.

         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic mechanophores function as force&#8208;reporting molecules in polymer materials. In their Research Article (e202510114), Yoshimitsu Sagara et&#160;al. demonstrate the first hinge&#8208;like mechanophore based on [2.2]paracyclophane. Polyurethane films covalently incorporating the mechanophore exhibit excimer&#8208;dominant emission in the force&#8208;free state. Upon mechanical activation, force&#8208;induced separation of the associated fluorophores leads to a change in fluorescence color from excimer&#8208;dominant bright yellow to monomer&#8208;dominant blue&#8208;green.

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Drug Discovery of Novel High&#8208;affinity, Selective, and Anti&#8208;inflammatory Inhibitors of the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed potent and selective noncovalent Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors through a structure&#8208;guided fragment&#8208;based approach. These nanomolar inhibitors activate Nrf2&#8208;controlled genes, suppress inflammation via NLRP3 and STING pathways, and exhibit distinct transcriptional profiles compared to covalent Nrf2 activators, offering promising chemical probes and drug leads for oxidative stress&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Activating the cytoprotective response of nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. A promising strategy is to inhibit the protein&#8208;protein interaction between Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Nrf2 using noncovalent compounds that target the Keap1 Kelch domain. These compounds may be more specific than covalent Keap1&#8208;reacting Nrf2 activators. However, the development of drug&#8208;like noncovalent Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors faces challenges due to the size and polarity of the Kelch binding pocket.

     alt="Fragment-Based Drug Discovery of Novel High-affinity, Selective, and Anti-inflammatory Inhibitors of the Keap1-Nrf2 Protein-Protein Interaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed potent and selective noncovalent Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors through a structure-guided fragment-based approach. These nanomolar inhibitors activate Nrf2-controlled genes, suppress inflammation via NLRP3 and STING pathways, and exhibit distinct transcriptional profiles compared to covalent Nrf2 activators, offering promising chemical probes and drug leads for oxidative stress-related diseases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating the cytoprotective response of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. A promising strategy is to inhibit the protein-protein interaction between Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Nrf2 using noncovalent compounds that target the Keap1 Kelch domain. These compounds may be more specific than covalent Keap1-reacting Nrf2 activators. However, the development of drug-like noncovalent Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors faces challenges due to the size and polarity of the Kelch binding pocket. Here, we present a new series of noncovalent Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors developed from a weak fragment hit identified by crystallographic screening. A two-step growing strategy and optimization guided by several X-ray cocrystal structures led to compounds with low nanomolar affinities and complete selectivity for Keap1 in a panel of homologous Kelch domains. In cells, compounds &lt;b&gt;24&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;28&lt;/b&gt; potently activated the expression of Nrf2-controlled genes and showed anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome and STING signalling activation. RNA sequencing revealed activation of cytoprotective pathways and a different profile from typical covalent Nrf2 activators. This work highlights the potential of fragment-based drug discovery for challenging targets like Keap1 and introduces novel Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors as chemical probes and drug leads.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ensemble of Active Acid Sites on Amorphous Silica&#8211;Alumina Surfaces for Catalytic Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous silica&#8211;alumina plays a key role in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), but its active sites are hard to define due to atomic disorder. Here, we analyze its structure&#8211;acidity relationship under FCC conditions and observe that diverse acid sites emerge, including zeolite&#8208;like and pseudo&#8208;bridging Br&#248;nsted sites, influenced by Si content and hydroxylation. Using theory and experiments we confirm Br&#248;nsted acidity peaks at an optimal Si coverage.








Abstract
Amorphous silica&#8211;alumina are critical materials in catalysis, particularly for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). However, the atomic scale understanding of the active sites has been challenging, because of the nonuniform atomic distribution and the material's amorphous nature. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT), machine learning potentials and sampling methods to investigate the relationship between structure and acidity in silica&#8208;modified alumina. Under FCC conditions, we predict an ensemble of acid sites with diverse local structures and a spectrum of acid strengths, including zeolite&#8208;like bridging Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) and pseudo&#8208;bridging silanol BAS. This distribution is influenced by surface structure, Si coverage, and extent of hydroxylation, shaped by synthesis methods and reaction conditions. Experiments using a model Si&#8208;stabilized alumina catalyst confirm that Br&#248;nsted acidity increases with Si content, peaking at an optimal value before declining. These insights provide a foundation for designing efficient solid acid catalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Nanoribbons with up to 29 Linearly&#8208;Fused Rings and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three triptycene end&#8208;capped N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons with precise length are prepared through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits. The longest one comprises a 29&#8208;linearly&#8208;fused&#8208;ring backbone, setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the reported soluble nonalternant nanoribbons. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy measurements indicate high intrinsic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities in these nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, one of the highest values reported for graphene nanoribbons and the highest observed to date for non&#8208;alternant ones.








Abstract
The synthesis of nonalternant graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)&#8212;carbon&#8208;based nanostructures featuring fused pentagonal or heptagonal rings that disrupt hexagonal symmetry&#8212;has remained a significant challenge despite their unique electronic properties, such as tunable bandgaps and topological states. Unlike conventional alternant hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene&#8208;derived systems), nonalternant architectures exhibit distinct electron confinement effects, making them promising for nanoscale optoelectronics and quantum materials. However, achieving precise control over their length, solubility, and structural regularity has had limited progress. Herein, we report a versatile solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a novel family of structurally precise N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons (NRs: NR&#8208;11 to NR&#8208;29) through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits terminated with triptycene end&#8208;caps. The longest one comprises 29 linearly fused rings (particularly including 10 pentagonal rings), setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the soluble nonalternant NRs reported to date. Strategic incorporation of triptycene end&#8208;caps and alkoxyphenyl substituents into their molecular backbones confers high solubility and a unique 3D configuration, enabling comprehensive solution&#8208;phase structural characterization and systematic investigation of length&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. Employing terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we infer high intrinsic charge carrier mobilities in nonalternant nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, highlighting this novel family of nanoribbons as promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications.

         <title>Stopping the Chain: Isolated Molecular Intermediates of Anionic Styrene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the organometallic first&#8208;step carbolithiation products of anionic styrene polymerization with diethyl ether and thf, that have not been isolated so far due to the high reactivity of anionic polymerization. X&#8208;ray solid&#8208;state and NMR solution&#8208;state experiments show different intermediates in the different solvents. In situ FT&#8208;IR and DFT&#8208;calculations present mechanistic proposals for the initiation reaction.








Abstract
Anionic polymerization developed to one of the most used polymerization techniques both in industry and academia in the last 70 years. Due to the required high reactivity of the polymerization, the isolation of the organometallic intermediate in between initiation and propagation step has not been possible so far and its mechanism is still not fully understood. Additionally, deprotonations in benzylic positions remain challenging, which is a prerequisite for a successful living carbanionic polymerization, but also complicating the synthetic access to the intermediates. Herein, we present the synthesis and isolation of the first&#8208;step carbolithiation product of anionic styrene polymerization in diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Characterizations in solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution state by extended nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were carried out. Differing initiation reactivity was observed by in situ fourier transform&#8208;infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, revealing the intermediates to be responsible for polymerization reactivity. A possible mechanistic explanation for the initiation state was presented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By our approach of isolating the chain&#8208;relevant intermediates on a molecular level, we gained new insights on the existing mechanism.

We demonstrate the unique reactivity of a mesoionic imine with bis&#8208;aryl carbodiimides, forming an MII&#8208;CDI adduct at room temperature via a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;H shift. These MII&#8208;CDI adducts serve as important synthons for mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene&#8208;stabilized nitreones (I) and guanidinate&#8208;type ligands.








Abstract
In this study, we report our recent findings on the synthesis and reactivity of a novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine&#8208;type mesoionic imine&#8208;carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) adduct. Unlike reported NHC&#8208;CDI adducts, formed by the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) with CDI, these zwitterionic compounds undergo a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift (1,3&#8208;H shift), resulting in guanidine&#8208;type compounds. The mechanism of this 1,3&#8208;H shift has been investigated through quantum chemical calculations. The MII&#8208;CDI adduct serves as a valuable synthon for the synthesis of mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene (MIC&#8208;ADC)&#8208;based nitreone (N(I)) compounds. We have conducted a detailed investigation into the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and electrochemical behavior of these nitreone (N(I)) compounds. Additionally, the potential of these MII&#8208;CDI adducts as guanidinate ligands is explored. Our investigations here display the distinct reactivities of MII in contrast to their N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (NHI) congeners.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle Monolayer&#8208;Decorated Nanopipette Enabling in Situ Monitoring of Single&#8208;Cell Redox Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette was developed to visualize single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. Leveraging strong near&#8208;field coupling within the monolayer that forms uniform hotspots, our method enables highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of redox metabolism changes, which deepens the understanding of single&#8208;cell ferroptosis.








Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of how single cells respond to redox perturbations is pivotal for predicting cell fate decisions. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;active nanopipettes hold promise for single&#8208;cell analysis, yet challenges remain in achieving both signal sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, a plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette has been developed, which serves as a biomimetic endoscope to monitor single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. This is accomplished by the conformal transferring of gold nanoparticle monolayer onto the nanopipette followed by the functionalization of redox&#8208;responsive probes. The strong near&#8208;field coupling within monolayer forms uniform hotspots, enabling highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of SERS signals changes triggered by redox species. Modulated by the nanopipette technology, the endoscope allows for in situ monitoring of global redox states with low invasiveness and high spatial resolution. Further, study of ferroptosis events via simultaneous optical and electrical recording elucidates the correlation between redox imbalance and membrane damage during various ferroptosis&#8208;inducers stimulation, which has not been observed at the single&#8208;cell level. This work provides profound insights into the cellular redox dynamics, contributing to a deeper understanding of related physiopathological pathways.

         <title>Linking Metallacycle Transfer with Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis to Generate Polyacetylenes of Unprecedented Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unusual low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap polyacetylenes bearing ring&#8208;fused tellurophene and vinyl side chains were prepared by combining metallacycle transfer (Hf/p&#8208;block element exchange) with ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) into a single modular and efficient protocol. 








Abstract
A hafnium&#8208;based bicyclic precursor (COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Hf) has been prepared that enables tandem Hf/E metallacycle transfer (E&#160;=&#160;main group element) and the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclooctatetraene (COT) units to generate a new family of structurally unique polyacetylenes. Highlights from this work include a tellurophene&#8208;grafted polyacetylene, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Te, and a polyacetylene with unsaturated vinyl side chains, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;vinyl. The resulting polymers can be processed into films that yield optical band gaps as low as 1.6&#160;eV, representing promising new architectures for the optoelectronics community.

         <title>Quantitative Tracking of Apoptotic Caspase&#8208;3 In Vivo for Early Evaluation of Radiation Therapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescence probe was developed to accurately quantify caspase&#8208;3 induced by radiotherapy in vivo by emitting a dual signal at 1550&#160;nm as a reference and response signal, respectively. The detection limit for caspase&#8208;3 was determined to be 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. The established early efficacy evaluation system can effectively predict the therapeutic outcome of cancer radiotherapy and guide the optimization of treatment plans.








Abstract
Traditional responsive fluorescent probes are predominantly restricted to qualitative biomarker detection, incapable of delivering real&#8208;time quantitative analysis or spatial mapping of protease activity in vivo, which is essential for elucidating disease progression. To overcome this, a ratiometric second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) probe (DCNP@IR&#8208;806) was developed by conjugating caspase&#8208;3&#8208;specific peptide substrates and sensitizer molecules (IR&#8208;806) to lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP). DCNP@IR&#8208;806 achieves single&#8208;channel emission at 1550&#160;nm under dual excitation, facilitating self&#8208;calibrated quantification and real&#8208;time monitoring of activated caspase&#8208;3 in vivo. Radiotherapy induces tumor cell apoptosis, thereby activating caspase&#8208;3, which subsequently triggers a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II FL signal change of DCNP@IR&#8208;806. The ratiometric signal demonstrates a linear correlation with caspase&#8208;3 concentration, achieving a detection limit of 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. Then, an early efficacy assessment system capable of predicting radiotherapy outcomes within 12 h post&#8208;treatment was constructed, markedly expediting evaluation compared to traditional methods that require weeks. This rapid, precise, and user&#8208;friendly assessment facilitates timely optimization of therapeutic regimens to enhance efficacy while minimizing side effects. This platform represents a significant advancement in precision oncology by transitioning from qualitative imaging to in situ quantitative biomarker tracking.

         <title>Amide Chemistry Enables Redox Locking of Cyclic Disulfides for Polypeptide Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of a family of cyclic dichalcogenides derived from cysteine is significantly enhanced against reductants upon acylation of the alpha&#8208;amino group. Amide formation serves as a redox lock, offering a mechanism to achieve selectivity in the assembly of large cyclic polypeptides on a water&#8208;compatible solid support.








Abstract
A practical strategy in synthetic organic chemistry for shutting down temporarily the nucleophilicity of thiols is to exploit their redox properties by converting them into disulfides. The stability of such a thiol protection in reductive medium can be sensitive to microenvironmental changes, including chemical modifications occurring nearby. Although difficult to achieve, large shifts in disulfide stability might provide a practical mean for bringing selectivity in a reacting system comprising multiple thiol functionalities. Here we report that the stability of a cyclic disulfide increases dramatically upon acylation of an amino group placed in the vicinity of the S&#9472;S bond. The gain in stability is so pronounced that the amide bond formation acts as a redox lock. We describe the application of such a redox switch to the chemoselective assembly of polypeptides by thiol&#8208;based peptide ligation chemistries.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Delocalized Cu2+ Activates Spin Channels in Spinel Oxides to Selectively Produce 1O2 for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an electron&#8208;delocalized strategy to unlock FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+ spin channel, inducing intermolecular electron transfer of two PMS for selective 1O2 generation. The directed electron transfer behavior not only maintains the catalyst stability, but also immensely reduces the 1O2 generation energy barrier and improves the PMS utilization.








Abstract
Blocked electron transfer in the catalyst during advanced oxidation processes causes sluggish singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency and sacrifices catalyst stability. In this work, we propose an electron&#8208;delocalization strategy that unlocks ATd2+&#9472;O&#9472;BOh3+ electron&#8208;transfer pathways within spinel oxide (Cu0.8Fe2.2O4), inducing the intermolecular electron transfer of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selective 1O2 generation. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the electron&#8208;delocalized Cu2+ triggers a high spin&#8208;state of O in FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+, thus creating a spin channel for the spontaneous intermolecular electron transfer of PMS from the FeOh3+ adsorption site to the FeTd2+ adsorption site through FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+. This process allows for the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of PMS, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the formation of SO4&#8226;&#8722; and SO5&#8226;&#8722; radicals. Subsequently, the interfacial SO4&#8226;&#8722; rapidly oxidizes SO5&#8226;&#8722; into 1O2, enhancing 1O2 generation efficiency without sacrificing catalyst stability. The selectivity of 1O2 in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system reaches 98.4%. Multiple pollutants are removed in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system without interference from coexisting substances. The scale&#8208;up experiment realizes 100% contaminant removal during the continuous operation process (48&#160;h). This work exhibits a novel strategy for selective 1O2 generation to achieve the goal of practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Blocked electron transfer in the catalyst during advanced oxidation processes causes sluggish singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation efficiency and sacrifices catalyst stability. In this work, we propose an electron-delocalization strategy that unlocks A&lt;sub&gt;Td&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;O&#9472;B&lt;sub&gt;Oh&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; electron-transfer pathways within spinel oxide (Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), inducing the intermolecular electron transfer of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selective &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the electron-delocalized Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; triggers a high spin-state of O in Fe&lt;sub&gt;Td&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;O&#9472;Fe&lt;sub&gt;Oh&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, thus creating a spin channel for the spontaneous intermolecular electron transfer of PMS from the Fe&lt;sub&gt;Oh&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption site to the Fe&lt;sub&gt;Td&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption site through Fe&lt;sub&gt;Td&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;O&#9472;Fe&lt;sub&gt;Oh&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. This process allows for the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of PMS, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the formation of SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; radicals. Subsequently, the interfacial SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; rapidly oxidizes SO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, enhancing &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation efficiency without sacrificing catalyst stability. The selectivity of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PMS system reaches 98.4%. Multiple pollutants are removed in the Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PMS system without interference from coexisting substances. The scale-up experiment realizes 100% contaminant removal during the continuous operation process (48&#160;h). This work exhibits a novel strategy for selective &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation to achieve the goal of practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrated Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of the mRNA Vaccine Building Block N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Triphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and its N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are crucial components in mRNA vaccine technology. Here, an atom&#8208;economic, high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route for &#936;TP synthesis is presented. A new chemoenzymatic route for m1&#936;TP synthesis was developed. The method offers enhanced reaction efficiency and sustainability compared to pure chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and its N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are critical monomer building blocks of mRNA therapeutics, yet efficient, scalable methods of their synthesis from readily accessible substrates remain underdeveloped. m1&#936;TP is a major cost factor of production of the current COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. We herein report a notably atom&#8208;economic and high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route toward &#936;TP and present two chemoenzymatic routes for producing m1&#936;TP at &#8764;200&#160;mg scale of isolated compound. Biocatalytic cascade rearrangement of uridine delivered &#936;MP or &#936; in high yields. Acetonide&#8208;protected &#936;MP was selectively N1&#8208;methylated using dimethyl sulfate and subsequently converted to the triphosphate through efficient kinase cascade reaction. Saccharomyces cerevisiae uridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate kinase was shown for ATP&#8208;dependent phosphorylation of m1&#936;MP to m1&#936;DP and m1&#936;TP synthesis was catalyzed by Escherichia coli acetate kinase which also served to regenerate ATP by acetyl phosphate. Benchmarked against chemical route converting the enzymatically produced &#936; into m1&#936;TP, the novel chemoenzymatic route from &#936;MP offered improved metrics of reaction efficiency and sustainability. The synthetic &#936;TP and m1&#936;TP replaced UTP for mRNA synthesis by in vitro transcription. Overall, this study shows the productive integration of chemical methylation with enzymatic cascade reactions for C&#9472;C coupling and phosphorylation toward an efficient preparation of m1&#936;TP.

         <title>Bone&#8208;Inspired Sustainable Hydrogel Electrolytes for Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a bone&#8208;inspired hydrogel electrolyte (Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel) using Zn&#8208;doped hydroxyapatite (Zn&#8208;HA) nanofibers and a gelatin matrix derived from animal bones. Its bone&#8208;like structural composition ensured excellent sustainability, water retention ability, and mechanical properties, addressing Zn anode issues. The zinc superionic conductor Zn&#8208;HA created dual Zn2&#8314; transport channels, accelerating desolvation and enhancing AZMB performance.








Abstract
Hydrogels are promising electrolytes for use in aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs). However, the problems associated with the Zn anodes cannot be eliminated using current hydrogel electrolytes, and their poor sustainability has also been neglected. We have developed a bone&#8208;inspired hydrogel electrolyte (Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel) composed of Zn&#8208;doped hydroxyapatite (Zn&#8208;HA) nanofibers and a gelatin matrix derived from animal bones. The bone&#8208;like structure and strong molecular interactions in the biodegradable, recyclable, and biocompatible components endow Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel with excellent sustainability, water retention, and mechanical properties, which solves the problems currently associated with Zn anodes. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;HA superionic conductor exhibits an ultrahigh intrinsic ionic conductivity and accelerated Zn2+ desolvation process. The dual&#8208;channels for Zn2+ transport in Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel result in high ionic conductivity (32.5 mS cm&#8722;1) and transference number (0.80), facilitating uniform Zn plating/stripping and durable working stability. As a result, Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel ensures ultrastable cycling performance with a cumulative capacity of 5 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2 for Zn/Zn cells and a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 82.4% after 2000 cycles for full cells, surpassing the capabilities of current hydrogel electrolytes, and has potential applications in sustainable and functional energy&#8208;storage devices.

Chemoselectivity Challenge: A precise catalyst design allows for chemoselectivity control over alkyne reactivity to yield pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) cyclotrimerization. Operative mechanism has been elucidated by means of stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations.








Abstract
The synthesis of pentafulvenes with varied substituents has been efficiently achieved using novel rhodium&#8208;based catalysts via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) alkyne cyclotrimerization. A rational design of the catalyst structure, including pyridonato, NHC, and CO ligands, ensures the alkyne chemoselectivity and prevents the formation of robust rhodium&#8208;fulvene species. Furthermore, the judicious choice of acidity and steric properties of different alkynes enables the preparation of cross&#8208;coupled fulvene derivatives. Stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations, shed light on the reaction mechanism, showing that it includes an initial alkyne deprotonation, two successive alkyne insertions, cyclization, and protonolysis, the first insertion being the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>A Butterfly&#8208;Like Fluorescent Tracker for Dynamic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamics of reversible polymerization could be visualized using a butterfly&#8208;shaped fluorescent tracker. The emission color showed strong dependence on the microenvironmental confinement within the dynamic polymers, correlating with molecular weight, backbone structure, conformation, and aggregation state. The dynamic polymerization of poly(disulfide)s could be tracked via the multicolored emission of the fluorescent probe, demonstrating high sensitivity to a wide range of poly(disulfide)s.








Abstract
Optically tracking constitutional dynamics provides a time&#8208;resolved, non&#8208;invasive, and visually interpretable approach to unraveling microscopic complexity in system chemistry. Here we report a butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent tracker, featuring excited&#8208;state conformational adaptivity, capable of sensing the subtle microscopic dynamics of polymers as a ratiometric fluorescent probe. The key design is coupling the fluorophore's conformational relaxation dynamics to microenvironmental constraints imposed by polymer structural features&#8212;such as chain length, conformation, and inter&#8208;/intramolecular interactions. By employing the fluorophore as a bifunctional initiator, we grafted two dynamic polymer chains onto its phenyl &#8220;wings&#8221;, creating a single&#8208;fluorophore tracker that dynamically interacts with its environment. This system functions as a highly sensitive ratiometric probe, optically reporting microscopic polymer dynamics in real time, including polymerization kinetics, chain folding/unfolding transitions, and depolymerization processes. Systematic studies demonstrate the broad applicability of this concept across diverse polymeric systems, with distinct emission signatures enabling differentiation between systems. The probe's ability to correlate fluorescence output with microenvironmental changes reveals its utility in both fundamental and applied contexts. We anticipate this conformationally adaptive fluorescent platform will advance research in dynamic chemistry, particularly for real&#8208;time monitoring of polymeric systems and the development of responsive materials.

         <title>Titanium&#8211;Polyoxometalate Crosslinked Metallo&#8211;Supramolecular Polymer as Artificial Interfacial Layer for Highly Persistent and Low&#8211;Temperature Tolerant Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>An advanced metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer is designed and synthesized by utilizing a titanium&#8211;polyoxometalate (Ti&#8208;POM) to bridge organic and inorganic moieties, and it is utilized as an anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) to stabilize lithium metal anodes. The MSP&#8208;IPL possesses superior ion&#8208;transfer ability and outstanding electrochemical/ambient stability. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs can effectively bind with PF6&#8722;, enhancing Li+ transference number (tLi+&#160;= 0.607), promoting uniform distribution of Li+ flux.








Abstract
The uncontrolled lithium (Li) dendrite growth and fragile native solid electrolyte interphase formation have severely hindered the practical development of Li metal batteries. Herein, a coordinatively cross&#8208;linked metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer as anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) is developed by utilizing titanium(IV)&#8211;polyoxometalates (Ti&#8208;POMs) as hexatopic linkers to bridge organic and inorganic moieties. The constructed MSP&#8208;IPL possesses high electrochemical stability, superior ion&#8208;transfer ability, and good air stability. Due to its high film formation uniformity and mechanical tenacity, the MSP&#8208;IPL can effectively avoid nonuniform Li deposition caused by the tip effect, thus inhibiting Li dendrite proliferation. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs in polymer skeleton can efficiently bind with PF6&#8722; anions, thus increasing Li+ transference number and promoting homogeneous Li+ distribution. The reprocessability and self&#8208;healing ability endowed by dynamic coordination bonds enable the MSP&#8208;IPL to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interface contact. Consequently, high&#8208;loading Li||LiFePO4 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries based on MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li anodes demonstrate impressive cyclability and extraordinary rate capability. Even at a low temperature of &#8722;20 &#176;C, the MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li||NCM811 batteries can still cycle stably for over 500 cycles (equivalent to 138 days) with a considerable capacity retention of 86.8%. This work presents a promising solution for developing practical low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries.

         <title>Reversing Blocking Order of Trithiocarbonate&#8208;Mediated RAFT Polymerizations Using Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acrylic&#8208;methacrylic block copolymers have limited accessibility due to monomer order requirements in reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques leading to a vast landscape of block copolymers being understudied. Using unique PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization conditions, a controlled chain extension of poly(methyl acrylate) with methyl methacrylate could be performed resulting in a high&#8208;molecular weight thermoplastic elastomer.








Abstract
Many acrylic&#8211;methacrylic block copolymer sequences remain inaccessible due to synthetic limitations. Herein, photoinduced electron/energy transfer (PET) catalysis is leveraged to reverse blocking order limitations in trithiocarbonate (TTC)&#8208;mediated reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We synthesized poly(methyl acrylate&#8208;b&#8208;methyl methacrylate) by PET&#8208;RAFT using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3, achieving predictable, linear increases in molecular weight with conversion. Kinetics studies showed that adding a tertiary amine (triethanolamine) introduced a reversible redox reaction to stabilize the TTC radical during chain extensions, leading to more uniform block copolymers (&#208;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.47) compared to block copolymers synthesized without amine (&#208;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.56). To highlight the utility of this method, triblock copolymers of poly(methyl acrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) blocks were investigated. The order of acrylic and methacrylic blocks impacted the physical properties of compositionally similar polymeric materials. For example, a high molecular weight triblock copolymer (P(MMA&#8208;b&#8208;MA&#8208;b&#8208;MMA), Mn&#160;=&#160;564&#160;kg mol&#8722;1) thermoplastic elastomer showed exceptional strain (&gt;1600%). Overall, we report (i) a new methodology to unlock synthetic access to acrylic&#8211;methacrylic block copolymers using TTCs and photocatalysis, (ii) insight into photocatalyst&#8208;mediated radical polymerization, and (iii) synthesis of new high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Si/Carbon&#8208;dots with Surface N&#8208;C Sites Promoting Proton and Electron Transfers in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

The *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH step is considered the rate&#8208;determining step in the oxygen reduction reaction. Silane chain&#8208;grafted carbon dots with N&#8208;C active sites help overcome the energy barrier through promoting proton and electron transfers, thereby enhancing H2O2 production in photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed through either a two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron pathway, both of which are important for a wide range of applications. The intermediate conversion of *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH recognized as the rate&#8208;determining step in ORR, with its efficiency strongly dependent on the nature of active sites at the surface of a catalyst. Herein, Si&#8208;supported carbon dots (Si&#8208;CDs) are introduced as cocatalysts in a photocatalytic system, where their nitrogen&#8211;carbon sites play a pivotal role in lowering the energy barrier for *OOH formation by promoting proton and electron transfers, thus enhancing the H2O2 production rate in ORR. This strategy is broadly applicable across a wide range of photocatalysts, both with and without use of sacrificial agents. The H2O2 production rate for Zn0.5Cd0.5S (30&#160;mg) increased from 13.0 to 40.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 when 0.6&#160;mg of Si&#8208;CDs were added. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations are conducted to reveal the reaction pathway and the reduced energy requirements for the *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH conversion. This study provides a unique example of overcoming a key barrier in ORR using a metal&#8208;free catalyst and promotes potential applications in various fields.

         <title>Transition Metal Atom&#8211;Cluster Synergistic Modification with Tuned d&#8208;band Center Imparts Longevous Potassium Metal Anodes</title>

The transition metal atom&#8211;cluster synergistic strategy modifies the aluminum current collector to enhance potassiophilicity, increase nucleation density and induce 3D progressive nucleation mode, thereby ensuring a dendrite&#8208;free potassium anode toward robust potassium metal batteries.








Abstract
The tailored nucleation and growth of potassium metal over a current collector is essential to realize longevous potassium metal anodes. The commercial current collector lacks sufficient nucleation sites and fails to guide uniform deposition, underscoring the request for interfacial modulation maneuvers. Herein, we develop transition metal atom&#8211;cluster moiety decorated N&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanosphere to modify the Al current collector. In a Fe model system, the Fe single atoms provide high surface energy and fast charge transfer, while Fe clusters serve as local electron reservoirs. This cooperative architecture manages to tune the d&#8208;band center, accordingly promoting the potassium capture and minimizing the nucleation overpotential to merely 4&#160;mV. Theoretical simulations and in situ microscopic/spectroscopic characterizations evidence that the synergistic modification markedly accelerates potassium plating/stripping kinetics, enabling prolonged symmetric&#8208;cell cycling (approaching 3000&#160;h) and stabilized full&#8208;cell performance (0.022% decay rate per cycle over 2000 cycles). This strategy could be extended to other transition metals (e.g., Co, Ni, or Cu), offering a paradigm for atomic&#8208;level interfacial engineering toward reversible alkali metal batteries.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence from Isolated Molecules Through Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a series of highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence films were achieved by doping heterocyclic molecules containing a chiral propionic acid group into a polymer matrix, with the highest phosphorescence efficiency reaching up to 68.4% under ambient conditions. Notably, the chiral propionic acid group not only imparts circular polarization to the emitter but also enhances intermolecular interactions between the host and emitter.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with circularly polarization feature attracts considerable attentions owing to its unique exciton and photon properties. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a series of CPP films by doping heterocyclic molecules with a chiral propionic acid group into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, achieving a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 68.4% under ambient conditions. The intermolecular interactions between the chiral isolated molecules and PVA simultaneously induce circularly polarized luminescence and enhance phosphorescence efficiency, thereby improving CPP performance. Moreover, the CPP lifetimes of the films can be rationally tuned from 1 to 944&#160;ms by subtle modification of heteroatoms on the heterocyclic chromophores. This study provides a promising approach to developing efficient CPP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics and bioelectronics.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Activity of Cu4 Clusters Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a tetranuclear copper cluster as a model, we modulated coordination microenvironments to boost electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance, uncovering atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity correlations and offering precise ligand&#8208;engineering strategies for advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Surface ligands play a crucial role in modifying catalytic environments and enhancing performance through various mechanisms. However, the multivariate synergistic mechanisms, dynamic evolution patterns, and universal design principles of ligand effects remain to be thoroughly investigated. Metal clusters, with their atomically precise structures, serve as ideal models for studying ligand regulation mechanisms. Herein, we synthesized two copper clusters of N,S&#8208;bidentate ligand&#8208;protected Cu4(PTI)4 and Cu4(BTT)4 featuring identical metallic core structures but distinct ligand architectures and evaluated their catalytic performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Notably, the Cu4(PTI)4 cluster with stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands achieved near&#8208;100% Faradaic efficiency at optimal potentials, significantly surpassing the Cu4(BTT)4. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we unveiled that enhancing the electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of ligands induces alterations in the local microenvironment and electronic structure of metal active sites, thereby exerting positive impacts on electrocatalytic NO3RR performance.

         <title>Transforming Single&#8208;Atom Site to Dual&#8208;Atom Site in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts: A Universal Strategy for Enhancing Durability in Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>

This work develops a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits highly active, selective, and strong H2O2 decomposition capability for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. 








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is the most promising non&#8208;noble metal oxygen reduction catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, their practical applications are still limited by unsatisfactory long&#8208;term stability. This is because the N atoms of the active FeN4 moiety are easy to protonate, leading to the leaching of Fe atoms, and the H2O2 generated during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process triggers the Fenton reaction, further accelerating the dissolution of Fe. To address these critical stability challenge, we developed a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. This is achieved by treating the presynthesized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in a H2/Ar atmosphere to break the C&#9472;N bonds near the FeN4 sites while introducing Fe and N precursors to form the Fe2N6 sites. Our theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the newly formed Fe2N6 sites are structurally more stable in acidic ORR and produce negligible H2O2 (&lt;1%). Therefore, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits an extremely low Fe demetalation ratio (0.61 at%) in 0.1&#160;M HClO4 after 80k cycling. More surprisingly, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst can effectively decompose H2O2 with a high decomposition rate of 15.7&#160;mmol min&#8722;1, approaching that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Pt/C catalyst (17&#160;mmol min&#8722;1). As a result, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst assembled PEMFC operates stably for 300&#160;h with only 7% current density attenuation, whereas that of the pristine Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst&#8208;based device declines by 84% within 100&#160;h.

         <title>Coherently Coupled Frustrated Lewis Pairs in In2O3&#8722;x Nanoclusters for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) were constructed on the graphitic carbon nitride support, leveraging the privileged hydrogen&#8208;bond sewing interface. Significantly, the built&#8208;in electric fields and particularly multisite architecture reshape the kinetic landscapes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The downstream reduction follows the formate pathway, which preferentially inhibits CO production while promotes CH4 formation. 








Abstract
Co&#8208;catalysts integration presents unique opportunities to enhance photoactivity, yet selectivity control and mechanistic understanding within multistep reactions remain fundamental challenges hitherto. In this study, a reshaped kinetic landscape is demonstrated over coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on carbon nitride matrix, which mediates directed CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion with a selectivity of 65.3% (electron basis). The hydrogen&#8208;bonded interface fosters intimate electronic coupling, generating built&#8208;in electric fields that facilitate cascade charge transfer processes. Particularly, exceptionally robust FLPs sites were identified within the sub&#8208;nanosized In2O3&#8722;x nanoclusters, in contrast to easily deactivated counterparts in oversized crystalline structures. These enduring FLPs sites confer privileged adaptive binding with CO2 and mutative C1 intermediates. Correlated in situ infrared and mass spectroscopic analyses track the formation of FLPs&#8208;CO2 adducts and highlight the predominance of formate (HCOO&#8722;) pathway, surpassing competitive CO evolution. This work opens inspiring prospects for exploring multielectron photochemistry and achievable metrics through distinctive FLPs topologies on sub&#8208;nanostructures.

&lt;p&gt;Coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) were constructed on the graphitic carbon nitride support, leveraging the privileged hydrogen-bond sewing interface. Significantly, the built-in electric fields and particularly multisite architecture reshape the kinetic landscapes in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The downstream reduction follows the formate pathway, which preferentially inhibits CO production while promotes CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation.

         <title>Improving Mass Transport and Charge Transfer in COF&#8208;Based Photocatalysts With Three&#8208;Dimensional Ordered Macropores for Benzylamine Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>

A one&#8208;step self&#8208;sacrificing template strategy enables the synthesis of 3DOM&#8208;COFs with ordered macropores. Coupled with ZnCdS, the resulting S&#8208;scheme heterojunction efficiently catalyzes benzylamine oxidation and H&#8322; evolution. The 3DOM structure accelerates mass transfer and charge transfer, enhancing overall photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown promise as photocatalysts for chemical transformations. However, their dense micropores and poor pore connectivity hinder mass transport and charge separation/transfer, limiting their efficiency. Herein, we develop a one&#8208;step self&#8208;sacrificing template strategy to synthesize three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous COFs (3DOM&#8208;COFs). This approach uniquely integrates in situ Tp&#8211;Tta COF crystallization with synchronized degradation of polystyrene templates under solvothermal conditions. This method introduces unreported kinetic match between template decomposition and framework growth. Such a confined growth mechanism leads to structurally robust and highly ordered macroporosity without post&#8208;processing. 3DOM architecture enables uniform dispersion of fine ZnCdS nanoparticles for the generation a 3DOM&#8208;COF based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, which exhibits remarkable performance in the oxidation of benzylamine (BA) for simultaneous N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine production with 99% selectivity at a rate of 15.1&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and H2 generation with a rate of 17.8&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. The 3DOM architecture confers 50&#8208;fold faster mass transport than bulk COFs, while the heterojunction facilitates directional charge separation and interface charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the heterojunction optimizes reaction thermodynamics by lowering the potential energy barriers of BA activation. The work pioneers a template&#8208;concurrent synthesis paradigm, resolving COFs' critical pore engineering challenges.

         <title>Merging One&#8208; and Multi&#8208;Photon Processes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Enhanced NIR Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal and Photochemical Conversions</title>

This work demonstrates a paradigm for the development of highly stable and multifunctional HOF materials to enable the full&#8208;spectrum utilization of sunlight, which is achieved through a dual&#8208;process mechanism involving one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitations, facilitated by direct absorption of NIR light within a single HOF platform, for synergistically enhanced performance in photothermal, photochemical, and chiroptical applications.








Abstract
Direct application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for solar&#8208;thermal and solar&#8208;chemical conversions is of emergent interest to improving efficiency in solar&#8208;energy utilization. Herein, we report a synthetic approach to NIR&#8208;responsive materials by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;1/2/3) from multifunctionalized Ru&#8208;components incorporating chiral, photoactive, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;stacking, and protonation/deprotonation subunits. Significantly, protonation of the imidazole&#8208;subunits in HOF&#8208;3 promotes densified packing to extend NIR absorption tail up to 1100&#160;nm with a narrowed bandgap of 1.41&#160;eV, meanwhile leads to spontaneous resolution of enantiomeric &#916;&#8208;/&#923;&#8208;HOF&#8208;3. Consequently, remarkably enhanced photothermal effect and photocatalytic performance, including chiroptical activity induced by circularly polarized NIR light, are achieved through synergy of direct one&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon NIR absorption, underscoring effectiveness to bring multifunctionalities into ordered HOFs for generation of robust and effective materials with multimode NIR responsiveness.

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;based Multiblock Copolymers from Cascade ROMP&#8208;RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ROMP&#8208;RAFT cascade polymerization strategy was designed to synthesize polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers, which were employed as compatibilizers to upcycle mixed plastics.








Abstract
Plastic disposal has become a serious environmental and social problem. Mechanical recycling of waste plastics is the most widely adopted strategy to address this issue, but if used to recycle mixed plastics, it usually requires the addition of amphiphilic block copolymers. Polyolefins account for almost half of all synthetic plastics, making them ubiquitous in the plastic waste stream. Within this perspective, polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers are highly desirable, but they are difficult to access using traditional strategies. In this contribution, a cascade ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization strategy was developed to prepare various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with tunable polar segments and microstructures. Using this strategy, tunable amounts of the trithiocarbonate RAFT agents were installed in the polyolefin main chain via ROMP. Subsequent chain extension of various polar vinyl monomers via controlled RAFT polymerization formed various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with high molecular weight and good physical properties. These multiblock copolymers were used to compatibilize and upcycle mixtures of high&#8208;density polyethylene/polymethyl methacrylate (HDPE/PMMA) and high&#8208;density polyethylene/polyethylene terephthalate (HDPE/PET).

A butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent molecular tracker is designed to make dynamic polymerization processes visible and colorful. In their Research Article (e202507770), Qi Zhang and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of a conformationally flipping fluorescent dye that senses subtle microenvironmental changes and emits multicolor fluorescence to visualize the dynamics in reversible polymerization of cyclic disulfides. This molecular optical tool enables a real&#8208;time and sensitive way to monitor polymeric systems.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Intracellular Delivery of Native Proteins by BioReversible Arginine Modification (BioRAM) on Amino Groups (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native proteins are typically not cell&#8208;permeable, making intracellular delivery a significant challenge. The cover image illustrates the model protein RNase A, which is transiently modified with polyarginine chains (orange) attached to lysine residues. In combination with the CPP&#8208;Additive technology, the resulting bioconjugate is able to translocate across the lipid membrane of human cells. Details are reported in the Research Article (e202506802) by Christian Hackenberger et&#160;al.

         <title>Anisotropy of Single&#8208;Crystal Semiconductors in Photo(electro)Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes how crystallographic anisotropy in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors governs light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactions, offering mechanistic insights and design guidelines for high&#8208;performance photo(electro)catalysts through material synthesis, theoretical modeling, and advanced characterization techniques.








Abstract
Anisotropy in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors has emerged as a key design principle for understanding and advancing photo(electro)catalytic systems. The exposure of well&#8208;defined facets in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors introduces anisotropic variations in atomic coordination, electronic structure, and surface energetics, giving rise to directional charge transport and facet&#8208;specific reactivity. Such intrinsic differences coordinate the entire photocatalytic process, from charge excitation and separation to interfacial reaction kinetics. In this regard, effective utilization of anisotropy requires clarifying its impact on electronic structure, charge transport, and interfacial reactivity, along with its sensitivity to microenvironmental changes under realistic operando conditions. In this review article, we systematically examine the role of crystallographic anisotropy in light harvesting, charge carrier dynamics, and surface reactivity. We summarize recent advances in anisotropic material design, trace the evolution of the concept, and provide mechanistic insights based on experimental studies, theoretical models, and advanced characterization techniques. We further discuss current challenges and propose strategies to guide the rational application of anisotropy in catalyst design, aiming to expand its scope across a broader range of photo(electro)catalytic systems.

         <title>Rational Design Strategies in DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in rational DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) design, focusing on fragment&#8208;based DELs, covalent DELs, and focused DELs. These innovations shift DELs from empirical screening to a more strategic, hypothesis&#8208;driven approach, enhancing hit quality and drug discovery efficiency.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have emerged as a powerful and cost&#8208;effective platform for high&#8208;throughput screening, enabling the rapid identification of small&#8208;molecule ligands against a wide range of biological targets. However, traditional DEL approaches often rely on empirical and broad&#8208;based library construction, which can lead to low hit rates, off&#8208;target interactions, and limited chemical diversity around pharmaceutically relevant motifs. Recent technological advances have sought to address these limitations, shifting DELs from a largely blind screening tool to a more rational and precision&#8208;oriented strategy. In this review, we systematically examine the evolution of DEL methodologies, with a particular focus on innovations in library design that enhance hit quality and screening efficiency. Specifically, we highlight the emergence of fragment&#8208;based DEL strategies for exploring chemical space with minimal structures, the incorporation of covalent warheads to enable irreversible binding to specific residues, and the development of focused DELs tailored to particular protein families or binding motifs. Together, these advances mark a shift from blind, empirical screening toward a more strategic and hypothesis&#8208;driven application of DEL technology.

         <title>Embracing Complexity: Peptides as Tunable Scaffolds in the Construction of Discrete Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent chirality, tunability, biocompatibility, and robustness of peptides provide an exciting opportunity for supramolecular chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore uses of peptides in discrete supramolecular systems, how chemists can draw inspiration from larger biological assemblies, and discuss how embracing the complexity of peptide secondary structures in the design of these systems provides opportunities for novel structures and functions.








Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has advanced rapidly, with scientists using fundamental understanding to generate function from simple building blocks. However, synthetic systems are still in their infancy when compared to biology. The increasing use of peptides in supramolecular structures provides a clear roadmap to more complex function, introducing chiral, information&#8208;rich building blocks from a readily available pool. Peptides have historically been incorporated as modular additions to discrete supramolecular architectures to interface with biological systems. More recently, supramolecular chemists have embraced the complexity of secondary and tertiary structures and peptides&#8217; intrinsic propensity for folding to enable the formation of supramolecular architectures built from peptides, leveraging their innate properties. We explore the urgent need to embrace complex, chiral, folded building blocks in discrete supramolecular architectures and illustrate how this will provide opportunities for novel functions and applications.

However, synthetic systems are still in their infancy when compared to biology. The increasing use of peptides in supramolecular structures provides a clear roadmap to more complex function, introducing chiral, information-rich building blocks from a readily available pool. Peptides have historically been incorporated as modular additions to discrete supramolecular architectures to interface with biological systems. More recently, supramolecular chemists have embraced the complexity of secondary and tertiary structures and peptides&#8217; intrinsic propensity for folding to enable the formation of supramolecular architectures built from peptides, leveraging their innate properties. We explore the urgent need to embrace complex, chiral, folded building blocks in discrete supramolecular architectures and illustrate how this will provide opportunities for novel functions and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of oxygen&#8208;doped graphene nanoribbons (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR) were synthesized on Au(111) via in situ formation of pyrans. Both O&#8208;doped GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors but exhibit different sensitivities to oxygen dopants, which is attributed to the difference in the density of states near the Fermi level between the substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts.








Abstract
Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen&#8208;doped GNRs (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, noncontact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O&#8208;doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron&#8208;GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, the band structure of O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2&#8208;hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.

         <title>Encapsulating Ionophores in Zeolite Imidazolate Framework&#8208;8 for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Ion Fluctuations in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, ionophore was encapsulated in zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticle for long&#8208;term ion recognition with high stability. The mechanical mismatch between implanted electrodes and brain tissue was addressed by sputtering gold nanoparticles (AuNP) on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers as a flexible electrode substrate. This study provides a versatile strategy for developing ion&#8208;selective microsensors that well meet the demands of long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring.








Abstract
Various ions in the brain (e.g., H+, K+, and Ca2+) play essential roles in neural information transmission and physiopathological processes. Real&#8208;time monitoring of these ions will provide critical information for understanding neural functions and diagnosing diseases. However, long&#8208;term monitoring the dynamics of ions with microelectrodes remains a challenge due to the limited availability of sensing strategies capable of in vivo measurements with high stability in the mechanically soft and chemically complex brain of freely moving rats. Here, we develop a flexible and stable ion&#8208;selective microsensor for long&#8208;term monitoring of ions in rat brain, in which zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles incorporated with ionophores are used for selective ion recognition and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers sputtered with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as the soft electrode substrate. The flexible microsensors allow long&#8208;term in vivo ion sensing with good stability in the brain of behaving rat, avoiding progressively deteriorating response of traditional polymer&#8208;based rigid ion selective microsensor caused by its instability interface and mechanical mismatch to soft brain tissue.

We introduce an all&#8208;in&#8208;one AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA platform, a novel, rapid, and automated method for absolute quantitation of influenza A and B viruses.

Abstract
Accurate nucleic acid quantification analysis (NQA) is crucial for disease treatment and prevention. However, existing digital NQA methods often lack sufficient automation and speed. In this study, we introduce a novel rapid and automated active&#8208;matrix digital microfluidics&#8208;based droplet digital recombinase polymerase amplification method (AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA). This method can quantify influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) within a mere 60&#160;min, covering the entire workflow from nucleic acid extraction to digital amplification, fluorescence detection, and statistical analysis. We fabricated an AM&#8208;DMF chip equipped with high&#8208;throughput electrodes and optimized its control logic. Leveraging an artificial intelligence droplet navigation algorithm, we successfully achieved motion and mixing operations of high&#8208;throughput droplets (4608 droplets, each with a volume of 0.9&#160;nL). A dual&#8208;target RPA system was designed to detect IAV and IBV, and its detection performance was fine&#8208;tuned. Experiments conducted with clinical samples revealed that this method exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity for single&#8208;molecule detection, with a detection limit of 1.69 copies per reaction, and it achieved 100% concordance with qPCR results. This groundbreaking quantification technology holds tremendous promise for advancing disease diagnosis, treatment, and fundamental research.

         <title>Multiactivity of Nanozyme Liposome Regulates the Homeostasis of Biochemical Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a biomimetic liposome (CeO2@M) with nanozyme multiactivity to regulate the homeostasis of microenvironment. Artificial liposomes with negatively charged liposomes, like endothelial membranes, reduce blood component adhesion. The CeO2 nanozyme hydrolyzes ATP/ADP, lessening platelet aggregation, and regulates the level of biochemical factors such as ROS to maintain the homeostasis of the microenvironment for tissue regeneration.








Abstract
In living systems, cascade reactions involving multiple enzymes, critical for regulating the biochemical microenvironment's homeostasis, are essential to transplantation remodeling. However, for ready&#8208;to&#8208;use purposes, designing and constructing therapeutic liposomes that replicate natural cell functions during the initial transplantation phase remains a significant challenge in synthetic biology for tissue engineering. Herein, we developed a biomimetic liposome with multienzymatic nanozyme activity to regulate proinflammatory factors induced by exogenous implants. The liposomes were fabricated through the self&#8208;assembly of artificial membranes on CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). These membranes, featuring a negatively charged surface analogous to endothelial cell (EC) membranes, effectively attenuate blood component adhesion and aggregation. The CeO2 nanozyme not only hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), reducing subsequent platelet aggregation, but also regulates biochemical microenvironment homeostasis, thereby promoting tissue regeneration.

     alt="Multiactivity of Nanozyme Liposome Regulates the Homeostasis of Biochemical Microenvironment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a biomimetic liposome (CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@M) with nanozyme multiactivity to regulate the homeostasis of microenvironment. Artificial liposomes with negatively charged liposomes, like endothelial membranes, reduce blood component adhesion. The CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme hydrolyzes ATP/ADP, lessening platelet aggregation, and regulates the level of biochemical factors such as ROS to maintain the homeostasis of the microenvironment for tissue regeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In living systems, cascade reactions involving multiple enzymes, critical for regulating the biochemical microenvironment's homeostasis, are essential to transplantation remodeling. However, for ready-to-use purposes, designing and constructing therapeutic liposomes that replicate natural cell functions during the initial transplantation phase remains a significant challenge in synthetic biology for tissue engineering. Herein, we developed a biomimetic liposome with multienzymatic nanozyme activity to regulate proinflammatory factors induced by exogenous implants. The liposomes were fabricated through the self-assembly of artificial membranes on CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (NPs). These membranes, featuring a negatively charged surface analogous to endothelial cell (EC) membranes, effectively attenuate blood component adhesion and aggregation. The CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme not only hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), reducing subsequent platelet aggregation, but also regulates biochemical microenvironment homeostasis, thereby promoting tissue regeneration. This work advances the development of cell-like entities capable of modulating signaling communication between living and abiotic interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>First Chiral Catalan Solid Based on Molybdenum Halide with Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Deep&#8208;Red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra was successfully synthesized via a solvothermal method. This unique Catalan solid structure exhibits efficient deep&#8208;red circularly polarized emission, enhanced stability, and improved photoluminescence quantum yield. The proposed system provides a novel platform for advancing the research on chiral metal halides and paves the way for their application toward chiral optoelectronics. 








Abstract
The design of novel chiral metal halides with exceptional chiroptical properties has attracted significant research attention due to their potential applications in chiral optoelectronics and spintronics. However, developing the deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters is still challenging. In this work, we presented the first chiral molybdenum halide clusters by incorporating chiral methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA) for the design of (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra, which adopt the unique Catalan solid structure. These chiral tetrakis hexahedra exhibit 24 unique 3c&#8208;2e Mo&#9472;Mo&#9472;Cl bonds, which are scarcely reported. Notably, these (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra demonstrated pronounced circularly polarized luminescence in the deep&#8208;red region, accompanied by an extended emission lifetime of 114.14 &#181;s at room temperature. Additionally, these chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra are optically stable for 3 months. The four&#8208;state spin sublevel model was employed to investigate the emission mechanism and found that the temperature&#8208;dependent exciton dynamics lead to the dual&#8208;band emission of the designed chiral tetrakis hexahedra. Our study expands the family of lead&#8208;free chiral metal halides and develops a novel strategy to design a high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;red CPL emitter.

         <title>Regiodivergent Photocatalytic Annulation for the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent photocatalytic annulation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea with olefins or bicyclobutanes (BCBs) has been developed. The regioselectivity is controlled by the proper choice of counteranion of the cationic iridium photocatalyst and solvent. This protocol enables straightforward access to diverse cyclic amino hydrocarbons, including functionalized bicyclic scaffolds of distinct three&#8208;dimensional architectures, with precise deployment of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene groups, cultivating a chemical space for bioisosteres.








Abstract
Regiodivergent synthesis is a powerful strategy for expanding chemical space. Given the significance of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules in pharmaceutical sciences, a regiodivergent [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea to olefins and [1.1.0]&#8208;bicyclobutanes was developed by employing cationic iridium complexes as photocatalysts under visible&#8208;light irradiation. By properly selecting a counteranion of the photocatalyst and tuning the reaction conditions, each regioisomeric cyclic hydrocarbon with a defined gem&#8208;difluoromethylene disposition was directly assembled with high selectivity. Mechanistic elucidation revealed the critical relevance of the basicity of the photocatalyst counteranion to the regiochemical outcome. The reaction diverges depending on the intervention of deprotonation of the initially generated urea radical cation by the pairing anion to form the corresponding neutral radical; this not only governs the regioselective ring opening of the cyclopropane moiety but also modulates the relative reactivity of the two resulting terminal carbon radicals, thereby dictating the dominant pathway.

         <title>Selective Phosphorylation of Phenols and Benzenediols by the Kinase PsiK and Variants Thereof</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PsiK from Psilocybe cubensis phosphorylates a diverse set of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate. High&#8208;throughput screening of active site mutant libraries using DESI&#8208;MS enabled protein engineering of PsiK, further expanding its substrate scope. The scalability of PsiK&#8208;catalyzed reactions was demonstrated, further highlighting its biocatalytic utility for selective phosphorylation.








Abstract
Phosphorylation plays important roles in biology by modulating the structure, reactivity, and biological function of a broad range of molecules. Biocatalytic phosphorylation has attracted attention from synthetic chemists due to its selectivity and mild reaction conditions using ATP as a phosphate donor. Given the potential synthetic utility of kinases with activity on small molecule substrates, we explored the activity of PsiK, the enzyme responsible for selective 4&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylation of 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine or psilocin in psylocybin biosynthesis by Psilocybe cubensis. We find that PsiK has good activity on a range of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate, enabling preparative phosphorylation of different substrates, and substantially expands the substrate scope of biocatalytic phosphorylation. We also show that active site mutations can further expand substrate scope and improve site&#8208;selectivity. This engineering effort was greatly expedited using DESI&#8208;MS screening, which enabled analysis of 2688 reactions in only 40&#160;min. Finally, gram&#8208;scale phosphorylation of a representative substrate was achieved with a turnover number over 10 000. Together, these results highlight the biocatalytic utility of PsiK and derivatives thereof for selective phosphorylation of phenols and benzenediols under mild conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Cathode Constructed Solely by Carbon Dots for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots are solely applied as the active cathode material in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries for the first time, which exhibit decent cycling performance, excellent capacity retention, and ultrahigh ion diffusion ability.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have been explored widely in the electrochemistry field, owing to their unique structures and rich properties. However, in the reported devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, CDs are always used as additives to modify the electrodes or regulate the electrolytes because they have been regarded as inert and low&#8208;capacity materials all along. Here, for the first time, o&#8208;phenylenediamine derived CDs are selected as the only protagonist to construct cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such CDs (p&#8208;CDs) have a special &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenazine&#8208;based structure, with carbon cores for electrical conductivity and active sites for embedding Zn2+ and H+. The p&#8208;CDs solely constructed cathode material delivers a superior capacity of 290&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and a decent capacity of 103&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 10&#160;A g&#8722;1, as well as an ultrahigh ion diffusion coefficient of 10&#8722;8&#160;&#8764;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;cm2 s&#8722;1. The p&#8208;CDs assembled ZIBs exhibit a stable long&#8208;term cycling, retaining 87.4% of the original capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles. Various characterizations and theoretical calculations prove that the electron&#8208;deficient N as the active sites on p&#8208;CDs can embed/release Zn2+ and H+ reversibly.

The p-CDs solely constructed cathode material delivers a superior capacity of 290&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a decent capacity of 103&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an ultra-high current density of 10&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as an ultrahigh ion diffusion coefficient of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&#8764;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The p-CDs assembled ZIBs exhibit a stable long-term cycling, retaining 87.4% of the original capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles. Various characterizations and theoretical calculations prove that the electron-deficient N as the active sites on p-CDs can embed/release Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reversibly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Building a Bridge Between Ambient MS and LC&#8208;MS by Non&#8208;Exhaustive Microdesorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential analysis strategy was developed to integrate rapid ambient mass spectrometry (MS) screening with LC&#8208;MS confirmation using a single solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) device. The approach involves an initial non&#8208;exhaustive microdesorption for ambient MS screening, followed by a second desorption for LC&#8208;MS confirmation of only the disputed samples. This workflow enhances throughput while maintaining sensitivity and minimizing matrix effects. The method has been applied for high throughput anti&#8208;doping test.








Abstract
Ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) offers rapid screening but faces challenges in analyzing complex samples due to high matrix effects. The absence of a separation step can also lead to false positives due to the isomers or isobars. In this study, a sequential analysis strategy which combines ambient MS and LC&#8208;MS based on the non&#8208;exhaustive microdesorption in solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) was developed for the first time. By combining coated blade spray (CBS)&#8208;MS with LC&#8208;MS, in the first step, a few microliters of solvent were used for non&#8208;exhaustive desorption with high enrichment factor for rapid screening by CBS&#8208;MS. For the suspicious samples, the remaining analytes on the SPME coating undergo exhaustive desorption, then followed by LC&#8208;MS confirmation. The matrix&#8208;compatible coating used in the SPME device significantly reduces matrix effects while enhancing sensitivity through analyte enrichment. This method is environmentally friendly, utilizing only a few microliters of organic solvents for screening. The approach was rigorously validated, both theoretically and experimentally, and successfully applied to anti&#8208;doping testing, enabling detection of 53 prohibited substances in urine samples by integrating CBS&#8208;MS with LC&#8208;MS.

         <title>Precise Molecular Engineering of Heptamethine Cyanine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Type&#8208;I Photosensitizers for Pro&#8208;Death Autophagy and Hypoxia&#8208;Tolerant Antitumor Treatment</title>

This study presents precise molecular engineering for conversion of typical heptamethine cyanine dye into a good type&#8208;I photosensitizer. The optimized molecular can produce hydroxyl radicals by electron transfer and alkyl radicals by H&#8208;abstraction reaction. These radicals can induce ferroptosis and necroptosis, providing a crucial strategy for hypoxic solid tumors therapy. 








Abstract
Heptamethine cyanine (Cy7) dyes have excellent near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging capability but competitively inhibit the photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect, especially in hypoxic solid tumors. In this study, a series of aryl&#8208;ketone&#8208;modified Cy7 derivatives (ACy) were constructed to transform Cy7 into a type&#8208;I photosensitizer capable of both hydrogen (H)&#8208;abstraction and electron transfer for the first time. The introduction of an aryl&#8208;ketone group at the C3 position of Cy7 imparted it with H&#8208;abstraction capability and enhanced its intersystem crossing efficiency. Moreover, an increase in the steric hindrance of the aryl&#8208;ketone group promoted the efficiency of the H&#8208;abstraction reaction and electron transfer process. Optimized molecules, 3ACy&#8208;3ipr, not only exhibited bright fluorescence but also generated hydroxyl and alkyl radicals upon NIR light irradiation. These radicals induced mitochondrial autophagy in hypoxic tumor cells, eventually leading to necrosis and ferroptosis. Tumor targeting peptide modified liposomes were used to construct nanocarriers to improve the biocompatibility and tumor retention of 3ACy&#8208;3ipr, which fluoresces at the tumor site and significantly inhibited the growth of solid tumors via PDT. This study provides an excellent platform for the precise development and clinical utilization of NIR theranostic agents.

         <title>Regioselective C&#9472;H Functionalization by the Combination of Enzymatic and Chemocatalytic Reactions in Water</title>

H3CP contributes to sustainable synthesis by integrating regioselective enzymatic halogenation, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling, and enzymatic hydrolysis. TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M micelles enable the Pd&#8208;catalyzed step, allowing seamless compatibility with enzymatic reactions in one vessel under aqueous conditions. Using this platform, diverse simple aromatic substrates are readily transformed into valuable acrylic acid building blocks.








Abstract
The combination of bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often&#8208;high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo&#8208;enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic Halogenation, chemo&#8208;catalytic Heck coupling, and an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Hydrolysis reaction (H3 Catalytic Platform&#160;=&#160;H3CP) in a single reaction vessel. H3CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross&#8208;coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super&#8208;molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H3CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.

         <title>Sustainable Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Polyester Waste Using Reconstructed Defective&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical recycling of polyester waste is a sustainable circular economy strategy. Here, we report a strategy for closed&#8208;loop recycling of polyester waste catalyzed by a reconstructed defective&#8208;MOF (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) under mild conditions. The sustainability assessment results verify the ecological, resource, and health advantages of closed&#8208;loop recycling as well as the feasibility of the circular economy.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of polyester waste presents a promising strategy for achieving a sustainable circular economy. However, the development of efficient, low&#8208;cost recycling methods that minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions remains challenging. Here, we report an approach for depolymerization polyester waste to bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) using a reconstructed metal&#8211;organic framework (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) catalyst under mild conditions. The r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT exhibited a space&#8208;time yield of 1035.8 gBHET gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 190&#160;&#176;C. Importantly, this is an order of magnitude higher than that reported for similar MOF&#8208;based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the depolymerization pathway involves the activation of oxygen and ethylene glycol adsorbed on r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT, forming nucleophilic intermediates. These intermediates then facilitate the cleavage of the polyester C&#9472;O bond through nucleophilic attack, thereby gradually generating the BHET product. Sustainability evaluation results validated the circular economy feasibility of the recycling approach, with a minimum sales price (MSP) of 498 $/ton, much lower than the MSP of the traditional petroleum&#8208;based production route (1000 $/ton). The approach also achieved a 61% reduction in energy use and a 52% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This work provides a sustainable solution for managing polyester waste accumulation.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 190&#160;&#176;C. Importantly, this is an order of magnitude higher than that reported for similar MOF-based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the depolymerization pathway involves the activation of oxygen and ethylene glycol adsorbed on &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT, forming nucleophilic intermediates. These intermediates then facilitate the cleavage of the polyester C&#9472;O bond through nucleophilic attack, thereby gradually generating the BHET product. Sustainability evaluation results validated the circular economy feasibility of the recycling approach, with a minimum sales price (MSP) of 498 $/ton, much lower than the MSP of the traditional petroleum-based production route (1000 $/ton). The approach also achieved a 61% reduction in energy use and a 52% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This work provides a sustainable solution for managing polyester waste accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A dynamic crystalline bio&#8208;based nanofiber membrane is constructed via a rigid&#8208;flexible coupled supramolecular network strategy. The nanofiber membrane exhibits a three&#8208;stage fracture mechanism during the stress process. demonstrating exceptional mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based polyurethanes are promising sustainable elastomers whose polymeric network structure has a decisive impact on their properties. However, existing bio&#8208;based polyurethanes face challenges in simultaneously enhancing mechanical strength and toughness. Inspired by the multilevel heterogeneous structure of articular cartilage, we propose a bionic design strategy of rigid&#8208;flexible coupled supramolecular cross&#8208;linking networks to prepare bio&#8208;based polyurethane elastomers with enhanced strength and toughness. By incorporating the asymmetric coupling of rigid furan rings and flexible aliphatic side chains into the molecular chains, a dynamic hydrogen bond network with a gradient distribution of bond energy was constructed, achieving uniform microphase separation between the soft phase (amorphous) and the hard phase (crystalline). Nanofiber membranes were fabricated by rigid&#8208;flexible coupled polyurethane electrospinning, where the microphase&#8208;separated structure is further transformed into dynamic crystalline domains. Under external force, multilevel energy dissipation is achieved through the breaking and controllable recombination of hydrogen bonds within the crystalline domain. resulting in polyurethane nanofiber membranes with significantly enhanced mechanical strength and toughness (fracture strength: 31.37&#160;MPa, fracture strain: 731.04%, toughness: 102.13&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). This network design strategy expands the potential of bio&#8208;based elastomers in smart wearable textiles, flexible electronic devices, and biomedical applications, thereby advancing the development of sustainable high&#8208;performance polymers.

         <title>Controlled Electrocatalytic Glycerol Upgrading to Glyceraldehyde in Near Neutral Media by Cobalt Oxide Lattice Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co3O4 lattice activation mechanism is proposed by introducing Ru single atom into the Co tetrahedral (CoTd) site, which switches the rate determining step (RDS)&#160;from reconstruction to adsorbed electrophilic oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (AOM&#8208;HAT) process and resultantly enhancing both glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) activity and glyceraldehyde (GAD) selectivity in neutral media.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol driven by renewable electricity offers a greatly attractive green way to produce value&#8208;added chemicals at much reduced global carbon footprint. However, achieving both the enhanced activity and selectivity for the most&#8208;valuable C3 product&#8208;glyceraldehyde (GAD) of glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) in neutral media, though of great importance, is extremely challenging. In this work, we propose a Co3O4 lattice activation mechanism by introducing single atom Ru (0.36&#160;wt%) into the tetrahedral sites (CoTd) of Co3O4 lattice to significantly elevate the GOR activity and the GAD selectivity. The as&#8208;constructed Ru&#8208;Co3O4/NF only needs 1.16&#160;V to achieve the current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 during GOR and maintains &#8764;60% GAD selectivity (&#8764;90% for C3 products) over a broad potential window, which are the highest reported in near neutral media. This excellent performance has been demonstrated to originate from the introduction of Ru atoms, which activates the lattice active sites of Co3O4 by promoting the rapid reconstruction of the catalyst to generate sufficient Co3+&#8208;(OH)ads electrophilic oxygen species, resulting in not only the accelerated GOR kinetics, also largely enhanced selectivity of GAD by the adsorption configuration regulation of glycerol primary alcohols (C&#945;&#8208;OH) favoring the primary alcohol oxidation pathway.

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Mediated Luminophore Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The choice of anion selectively directs the solution&#8208;state aggregation of a cationic luminophore, dictating its photoluminescence. Some anions cause emission from a monomeric state, some induce excimer formation, and others lead to dimers, while the triflate counterion gives multichromatic emission from all three species.








Abstract
Emissive organic salts have long been integral to the discovery of fluorescence phenomena and functional luminescent dyes. Typically, one component of the salt acts as the photoactive unit (luminophore) and its nonemissive counterion is selected to independently tune bulk physical properties, such as solubility. However, the impact of counterion choice on the aggregation and resulting emissive state of organic salts in solution has not been widely investigated. Here, we report that a single cationic luminophore gives rise to either monomer, dimer, excimer, or multichromatic emission under otherwise identical conditions by varying only its counterion. We employ N&#8208;methyl quininium (MeQn+) as a permanently charged cationic luminophore, which we pair with a series of monovalent anions. At low solution&#8208;state concentrations, all the salts give identical absorption and emission spectra that correlate with the MeQn+ monomer. However, at higher concentrations, the emission, excitation, and absorption data differ, revealing the presence of monomer, dimer, excimer, or all three, depending on the structure of the anion. Understanding and modulating the formation of dimeric or other well&#8208;defined aggregated species by specific ion effects could be exploited in the design of molecular probes for biological systems or emissive thin&#8208;film dispersions for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Orchestrating Penta&#8208;Element Interplay in Gradient&#8208;Porous Carbons for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between the active sites induced by promete and the Na+ storage capacity as well as anion adsorption/desorption has been established through a combination of electrochemical analysis, machine learning potentials, and molecular dynamics simulations, which enhances the kinetics and capacity balance of anode and cathode for sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) offer a cutting&#8208;edge synergy between battery&#8208;level energy density and supercapacitor&#8208;like power density, yet face critical challenges in balancing the kinetic and capacity mismatch between Faradaic anodes and capacitive cathodes. Herein, we present a penta&#8208;element doped gradient&#8208;porous carbon (PE&#8208;GPC) with a nanosphere architecture, engineered with high&#8208;entropy principles and a gradual pore density variation to enhance mass transport and charge storage. Operando spectroscopy and machine learning potentials unveil a concerted penta&#8208;element interplay: thiophene&#8208;like S configurations mediate dynamic redox processes, enabling pseudocapacitive Na&#8314; and anion storage, while fluorine functionalities foster a self&#8208;rejuvenating NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), stabilizing long&#8208;term cycling. Meanwhile, the synergistic N/B/P triad engineers a hierarchical defect network that enhances electronic conductivity and fine&#8208;tunes ion adsorption energetics. This orchestrated interplay empowers the SIHC full cell with a high energy density of 196&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a formidable power density (10.4&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1), and an impressive 88.2% capacity retention after 9000 cycles. By establishing a high&#8208;entropy stabilization paradigm, this work paves the way for multi&#8208;ion storage architectures, offering a universal strategy to bridge the charge&#8208;transfer imbalance in advanced energy devices.

         <title>Branched&#8208;Selective Functionalization of 2&#8208;Alkyl Aziridines Through Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl aziridines was reported, enabling unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling and defluorinative coupling via cleavage of the more hindered and less favored C&#9472;N bond. This strategy also enables a novel remote desaturation reaction of aziridines through a unique &#8220;self&#8208;terminated&#8221; chain&#8208;walking process. This work offers a modular approach to different alkenyl amine derivatives.








Abstract
Overriding the inherent substrate&#8208;controlled regioselectivity in aziridine activation holds significant potential. It could enable previously inaccessible disconnections from these readily available, strained heterocycles, facilitating the diverse synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing products. In this study, we present a Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl (and 2,2&#8208;dialkyl) aziridines, leading to unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling with styrenes and reductive defluorinative coupling with trifluoromethyl alkenes. In addition to enabling the functionalization of the N&#8208;adjacent sites of aziridines, this catalyst&#8208;controlled activation strategy triggers an unprecedented reaction framework for aziridines, namely, the remote desaturation via ring&#8208;opening. Notably, detailed mechanistic studies demonstrate the operation of a rare &#8220;self&#8208;terminated&#8221; chain&#8208;walking process, offering a flexible method for remote desaturation that generates alkenyl amines with varying chain lengths. Overall, this study provides a modular approach to access a wide range of alkenyl amine derivatives.

Zwitterionic pnictinidenes: A new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species stabilized by bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate ligands is reported, enabling the isolation of Sb and Bi in multiple oxidation states. These thoroughly characterized systems exhibit cationic character and engage in redox catalysis, facilitating catalytic hydrodefluorination and dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes, expanding the scope of main group redox chemistry.








Abstract
Herein, we describe a new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species with bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate as ligands, enabling the isolation of stable Sb and Bi species in multiple oxidation states. Computational analysis of zwitterionic pnictinidenes revealed their cationic character at the metal centre while holding unique electronic properties that contribute to their nucleophilicity and stability. These systems participate in oxidative addition and reductive elimination processes, and display redox catalytic activity in hydrodefluorination reactions, marking a unique example of cationic pnictinidene catalysing a redox transformation and providing reactivity beyond the constraints of pincer ligands. Additionally, we report on a novel dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes. This work expands the scope of low&#8208;valent pnictogen chemistry, providing a novel platform for main group redox catalysis.

         <title>Highly Crystalline and Oriented Thin Films of Fully Conjugated 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a fully conjugated, 3D covalent organic framework (COF) based on cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh); the synthesis employs modulated conditions to achieve thin films with high crystallinity. The COTh&#8208;1P COF shows potential for optoelectronic applications, thanks to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, the preferential film orientation, and charge dynamics insights obtained from optical pump terahertz probe studies.








Abstract
Fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a newly emerged class of materials that expands reticular chemistry to extended electron delocalization for optoelectronic applications. To overcome the limitations of sp3&#8208;connected 3D frameworks, the pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral motif cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) has gained attention for forming fully conjugated 3D COFs. We report on a novel COTh building block, featuring functional formyl groups directly attached to the core's conjugated thiophenes. The modulation synthesis approach with mono&#8208;functionalized inhibitors enables the formation of COTh&#8208;1P COF, which exhibited remarkable crystallinity and permanent porosity. By following this approach and by optimizing the synthesis conditions for the solvothermal growth of thin films, we fabricated the first preferentially oriented conjugated 3D COF films on various substrates without pre&#8208;functionalization. With these thin films, optical pump terahertz probe studies allowed us, for the first time with 3D&#8208;fully conjugated COFs, to provide insights into the excited state and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics of these unique organic frameworks. Low effective masses are discovered for valence and conduction bands by density functional theory simulations. The ability to create crystalline and oriented films of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COTh&#8208;based COFs on non&#8208;modified substrates is expected to open the way for integration of such frameworks into diverse optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Dynamic Active Site Evolution in Lanthanum&#8208;Based Catalysts Dictates Ethane Chlorination Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
LaOCl&#8208;catalyzed C2H6 chlorination offers a low&#8208;carbon route for polyvinyl chloride synthesis, yet structural evolution occurs under Cl2 conditions. We establish structural sensitivity in La&#8208;catalyzed chlorination, and elucidate the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of LaCl3 and the role of hydroxyl groups in overchlorination, highlighting stabilization of LaOCl and hydroxyl chemistry modulation as key design principles to break selectivity limitations.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated chlorination of ethane presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) synthesis, yet selectivity toward 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane remains challenged by uncontrolled over&#8208;chlorination. Lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) has emerged as a promising catalyst, but its structural dynamics under Cl2&#8208;rich conditions and the origin of selectivity loss remain elusive. Here, we integrate advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations to address this knowledge gap. Our findings unveil a sequential LaOCl&#160;&#8594;&#160;LaCl3 transformation that dictates product distribution shifting from 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane to trichloroethane. Mechanistic insights reveal that surface hydroxyl groups, generated during catalyst chlorination, promote bidentate adsorption of 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane via hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, thereby activating C&#9472;Cl over&#8208;chlorination. Additionally, by employing Al2O3&#8208;supported LaCl3 model catalysts, the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of the LaCl3 species is demonstrated. The bonding of interfacial oxygen with monolayer&#8208;dispersed LaCl3 species generates empty 4f&#8208;states above the Fermi level, creating strong Lewis acid sites that stabilize Cl radicals and selectively convert chloroethane to 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. In contrast, aggregated nanoparticles are inactive due to their inability to stabilize chlorine radical. Our findings establish important structure sensitivity in lanthanum&#8208;catalyzed chlorination and provide guiding principles for catalyst design, highlighting the importance of stabilizing metastable LaOClx species and modulating surface hydroxyl chemistry to overcome selectivity limitations.

&lt;p&gt;LaOCl-catalyzed C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; chlorination offers a low-carbon route for polyvinyl chloride synthesis, yet structural evolution occurs under Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions. We establish structural sensitivity in La-catalyzed chlorination, and elucidate the size-dependent chlorophilicity of LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the role of hydroxyl groups in overchlorination, highlighting stabilization of LaOCl and hydroxyl chemistry modulation as key design principles to break selectivity limitations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical-mediated chlorination of ethane presents a low-carbon alternative for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) synthesis, yet selectivity toward 1,2-dichloroethane remains challenged by uncontrolled over-chlorination. Lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) has emerged as a promising catalyst, but its structural dynamics under Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich conditions and the origin of selectivity loss remain elusive. Here, we integrate advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations to address this knowledge gap. Our findings unveil a sequential LaOCl&#160;&#8594;&#160;LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; transformation that dictates product distribution shifting from 1,2-dichloroethane to trichloroethane. Mechanistic insights reveal that surface hydroxyl groups, generated during catalyst chlorination, promote bidentate adsorption of 1,2-dichloroethane via hydrogen-bond networks, thereby activating C&#9472;Cl over-chlorination. Additionally, by employing Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-supported LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; model catalysts, the size-dependent chlorophilicity of the LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; species is demonstrated. The bonding of interfacial oxygen with monolayer-dispersed LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; species generates empty 4f-states above the Fermi level, creating strong Lewis acid sites that stabilize Cl radicals and selectively convert chloroethane to 1,2-dichloroethane. In contrast, aggregated nanoparticles are inactive due to their inability to stabilize chlorine radical. Our findings establish important structure sensitivity in lanthanum-catalyzed chlorination and provide guiding principles for catalyst design, highlighting the importance of stabilizing metastable LaOCl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species and modulating surface hydroxyl chemistry to overcome selectivity limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Turnover Frequency in the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrous Oxide to Dinitrogen at a Binuclear Copper Complex of 3,5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazole</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by nitrous oxide reductase, a binuclear copper complex supported by carbon black was utilized for the electrocatalytic N&#8322;O reduction under ambient conditions. The binuclear Cu center enables exceptionally high turnover frequency and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for the electrochemical N&#8322;O reduction.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone&#8208;depleting substance. Electrocatalytic N2O reduction (e&#8208;N2ORR) is a promising approach to remove N2O from the air under ambient conditions. However, developing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free e&#8208;N2ORR electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and turnover frequency (TOF) remains a challenge because of the weak binding of N2O and the high kinetic barrier for deoxygenation reaction. In this work, inspired by the multinuclear copper active site of nitrous oxide reductases, a binuclear copper complex of 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole supported on carbon black of Ketjenblack (CuHdatrz/KB) was utilized for the e&#8208;N2ORR at pH 13 and 298&#160;K. CuHdatrz/KB achieves a high FE of&#160;&#8776;&#160;100% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for the e&#8208;N2ORR to N2 and TOF up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;700&#160;h&#8722;1, which is one&#8211;two orders of magnitude higher than those of the previously reported molecular&#8208;based catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that Cu(II) ions of CuHdatrz/KB are reduced to Cu(I) keeping the binuclear core, suggesting that the multinuclear copper active site is crucial to efficiently catalyze the e&#8208;N2ORR like the nitrous oxide reductase.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Dearomatization of Naphthalene and Anthracene with Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes Through Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated intramolecular dearomatization strategy of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with anthracene and naphthalene was reported. Bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks could be obtained and (1,2,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs was achieved through this strategy along with further transformations. Mechanistic studies have shown that the key singlet biradical intermediate leads to the generation of two products, and the substituent on BCBs bridgehead position play a decisive role in product selectivity. 








Abstract
Cyclization of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) is an effective way to construct saturated polycyclic 3D structures. Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular dearomative reaction to forge bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks through (1,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs. Moreover, the unprecedented (1,2,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs through 1,4&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process was also realized along with the further transformations. The mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction was initially carried out by an energy transfer (EnT) process and the key open&#8208;shell singlet biradical intermediate may undergo [4&#960;&#160;+&#160;2&#963;] cycloaddition or 1,4&#8208;HAT process leading to the formation of two products and we found that the selectivity of product is related to the substituents at the BCBs bridgehead position. Our findings are supported by control experiments, deuterium labeling and kinetic studies, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Angularly Resolved Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We find that the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal (TERS) is angularly distributed and vibrational mode specific. The radiation pattern in the back focal plane (BFP) of vertical or parallel Raman dipoles is strongly influenced by the near&#8208;field in the TERS nanogap, while the emission is guided into the far&#8208;field with high directionality by the tip&#8208;sample antenna; however, with significant differences in the emission angle, intensity, and the divergency.

Abstract
Despite intensive research in tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), the angular distribution of Raman scattering in the TERS gap remains experimentally unreported leaving its relevance to the TERS signal formation to be seldomly discussed. Here, we investigate the angular distribution of the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal in the Fourier plane using a model system composed of flat&#8208;lying cobalt (II) hexadecafluoro&#8208;phthalocyanine (CoPcF16) molecules physically adsorbed on a smooth gold surface. Both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational modes are observed, where the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Raman modes at about 678 and 740&#160;cm&#8722;1 have different angular intensity distributions than those of in&#8208;plane Raman modes at 1309 and 1373&#160;cm&#8722;1. We interpret the angular spectrum of the TERS signal considering the molecular vibrational modes computed with density functional theory (DFT) for the free and gold&#8208;deposited molecule, and the directed Raman scattering by the gap&#8208;mode predicted by finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulations. We contend that the TERS gap directs the Raman vibrational modes differently, leading to distinct angularly distributed Raman scattering intensities. These findings emphasize the nonnegligible role of the TERS detection scheme in understanding spectral features, such as the relative peak intensity ratio variations for studying molecular orientations, or for monitoring chemical reactions.

         <title>Introducing Steric Bulk Into Silylboranes: Enhanced Bench Stability and Novel Chemical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following initial experimental and theoretical studies that indicated that silylboranes decompose via oxygenation, bulky silyl anions were used to synthesize silylboranes with enhanced bench stability and novel reactivity. These kinetically stabilized silylboranes are stable in air and moderately activate carbon monoxide (CO) to form spirocyclic compounds. DFT calculations suggested that the activation of CO is driven by hyperconjugation.








Abstract
Silylboranes are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, and a wide range of structural variants of silylboranes have already been synthesized. However, the stability of silylboranes varies significantly, and their decomposition mechanism remains to be fully understood. Moreover, some silylborane motifs have not yet been applied as synthetic reagents due to their instability. To address this issue, we first investigated the decomposition mechanism of silylboranes in air and moisture using experimental and theoretical methods. We discovered that oxygenation by atmospheric oxygen is the major decomposition pathway, resulting in the formation of a borylsilylether, and that the introduction of a bulky silyl group suppresses this decomposition. Based on these results, we synthesized triisopropylsilyldimesitylborane (i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2), which exhibits high bench stability. Moreover, i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2 reacts with carbon monoxide (CO), which is the first example of a reaction between a silylborane and CO. Further computational studies revealed that electronic effects, including hyperconjugation between the Si&#9472;B &#963;&#8208;bond and C&#9472;O &#960;*&#8208;bond, are crucial for CO activation. Furthermore, we prepared a bench&#8208;stable bissilylaminoborane by introducing triisopropylsilyl groups, providing a bissilylchloroborane upon hydrogen chloride treatment.

     alt="Introducing Steric Bulk Into Silylboranes: Enhanced Bench Stability and Novel Chemical Reactivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following initial experimental and theoretical studies that indicated that silylboranes decompose via oxygenation, bulky silyl anions were used to synthesize silylboranes with enhanced bench stability and novel reactivity. These kinetically stabilized silylboranes are stable in air and moderately activate carbon monoxide (CO) to form spirocyclic compounds. DFT calculations suggested that the activation of CO is driven by hyperconjugation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silylboranes are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, and a wide range of structural variants of silylboranes have already been synthesized. However, the stability of silylboranes varies significantly, and their decomposition mechanism remains to be fully understood. Moreover, some silylborane motifs have not yet been applied as synthetic reagents due to their instability. To address this issue, we first investigated the decomposition mechanism of silylboranes in air and moisture using experimental and theoretical methods. We discovered that oxygenation by atmospheric oxygen is the major decomposition pathway, resulting in the formation of a borylsilylether, and that the introduction of a bulky silyl group suppresses this decomposition. Based on these results, we synthesized triisopropylsilyldimesitylborane (&lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8211;BMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which exhibits high bench stability. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8211;BMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with carbon monoxide (CO), which is the first example of a reaction between a silylborane and CO. Further computational studies revealed that electronic effects, including hyperconjugation between the Si&#9472;B &#963;-bond and C&#9472;O &#960;*-bond, are crucial for CO activation. Furthermore, we prepared a bench-stable bissilylaminoborane by introducing triisopropylsilyl groups, providing a bissilylchloroborane upon hydrogen chloride treatment. These findings provide valuable insights into how steric and electronic effects can be used to optimize the balance between stability and reactivity in silylboranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Bending and stretching effect provoked by the repeated application of 385&#8208;nm radiation (purple) and 475&#8208;nm radiation (blue) on sulfur microcrystals.








Abstract
Here, we describe the synthesis and photo&#8208;responsive properties of 2D cyclo&#8208;octasulfur microcrystals (&#945;&#8208;S8 MCs), produced using a quick, simple, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method. Controlled 385&#8208;nm irradiation of these crystals induces an immediate, reversible, and sustained bending effect. The time required for the crystals to return to their initial shape is significantly reduced when exposed to 475&#8208;nm light, completing the entire excitation&#8208;relaxation cycle in less than 2 s. Moreover, this process can be repeated up to 50 times as long as the crystals remain in water. The dependence of recovery time on light wavelength is rationalized qualitatively via highly correlated quantum&#8208;chemical calculations of the absorption spectra of S8 chains. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of ring&#8208;to&#8208;chain and chain&#8208;to&#8208;ring transformations: the breaking of &#945;&#8208;S8 rings by 385&#8208;nm radiation induces bending in the &#945;&#8208;S8 MCs, while the excitation of the chains with 475&#8208;nm light facilitates an accelerated recovery process, allowing the S8 molecules to swiftly regain their ring shape. Thus, our study demonstrates that &#945;&#8208;S8 MCs represent intelligent actuators as light&#8208;controlled molecular muscles with the simplest inorganic composition reported to date.

A pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system enables asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes, providing a highly efficient approach to make biologically significant &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Direct enantioselective &#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes is a significant organic transformation, which may provide a highly efficient strategy to make bioactive chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve this reaction due to the interference of the reactive NH2 group, potential [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition side reaction and complicated stereoselective control. Carbonyl catalysis is an effective strategy to activate glycinate by forming an imine to facilitate the conjugate addition. With a pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system, direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C conjugate addition of glycinate to nitroalkenes has been successfully developed for the first time, producing a broad range of chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 98% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, 98% ee). The products can be easily converted into various biologically significant chiral molecules maintaining the same enantiopurity.

         <title>Decoy DNA Protects Molecular Tension Probes from DNase Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based probes are rapidly degraded by DNases in live&#8208;cell environments, limiting their use. We introduce a decoy DNA strategy, where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA acts as a competitive substrate for DNases, protecting functional DNA probes and significantly extending their stability for long&#8208;term live&#8208;cell studies.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular probes are essential tools for visualizing and quantifying mechanotransduction at the single&#8208;molecule level. However, their application in live&#8208;cell environments is severely limited by DNase&#8208;mediated degradation, which shortens probe lifespan and introduces false&#8208;positive signals. Here, we present a decoy DNA strategy where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA competitively binds DNases, effectively preserving functional DNA probes. This approach extends probe stability from 1&#8211;2 h to beyond 24 h, substantially improving signal integrity in live&#8208;cell tension imaging. In contrast to structurally modified nucleic acids, decoy DNA can be readily applied to existing DNA probe systems, enabling seamless integration without the need for additional validation or calibration. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy provides a generalizable framework for stabilizing DNA&#8208;based molecular tools in DNase&#8208;rich environments, enabling high&#8208;precision mechanobiology studies across diverse cell types and extended experiment durations.

         <title>Counterintuitive Photochemistry of an Isolated Acridinyl Radical: ConPET via Preassembly, Solvated Electrons or a Long&#8208;Lived Excited State?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we isolate the reduced form of a commonly used acridinium photocatalyst (acridinyl, Acr&#8226;) and investigate its photochemistry using transient absorption, analysed alongside TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We show that despite the apparent long lifetime of the fluorescent state of Acr&#8226;, it is not relevant to reactivity. Instead, reactivity occurs through counterintuitive preassembly and solvated electron&#8208;based mechanisms.








Abstract
Photoredox chemistry has seen a dramatic rise in popularity in recent years, but mechanistic understanding has persistently lagged behind reaction development itself. This is particularly true for the emerging area of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (conPET), which has attracted both great interest due to its ability to activate inert substrates selectively and under mild conditions and continuing controversy over its mechanistic feasibility. We describe herein the isolation of the key radical intermediate state of an acridinium&#8208;based conPET catalyst and detailed investigations of its photochemistry by a suite of (photo)reactivity, photoluminescence and transient absorption techniques, supported by computational studies. We observe strong wavelength and solvent dependencies in the reactivity profile, which correlate well with observations of a long&#8208;lived, fluorescent excited state that would be compatible with diffusion&#8208;limited reactivity. However, photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies suggest that, counter&#8208;intuitively, this state does not actually participate in reactivity. Instead, changes occur far faster than the diffusion limit, which provides strong, direct evidence for preassembly of the photocatalyst and substrate prior to photoexcitation. Further inspection also indicates parallel formation of solvated electrons, likely providing the major pathway under previously reported synthetic conditions, suggesting that otherwise competing rationales for conPET can in fact operate simultaneously.

We report a novel and versatile self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional polymer brushes under ambient conditions with exceptional oxygen tolerance. By introducing a bimetal CuZn alloy, the system self&#8208;adaptively regulates the dissociation of copper species, ensuring robust and controllable polymer brush growth across a wide range of distances between the bimetallic alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate.








Abstract
We report herein a self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (SI&#8208;BMCRP) for fabricating various polymer brushes using microliter volumes under ambient conditions. The introduction of bimetal CuZn alloy can self&#8208;adaptively control the dissociation of copper species while still realizing the controllability of polymer brush growth with high oxygen tolerance at a wide range of distances between the bimetal alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate. The successful fabrication of multiscale and multifunctional polymer brushes with high&#8208;end group fidelity and patterned architectures further demonstrates the robust nature of SI&#8208;BMCRP. The resultant polymer brushes show great potential for new applications in moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation, breath monitoring, and speech recognition.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Native Proteins by BioReversible Arginine Modification (BioRAM) on Amino Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioreversible Arginine Modification of amine&#8208;containing protein residues (termed BioRAM) allows the serum&#8208;compatible, readily accessible, and efficient delivery of native proteins into live cells. Combined with cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP) additives, BioRAM results in intracellular RNase A activity at nanomolar concentrations, thus enabling the cellular delivery of native protein cargoes without additional genetic engineering. 








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based tools are emerging as innovative solutions to interfere with biological pathways in molecular biology and medicine. They offer advantages over traditional small molecules due to their adaptable structural diversity and their ability to engage previously inaccessible cellular targets. However, most proteins do not penetrate the lipid bilayer of mammalian cells and are therefore restricted to extracellular targets. Despite recent advances, a general method for the delivery of functional proteins into human cells remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a bioreversible protein modification strategy of amines using short arginine&#8208;containing peptides (termed BioRAM) that enables cytosolic delivery starting from genetically non&#8208;engineered proteins. We optimized the bioconjugation strategy to achieve fast intracellular cleavage and complete recovery of the native protein. In combination with our previously established cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;additive protocol, we show superior delivery of fluorescent protein and functional RNase A into the cytosol, achieving physiological response. Moreover, we are able to demonstrate the excellent performance of BioRAM in the presence of serum, thereby broadening the scope for intracellular applications of functional proteins.

         <title>Sequential Reconstruction of Calicheamicin &#947;1I Iodo&#8208;Thiobenzoate by Selective Carrier Protein Trapping Reveals a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Iodinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic synthesis of the iodo&#8208;thiobenzoate of calicheamicin &#947;1I was reconstituted in vitro from malonyl&#8208;CoA, involving the orsellinate biosynthesis by CalO5 and subsequent modifications by CalO6, CalO3, CalO2, and CalO1. A TEV site was introduced into CalO5, enabling the successful detection of the intermediate or product attached to the ACP domain through intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometric analysis.








Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) play important roles in natural product biosynthesis, particularly chlorinases and brominases. Apart from ubiquitous mammalian iodination in thyroxine biosynthesis, iodinated natural products are extremely rare, and enzymes responsible for iodination are even less well described. A notable exception is calicheamicin &#947;1I, a potent antitumor compound containing an aromatic iodide, for which a halogenase has been proposed to mediate iodine incorporation. Despite predictions regarding the enzymes involved in iodinated aryl ring biosynthesis, experimental evidence remains limited due to challenges in substrate identification and reaction monitoring. In this study, we successfully reconstituted the enzymatic activities required for iodination and all embellishments of the highly substituted benzene ring in calicheamicin &#947;1I. Using intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometry combined with protease cleavage, we demonstrated formation of the orsellinate thioester followed by sequential C&#8208;2 O&#8208;methylation, C&#8208;5 iodination, C&#8208;3 oxidation, and C&#8208;3 O&#8208;methylation. This research characterizes the first flavin&#8208;dependent iodinase that acts on a carrier protein&#8208;dependent substrate, identifies the natural substrates of a cytochrome P450 oxygenase and two O&#8208;methyltransferases, and provides valuable insights for biocatalysis. Additionally, these findings could facilitate the engineering of other polyketide biosynthetic pathways and contribute to optimizing fermentation conditions to generate new calicheamicin derivatives.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Supported Ru&#8211;Ni: A Common Active Site for Hydrolysis, Hydrogen Oxidation, and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuNi&#8208;Ti3C2 catalyst was utilized to investigate the activation and conversion of hydrogen. RuNi&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibits outstanding activity in AB hydrolysis, HOR, and phenylethylene tandem reaction, especially TOF of AB hydrolysis up to 1833 min&#8722;1.








Abstract
Insights into the activation and conversion of hydrogen using a single&#8208;mode catalyst are crucial for advancing fuels and fine chemical production. In this paper, the activation and conversion of H2 molecules in hydrogen production and application were investigated on RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe)&#8208;MXene catalysts. RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe) bimetallic nanoclusters were uniformly distributed on Ti3C2 MXene. The optimal Ru2.5Ni2.5&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibits the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1833 min&#8722;1 toward ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalysts also showed good catalytic activity in hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The high activity originates from the acceleration of the catalytic process by RuNi clusters&#8208;Ti3C2 and the promotion of H2 molecular transport by the special interface of RuNi cluster&#8208;MXene. The RuNi clusters&#8212;Ti3C2 with multisites provide a dependable platform for the regulated activation and conversion of H2 molecules and various reaction intermediates. The competitiveness of nanocluster&#8208;MXene catalytic material is showcased for activation and conversion of hydrogen. This research of reaction&#8208;inducing adaptation uncovered the pathway to explore multifunctional catalysts in energy, chemistry, and materials applications.

Two unprecedented redox&#8208;active, low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;triradical complexes, [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;S&#8226;&#8722;)3]&#183;NHC&#9552;S (1&#183;NHC&#9552;S; E&#9552;S) and [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;Se&#8226;&#8722;)3] (2; E&#9552;Se) have been synthesized and structurally characterized by SCXRD. They were further characterized spectroscopically using IR, Raman, EPR, and UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. The low&#8208;spin electronic configuration of the central Fe(III) ion (1) and the nature of the magnetic interaction between the Fe(III) center and the three unpaired electrons in 1 have been investigated by magnetic measurements. In addition, the bonding stability and electron density distribution in 1 were studied by quantum chemical calculations and correlated with experimental results. Finally, a series of well&#8208;defined functional homopolymers were synthesized via catalytic polymerization reactions using [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;S&#8226;&#8722;)3] (1) as a catalyst at ambient temperature. These reactions yielded poly(N, N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA), poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), and poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) with low dispersities ranging from 1.2 to 1.22. The successful synthesis of various diblock copolymers confirmed excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity of the synthesized homopolymers. These homopolymers and diblock copolymers highlight the versatile catalytic polymerization reactions of these Fe&#8208;radical complexes. Herein, we present a report on the polymerization of various acrylamides and methacrylates using a redox&#8208;active Fe&#8208;dithiolene complex for the first time.

         <title>Hybrid Cathode Interlayer Engineering Enables Over 20% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy is developed by using polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine as a guest material to improve the photovoltaic performance of the perylene&#8208;diimide cathode interlayer. Benefitted from the improved ohmic contact, interfacial compatibility, and carrier dynamics of PDINN:F16CuPc, a remarkable efficiency of 20.17% is achieved in the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device, which is higher than that of the control PDINN&#8208;based device with an efficiency of 19.29%.








Abstract
The capability of cathode interlayer (CIL) in regulating the conductivity, interfacial dipole, and work function of the electrode plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). The widely used perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs suffered from the inbuilt limitation of finite conductivity and poor thickness tolerance. To address this issue, we develop a universal strategy to finely optimize the functionality of perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;type CIL (PDINN) by incorporating polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) derivative to form a hybrid CIL. It is found that the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between PDINN and CuPc can address the solvent processability issue of CuPc used as CIL. The incorporation of CuPc in the PDINN layer leads to better film morphology, increased conductivity, and reduced cathode work function, enabling greater CIL thickness tolerance and significantly improved photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Notably, the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device using PDINN:F16CuPc as hybrid CIL yields a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.17%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 19.29% for the control device based on PDINN CIL. Particularly, this strategy demonstrates a universality in multiple photoactive layers and various perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs, offering an effective approach to developing highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Engineered C&#8211;N Lyases for Stereoselective Synthesis of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
EDDS lyase was subjected to iterative cycles of site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screened for increased activity for the addition of 2&#8208;((methylamino)methyl)aniline to fumarate. The final mutant, EDDS lyase CEA, accepts various N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylmethanamines derivatives, yielding N,N&#8208;disubstituted L&#8208;aspartic acids, as well as several ortho&#8208;substituted anilines, producing N&#8208;arylated L&#8208;aspartic acids.








Abstract
Optically pure N&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acids are valuable chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and agrochemicals. Ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8208;disuccinic acid lyase from Chelativorans sp. BNC1 catalyzes the addition of a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic primary amines to fumarate, producing the corresponding enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted L&#8208;aspartic acids. In this work, the enzyme was subjected to iterative cycles of site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screened for increased activity for the addition of 2&#8208;((methylamino)methyl)aniline to fumarate. The final variant displayed an activity of three orders of magnitude higher compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme. Unexpectedly, the enzyme catalyzed the hydroamination of fumarate with the aliphatic secondary amine of the starting substrate, rather than with the aromatic primary amine, leading to the formation of a tertiary amine. Exploring the substrate scope showed that the enzyme accepts various substituted N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylmethanamines for the hydroamination of fumarate, yielding N,N&#8208;disubstituted L&#8208;aspartic acids in high optical purity (up to &gt;99% ee). Furthermore, we showed that the enzyme accepts several ortho&#8208;substituted anilines that were previously not accepted by the wild&#8208;type enzyme, yielding the corresponding N&#8208;arylated L&#8208;aspartic acids in high enantiomeric excess (&gt;99% ee). This serendipitous finding enables a new strategy for the biocatalytic synthesis of tertiary amines, unlocked within the C&#8208;N lyase toolbox.

We propose the novel concept of the application of donor&#8211;acceptor porous aromatic framework (named as PAF&#8208;310) constructed from two types (n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type) storage blocks to accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics in potassium ion batteries, which shows the impressively electrochemical properties at room and low&#8208;temperature (even &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C) with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage mechanism.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;310) using p&#8208;type phenazine (PZ) and n&#8208;type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low&#8208;temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF&#8208;310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1) at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, PAF&#8208;310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low&#8208;temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 130.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C at 0.2 A g&#8722;1). Even at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, PAF&#8208;310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1). Moreover, various in/ex&#8208;situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co&#8208;storage mechanism of K+ and PF6&#8722; in PAF&#8208;310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low&#8208;temperature stabilized PIBs.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Red Algal Diterpene Peyssonnosol in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two terpene synthases derived from Anaerolineae bacteria catalyse the biosynthesis of peyssonnosene&#8208;type diterpenes from red algae. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis enabled a partial functional switch, resulting in the formation of additional byproducts. The intricate cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
Two diterpene synthases (DTSs) for peyssonnosol and peyssonnosol B were discovered in bacteria. Their enzyme mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, yielding biosynthetically related molecules that gave important insights into the terpene cyclisation cascade. In the present case, several mechanisms in line with the isotopic labelling experiments could be formulated. Only an extended experimental approach in combination with computational chemistry ultimately resulted in a refined mechanistic model.

         <title>Controlling Assembly of Hybrid DNA Nanostructures into Higher&#8208;Order Structures via Hydrophobicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We harness hydrophobic interactions, fundamental in biology yet underutilized in DNA nanotechnology, to build a design framework for hierarchical DNA assemblies. By conjugating small hydrophobic molecules to DNA motifs, we controlled the formation of higher&#8208;order structures, moving beyond traditional Watson&#8211;Crick pairing.








Abstract
Hydrophobic interactions are one of the fundamental driving forces of self&#8208;assembly in living systems. It remains challenging to harness hydrophobicity to have a controllable and programmable assembly of DNA nanostructures. On the other hand, there is also a need to explore orthogonal hierarchical assembly strategies to be used as an additional toolset along with the traditional Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing to achieve complex superstructures. In this work, we rationally design and synthesize a series of low molecular weight hydrophobic molecules that are conjugated to single&#8208;stranded DNA strands. By incorporating these modified DNA strands into the precisely defined locations of DNA tiles and origami nanostructures, we achieve controlled hierarchical assembly driven by hydrophobic interaction. We demonstrate a versatile hydrophobicity&#8208;guided higher&#8208;order assembly strategy by employing strategically engineered DNA nanostructures of increasing complexity, ranging from simple DNA tiles to complex origami structures, functionalized with these small hydrophobic molecules as programmable building blocks.

         <title>Resiquimod&#8208;Induced Nanovaccine (RINV) for Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the dual roles of resiquimod (R848) as both an immune stimulant and a structural unit, this study conjugates R848 onto fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer to develop an antigen carrier G5&#8208;R848. G5&#8208;R848 forms stable nanovaccines with OVA model antigen or tumor lysates and facilitates cytosolic antigen delivery. The nanovaccines demonstrate potent DCs maturation and cross&#8208;presentation and elicit significantly increased tumor antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell responses.








Abstract
Cancer nanovaccines have emerged as a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy due to their capability of eliciting robust tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. However, structural complexity and insufficient spatiotemporal coordination of immune activation pose substantial challenges for optimizing the therapeutic potential of nanovaccines. Herein, a resiquimod&#8208;induced nanovaccine (RINV) is devised for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) was covalently conjugated to fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer through a disulfide linker to obtain the vaccine carrier G5&#8208;R848. In this design, R848 not only fulfills its biological role as a vaccine adjuvant but facilitates uniform nanovaccine formation with the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) due to its distinctive chemical structure. Redox&#8208;triggered intracellular R848 release further promotes cytosolic delivery of antigen and subsequent antigen cross&#8208;presentation. In vivo studies demonstrated that the nanovaccine induces remarkable prophylactic and therapeutic effects in the B16F10&#8208;OVA melanoma model. Moreover, G5&#8208;R848 forms personalized nanovaccines by complexing with cell lysates from resected B16F10 and 4T1 tumor tissues, effectively inhibiting postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Bonnadiene and ent&#8208;Polytrichastrene B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B has been accomplished. An enantioselective redox&#8208;relay Heck alkenylation was used to form the stereocenter at C7. The unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic structure was constructed via [5+2] cycloaddition. The functionalities in the spirotricycle have been strategically utilized to append the remaining moieties present in the natural product in a sequential manner. Moreover, two Fe&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes were employed to reduce the unactivated tetrasubstituted olefin and to construct the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring.








Abstract
We report herein the first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B, two diterpenoids that share a common spirotricyclic skeleton. Notably, ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B also features a highly strained, sterically congested tetrasubstituted cyclopropane moiety, presenting significant synthetic challenges in both its construction and stereochemical control. The synthesis features: (1) palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective redox&#8208;relay Heck alkenylation between electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenyl triflate and primary alkenol to form the stereocenter at C7; (2) diastereoselective intramolecular [5+2] cycloaddition to rapidly assemble the unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic skeleton; (3) sequential installation of the requisite alkyl groups and alkenes present in the targeted molecule by leveraging the functionalities positioned on the tricycle; (4) Fe&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;initiated hydrogenation to stereospecifically reduce the tetrasubstituted &#916;10,11 olefin and install the contiguous stereocenters; (5) Fe&#8208;mediated HAT&#8208;initiated 3&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization to rapidly forge the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring with excellent stereoselectivity.

         <title>Tunable Endo/Exo Selectivity in Direct Catalytic Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions with Polyfunctional Lewis Acid / Azolium&#8211;Aryloxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept for catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with iminoesters employs modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide betaine catalysts, controlling endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selectivity through adjustments of metal center, azolium, and sterics. DFT studies reveal an almost perfect spatial fit of functional sites, enabling precise orchestration of the catalytically relevant moieties involved&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis.








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions (1,3&#8208;DCA) using iminoesters as ylide precursors offer a powerful approach to accessing stereochemically complex, biologically relevant pyrrolidines. Although previous studies have already achieved impressive stereoselectivities, catalytic productivity remains a challenge, with turnover numbers (TON) typically below 20. In this article, we introduce a novel concept for catalytic 1,3&#8208;DCA that enables remarkable productivity for both endo (TON up to 4000) and the more challenging exo products (TON up to 1500). This approach, making use of modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide catalysts, allows for precise control over endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity. The switch from endo&#8208; to exo&#8208;selectivity is accomplished by modifying the metal center, the azolium moiety, and steric factors. As detailed DFT studies reveal, both the endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selective catalyst systems exhibit an almost perfect spatial alignment of their key functional sites, allowing for a unique interplay of Br&#248;nsted acids and bases, Lewis acids, and hydrogen bonding. The computational studies further demonstrate that these polyfunctional catalysts dramatically lower the energetic barriers of the concerted or stepwise cycloaddition key steps.

     alt="Tunable Endo/Exo Selectivity in Direct Catalytic Asymmetric 1,3-Dipolar Cycloadditions with Polyfunctional Lewis Acid / Azolium&#8211;Aryloxide Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel concept for catalytic asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with iminoesters employs modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium-aryloxide betaine catalysts, controlling endo- and exo-selectivity through adjustments of metal center, azolium, and sterics. DFT studies reveal an almost perfect spatial fit of functional sites, enabling precise orchestration of the catalytically relevant moieties involved&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions (1,3-DCA) using iminoesters as ylide precursors offer a powerful approach to accessing stereochemically complex, biologically relevant pyrrolidines. Although previous studies have already achieved impressive stereoselectivities, catalytic productivity remains a challenge, with turnover numbers (TON) typically below 20. In this article, we introduce a novel concept for catalytic 1,3-DCA that enables remarkable productivity for both &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; (TON up to 4000) and the more challenging &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; products (TON up to 1500). This approach, making use of modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium-aryloxide catalysts, allows for precise control over &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-diastereoselectivity. The switch from &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;- to &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity is accomplished by modifying the metal center, the azolium moiety, and steric factors. As detailed DFT studies reveal, both the &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-selective catalyst systems exhibit an almost perfect spatial alignment of their key functional sites, allowing for a unique interplay of Br&#248;nsted acids and bases, Lewis acids, and hydrogen bonding. The computational studies further demonstrate that these polyfunctional catalysts dramatically lower the energetic barriers of the concerted or stepwise cycloaddition key steps. However, they also precisely orchestrate and accelerate all accompanying transformations&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic machineries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Origin of Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structures in Siloxane Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxane electrolytes exhibit anion&#8208;rich solvation structures due to their large steric hindrance. The lower Pauli repulsion of Si&#9472;O bond compared to C&#9472;O bond leads to higher intrinsic stability than corresponding ethers.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. Siloxane electrolytes exhibit excellent performance in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Herein, the mechanisms responsible for the Li metal compatibility and high&#8208;voltage resistance of siloxane electrolytes were probed by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental characterizations. Siloxane electrolytes have been demonstrated to deliver anion&#8208;rich solvation structures, which are induced by weak Li ion (Li+)&#8211;solvent interactions and strong Li+&#8211;anion interactions. The silicon (Si)&#9472;oxygen (O) bond energy of siloxane is larger than that of carbon (C)&#9472;O of C&#8208;siloxane (replacing Si atoms in siloxane with C atoms) because the atomic radius of Si is larger than that of C, and the Pauli exclusion of Si is smaller than that of C. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that the decomposition of siloxane produces substances containing Si&#9472;O fragments on Li metal surfaces, which is beneficial for interfacial stability. This work reveals the mechanism of interfacial stability and intrinsic stability of siloxane electrolytes, providing a theoretical basis for the practical application of siloxane electrolytes in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Divergent Upcycling of Polystyrene into Phenol and Hydroquinone Derivatives by Photocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel divergent upcycling of PS to high value&#8208;added phenol and hydroquinone derivatives by photocatalysis and electrocatalysis with high chemical selectivity. This method operates under 1 atm air and room temperature with an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful depolymerization of real&#8208;life polystyrene (PS) using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, highlighting its promising potential for the chemical recycling of PS waste.








Abstract
The selective upcycling of polystyrene (PS) waste into value&#8208;added aromatics has emerged as a compelling strategy toward sustainable plastic valorization, drawing significant scientific and industrial interest. While most existing methods involved oxidative C&#9472;C bond cleavage predominantly yield benzoic acid, the direct conversion of waste PS into phenolic compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first example of photocatalytic upcycling of PS into phenol derivatives with high chemoselectivity. This economical method proceeds under ambient conditions (1 atm air and room temperature) using an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The use of strong acid effectively suppresses the formation of benzoic acid, playing a critical role in high selectivity. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cis configuration of neighboring phenyl rings in PS raises the barrier for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from the benzylic C&#9472;H bond, thereby contributing to the low polymer conversion. Furthermore, the novel divergent upcycling of PS to hydroquinone derivatives was achieved by a photo&#8208;electro tandem strategy. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by depolymerization of real&#8208;life PS using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, underscoring its promising potential for sustainable and scalable upcycling of PS waste.

         <title>Tunable Oxygen Vacancy Clusters Enhanced Catalytic Activity of CeO2 Nanorods on CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and halogen&#8208;free strategy for CO2 cycloaddition is achieved using CeO2 nanorods enriched with oxygen vacancy clusters. The Ce3+ ions and lattice oxygens in the vicinity of the vacancy clusters construct abundant frustrated Lewis pair sites, which boost substrate adsorption and activation, reduce reaction energy barriers, stabilize intermediates, and accelerate product desorption.








Abstract
Constructing heterogeneous halogen&#8208;free catalysts featuring efficiently activated CO2 and epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via an atom&#8208;economical route is significant but remains a big challenge. In this work, we develop an atmosphere&#8208;assisted strategy for preparing mesoporous CeO2 nanorods with tunable oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations, which boosts the performance of CO2 cycloaddition. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis elucidates that oxygen vacancy clusters regulate the dynamic equilibrium of the multiscale structure of CeO2 via a synergistic &#8220;compression&#8208;expansion&#8221; mechanism. Furthermore, the high concentrations of oxygen vacancy clusters form abundant frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) sites, which remarkably promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 with epoxides. Thus, the performance of CO2 cycloaddition was substantially intensified. A 95% yield of cyclic carbonate was obtained when the reaction was conducted with RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 at 110&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the kinetic properties and the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition on FLP sites in RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 were investigated based on the in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts with tunable FLP sites for the efficient activation and conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals by modulating oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Hollow Microreactors with Catalytic Nanobrushes for Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated living CDSA endows the engineering of the surface of hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures and enables specific inner&#8208;outer spatial isolation of various catalytic species on tailored microreactor. Notably, the microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes and internal Pt&#8208;Ni alloys revealed prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine (95.4% sel.).








Abstract
Micro/nanoreactors with hollow structures have traditionally focused on the design of the internal catalytic microenvironment, while precise engineering of their external surfaces at a nanoscale level is particularly rare. Here, we develop a unique approach to elaborately engineer the surface of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;based hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures that serve as an external catalytic platform. This involves the anchoring of high&#8208;density micellar brushes onto the epidermis of ZIF&#8208;8 via surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, followed by the rapid capture of multiple species to fabricate the catalytic nanobrushes. Such a nanoscale fluff&#8208;like surface in combination with an internal cavity that encapsulates other functional components enables specific spatial isolation of various catalysts. The resultant microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes for esterification and internal Pt&#9472;Ni alloys for hydrogenation reveals prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine with a high selectivity of 95.4%. Remarkably, the microreactor decorated with PW12 nanobrushes can greatly prompt the catalytic efficiency of esterification with the inhibited competition from the hydrogenation reaction. Overall, this work provides an innovative guidance for the rational creation of multifunctional microreactors with fine surface nanostructures.

This involves the anchoring of high-density micellar brushes onto the epidermis of ZIF-8 via surface-initiated living crystallization-driven self-assembly, followed by the rapid capture of multiple species to fabricate the catalytic nanobrushes. Such a nanoscale fluff-like surface in combination with an internal cavity that encapsulates other functional components enables specific spatial isolation of various catalysts. The resultant microreactor with external PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; nanobrushes for esterification and internal Pt&#9472;Ni alloys for hydrogenation reveals prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine with a high selectivity of 95.4%. Remarkably, the microreactor decorated with PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; nanobrushes can greatly prompt the catalytic efficiency of esterification with the inhibited competition from the hydrogenation reaction. Overall, this work provides an innovative guidance for the rational creation of multifunctional microreactors with fine surface nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Length Ratio&#8208;Driven Configurational Modulation of Heteroleptic Pd6L6L&#8217;6 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By systematically modulating the ligand length ratio (r) between the two types of ligands in the octahedral heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 cages, the local steric hindrance of each triangular face was altered. This subsequently adjusted the energy difference between the Type&#8208;A and Type&#8208;B isomers, ultimately driving a directional transformation of the cage configuration.








Abstract
Biomolecular configurational modulation is essential for maintaining the stability and functionality of biological systems. Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, we present a strategy to modulate the configurations of heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 cages by systematically varying the ligand length ratio (r). Although theoretical analysis suggests that these Pd6L6L'6 assemblies could adopt up to 48 possible configurational isomers, we successfully modulated the thermodynamic preference between two dominant configurations (Type&#8208;A and Type&#8208;B) by implementing energetic differentiation through careful optimization of r. Specifically, the system exclusively forms Type&#8208;A cages at r&#160;=&#160;1.0, whereas Type&#8208;B becomes the predominant configuration when r&#160;&#8805;&#160;1.4. Control experiments demonstrate that the introduction of bulky steric groups does not induce configuration changes. This research offers valuable insights and serves as a useful reference for the design and configurational modulation of heteroleptic cages.

         <title>Overcoming Challenges in Small&#8208;Ring Transfer: Direct Decarboxylative Hydroalkylation of Alkenes via Iron&#8208;Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a catalytic approach for the direct decarboxylation of challenging CF3&#8208;cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl carboxylic acids using cooperative iron&#8208;thiol catalysis. This strategy enables the efficient generation of valuable radicals that can be incorporated into activated and unactivated alkenes, offering access to elusive chemical space. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive mechanistic studies, supported by experimental, spectroscopic, and DFT data, which offer insights into radical stability in small&#8208;ring systems.








Abstract
Cyclopropanes, especially those substituted with trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups, are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Their enhanced bioavailability contributes to the widespread presence of this motif in a variety of bioactive compounds. Despite the development of multiple synthetic strategies, a direct method for transferring CF3&#8208;containing small rings from their most abundant carboxylic acid surrogates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we overcome the challenging decarboxylation of CF3&#8208;cyclopropyl and CF3&#8208;cyclobutyl carboxylic acids while leveraging the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited state of photochemically activated iron complexes. The resulting radicals were then engaged in radical addition to alkenes, followed by a timely hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by a thiol donor. This efficient iron&#8208;thiol cooperative catalysis enables, for the first time, facile hydroalkylation of alkenes with highly reactive CF3&#8208;containing cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl radicals. Synergistic experimental, spectroscopic, and density functional theory (DFT) studies support the proposed reaction mechanism. Additionally, we employed the radical stabilization energy (RSE) scale, developed using isodesmic equations computed at the DFT level, aiming to provide a better understanding of the reluctant radical decarboxylation of small&#8208;strained cycloalkanes.

         <title>Chirality Unbound in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a method to wind chiral graphene nanoribbons into either right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices, depending on the functional groups that adorn their edges. These helically wound graphene nanoribbons act as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to their chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.








Abstract
In this manuscript, we report the first demonstration of controlled helicity in extended graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We present a wealth of new graphene nanoribbons that are a direct consequence of the high&#8208;yielding and robust synthetic method revealed in this study. We created a series of defect&#8208;free, ultralong, chiral cove&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons where helical twisting of the graphene nanoribbon backbone is tuned through functionalization with chiral side chains. S&#8208;configured point chiral centers in the side chains transfer their chiral information to induce a helically chiral, right&#8208;handed twist in the graphene nanoribbon. As the backbone is extended, these helically twisted graphene nanoribbons exhibit a substantial increase in their circular dichroic response. The longest variant synthesized consists of an average of 268 linearly fused rings, reaching 65&#160;nm in average length with nearly 10 full end&#8208;to&#8208;end helical rotations. The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&#949;| value of 6780 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 550&#160;nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Tailored Molybdenum&#8211;Nickel Catalyst Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation and Suppresses Parasitic Oxygen Reduction for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;tailored MoNi4 alloyed catalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) showing high hydrogen oxidation activity but low oxygen reduction activity in alkali has been developed. Such dual functionality tackles the issue of reverse&#8208;current decay&#8212;the harmful potential jump from parasitic anodic oxygen reduction during startup/shutdown events. When integrating into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell, this catalyst demonstrates superior corrosion resistance and durability compared with the Pt/C counterpart over repeated startup/shutdown cycles.








Abstract
Numerous existing strategies struggle to mitigate reverse&#8208;current decay (RCD) during startup and shutdown in polymer electrolyte fuel cells to avoid cathode corrosion, but the added system complexity and cost are drawbacks. Here, we report that modification of a molybdenum&#8211;nickel alloy through the doping of copper enables a non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) that efficiently catalyzes hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) while catalytically inactive toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, making it ideal for fuel&#8208;cell anode because the instantaneous interfacial potential jump originated from the parasitic ORR during device startup/shutdown can be surmounted. The catalyst, when assembled in the anode of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell, manifests substantially improved corrosion&#8208;resistant ability compared with that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt/C) catalyst. The basis for the achieved performances reveals to be the copper dopants that increase the hydrogen bonding of interfacial water for enhanced HOR, yet weaken molecular oxygen adsorption while stabilizing hydroxyl adsorption for ORR suppression.

A unique photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated floating catalytic platform based on the rationally designed Janus aerogel has been explored to maximize sunlight utilization and overcome inherent kinetics/mass transport limitations of bifunctional oxygen reactions in neutral triphase systems, enabling a new class of full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery to achieve ultrahigh energy efficiency. It is unveiled that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically improve oxygen reaction kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates the adsorption energetics optimization of reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Harnessing natural resources (solar, seawater) to explore next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage is an intriguing yet challenging task. Here, we establish a unique floating photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated catalytic platform based on engineered Janus aerogel that overcomes inherent mass transport/kinetics constraints in neutral triphase oxygen reaction systems to enable a full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery with ultrahigh energy efficiency. Our approach employs in situ region&#8208;selective assembly of the rationally designed fluorinated donor&#8211;acceptor polymers on carbon&#8208;nanotube aerogel (FMTAPPC), creating a new floatable FMTAPPC photoelectrode with asymmetric wettability, superior photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;response, and bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) catalysis. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration enables floating FMTAPPC to maximize sunlight utilization for interface micro&#8208;environment regulation and adsorbate binding optimization via photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activation while satisfying paradoxical wetting requirements of OER/ORR, which tunes reaction kinetics and intermediate energetics to remarkably promote both OER/ORR in neutral media. Under sunlight, floating FMTAPPC delivers large current densities for both OER/ORR&#8211;3&#8211;4 fold&#8208;enhancement over dark conditions. This enables the seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air battery to simultaneously improve charge/discharge performance at high rates and deliver ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 128.2%&#8212;surpassing most photo&#8208;assisted batteries. Mechanistic studies unveil that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically boost OER/ORR kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates intermediate energetics optimization, substantially lowering reaction energy barriers.

         <title>Spring&#8208;Like Behavior in [8]Helicene Diimides: How Helical Pitch Governs Optical Anisotropy and Electronic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the imide nitrogen atoms of [8]helicene diimides with different alkyl chains allows for precise control over the helical pitch of their backbones. This has a profound impact on the molecular packing, chiroptical properties, and through&#8208;space electronic conjugation of the molecules. As a result, this approach enables fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of this new class of materials with enhanced optical anisotropy and electronic communication.








Abstract
Helicenes, with their corkscrew&#8208;shaped geometry, have emerged as prototypical molecular springs for engineering chiral functional materials through precise structural modulation. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of [8]helicene diimides ([8]HDIs) and demonstrate that the helical pitch of their backbone can be precisely tuned by bridging the imide nitrogen atoms with alkyl chains of varying lengths (C3&#8211;C6). This approach constrains the molecular geometry to systematically control optical anisotropy, chiroptical response, and electronic communication. Remarkably, modulation of the helical pitch leads to high optical dissymmetry factors (up to 6.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and enhanced through&#8208;space conjugation. Furthermore, we investigate how variations in the helical pitch affect crystal packing in both enantiopure and racemic samples. Complementary quantum chemical calculations provide insights into the origins of these properties, highlighting the potential of this strategy for designing advanced chiral materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Hole&#8208;Selective Molecules for UV&#8208;Resistant High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

We develop a thiophene&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayer, referred to as Me&#8208;TPCP, which serves as the hole&#8208;selective layer for inverted perovskite solar cells. Me&#8208;TPCP demonstrates exceptional ultraviolet stability, superior hole extraction, and effective defect passivation capabilities. Consequently, we achieve a remarkable efficiency of 25.62% with excellent ultraviolet, operational, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced degradation, particularly occurring at the buried interface, has emerged as a significant stability challenge, severely limiting the widespread applications of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we rationally design and synthesize novel thiophene&#8208;modified self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated hole&#8208;selective molecules, namely (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;TPCP), affording UV&#8208;stable high&#8208;efficiency PSCs. Simultaneously incorporating phenyl and thiophene groups enhances molecular conjugation, effectively protecting the fragile bonds between the carbazole core and the phosphonic acid group. This modification results in enhanced intrinsic UV stability and improved hole transport ability of the molecule. Furthermore, thiophene grafted on the carbazole coordinates with the Pb2+ ions in perovskite, enhancing the binding of perovskite to hole&#8208;selective molecules. Consequently, the crystallinity of the perovskite film is significantly improved, along with decreased defect density, thereby inhibiting its degradation under UV light illumination. By introducing methyl groups, the molecular stability is further enhanced, and the energy level of Me&#8208;TPCP is finely tuned, resulting in a lower interfacial energy barrier that facilitates more efficient hole extraction. With these advantages, inverted PSC devices based on Me&#8208;TPCP achieve a significantly higher efficiency of 25.62% than the control devices (23.85%). Meanwhile, these devices demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in UV stability, as well as improved operational and thermal stability.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D COFs)&#160;was developed with a cyt topology, facilitating the uniform dispersion and full exposure of distinct metal sites. The resulting TAPP&#8208;OFPc&#8208;COFs demonstrate exceptional electrocatalytic performance in urea oxidation. The Fe&#8211;Ni bimetallic sites synergistically ensure high efficiency and cycle stability.








Abstract
Porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile scaffolds for developing high&#8208;performance photo&#8208; and electrocatalysts. By enabling precise anchoring of metal species onto their cores, these COFs allow for meticulous tuning of chemical and electronic properties, facilitating single&#8208;atom distribution and achieving outstanding catalytic performance. However, the majority of these COFs are restricted to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures, where the catalytic activity of the metal centers is often compromised due to eclipsed stacking layers, limiting their optimization potential. To address this challenge, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with a cyt topology. This innovative structural arrangement facilitates the atomic&#8208;level distribution of distinct metal species across steric exposed networks, and the synergistic effect of bimetallic sites leads to exceptional electrocatalytic activity in urea oxidation reactions with a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at just 1.37&#160;VRHE. This study not only broadens the topological diversity of 3D COFs but also establishes a platform for achieving uniform and accessible multimetal distributions, paving the way for synergistic electrocatalytic materials.

We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene (Ge4CHD) derivative. Moreover, the reactivity revealed that the Ge4CHD derivative dissociated into the methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative in solution.








Abstract
We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, it undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene derivative (Ge4CHD). Moreover, theoretical calculations on Ge4CHD reveal &#963;*&#8211;&#960; interactions between the two &#960; orbitals (Ge&#9552;Ge) and the CH &#963;* orbital. This interaction is confirmed by a significant red shift in the solid&#8208;state UV&#8211;vis spectrum. In contrast to the behavior in the solid state, the Ge4CHD derivative dissociates in solution into a methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. The resultant 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with S8 to form a novel cage compound containing three S and two Ge atoms. On the other hand, in the reaction with triphenylphosphine sulfide, the in situ generated 2&#8208;thia&#8208;1,3&#8208;digermabicyclo[1.1.0]butane derivative activated the benzene solvent, leading to the formation of a [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition product. Additionally, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to form a three&#8208;membered ring. Its structural parameters and the results of theoretical calculations indicated the zwitterionic character.

         <title>Operando XAFS Deciphering Dynamic Evolution of Heteronuclear Cu&#8211;Ni From Atomic Sites to Atomic Clusters for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the intrinsic potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction of Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear sites during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Through operando XAFS and microscopy, we reveal the potential&#8208;driven transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7). The tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs effectively reduce the occupancy of Cu 3d&#8211;C 2p antibonding orbitals, thereby promoting CO2 protonation and significantly accelerating eCO2RR kinetics.








Abstract
Revealing the dynamic evolution of atomic&#8208;level active sites during catalytic reactions is critical for identifying true catalytic centers and optimizing the adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, elucidating the dynamic atomic/electronic transformation mechanisms of metal sites in multimetallic systems and achieving atomic&#8208;level control remains challenging. Here, we report a potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction intrinsic to Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear atomic sites during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and microscopy unveil the transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7) at potentials from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.2&#160;V versus RHE, anchored on porous carbon through N/S coordination. The Cu&#8208;rich evolution reshapes geometric structures of active sites, inducing gradual electron localization, thereby optimizing the adsorption energy of CO2 intermediates as evidenced by operando measurements and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs formed at &#8722;0.9&#160;V reduce the antibonding orbital occupancy between Cu 3d and C 2p states, facilitating CO2 protonation and enhancing eCO2RR kinetics. These findings demonstrate high CO selectivity and catalytic stability, providing fundamental insights into the dynamic reconstruction and catalytic mechanism of atomic&#8208;scale active sites.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Atom La2 Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an ultra&#8208;fast printing technology, we have successfully embedded diatomic lanthanum sites onto a graphene framework, which shows excellent ORR performance. The La2&#8208;N6 configuration structure can effectively reduce the reaction barrier of RDS and promote effective charge transfer, thus enhancing the catalytic process, on which the intermediates and structural evolution were well uncovered by combining advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Rare earth lanthanum element has a large atomic radius, multi&#8208;shell orbital electrons, and Fenton&#8208;like reaction inertia, on which a localized high&#8208;coordination structure can be easily formed for the favorable adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, for single&#8208;atom lanthanum sites, due to the loss of all the outmost s and d electrons, the practically vacuous outmost orbitals are stable but sleepy for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we synthesize a novel dual&#8208;atom La catalyst onto N&#8208;doped graphene (La2&#8208;NG) by a Joule ultrafast heating method, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.893&#160;V for the ORR. The La2&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrates a great open circuit voltage of 1.52&#160;V and a maximal power density of 192&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the change of valence states of La and the dynamic structural evolution of the La2&#8208;N6 moiety embedded onto the graphene during the ORR, through which the adsorption/desorption of oxygen reduction intermediates can be reasonably regulated. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the La2&#8208;N6 structure can decrease the reaction energy barrier and promote charge transfer.

         <title>Upconversion Lanthanide&#8208;Based 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Multimode Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and upconversion luminescence under 980&#160;nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+, Tb3+, or Eu3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.








Abstract
Luminescent 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of metal&#8208;organic framework materials expanded in a 2D plane, which have a wide range of applications in fields of optoelectronic devices, sensors, and information storage due to their unique layered structure and excellent optical properties. Currently, research on luminescent 2D MOFs mainly focuses on down&#8208;shifting luminescence, while the exploration of upconversion luminescence remains in its early stages. Herein, a novel 2D Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and red upconversion luminescence at 660 nm under 980&#160;nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. In addition, multimode emitting MOFs with both upconversion and down&#8208;shifting luminescence were further constructed by codoping Tb3+ or Eu3+. Inspired by the layered structure of 2D materials, multilayer stacked 2D MOFs composites were prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation method and upconversion luminescence was realized for the first time by interfacial energy transfer between different components. This strategy not only expands the optical modulation of luminescent 2D MOFs, but also provides new ideas for the construction of multifunctional luminescent materials. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.

This study introduces an N&#9472;B&#9472;N unit&#8208;based strategy to enhance room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), highlighting that 1,1&#8208;DB shows strong RTP property, unlike its isomer 1,2&#8208;DB. The contrast in their performance aids in understanding the relationship between molecular structure and phosphorescence, offering insights for designing and optimizing RTP materials.








Abstract
Achieving pure organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is of great interest due to their applications in optoelectronics. However, improving RTP in pure organic materials by controlling triplet excitons is challenging due to their complex relaxation processes. Therefore, exploring effective strategies to modulate triplet excitons is crucial. Herein, we propose a N&#9472;B&#9472;N isomerization strategy to enhance RTP performance. Two isomers containing HN&#9472;B&#9472;NH units (B2{1,2&#8208;(NH)2C6H4}2), namely 1,1&#8208;DB and 1,2&#8208;DB, were synthesized to explore their RTP properties. Intriguingly, 1,1&#8208;DB exhibited excellent RTP, whereas 1,2&#8208;DB displayed negligible phosphorescence. The N&#9472;B&#9472;N unit in 1,1&#8208;DB optimizes molecular configuration and interactions, enhancing electron delocalization and stabilizing triplet excitons, which improves intersystem crossing (ISC) and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) while reducing nonradiative decay, thus enabling RTP. Additionally, based on phosphorescence resonance energy transfer, multicolor afterglows were achieved by doping fluorescein into 1,1&#8208;DB. This work not only provides a new class of RTP materials but also offers valuable insights for the discovery and optimization of rational designs in RTP materials, potentially triggering the exploration of new functions and properties within boron&#8208;nitrogen molecular systems.

         <title>Azine&#8208;Pyridine Frame Generated Covalent Organic Frameworks and Self&#8208;Polymerized Films</title>

We report a family of azine&#8208;pyridine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that promote proton and electron transport through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. These COFs exhibit thermochromism, self&#8208;assemble into meter&#8208;scale films, and show enhanced heavy metal ion reduction, UV shielding, and battery performance, offering new opportunities in reticular chemistry, environmental science, and energy storage.








Abstract
Engineering covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into industrializable films with inherent functionalities has remained a major challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, through developing skeletal azine&#8208;pyridine conformation, we present an effectual synthetic frame to convert a family of powdery COFs into self&#8208;polymerized COFs films under green and ambient conditions. The active proton tautomerism in our azine&#8208;pyridine frame offers a thermochromism, facilitating self&#8208;polymerization of large&#8208;area COFs films from ca. 10&#160;nm to &gt;30&#160;&#181;m thickness with outstanding chemical stability, industrializable processability, and mechanical strength. More remarkably, our azine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based COFs first display various fresh properties, i.e., up to 1913 and 624&#160;mg g&#8722;1 reducing capacities on ions of Au3+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Au0 and Cr6+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Cr3+, 99.9% UV&#8208;blue light shielding and 97.2% transmissivity of visible lights and 10&#8208;fold increase in Zn battery lifetime. We expect that the azine&#8208;pyridine synthetic frame will serve as a generalizable route to boost the development of reticular chemistry, environmental science, and nano&#8208;electronics.

         <title>Tunable Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Supramolecular Polymers Toward Application in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitherto thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and supramolecular polymerization have been seemingly incompatible phenomena. Herein, we demonstrate multiple resonance (MR) TADF from supramolecular polymers, which can be tuned, by using a supramolecular modulator approach. Further, a supramolecular solubilization strategy allows for the transfer of these properties to aqueous media, highlighting the potential for future application.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) offers great potential for application in light emitting devices and bioimaging. Supramolecular polymers can offer intriguing properties for the same applications, such as stimuli responsiveness and self&#8208;healing owing to their dynamic intermolecular interactions. However, merging the two has remained a formidable challenge, due to the nonplanar geometry of common TADF chromophores. Herein, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a less distorted multiple resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) chromophore connected to a polymerization inducing building block. The obtained supramolecular synthon is capable of assembling in aliphatic solvents due to combined interchromophore interactions and hydrogen bonding. Within the supramolecular ensemble the long&#8208;lived photoluminescence properties of the chromophore are maintained. Further modification of the photoluminescence properties could be achieved by using different supramolecular modulators in a social self&#8208;sorting approach, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of the photoluminescence lifetime and bandwidth. Notably, the extent of intermolecular interactions can switch these assemblies from kinetically to thermodynamically controlled regimes. Finally, we employ this co&#8208;assembly strategy to move from organic to aqueous media highlighting the potential toward biological applications.

         <title>Engineering Unspecific Peroxygenases for Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unspecific peroxygenase from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) has been successfully engineered to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. This biocatalytic process demonstrates high efficiency and selectivity with scalability to preparative levels, expanding the catalytic repertoire and synthetic applicability of UPOs in selective oxyfunctionalization.








Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are promising biocatalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization. Compared to cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), the catalytic potential of UPOs has been less investigated, largely due to their limited natural diversity and the challenges associated with their optimization through enzyme engineering. In this study, we engineered an UPO from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, a valuable transformation yet to be realized in biocatalysis. Through enzyme engineering, two AniUPO variants, AniUPO&#8208;M3 and AniUPO&#8208;M6, were developed to produce a wide range of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters, achieving up to 97% yield, 4140 total turnover number (TTN), and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio (er). The biocatalytic process operates under mild conditions and is scalable for preparative applications. This study broadens the catalytic repertoire of UPOs and enhances their potential for industrial applications.

This study illustrates a versatile strategy for creating chirally chimeric protein constructs by merging natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) protein motifs through a combination of L&#8208;sortase&#8208;mediated transpeptidation and D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8208;mediated ligation. This approach has enabled the development of protein nanoparticle vaccines with improved stability and the ability to elicit potent antibody responses.








Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image proteins and nucleic acids exhibit remarkable biostability and bioorthogonality, offering a promising strategy to enhance the longevity of biological therapeutics. Here, we present a modular approach for constructing complex protein architectures that integrate both natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) motifs. Key to this strategy is the development of D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8212;a chemically synthesized, chirally inverted ligase that enables the efficient conjugation of D&#8208;SpyTag and D&#8208;BDTag. By exploiting the achirality of glycine (Gly), we used L&#8208;sortase to covalently link D&#8208;peptides (e.g., SpyTag or BDTag, bearing an N&#8208;terminal poly&#8208;Gly motif) to L&#8208;proteins (e.g., GFP, VLP&#8208;forming Mi3, or antigens) containing a C&#8208;terminal LPXTG sorting signal. The resulting D&#8208;SpyTagged and D&#8208;BDTagged proteins were further assembled via D&#8208;SpyStapler. This method enabled the construction of chirally chimeric VLP vaccines displaying antigens derived from malaria parasites and coronaviruses in various forms&#8212;recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides&#8212;providing significant flexibility and modularity for vaccine design. The resulting chirally hybrid vaccines exhibited enhanced proteolytic resistance in vitro and elicited potent immune responses in vivo. This study provides a versatile platform for developing long&#8208;acting therapeutics and vaccines.

Poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structurally diversity were synthesized by a &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8208;repolymerization&#8221; strategy. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. 








Abstract
The development of innovative poly(ether&#8208;ester)s with perfectly alternating ether and ester functionalities to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. Herein, we prepared a series of enantiopure cyclic thioether&#8208;ester monomers bearing various pendant substituents by a facile &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8221; strategy. The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers will afford stereoregular poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structural diversity. The varieties of substituent size, position and stereo&#8208;configuration provide the opportunity to systematically investigate polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as structure&#8208;properties relationship for the resulting poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. Of note, these polymers can be chemically recycled by either ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or alcoholysis, with high monomer regeneration efficiency. The systematic investigation of substitution effects and structure&#8208;property relationships in this work provides a molecular blueprint for designing novel chemically recyclable polymers with high performance.

         <title>Engineering Crystalline/Amorphous Interfaces for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an amorphous indium&#8208;based catalyst, which could reconstruct into crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of metallic indium under working conditions. Therefore, it can exhibit excellent performance in CO2 electroreduction to formic acid at high current densities. The Faradaic efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to formic acid over the In/In&#9472;OH interfaces reaches 98%, which is a 66.1% increase compared to traditional In2O3. 








Abstract
In the request for carbon neutrality, CO2 electroreduction to high&#8208;value fuels and chemicals, particularly formic acid, has become as a promising approach. However, implementing it on an industrial scale is hindered by the catalyst instability under high current densities and the excessive energy consumption of conventional electrolysis systems. To tackle these challenges, we propose an amorphization strategy to regulate catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions. In particular, an amorphous In&#8208;based catalyst, InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x, was designed and achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 98% at &#8722;800 to &#8722;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction to formate, while maintaining stability for 100&#160;h. Mechanistic studies show that InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x undergoes partial reduction to stable crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of fully reducing to metallic In, enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and *OCHO intermediate. To improve the economic viability of electrolysis system, a CO2 electroreduction coupled with waste plastics electrooxidation system for formate production was constructed. Compared to conventional electrolysis system, the coupled system reduced energy consumption by 34.7% and increased formate production by 49.7%, offering a more energy&#8208;efficient and cost&#8208;effective approach to CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation of Radical Photochromism and Photoluminescence via Polymer Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity of polymer matrices not only plays a crucial role in inducing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence by protecting the naphthalene diimide core structure from quenching by oxygen and moisture, but also facilitates the generation of stable anion radicals through photoinduced electron transfer, even in the absence of UV irradiation.








Abstract
While polymer matrices are widely used to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from oxygen and moisture quenching by providing a network that enables long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the influence of polymer polarity on phosphors for stable free radicals with radical luminescence (RL) has not been well studied. In this work, naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives, denoted as NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH (X&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;6), featuring different alkyl alcohol chains, exhibit multi&#8208;responsive and tunable RTP and RL properties through polymer matrix polarity regulation. Experimental results reveal that NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH&#8226;&#8722; anion radicals are generated via not only photoinduction in the excited state but also intermolecular interactions of polar matrix in the ground state. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that polar polymers rich in hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors (e.g., &#9472;NH2, &#9472;NH&#9472;, and &#9472;OH), where electrostatic interactions dominate over dispersion (E/D&#160;&gt;&#160;1), more readily induce anion radicals compared to polar polymers rich in acceptors (e.g., &#9472;CN and &#9472;CO&#9472;), where dispersion interactions outweigh electrostatic effects (E/D&#160;&lt;&#160;1). These derivatives exhibit potential applications in information encryption and volatile amine detection due to their chromic and luminescent properties. These findings offer perspectives on the role of polymer matrix polarity in modulating anion radical behavior, and mechanistic insights into the balance between RTP and RL properties.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of chlorine&#8208;participated ethylene oxidation on a tin dioxide (SnO2) anode is elucidated. In this process, 92% of 2&#8208;chloroethanol is produced through the dual&#8208;adsorbate pathway, where ethylene directly couples with chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH). 








Abstract
Electrified 2&#8208;chloroethanol synthesis serves as a promising alternative to conventional ethylene oxidation with corrosive hypochlorous acid (HClO) and offers the opportunity for sustainable pharmaceutical production. However, the instability of locally generated HClO and the competing water oxidation largely limit the efficiency of this electrochemical process. Here we report a new reaction pathway involved in the ethylene oxidation toward 2&#8208;chloroethanol, featuring co&#8208;adsorbed chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH) species on a tin dioxide (SnO2) anode. This dual&#8208;adsorbate pathway favors the efficient ethylene oxidation, giving rise to a large current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for at least 50 h and a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 82% for the 2&#8208;chloroethanol product. This work opens an avenue for electrifying the synthesis of important organic molecules via simultaneously modulating the adsorption of multiple active intermediates.

         <title>A Recyclable Cooperative Approach for Selective Lithium Recovery from Industrial&#8208;Grade Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Black Mass via Oxidative Delithiation and Complexation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>

This study presents a novel method to extract lithium selectively from spent LIBs under mild conditions. The cooperative actions of anthraquinone ligand with H2O2 generate reactive oxygen species that drive oxidative delithiation with concurrent lithium abstraction and coordination by the ligand, enabling efficient and rapid lithium extraction.








Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively from an industrial&#8208;grade lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) black mass having multiple metal ions is challenging but crucial from an industrial standpoint. However, most of the methods involve harsh conditions and sacrificial reagents, are energy&#8208;intensive and time&#8208;consuming, and generate secondary pollution. This study presents a lithium selective, ligand&#8208;assisted cooperative approach for the selective leaching of lithium under mild conditions. It is revealed that the synergistic actions of anthraquinone salt (Na2AQAc) and H2O2 generate highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as &#8226;OH, &#8226;O2&#8722;, and 1O2 that facilitate oxidative delithiation supported by spin trapping EPR and quenching experiments. As a result, a phase transition of cathode material and concurrent lithium abstraction by the ligand, forming an octanuclear lithium complex ([Li8(AQAc2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH2)2(H2O)12]4+) in the leachate was observed. Consequently, a leaching efficiency of 97% with over 99% selectivity was achieved under the optimized conditions of 3.5% H2O2 (v/v), 30&#160;&#176;C, 72&#160;mM Na2AQAc, 40&#160;g L&#8722;1 pulp density, and a reaction time of 1&#160;h. A recycling strategy was demonstrated to recover anthraquinone acid, and lithium was separated as high&#8208;purity Li&#8322;CO&#8323;. This method offers the advantages of room&#8208;temperature operation, neutral pH conditions, shorter time duration, minimal reagent usage, and the ability to recycle the reagents.

         <title>Stepwise Acetylene Insertion and Ammonia Activation at a Digallene and Diindene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise insertion of acetylene into the E&#9552;E bonds of digallenes and diindenes is reported. This leads to the selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores. The six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues are Lewis&#8208;acidic and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia, which&#8212;upon heating&#8212;undergo ammonolysis releasing ethylene.








Abstract
Sequential [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions between acetylene and the digallene and diindene compounds (ETer)2 (E&#160;=&#160;Ga, In; Ter&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Dipp2&#8208;C6H3; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) are described. Careful control of the reaction conditions leads to selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores, respectively. A structural analysis of the heterocycles by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests limited electronic delocalization within the rings, which is borne out in their reactivity. For example, the six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues exhibit Lewis&#8208;acidic behavior and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia. Upon heating, these adducts transform into the corresponding bimetallic triel amides with concomitant generation of ethene.

         <title>Regioreversed Carbosulfenylation of Fluoroalkenes via Nickel&#8208;Mediated Radical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed unconventional 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of fluoroalkenes provides efficient access to sulfide and fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing products. Preliminary mechanistic studies support a pathway involving thiyl radical generation via HAT, addition to the alkene, and subsequent nickel&#8208;mediated benzylation.








Abstract
Carbosulfenylation of olefins represents an important class of reactions for the synthesis of structurally diverse organosulfur compounds. Previous studies typically yield 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity. In the context of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis, accessing the regioreversed products is desirable, significantly broadening the scope of these reactions. In this study, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, using free thiols and benzyl bromides as sulfur and carbon sources, respectively. The unusual regioselectivity observed is enabled by a &#8220;radical sorting&#8221; mechanism. The Ni catalyst activates benzyl bromide to generate a benzylic radical that undergoes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with the thiol to form a sulfur&#8208;centered radical. The sulfur radical subsequently adds to the fluoroalkenes, resulting in an &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl C&#8208;radical. This radical undergoes SH2 with a Ni&#8211;CH2Ar to form a C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and quaternary center, ultimately producing valuable fluoroalkyl thioethers. Isotopic labeling experiments corroborate a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event within the working mechanism.

In this work, we construct a highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient CEI based on a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for stabilizing Li||NCM94 battery at high voltage (4.8&#160;V) and extreme temperatures (&#8722;40&#8764;60&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries attract great interest, but their poor safety and cycling performance hinder their applications, especially with high cut&#8208;off voltage nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature, and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for Li|| LiNi0.94Co0.05Mn0.01O2 (NCM94) batteries with excellent cycling performance through constructing highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). Such CEI exhibits a gradual decrease in C&#9472;F and a gradient increase in LiF and LiBxOy from the outside to the inside, which effectively inhibits structural degradation of the NCM94 cathode. With an excellent CEI, Li|| NCM94 batteries show outstanding cycling stability and wide temperature applicability (&#8722;40&#8764;60&#160;&#176;C). The battery could exhibit a capacity retention of 87% after 200 cycles at 4.8&#160;V, and deliver 112% (or 56%) of their room&#8208;temperature capacity at 60 &#176;C and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, as&#8208;constructed 7.6&#160;Ah pouch cell could run 145 cycles with an energy density of 541&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work provides the guidance on designing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces for wide&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Modular Access to P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds via Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of (Thio)Phosphonic Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy using newly modified chiral PIM ligands enables modular access to diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds with high stereocontrol. This approach tolerates broad functionality, constructs challenging P&#9552;S motifs, and enables late&#8208;stage nucleoside derivatization, providing a versatile platform for drug and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutic development.








Abstract
Chiral phosphorus(V) centers&#8212;particularly those bearing fully heteroatom&#8208;substituted frameworks&#8212;are key stereochemical motifs in pharmaceuticals, nucleic acid therapeutics, and functional materials. However, their stereoselective construction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy enabled by rationally engineered PIM ligands that affords broad and modular access to structurally diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds. By harnessing the tunable Lewis acidity and well&#8208;defined chiral environment of the catalyst&#8212;together with the distinct mechanistic features of chiral Lewis acid catalysis&#8212;this strategy overcomes the substrate scope limitations that have constrained traditional approaches. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and delivers high levels of stereocontrol across seven distinct substitution patterns, including the efficient construction of chiral P&#9552;S motifs previously considered synthetically challenging. Importantly, the approach enables efficient late&#8208;stage derivatization of nucleosides and their analogs, thereby providing a general entry point to stereodefined P(V)&#8208;containing bioactive molecules. This work not only expands the utility of transition&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis in phosphorus chemistry, but also establishes a versatile framework for applications in drug discovery and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutics where precise stereochemical control is essential.

         <title>Electrocatalytic C&#9472;S Cross&#8208;Coupling via Engineered Frustrated Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Pairs for High&#8208;Efficiency Methanesulfonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that MOFs catalysts with Lewis acid&#8208;base sites generated by introducing specific ligand groups can produce methanesulfonate through nucleophilic attack, and performance is superior to previously reported copper&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of the Lewis acid and base sites for electrocatalytic C&#9472;S coupling reaction and provides an avenue to produce by abundant resources and renewable electricity.








Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of sulfonyl compounds under mild conditions remains a significant challenge due to the reliance on harsh reagents, high energy consumption, and low selectivity in conventional methods. Herein, we report a novel strategy for efficient C&#9472;S bond formation through in situ modulation of frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs within a copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CuBDC&#8208;XN). By precisely engineering electron&#8208;deficient Cu Lewis acid sites and electron&#8208;rich XN&#8208;functionalized Lewis base sites, this bifunctional catalyst enables the synergistic co&#8208;reduction of SO32&#8722; and CO2 into methanesulfonate (MS) at ambient conditions with a Faradaic efficiency of 13.77% (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus RHE). Mechanistic studies reveal that the frustrated Lewis pairs selectively stabilize key intermediates (*CHO and SO32&#8722;) via electrostatic interactions, facilitating nucleophilic attack and C&#9472;S coupling with a reduced energy barrier (0.48&#160;eV). In situ spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations further elucidate the dynamic adsorption&#8208;configuration regulation and intermediate evolution pathway. This work not only establishes a molecular&#8208;level understanding of cooperative Lewis acid&#8208;base catalysis but also provides a universal design principle for the sustainable electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added organosulfur compounds.

         <title>Dual Chemical Scissors Strategy Enables 1D Antimony Selenates with Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III)&#8212;were successfully designed and synthesized via dual chemical scissors strategy. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong SHG response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for UV NLO applications.








Abstract
The rational, function&#8208;driven design of advanced inorganic functional materials remains a significant challenge, primarily attributed to their inherently complex and highly connected 3D frameworks of most oxide&#8208;based systems. Herein, we report a &#8220;dual chemical scissors&#8221; strategy that synergistically combines the effects of fluoride ions and stereochemically active lone pairs to precisely modulate local coordination environments and enable controlled dimensional reduction. Using this approach, we successfully synthesized the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III). These compounds feature well&#8208;defined helical chain structures constructed from SbOxFy polyhedra and SeO4 tetrahedra, resulting in pronounced optical anisotropy and robust nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for ultraviolet NLO applications. This work establishes a powerful and generalizable structural design paradigm for constructing polar low&#8208;dimensional architectures and underscores the effectiveness of targeted coordination modulation in advancing high&#8208;performance optical materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation in Porous Organic Cage Salt&#8211;Metal Cluster Hybrids for Efficient Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated catalytic system based on a pH&#8208;responsive porous organic cage salt hybrid has been engineered, where Pd clusters are confined within the cage cavities and radical sites are located on the cage skeletons. Spatiotemporal regulation, combining pH&#8208;stimuli with spatially isolated active sites in proximity, maximizes cooperative performance and enables efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.








Abstract
Developing artificial biomimetic catalysts with precise spatiotemporal control remains challenging. Here, we present a pH&#8208;responsive organic cage salt containing quaternary ammonium moieties ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8208;12X, X&#9552;Cl or Br counteranions) as a platform for constructing such catalysts. Thermally induced electron transfer from counteranions to ammonium moieties generates radicals throughout cage skeletons ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X), which, combined with nanocavity confinement, facilitates metal precursor reduction and Pd cluster encapsulation, yielding the hybrid catalyst, Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X. The pH&#8208;responsive cages enable switching between two catalytic states: Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X, where radicals serve as active sites while Pd accessibility is hindered by numerous counteranions, and Pd@A&#8208;Cage, where neutralization of ammonium cages to non&#8208;radical amine cages (A&#8208;Cage) restores Pd accessibility by removing counteranions and modulating Pd surface charge. This dynamic switching allows real&#8208;time modulation of site&#8208;specific activity in single&#8208;step reactions. Sequential activation of dual active sites by acid&#8208;base stimuli enables tandem catalysis. Moreover, fine&#8208;tuning the protonation degrees of quaternary ammonium groups with base stimuli unveils an optimized catalyst, Pd@[PQA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;6X (where PQA&#8208;Cage refers to partially quaternized ammonium cages). Such a spatiotemporal control maximizes cooperative performance by balancing spatially isolated radicals and Pd sites for efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of incompatible oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.

         <title>Blood Retention and Kidney Clearance of Renal&#8208;Clearable Gold Nanoparticles Strongly Correlate with Renal Injury Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury model, proximal tubular injury&#8212;rather than glomerular leakage&#8212;predominantly determines the renal clearance of gold nanoclusters. The blood retention of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; strongly correlates with proximal tubular injury biomarker KIM&#8208;1, highlighting its potential as a sensitive exogenous blood marker for proximal tubular injury.








Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are typically filtered through the glomeruli and transported along the renal tubules before entering the bladder. However, the effects of glomerular leakage and tubular injury, two common features of kidney diseases, on nanoparticle transport remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the blood retention, kidney accumulation, and renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; in a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model. By correlating its transport with proteinuria and urinary kidney injury molecule&#8208;1 (KIM&#8208;1), endogenous biomarkers of glomerular leakage and proximal tubular injury, respectively, we found that glomerular leakage, as indicated by a &gt;50&#8208;fold increase in proteinuria, did not enhance its blood clearance. Instead, tubular injury significantly reduced glomerular filtration, resulting in elevated blood retention, increased kidney accumulation, and reduced renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328;. Moreover, Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; blood retention exhibited a very strong positive correlation with urinary KIM&#8208;1 (Pearson's coefficient r&#160;=&#160;0.90), much stronger than KIM&#8208;1 correlations with conventional glomerular filtration blood markers such as serum creatinine. This suggests that Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; could serve as a sensitive exogenous blood marker of tubular injury, expanding the diagnostic potential of renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles in kidney diseases.

         <title>Communicative Nanomotors Reprogram Cancer Cell Death via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Communicative nanomotors respond to elevated ROS in the tumor microenvironment, enabling active communication and selective mitochondrial targeting through non&#8208;covalent surface engineering. Their precise interaction with cells induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and pyroptotic cell death, while chemotactic motility ensures deeper tumor penetration, advancing intelligent cancer therapeutics.








Abstract
Nanomotors offer significant advantages over passive nanoparticles in biomedical applications. However, their potential has been largely restricted to cargo transport, with limited capacity for interaction with biological systems. Here, we present next&#8208;generation self&#8208;assembled nanomotors that not only exhibit chemotactic motility but also actively communicate with cells, reprogramming cell fate by inducing pyroptosis. These nanomotors are designed to respond to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment, triggering nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;driven propulsion and selective mitochondria targeting via triphenylphosphine (TPP) surface engineering. This interaction induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and activation of gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Furthermore, their chemotactic motility facilitates deeper tumor tissue penetration in 3D spheroids, demonstrating their ability to navigate physiological barriers. By shifting the paradigm from motility&#8208;driven to interactive nanomedicine, this study establishes a transformative platform for targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healable Poly(ionic liquid) Copolymers Driven by Polar and Dipolar Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation&#8211;anion moieties in poly(ionic liquid) copolymers can modify the fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock interactions. Precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self&#8208;healing, thus opening pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy harvesting and storage, sensing, actuators, and others. 








Abstract
Commodity aliphatic and aromatic acrylic&#8208;based copolymers self&#8208;heal due to ubiquitous key&#8208;and&#8208;lock, ring&#8208;and&#8208;lock, and fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock van der Waals (vdW) interactions. However, the role of these interactions in the presence of covalently copolymerized ionic liquid (IL) is not known. This study is driven by the hypothesis that covalently incorporated cation&#8211;anion pairs to form poly(ionic liquid) copolymers (PILCs) can perturb inter&#8208; or intra&#8208;chain vdW interactions reflected in mechanical and electrical responses. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a series of PILCs comprising of pentafluorostyrene (PFS) and imidazolium&#8208;based IL monomers with variable&#8208;length aliphatic tails (methyl and butyl). Using a combination of 2D 1H&#8208;1H and 19F &#8208;19F NOESY NMR and FTIR measurements supplemented by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, these studies demonstrate that preferentially alternating/random PILCs topologies facilitate self&#8208;healing. The introduction of cation&#8211;anion moieties modifies the fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock interactions and, along with longer aliphatic tails &#9472;(CH2)3CH3 covalently attached to the imidazolium cation, enhances cation&#8208;anion mobility, thus faster recovery from mechanical damage occurs. These findings underline how precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self&#8208;healing in PILCs. These insights may open pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy storage and energy harvesting.

         <title>Photoswitchable Catalytic Divergent Synthesis by a Viologen&#8208;Functionalized Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Tetrahedral Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here a viologen&#8208;functionalized lanthanide&#8208;organic coordination cage with photo&#8208;redox activities, representing the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage.








Abstract
Photoswitchable catalysis presents a significant challenge, particularly in the modulation of reaction pathways. In this study, we describe a redox&#8208;active lanthanide&#8208;organic tetrahedral cage 1, self&#8208;assembled from a viologen&#8208;functionalised ditopic tridentate ligand and Eu(III) ions. Complexation&#8208;induced charge redistribution and spatial rearrangement of ligands in the assembly endow 1 with distinct photochromic properties and redox activities compared to free ligand L. 1 can serve as a photoswitchable catalyst for divergent chemical transformations of various tetraarylborates, giving biaryls and phenols via photo&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction under 365&#160;nm light irradiation, or producing mono&#8208;arene products through catalytic de&#8208;composition process in the absence of light. This work represents the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, paving the way for the design and construction of novel supramolecular edifices with switchable functions.

         <title>Switching Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation Toward Ethanol by Tuning Spin States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>

We developed a Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) photocatalyst with medium&#8208;spin active sites, in which both the unpaired electrons and eg orbital occupancy allow to selectively generate &#8226;CH2OH intermediates at moderate *OH coverage and promote the C&#9472;C coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH, leading to efficient photocatalytic conversion of CH4 to ethanol without the addition of strong oxidizing reagents. 








Abstract
The selective oxidation of methane (CH4) has attractive potentials for mitigating global warming and producing value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the efficient generation of multicarbon products such as ethanol remains challenging, due to the short lifetimes and high unpaired concentrations of reactive intermediates (like &#8226;OH, &#8226;CH3, &#8226;OCH3, and &#8226;CH2OH). Herein, we developed a medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst with tunable Fe(III) spin states, which can efficiently photo&#8208;oxidize CH4 to ethanol at ambient conditions. The unpaired electrons in d orbitals of Fe sites allow for efficient adsorption of &#8226;OH, and the eg orbital occupancy enables stabilizing different key carbon&#8208;containing intermediates (&#8226;OCH3 versus &#8226;CH2OH). By balancing those two descriptors, the medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst allows to achieve selective generation of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates with a moderate *OH coverage and subsequent coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH to ethanol. With a light intensity of 100 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and water as a weak oxidant, the Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst exhibited a peak photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol yield of 372 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without the use of photosensitizers or sacrificial reagents, which is &#8764;3 times higher than the previously best reported photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol under similar conditions. Our study suggests an attractive potential of converting CH4 to multicarbon products by modulating spin states of the catalytic sites.

         <title>Gold and Bismuth Trimetallic Synergistic Redox Catalysis for Non&#8208;Directed C&#9472;H Arylation with Aryl Bismuth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear gold catalyzed selective C&#9472;H arylation by using aryl bismuth reagents as the arylation reagents has been developed. The Bi(V) generated in&#8208;situ can oxidize gold(I) to form Au&#9472;Au&#9472;Bi intermediate, where Bi's Z&#8208;type coordination mitigates steric/electronic constraints. This trimetallic strategy outperforms classical C&#9472;C couplings, tolerating silanes, boronate esters, and germanes, thus providing new insights for multimetallic cooperative catalysis.








Abstract
The influence of substituent effects plays an important role on the efficiency and regioselectivity toward C&#9472;H activation of non&#8208;directed arenes. Here, an unprecedented trimetallic synergistic redox catalysis system has been developed to achieve a highly efficient and orthogonal C&#9472;H arylation of non&#8208;directed arenes with aryl bismuth. Both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;deficient aryl bismuth can proceed C&#9472;H arylation readily, thus affording an elegant strategy for the synthesis of challenging electron&#8208;rich and sterically hindered biaryls by means of gold catalysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Bi(V) species generated in&#8208;situ from Ar&#9472;Bi(III) and NFSI is not only an arylation reagent but also an oxidant to form a critical Au(II)&#9472;Au(II)&#9472;Bi intermediate (detected by HRMS). Interestingly, the binding Bi&#8208;moiety can modulate the electronic and steric environment of gold center through cooperative interactions, thus promoting the intramolecular transmetallation and reductive elimination. In addition, the synthetic robustness of this protocol has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiments and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Alkylidene Succinimides Enabled by Weak Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positive correlation between weak noncovalent interactions and the activity of asymmetric hydrogenation was explored through both DFT calculations and experimental studies by modifying the protecting group of the substrate. Based on these findings, an Earth&#8208;abundant nickel catalytic system was developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylene succinimide, demonstrating superior efficiency (4000&#160;S/C, substrate/catalyst) compared to rare metal catalysts (2000&#160;S/C). This system delivered excellent results, achieving up to 99% enantiomeric excess (ee) and 99% yield.








Abstract
The development of asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts based on Earth&#8208;abundant metals presents a sustainable alternative to efficient but resource&#8208;limited rare&#8208;metal systems. However, these catalysts often suffer from low catalytic activity. In this study, through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic experiments, we uncovered a positive correlation between catalyst&#8208;substrate weak noncovalent interactions and catalytic efficiency in the enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides with different N&#8208;protecting groups. The tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) substituent emerged as the optimal choice, significantly enhancing reactivity. This approach enabled the hydrogenation of a wide range of substrates with excellent yields (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99%&#160;ee), achieving a substrate/catalyst (S/C) ratio of 4000&#8212;twice the efficiency of rare&#8208;metal catalysts (S/C&#160;&#8804;&#160;2000) for similar transformations. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the enantiomers revealed that the high stereoselectivity is promoted by stabilizing weak noncovalent interactions in the R&#8208;configured transition state.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioconvergent C&#9472;O Bond Formation for Asymmetric Cross&#8208;Coupling of Allylamines and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of the C1&#8208;symmetric oxazoline ligand with copper induced an additional C&#9472;N axial chirality, thereby enhancing stereochemical control in the challenging asymmetric CO2 fixation. This result may establish a new paradigm for developing metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations. 








Abstract
Upgrading abundant carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value organic molecules has garnered broad research interest for decades. Within this domain, catalytic asymmetric synthesis employing CO2 holds great synthetic importance. Although remarkable advances have been made in asymmetric C&#9472;C bond formation using CO2 as a C1 synthon in recent years, the development of incorporation of CO2 as an oxygen source for asymmetric C&#9472;O bond construction remains elusive, presumably due to the formidable challenge of simultaneously addressing enantioselectivity control and reaction efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;Coordination of the C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric oxazoline ligand with copper induced an additional C&#9472;N axial chirality, thereby enhancing stereochemical control in the challenging asymmetric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation. This result may establish a new paradigm for developing metal-catalyzed asymmetric transformations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading abundant carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into high-value organic molecules has garnered broad research interest for decades. Within this domain, catalytic asymmetric synthesis employing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; holds great synthetic importance. Although remarkable advances have been made in asymmetric C&#9472;C bond formation using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a C1 synthon in recent years, the development of incorporation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an oxygen source for asymmetric C&#9472;O bond construction remains elusive, presumably due to the formidable challenge of simultaneously addressing enantioselectivity control and reaction efficiency.

         <title>A Polyaromatic Metallotube With a Dual Multi&#8208;Functionalization Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyaromatic metallotube, formed from PtCl2 and bispyridine ligands, undergoes dual multi&#8208;functionalization via substitution on the metal hinges. The first multi&#8208;functionalized Pt(II)&#8208;tube exhibits high water solubility as well as binds one molecule of fullerene C60, which is subsequently released through the second multi&#8208;functionalization, in a quantitative fashion. 








Abstract
Post&#8208;functionalization is an advanced, key synthetic method in supramolecular systems, whereas the previous method relies heavily on the substitution on the organic frameworks. Here we report a polyaromatic metallotube capable of dually multi&#8208;functionalizing the metal sites in an efficient post&#8208;assembly fashion. The Pt(II)&#8208;linked tube with tetrachloro groups is prepared from two PtCl2 hinges and two bent bispyridine ligands in high yield. The new metallotube efficiently converts to tetra&#8208;substituted tubes by the first multiple functionalization, through the replacement of the chloro groups with various alkynyl groups. The tubular structures before/after the functionalization are unequivocally confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. A resultant tetraammonium&#8208;attached Pt(II)&#8208;tube exhibits high water solubility and uptake abilities toward spherical and rod&#8208;like compounds. The metallotube strongly binds one molecule of fullerene C60 in the polyaromatic cavity yet releases it through the second multi&#8208;functionalization by tetrabromination of the metal hinges in a quantitative and reversible manner. Even after Bingel reaction within the tube, sterically demanding bis&#8208;substituted fullerenes (&gt;&#8764;80% selectivity) are readily released by the second functionalization. The present method, i.e., the use of simple PtCl2 hinges, will be applicable to wide&#8208;ranging metallo&#8208;supramolecules to enhance their structural and functional versatilities via post&#8208;multi&#8208;functionalizations.

         <title>&#8220;Outside&#8208;in&#8221; Design of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Linking Specific Peripheral Geometry to Defined CO2 Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; strategy for the design of NC&#8208;supported Fe and Ni SACs for CO2RR. Combined DFT calculations and experimental studies show that incorporating specific six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings into the outer shell retrofit the electronic property of coordination N atoms in the inner shell, thereby precisely controlling the catalytic performance of the metal center.








Abstract
The regulation of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) through microenvironment engineering, particularly via peripheral species, has recently garnered significant attention in the fields of materials science and heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, establishing unambiguous structure&#8208;property relationships for SAC, especially concerning peripheral effects, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy for the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Fe SACs for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory(DFT) calculations reveal that installing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring in the outer shell modulates the electronic properties of the inner&#8208;shell coordination N species, altering their electron transfer capabilities while fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;p coupling between the Fe center and adjacent N atoms. Notably, five&#8208;membered rings induce stronger d&#8208;p coupling compared to their six&#8208;membered counterparts, leading to a higher Fe valence state. This electronic modulation optimizes the adsorption strength of key CO2RR intermediates (COOH* and CO*), enhancing catalytic performance for CO production.&#160;Extensive experimental studies corroborate these theoretical findings. The proposed &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; design strategy can be extended to Ni SACs, offering new insights into the exploration of highly efficient single&#8208;atom centers through peripheral geometric effects.

         <title>The Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster of Bacterioferritin&#8208;Associated Ferredoxin (Bfd): a &#8220;Biological Fuse&#8221; that Prevents Oxidative Damage to Cells?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
When cellular iron is low, bacterioferritin (Bfr) releases its stored iron through a reductive process dependent on the [2Fe&#8211;2S] ferredoxin Bfd. Why accessing stored iron should depend on an iron&#8208;requiring protein when iron is scarce is unclear. Here, we show that the Bfd [2Fe&#8211;2S] cluster is sensitive to oxidative stress, suggesting that it may act as a &#8220;biological fuse&#8221;, shutting down iron release under conditions where free iron is toxic.








Abstract
Iron is in an essential micronutrient in living systems. However, it is also potentially toxic and so the concentration of chelatable iron within cells is tightly regulated to prevent catalytic formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferritins play a key role in iron homeostasis by storing excess iron as an insoluble ferric mineral within the protein. When bacterial cells become iron deficient, this store may be accessed by reduction/solubilisation of the iron. Bacterioferritins utilise heme, bound at an inter&#8208;subunit site, to support electron transfer to the stored mineral. Electrons for heme reduction are shuttled from NADPH via Bfd, a [2Fe&#8211;2S] cluster&#8208;containing ferredoxin. This raises the paradox that the synthesis of an iron&#8208;dependent protein co&#8208;factor is required under conditions of iron&#8208;deficiency so that stored iron can be utilised. Here, we show that exposure of Bfd to ROS suppresses the capacity of the protein to stimulate iron release from bacterioferritin. We propose that reliance of iron release on Bfd evolved to ensure that chelatable iron levels do not increase under oxidative stress conditions. Thus, the Bfd iron&#8211;sulfur cluster functions as a &#8220;biological fuse&#8221; in providing a fail&#8208;safe that immediately halts iron release once ROS accumulate to damaging concentrations.

         <title>Efficient Separation of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Products Using a Robust Polycatenated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed using an expanded aromatic tricarboxylate ligand, featuring the highest degree of catenation among known HOF analogues and enabling efficient C3H6/C2H4 separation with record productivity for this class of materials. 








Abstract
The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process produces mixtures of ethylene and propylene, driving demand for high&#8208;performance separation materials. We present HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework built from an expanded BTB (4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl&#8208;tribenzoate) linker, featuring the highest catenation degree observed in BTB&#8208;based HOFs. This unique architecture confers good stability under solvent, pH, and thermal conditions. With optimally sized pores and aromatic&#8208;rich surfaces, HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3 demonstrates excellent propylene/ethylene separation potential, outperforming its parent frameworks (HOF&#8208;BTB and HOF&#8208;BTB&#8208;NH2) under ambient conditions. Notably, the material accomplishes single&#8208;cycle purification of high&#8208;purity ethylene (99.95%) and propylene (99.5%) from equimolar binary mixtures, achieving a record ethylene productivity of 3.22&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 among HOF adsorbents.

     alt="Efficient Separation of Methanol-to-Olefins Products Using a Robust Polycatenated Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Framework"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robust hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed using an expanded aromatic tricarboxylate ligand, featuring the highest degree of catenation among known HOF analogues and enabling efficient C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation with record productivity for this class of materials. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methanol-to-olefins process produces mixtures of ethylene and propylene, driving demand for high-performance separation materials. We present HOF-ZJNU-3, a hydrogen-bonded organic framework built from an expanded BTB (4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;-benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tribenzoate) linker, featuring the highest catenation degree observed in BTB-based HOFs. This unique architecture confers good stability under solvent, pH, and thermal conditions. With optimally sized pores and aromatic-rich surfaces, HOF-ZJNU-3 demonstrates excellent propylene/ethylene separation potential, outperforming its parent frameworks (HOF-BTB and HOF-BTB-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) under ambient conditions. Notably, the material accomplishes single-cycle purification of high-purity ethylene (99.95%) and propylene (99.5%) from equimolar binary mixtures, achieving a record ethylene productivity of 3.22&#160;mol&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; among HOF adsorbents. This study not only establishes HOF-ZJNU-3 as a benchmark HOF material for MTO product separation but also advances the structural design of HOFs for industrial olefin purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Boosts the Uptake of Small Molecules in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the importance of chalcogen bonding in improving the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. The uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells through macropinocytosis pathway.








Abstract
Chalcogen bonding, a noncovalent interaction between the chalcogen atom (S, Se, and Te) and Lewis base, plays crucial roles in catalysis, anion recognition, protein confirmation, enzyme activity, and drug design. Herein, we show that chalcogen bonding can be used as a driving force to enhance the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. A systematic investigation using several chalcogen&#8208;containing fluorescent molecules reveal that the cellular uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells. This study suggests that the biological activities of chalcogen&#8208;based compounds may depend not only on their chemical reactivity but also on their chalcogen bond forming ability with the cell membrane.

         <title>Synthesis of a Linear Tetraboron Cation via Deprotonation of a Nonsupported Dimeric Hydroborylborenium Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deprotonation of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion results in formation of a linear tetraboron cation. This homocatenated boron species can activate H2, leading to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. 








Abstract
The nonsupported B&#8211;H&#8211;B moiety of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion can be readily deprotonated by 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, affording a H&#8208;bridged linear tetraboron cation. The resulting tetraboron cation shows diverse reactivity with small molecules. Treatment of this tetraboron cation with H2 leads to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. Additionally, during the preparation of the hydroborylborenium, an unprecedented formal boryl cage&#8208;walking was observed. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this process involves consecutive activation of carboranyl B(9)&#8211;H bonds.

         <title>Decoupling Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation: A Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Assisted Dual&#8208;Site Synergy Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy mechanism is demonstrated to overcome the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru single sites drive selective CO&#8322;&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, while Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply H species to Ru single sites via spillover over N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, achieving 98.0% CO selectivity with ultrahigh activity (3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The persistent trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity remains a critical barrier to efficient CO2 valorization. Herein, we propose a concept of decoupling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the photothermal catalytic reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy. This concept is demonstrated through a hybrid catalyst constructed by immobilizing abundant Ru single sites and trace Ru clusters onto high&#8208;efficiency photothermal support of N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages (hNCNC). Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#9472;N4 sites are highly active and selective for the RWGS reaction, contingent on the efficient migration of dissociated *H species to adjacent C atoms of Ru. Importantly, we experimentally confirm that Ru single sites dominate CO2 hydrogenation to CO, whereas Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply hydrogen species to adjacent single sites via spillover over hNCNC. Leveraging this synergistic interaction, the hybrid catalyst achieves an exceptional CO production rate of 3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity over 98%. This mechanism shows universal applicability as demonstrated by the effective promotion of CO2 hydrogenation of Ru single sites by other typical hydrogen&#8208;spillover&#8208;active metal clusters, e.g., Pt and Pd clusters. This design concept liberates the potential to overcome the longstanding activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Active Edge Sites Engineering on Amorphous Co&#8211;Mn Spinel&#8208;Based Oxides for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general synthesis approach is presented to prepare Turing&#8208;type porous CoMn2O4 nanoreactors, facilitating the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies, thereby promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (1O2) pathways.








Abstract
Rational modulation of edge active sites in the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers, is a hot topic in the heterogeneous catalysis field, yet the applicability of large&#8208;scale manufacturing remains a severe challenge. Herein, a general wet&#8208;chemical approach is reported to large&#8208;scale prepare porous CoMn2O4 with abundant active edge sites for enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like activation without using a template or heat treatment. The obtained Turing&#8208;type structure not only can be assembled into spatially restricted domain CoMn2O4 nanoreactors but also greatly facilitates the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies in promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (1O2) pathways and maintained a degradation rate of 99.8% within 5 min after seven&#8208;cycle runs. Moreover, the application prospect of the PMS&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like process for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment, including sulfadiazine (SD) antibiotics in real river water and real pharmaceutical wastewater, was demonstrated by the fixed&#8208;bed tower reactor and the in&#8208;situ floating water treatment device. This work will provide guidance for the development of low&#8208;cost and efficient heterogeneous PMS&#8208;activation catalysts through rational defect engineering.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dominated Calendar Aging in Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;dominated plating morphology governs the calendar aging of aqueous zinc metal batteries. Notably, corrosion severity does not directly correlate with aging&#8208;induced degradation. Electrolytes that promote smoother zinc deposition, quantified by a lower plating roughness factor (Prf), exhibit enhanced resistance to calendar aging. Leveraging this insight, an acetatization strategy achieves up to a 49&#8208;fold reduction in calendar aging&#8211;induced degradation.








Abstract
Zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage. While the majority of current research focuses on cyclic aging, the impact of calendar aging on zinc anodes has received far less attention. Here, we reveal that zinc deposition morphology, governed by anion chemistry, plays a decisive role in calendar degradation by amplifying interfacial corrosion and accelerating &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc accumulation. Notably, intrinsic corrosion rates alone do not predict degradation severity; for instance, triflate anion shows low corrosion but induces highly porous deposits and rapid aging. To address this, we propose a comprehensive electrochemical descriptor to quantify deposition morphology beyond traditional morphological characterization. Moreover, we introduce an acetatization strategy that tailors Zn2+ solvation and promotes dense plating, effectively suppressing side reactions and &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc formation. This approach effectively curbs calendar degradation, yielding nearly a 49&#8208;fold improvement in capacity retention. Under demanding conditions (6&#160;h aging intervals per cycle), practical anode&#8208;free Cu||ZnI2 cells (ca. 3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) exhibit high cycling stability, maintaining 96.2% of their initial capacity over 1000&#160;h. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of zinc anode degradation and offer a viable route to address calendar aging in ZMBs.

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter through Steric Pre&#8208;Substitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>

Here, a steric pre-substitution strategy is devised using tert-butylphenyl-functionalized indolo[3,2-b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora-Friedel-Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W-1. The efficiency roll-off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m-2 and 5,000 cd m-2, respectively. This work establishes a pre-substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid-state emission for high-performance MR emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Strategies Applied to the Late&#8208;Stage Modifications of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review explores the potential of mechanochemistry in the late&#8208;stage modification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), offering a comprehensive analysis of methods designed to transform structurally complex molecular scaffolds. By examining the scope, efficiency, and mechanistic aspects of these approaches, the review highlights protocols capable of effectively modifying structurally complex molecular scaffolds. To further assist researchers, we provide a detailed table summarizing the discussed APIs, their respective modifications, and any necessary pre&#8208;functionalizations. This resource should provide a practical guide for selecting suitable substrates to evaluate the pharmaceutical relevance of existing and novel (mechano)chemical methods.</dc:description>
