         <title>Binder&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Polymerization with Controllable Gel&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Transformation in Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling supramolecular polymerization across various length scales through metal&#8208;organic polyhedra in aqueous media enables functional nanomaterial fabrication beyond traditional &#960;&#8208;chromophoric systems. Herein, we present a straightforward strategy to tune the nano&#8208; and microscopic structural evolution of a co&#8208;assembled system. Ga&#8208;MOC ([Ga8(ImDC)12]12&#8208;, ImDC = imidazoledicarboxylate) is introduced as a discrete unit, while the Ni&#8208;ethylenediamine complex [Ni(en)3]2+ (Ni&#8208;en), served as the binder towards supramolecular polymerization. Comprehensive investigations revealed that adjusting the binder ratio in the bicomponent (Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en) co&#8208;assembly process allows precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly. At higher concentrations, this assembly forms a hydrogel above a critical binder ratio. Furthermore, the binder's ratio significantly influences the viscoelastic strength of the hydrogels by modulating the connectivity between the MOCs through hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding. Intriguingly, the hydrogels gradually transformed into crystals without any external stimuli, with different timescales regulated by the binder ratio. Single crystal structure determination reveals a 3D structure composed of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en, extended through charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding (CAHB) interactions, resulting through the transformation from a kinetically controlled gel state to a thermodynamically stable crystal product. This study provides an understanding of binder&#8208;mediated control over nanostructural evolution in co&#8208;assembled MOCs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Controlling supramolecular polymerization across various length scales through metal-organic polyhedra in aqueous media enables functional nanomaterial fabrication beyond traditional &#960;-chromophoric systems. Herein, we present a straightforward strategy to tune the nano- and microscopic structural evolution of a co-assembled system. Ga-MOC ([Ga8(ImDC)12]12-, ImDC = imidazoledicarboxylate) is introduced as a discrete unit, while the Ni-ethylenediamine complex [Ni(en)3]2+ (Ni-en), served as the binder towards supramolecular polymerization. Comprehensive investigations revealed that adjusting the binder ratio in the bicomponent (Ga-MOC and Ni-en) co-assembly process allows precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly. At higher concentrations, this assembly forms a hydrogel above a critical binder ratio. Furthermore, the binder's ratio significantly influences the viscoelastic strength of the hydrogels by modulating the connectivity between the MOCs through hydrogen (H)-bonding. Intriguingly, the hydrogels gradually transformed into crystals without any external stimuli, with different timescales regulated by the binder ratio. Single crystal structure determination reveals a 3D structure composed of Ga-MOC and Ni-en, extended through charge-assisted H-bonding (CAHB) interactions, resulting through the transformation from a kinetically controlled gel state to a thermodynamically stable crystal product.

         <title>How Carbene Ligands Transform AuAg Alloy Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we prepare an AuAg alloy nanocluster ligated by carbene, [Au13Ag12(PPh3)8(BMIm)2I8]SbF6, which is the first of its kind to show higher thermostability and higher sensitivity to light. It is attributed to a unique delocalization of electrons within the frontier orbitals. The Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm anchored on NiFe&#8208;LDH exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the electrosynthesis of urea.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have attracted increasing interest for their special structures and diverse applications. However, developing synthetic strategies and extending the database of NHC&#8208;protected nanoclusters are still challenging tasks. In this work, a novel and rapid synthetic method is developed to prepare AuAg alloy nanocluster ligated by carbene based on the reactivity of nanoclusters. The rod&#8208;like carbene&#8208;capped bimetal nanocluster, [Au13Ag12(PPh3)8(BMIm)2I8]SbF6 (Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm), was achieved and characterized by a series of techniques. The alloy nanocluster consists of two vertex&#8208;sharing icosahedrons and carbene ligands, phosphine ligands, and I atoms. Interestingly, the introduced carbene ligands show strong coordination capabilities with Au, enhancing the interaction between metal core and ligands. To the best of our knowledge, the carbene&#8208;capped Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm nanocluster is the first of its kind to show higher thermostability and higher sensitivity to light compared with the homogeneously capped analogue nanocluster ([Au13Ag12(PPh3)10I8]SbF6). Density functional theory calculations attribute these properties to a unique delocalization of electrons within the frontier orbitals. Finally, the Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm anchored on NiFe&#8208;LDH exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2, achieving a urea production rate of 29.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 34&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V (vs. RHE).

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Manganese Bromides for Photoluminescence and X&#8208;ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most significant challenges of luminescent materials is the thermal quenching (TQ) at high temperature. Understanding the correlation between crystal structure variation and photoluminescence (PL) quenching is significant to achieve anti&#8208;thermal quenching (anti&#8208;TQ) phosphors. Herein, we unveil a universal principle governing switchable TQ and anti&#8208;TQ behaviors in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid manganese bromides. We observed an abnormal anti&#8208;TQ phenomenon when phosphor is excited in the valley of PL excitation (PLE) spectrum (indirect excitation) while TQ phenomenon is observed when excited in the peak and shoulder positions of PLE. Our findings demonstrate that PL intensity is influenced by two variable parameters: the effective Mn&#8208;ligand distance and the shortest Mn&#8208;Mn distance. These excitation&#8208;dependent TQ and anti&#8208;TQ behaviors originate from the relative changes in these distances, which modulate the competition between radiative and nonradiative recombination rates, as evidenced at the molecular level by molecular dynamics simulation. X&#8208;ray activated radioluminescence (RL) also exhibits anti&#8208;TQ behavior, which is analogous to the indirect excitation of PL evolution when excited at PLE valley. These insights bridge the gap between PL and RL properties in 0D manganese halides and offer potential avenues for developing advanced anti&#8208;TQ phosphors, efficient LEDs, and high&#8208;performance scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Kalmanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of kalmanol was achieved by convergent and modular synthetic strategies. Two enantioenriched fragments were assembled by a Grignard reaction/ring&#8208;closing metathesis sequence. The remaining hydroxy groups were installed by precise late&#8208;stage oxidations.







Abstract
Kalmanol (1) is the first isolated kalmane&#8208;type grayanoid featuring a highly oxidized 5/8/5/5 tetracyclic carbon skeleton and 9 contiguous stereocenters. We have accomplished the efficient and asymmetric total synthesis of 1 in 16&#8197;steps from known compounds (20&#8197;steps from commercially available starting materials) by a modular synthetic strategy. A tetracyclic intermediate was prepared in a convergent manner through a Grignard reaction and a subsequent ring&#8208;closing metathesis reaction of two enantiomerically enriched fragments. The polyhydroxy groups were introduced by late&#8208;stage stereo&#8208; and regioselective oxidations.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Cobalt&#8208; or Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrosilylation/Hydroboration of Arylidenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operationally convenient one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed and enantioselective one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylidenecylcopropanes are developed to prepare racemic and enantioenriched 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal that these reactions proceed by metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening regioselective hydrosilylation followed by hydroboration of homoallylsilane intermediates.







Abstract
An operationally convenient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step hydrosilylation/hydroboration reaction of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access racemic 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes. In addition, the corresponding asymmetric reaction is developed with a chiral copper catalyst to prepare 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes with high enantioselectivity by a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure. Mechanistic studies reveal that this difunctionalization process begins with metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of arylidenecyclopropanes to generate homoallylsilane intermediates, followed by regio&#8208; or enantioselective metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of homoallylsilanes to produce skipped borylsilylalkanes. Selective transformations of C&#8722;B and Si&#8722;H bonds in skipped borylsilylalkane products are also demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Operationally convenient one-pot one-step cobalt-catalyzed and enantioselective one-pot two-step copper-catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylidenecylcopropanes are developed to prepare racemic and enantioenriched 1,4-borylsilylalkanes with high regio- and enantioselectivity, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal that these reactions proceed by metal-hydride-catalyzed ring-opening regioselective hydrosilylation followed by hydroboration of homoallylsilane intermediates.

         <title>Batrachopolyenes: Volatile Norsteroids from Femoral Scent Glands of Frogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of volatile steroidal natural products, the batrachopolyenes, have been isolated and identified from torrent frogs. A total synthesis established their structure. These norsteroids contain a unique contracted A&#8208;ring and unusual functionalization across the structural core, which were installed along a divergent total synthetic sequence.







Abstract
Steroid hormones are C18&#8208;C21&#8208;sterane derivatives, featuring the typical 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5 ring system. Here we report on a novel C18&#8208;steroid ring system named batrachane with a contracted A&#8208;ring resulting in a 5&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5 ring arrangement. The isolation, structural elucidation, and total synthesis of three members of the novel batrachopolyene family occurring in the tropical frog genus Odontobatrachus is reported. The batrachopolyenes represent an entirely new collection of volatile steroidal natural products produced by anuran amphibians. Alongside the contracted A&#8208;ring, each member contains a &#916;16&#8208;17 double bond but differs in the central belt of the steroidal structure. To create these atypical structural features, syntheses featuring a combination of Breslow radical chain relay chlorination, Favorskii ring contraction, and Clemmensen reduction proved successful. The occurrence of such compounds in another distal anuran group, the Mantellinae, suggests a more widespread distribution of the batrachane&#8208;type compounds among frogs. The new structural steroid type raises questions concerning steroid biosynthesis and reception, as well as distribution in frogs in general and the structures of their hormones.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence with Bis&#8208;pyclen Yb(III) Chelates: Crown vs. Linear Polyether Linkers in Discrete Heteropolynuclear Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the design and synthesis of pre&#8208;organized ligands combining two lateral bis&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclen macrocycles bridged by either a flexible linear pegylated linker (L2) or a bulkier K22 crown&#8208;ether (L3), and the regioselective formation of their dinuclear Yb complexes. Upconversion (UC) sensitization of Tb upon excitation into the Yb NIR absorption band was evaluated in D2O, showing the heteropolynuclear complexes of L2 to be two times more intense for UC emission compared to those of L3.







Abstract
Ligands combining two lateral bis&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclens were synthesized, using a flexible linear pegylated linker (L2) or a bulkier K22 crown&#8208;ether (L3). A functionalized pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclen (L1) was also prepared as a mononuclear analogue. Coordination behavior of lanthanide cations was studied via NMR titration with Lu for L1, and UV/Vis and luminescence spectroscopy with Yb for L2/L3. Strong coordination of two Yb atoms enabled isolation and spectroscopic characterization of dinuclear complexes in H2O and D2O. Excited state lifetime analysis at 980&#8197;nm revealed strong protection of Yb cations, with no coordinated water molecule. Upon titration of the isolated dinuclear Yb complexes with Tb cations, cooperative upconversion (UC) sensitization of Tb in the visible was observed upon excitation of Yb at 980&#8197;nm in D2O. In the absence of Tb, the Yb complexes also exhibited cooperative luminescence with a weak emission band around 500&#8197;nm upon NIR Yb excitation. Efficient UC with Tb was only observed after thermal treatment, suggesting a slow kinetic of formation of the UC species. [Yb2TbL3] showed weak Tb centered UC emission, while the dinuclear complex of L2 displayed more intense UC emission up to two equivalents of Tb, forming [(Yb2L2)Tbx] (x=1&#8211;2), with the tetranuclear heterometallic complex being the most intense emitter. Log&#8208;Log plot analysis confirmed the two&#8208;photon nature of the UC process.

         <title>A Chemically Powered Rotary Molecular Motor Based on Reversible Oxazepine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report an aniline&#8208;phenol&#8208;based rotary molecular motor that operates via an information ratchet mechanism. The 360&#176; directional rotation about a single covalent bond can be chemically driven by reversible oxazepine formation. Both the oxazepine formation and hydrolysis steps are kinetically gated via dynamic kinetic resolution, arising from the kinetic bias of chiral catalysts for enantiomers.







Abstract
While biological machines are powered mainly by chemical transformations, chemically driven artificial rotary motor systems are very limited. Here, we report an aniline&#8208;phenol&#8208;based rotary molecular motor that operates via an information ratchet mechanism. The 360&#176; directional rotation about a single covalent bond can be chemically driven by reversible oxazepine formation. Both the oxazepine formation and hydrolysis steps are kinetically gated via dynamic kinetic resolution, arising from the kinetic bias of chiral catalysts for enantiomers. Given the 95&#8201;% ee (97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5) and 88&#8201;% ee (94&#8201;:&#8201;6) of the individual gating steps of motor analogues, the overall directionality ratio could be calculated to be 91.7&#8201;:&#8201;8.3 (97.5&#8201;%&#215;94&#8201;%&#8776;91.7&#8201;%), which means that the motor will make one mistake (backward rotation) approximately every 11 to 12 turns.

         <title>Cooperative Active Sites on Ag2Pt3TiS6 for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Ammonia Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a new multi&#8208;element catalyst (Ag2Pt3TiS6) with enhanced ammonia oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction mass activities compared to Pt/C. Through density functional theory calculations, we identify that this arises from active site motifs consisting of Pt and Ti atoms that work cooperatively. The bifunctional capability of Ag2Pt3TiS6 is demonstrated as both the cathode and anode in a direct ammonia fuel cell.







Abstract
Ammonia has attracted considerable interest as a hydrogen carrier that can help decarbonize global energy networks. Key to realizing this is the development of low temperature ammonia fuel cells for the on&#8208;demand generation of electricity. However, the efficiency of such systems is significantly impaired by the sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report the design of a bifunctional Ag2Pt3TiS6 electrocatalyst that facilitates both reactions at mass activities exceeding that of commercial Pt/C. Through comprehensive density functional theory calculations, we identify that active site motifs composed of Pt and Ti atoms work cooperatively to catalyze ORR and AOR. Notably, in situ shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) experiments indicate a decreased propensity for *NOx formation and hence an increased resistance toward catalyst poisoning for AOR. Employing Ag2Pt3TiS6 as both the cathode and anode, we constructed a low temperature ammonia fuel cell with a high peak power density of 8.71&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low Pt loading of 0.45&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our findings demonstrate a pathway towards the rational design of effective electrocatalysts with multi&#8208;element active sites that work cooperatively.

Our findings demonstrate a pathway towards the rational design of effective electrocatalysts with multi-element active sites that work cooperatively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Generation of Microwire Heterojunctions with Flexible Optical Waveguide and Hydration&#8208;Mediated Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydration&#8208;mediated molecular engineering strategy has been used for the in situ generation of flexible heterojunctions that display ultralow&#8208;loss optical waveguides, high flexibility and controllable emission sequences. This integration of the benefits of flexibility and heterojunctions approach offers the possibility for developing photonic information encryption systems.







Abstract
Flexible heterojunctions based on molecular systems are in high demand for applications in photonics, electronics, and smart materials, but fabrication challenges have hindered progress. Herein, we present an in situ approach to creating optical heterojunctions using hydration&#8208;mediated flexible molecular crystals. These hydrated multi&#8208;component molecular solids display strong blue emitting optical waveguides with minimal optical loss (0.005 dB/&#956;m) and excellent flexibility (elastic modulus: 3.87&#8197;GPa). The water&#8208;mediated process enables the molecular microwires with tunable elastic and plastic deformation, as well as reversible uptake and release of lattice water, facilitating the formation of flexible heterojunctions. Spectral analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that these microwires exhibit both photochromism and color&#8208;tunable dual emission (fluorescence and phosphorescence), expanding their utility in photonic information encoding. Therefore, this work introduces a hydration&#8208;mediated molecular engineering strategy for fabricating crystalline heterojunctions with on&#8208;demand processability and controllable emission sequences, enabling optical signal manipulation at the micro/nanoscale.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Interpenetration&#8208;Free Mesoporous Aromatic Frameworks by Manipulating Catalysts as Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning the size of the catalyst ligand, a mesoporous aromatic framework, PAF&#8208;333, was obtained. It was found that the steric hindrance of larger&#8208;sized ligands avoided the framework interpenetration. Thanks to its large pore volume (3.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), it could adsorb 13.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% of hydrogen at 77&#8197;K, 100&#8197;bar and 0.537&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 of methane at 298&#8197;K, 98&#8197;bar, making it an ideal candidate for large&#8208;scale on&#8208;board methane storage.







Abstract
Reticular chemistry allows the design and synthesis of mesoporous networks by extending the size of the building blocks. However, interpenetration of the nets easily happens against the designed mesoporous networks, thereby falling short of achieving the intended specific surface area and pore size. Controlling the framework interpenetration has always been a challenge in the synthesis section of reticular chemistry. In this work, based on our previously reported type of highly porous aromatic frameworks (named PAF&#8208;1), we extended the tetrahedral building blocks to target an iso&#8208;reticular mesoporous PAF&#8208;333. A series of Ni(0) ligands with different sizes were employed to confirm that suitable&#8208;sized catalyst ligands could successfully inhibit skeleton interpenetration in the coupling reaction through the steric hindrance effect. The obtained mesoporous PAF&#8208;333 possessed a pore size of approximately 3.2&#8197;nm matching well with the value from the predicted non&#8208;interpenetrated structure. PAF&#8208;333 showed great high&#8208;pressure hydrogen and methane storage potential with a 13.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2 uptake at 77&#8197;K, 100&#8197;bar and a 0.537&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 CH4 uptake at 298&#8197;K, 98&#8197;bar, ranking at the top of the reported porous adsorbents in the gas storage applications.

         <title>Unsymmetric Protonation Driven Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis in Supramolecular Photocatalysts via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst (SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+) with an unsymmetric protonation structure significantly boosts H2O2 production from water and air. This design enhances charge separation and promotes dual active sites for Yeager&#8208;type O2 adsorption, enabling a selective one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron ORR pathway. SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ shows an H2O2 rate of 4666.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 100&#8201;% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. However, its performance is often hindered by low selectivity and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report an anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, featuring an unsymmetric protonation structure for H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air. The introduction of unsymmetric protonation disrupts the initial mirror symmetry of SADF, significantly enhancing the molecular dipole and facilitating efficient charge separation and electron transfer. Additionally, this modification increases the hydrophilicity of SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, enabling the interaction of water and dissolved oxygen with the catalytic sites. The altered electron density distribution creates numerous dual active sites for Yeager&#8208;type O2 adsorption, facilitating an efficient ORR towards H2O2 via a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ achieves an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production at a rate of 4666.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, with a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) of 1.35&#8201;%, surpassing most organic photocatalytic systems. Furthermore, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic antibacterial activity, achieving 100&#8201;% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus within 60&#8197;min.

         <title>Thiosulfate&#8208;Mediated Polysulfide Redox for Energetic Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides significantly impeded the performance of sulfur&#8208;based aqueous batteries (SABs). We proposed an effective redox regulation strategy via a thiosulfate&#8208;mediated ligand&#8208;chain interaction within the K2S2O3 electrolyte, which accelerates the polysulfide redox process (S0/S2&#8722;) and provides an additional capacity contribution through the thiosulfate redox pair (S2O32&#8722;/S4O62&#8722;). The thiosulfate&#8208;mediated SAB exhibits an unprecedented K+ storage capacity of 2470&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 616&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgS+Zn&#8722;1, surpassing both organic K&#8211;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;based aqueous batteries (SABs) are regarded as promising candidates for safe, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy storage. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides pose a significant challenge to the practical performance of SABs. Herein, we report a unique redox regulation strategy that leverages thiosulfate&#8208;mediated ligand&#8208;chain interaction to accelerate the polysulfide redox process (S0/S2&#8722;). The S2O32&#8722; species in the electrolyte can induce the rapid reduction of polysulfide through a spontaneous chemical reaction with sulfur species, while facilitating the reversible oxidation of short&#8208;chain sulfides. Moreover, the thiosulfate redox pair (S2O32&#8722;/S4O62&#8722;) within the K2S2O3 electrolyte contributes additional capacity at higher potential (E0 &gt;0&#8197;V vs SHE). Consequently, the elaborate SAB delivers an unprecedented K+ storage capacity of 2470&#8197;mAh&#8201;gs&#8722;1, coupled with a long cycling life exceeding 1000 cycles. Remarkably, thiosulfate&#8208;mediated SAB achieves an energy density of 616&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgS+Zn&#8722;1, surpassing both organic K&#8211;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems. This work elucidates the mechanism underlying the thiosulfate&#8208;mediated polysulfide redox process, thereby opening a pathway for the development of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing both organic K&#8211;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur-based aqueous batteries (SABs) are regarded as promising candidates for safe, low-cost, and high-energy storage. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides pose a significant challenge to the practical performance of SABs. Herein, we report a unique redox regulation strategy that leverages thiosulfate-mediated ligand-chain interaction to accelerate the polysulfide redox process (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/S&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). The S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species in the electrolyte can induce the rapid reduction of polysulfide through a spontaneous chemical reaction with sulfur species, while facilitating the reversible oxidation of short-chain sulfides. Moreover, the thiosulfate redox pair (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) within the K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte contributes additional capacity at higher potential (E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt;0&#8197;V vs SHE). Consequently, the elaborate SAB delivers an unprecedented K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage capacity of 2470&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, coupled with a long cycling life exceeding 1000 cycles. Remarkably, thiosulfate-mediated SAB achieves an energy density of 616&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;S+Zn&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing both organic K&#8211;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems. This work elucidates the mechanism underlying the thiosulfate-mediated polysulfide redox process, thereby opening a pathway for the development of high-energy aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxotungstate Featuring Zinc&#8208;Ion&#8208;Triggered Structural Transformation as An Efficient Electrolyte Additive for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a rare instance of a soluble high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate exhibiting Zn2+&#8208;triggered structural transformation from 0D nanocluster to 2D layer in ZnSO4 solution. Further, we showcase that such a kind of polyoxometalate, possessing Zn2+&#8208;triggered structural transformation properties, represents a new&#8208;type and promising class of additives for aqueous zinc battery electrolytes with significant potential applications.







Abstract
It is promising but still challenging for the widespread application of aqueous zinc batteries due to the poor reversibility of the zinc anode caused by prevalent dendrite growth and pronounced interfacial side reactions. Herein, we report a rare soluble and water&#8208;stable high&#8208;nuclearity {Nd9Si4W39} polyoxotungstate. Interestingly, upon encountering Zn2+ ions, the discrete {Nd9Si4W39} nanocluster undergoes a structural transformation to form an infinitely extended cluster&#8208;based {[Zn(H2O)4]3[Nd9Si4W39]2} two&#8208;dimensional honeycomb layer, with which atomic&#8208;level Zn2+ ion effects in reconstructing the layer are determined. More interestingly, we demonstrate that the structural transformation property renders the {Nd9Si4W39} cluster an efficient electrolyte additive for aqueous zinc batteries, enabling the formation of the 2D layer as a protective layer on the zinc anode, significantly enhancing the reversibility of the zinc anode. Compared to the pristine Zn//Zn symmetric battery, the Zn//Zn symmetric battery with the {Nd9Si4W39} additive exhibits an extended lifespan of over 2000&#8197;hours at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the formation of the protective layer effectively promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits zinc agglomeration, dendrite growth, and side reactions, thereby enabling the zinc anode to exhibit high reversibility and long&#8208;term service life.

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Fused Cyanoindone: A Superior Building Block for Designing Ultra&#8208;Narrow Bandgap Electron Acceptor with Long&#8208;Range Ordered Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel benzothiadiazole&#8208;fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability was designed to synthesize an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap acceptor BTC&#8208;2. Benefiting from long&#8208;range ordered stacking induced by BTC, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTC&#8208;2 based organic photovoltaic device delivered a 17.17&#8201;% efficiency with a photocurrent of 30.34&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and achieved a light utilization efficiency of 4.88&#8201;% in binary semi&#8208;transparent application.







Abstract
There are great demands of developing ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors for multifunctional electronic devices, particularly semi&#8208;transparent organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for building&#8208;integrated applications. However, current ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap materials applied in OPVs, primarily based on electron&#8208;rich cores, exhibit defects of high&#8208;lying energy levels and inferior performance. We herein proposed a novel strategy by designing the benzothiazole&#8208;fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability as the terminal to synthesize the acceptor BTC&#8208;2. The BTC unit imparts red&#8208;shifted absorption up to 1000&#8197;nm to BTC&#8208;2, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and the quinoid resonance effect. Additionally, BTC&#8208;2 features deep&#8208;lying energy levels with the highest occupied molecular orbital level of &#8722;5.81&#8197;eV, due to the ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of BTC. Furthermore, BTC&#8208;2 exhibits long&#8208;range ordering in both molecular packing and macroscopic blend morphology, resulting from shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder packing of two BTC units, leading to an ultra&#8208;long exciton lifetime over 1.1&#8197;ns. These superiorities facilitated a 17.17&#8201;% efficiency in the binary OPV device with an extremely high photocurrent of 30.34&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, representing the best performance for ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors, and a record light utilization efficiency of 4.88&#8201;% in binary semi&#8208;transparent systems. Overall, BTC is a superior building block for designing ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors.

         <title>Transmembrane Delivery of an Aryl Azopyrazole Photo&#8208;switchable Ion Transporter Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delivery of anion relay transporters across lipid membranes using a synthetic flippase is reported. These second generation photo&#8208;responsive relays incorporate an aryl azopyrazole photo&#8208;switch enabling greatly improved reversible photo&#8208;switching of the ion transport activity in&#8197;situ, in real time.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive synthetic ionophores allow for spatial and temporal control over ion transport, with promise for applications in targeted therapy. Relay transporters have emerged as a new class of ion transporters &#8208; these are anchored carriers that sit in both leaflets of the bilayer and mediate transport across the membrane by passing ions between them. The relays are themselves membrane impermeable, and so must be incorporated into the membrane during vesicle preparation. Here we show that relay transporters can be delivered to both sides of the membrane of vesicles using a synthetic flippase. By incorporating an aryl azopyrazole photo&#8208;switch into the movable arm of the relay transporters the ion transport activity can be very efficiently and reversibly switched between off and on states. This control is achieved by extension and contraction of their movable arms via photo&#8208;isomerization of the central aryl azopyrazole moiety, hence modulating the ability of the relays to pass ions across the membrane.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminophore Switches Photodynamic Processes via Protein Complexation for Biomarker&#8208;Activatable Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared Type&#8208;I photodynamic chemiluminescent&#8208;protein complex (HEDPN) is designed which can be specifically activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed nitroreductase for chemiluminescence&#8208;guided PDT.







Abstract
Despite the potential in cancer therapy, phototheranostic agents often face two challenges: limited diagnostic sensitivity due to tissue autofluorescence and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy due to the Type&#8208;II photodynamic process with the heavy oxygen reliance. In contrast, chemiluminescent theranostic agents without the requirement of real&#8208;time light excitation can address the issue of tissue autofluorescence, which however have been rarely reported for photodynamic therapy (PDT), not to mention less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type&#8208;I PDT. In this work, we synthesize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophores with the specific binding towards human serum albumin (HSA) to form chemiluminophore&#8208;protein complex for cancer detection and photodynamic therapy. Interestingly, after the complexation with HSA, the chemiluminescence (CL) intensities of chemiluminophores are enhanced by over 10&#8208;fold; meanwhile, the photodynamic process switches from Type&#8208;II (singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation dominated) to Type&#8208;I (superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical dominated), while the previously reported activated chemiluminophore with non&#8208;specific HSA binding can't switch photodynamic process. Based on the optimal chemiluminophore, a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable CL probe&#8208;protein complex is synthesized, which specially turns on its CL and Type&#8208;I PDT in hypoxic tumors for precision therapy.

     alt="Near-Infrared Chemiluminophore Switches Photodynamic Processes via Protein Complexation for Biomarker-Activatable Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared Type-I photodynamic chemiluminescent-protein complex (HEDP&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed which can be specifically activated by the tumor-overexpressed nitroreductase for chemiluminescence-guided PDT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential in cancer therapy, phototheranostic agents often face two challenges: limited diagnostic sensitivity due to tissue autofluorescence and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy due to the Type-II photodynamic process with the heavy oxygen reliance. In contrast, chemiluminescent theranostic agents without the requirement of real-time light excitation can address the issue of tissue autofluorescence, which however have been rarely reported for photodynamic therapy (PDT), not to mention less oxygen-dependent Type-I PDT. In this work, we synthesize near-infrared (NIR) chemiluminophores with the specific binding towards human serum albumin (HSA) to form chemiluminophore-protein complex for cancer detection and photodynamic therapy. Interestingly, after the complexation with HSA, the chemiluminescence (CL) intensities of chemiluminophores are enhanced by over 10-fold; meanwhile, the photodynamic process switches from Type-II (singlet-oxygen-generation dominated) to Type-I (superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical dominated), while the previously reported activated chemiluminophore with non-specific HSA binding can't switch photodynamic process. Based on the optimal chemiluminophore, a nitroreductase-activatable CL probe-protein complex is synthesized, which specially turns on its CL and Type-I PDT in hypoxic tumors for precision therapy. Thus, this study provides a complexation strategy to improve phototheranostic performance of chemiluminophores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption Kinetics and Capacity of a Stable CeF3@Ni3N Heterostructure for Methanol Electro&#8208;Reforming Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable CeF3@Ni3N heterostructure with abundant interfaces is fabricated, which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and stability under industrial current density for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production. CeF3@Ni3N heterostructure can adjust electron distribution and modulate surface adsorption kinetics/capability of methanol and OH&#8722;, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Alkaline methanol&#8208;water electrolysis system is regarded as an appealing strategy for electro&#8208;reforming methanol into formate and producing hydrogen with low energy&#8208;consumption compared with alkaline water electrolysis. However, stability and selectivity under high current densities for practical application remain challenging. Herein, a CeF3@Ni3N nanosheets array anchored on carbon cloth (CeF3@Ni3N/CC) was fabricated. The gradual extrusion of F species from Ni(OH)2 lattices can stabilize hierarchical structure and construct abundant heterostructure interfaces. Moreover, CeF3 can modulate electron distribution of Ni3N, thus simultaneously enhancing the surface adsorption kinetics and capability of methanol and OH&#8722;, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity and selectivity. Therefore, bifunctional CeF3@Ni3N/CC exhibits low potential of 1.43&#8197;V at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, along with high stability over 72&#8197;h and high faradaic efficiency (FEs) in MOR, as well as an overpotential of 76&#8197;mV to achieve 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, membrane&#8208;free CeF3@Ni3N/CC||CeF3@Ni3N/CC cell for MOR||HER delivers high electrocatalytic activity, long&#8208;term stability and FEs at high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This study highlights the importance of optimizing surface adsorption behavior of active species, as well as rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production.

         <title>Counterions Determine if Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Convert SO2 to Sulfate or Reversibly Adsorb It</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different counterions modulate the solid&#8208;state SO2 adsorption behavior in M6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (M=Pd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II)). Certain anions induce reversible SO2&#8208;adsorption, while nitrate promotes its transformation to sulfate at room temperature. Among these cages, Pd6L8 exhibits the highest cavity&#8208;mediated SO2 conversion, excellent stability, and is quantitatively regenerated.







Abstract
The continuous emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere damages the environment, air quality, and public health worldwide. To mitigate their impact, materials that capture and chemically inactivate gases are required; however, integrating and precisely controlling both abilities within a single material remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that switching between SO2&#8208;physisorption and chemisorption is possible for porous materials by using different counterions, as illustrated with a series of Pd6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs). Pd&#8208;MOCs bearing BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, or SO42&#8722; expressed reversible adsorption (up to 3.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), cyclability, and SO2/CO2 selectivity. NO3&#8722; promoted conversion of SO2 to sulfate, as corroborated with M6L8 cages built on Co(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) ions. Noteworthy, the nitrate derivative of Pd6L8 captures 6.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 of SO2, cleanly transforms it to SO42&#8722; within its cavity in 94&#8201;% yield at room temperature, it is quantitatively regenerated, and tolerates humid SO2; such qualities are unprecedented for SO2 adsorbents. The deliberate use of counterions for modulating adsorption could be applied to charged MOFs, COFs, or POCs, potentially leading to the development of new reactivity or catalysis pathways for advanced applications against contaminant gases.

         <title>Structurally Asymmetric Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn Node in Metal&#8211;Organic Layers on Carbon Nitride Support for CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange of high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes induced Jahn&#8211;Teller lattice distortion at adjacent Ni sites, significantly enhancing CO2 photoreduction by promoting CO2 adsorption through enhanced orbital overlap and facilitating charge carrier migration via additional spin&#8208;polarized electrons.







Abstract
The Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) effect&#8208;induced lattice distortion presents an advantageous approach to tailor the electronic structure and CO2 adsorption properties of catalytic centers, consequently conferring desirable photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, achieving precise J&#8211;T distortion control over catalytic sites to enhance CO2 adsorption/activation and target&#8208;product desorption remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we successfully induced J&#8211;T lattice distortion in neighboring Ni sites by exchanging high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes. EXAFS results and DFT simulations revealed that the highly asymmetric Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes induced structural contraction (shortened Ni&#8722;O bonds) in the adjacent Ni&#8722;O lattice. The magnetic hysteresis loop (M&#8722;H) confirmed that the introduction of Mn2+ increased the number of spin electrons, thereby increasing the magnetization intensity. The spin mismatch between photogenerated electrons and holes suppressed charge recombination. Significantly, the d orbitals of the Ni sites in the Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes exhibited strong orbital hybridization with the p orbitals of CO2, as evidenced by the enhanced d&#8208;p orbital overlap, facilitating rapid CO2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, the sample featuring lattice&#8208;mismatched Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes exhibited an 8.79&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production rate compared to the Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes, in the absence of cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents.

In this work, we successfully induced J&#8211;T lattice distortion in neighboring Ni sites by exchanging high-spin Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes. EXAFS results and DFT simulations revealed that the highly asymmetric Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes induced structural contraction (shortened Ni&#8722;O bonds) in the adjacent Ni&#8722;O lattice. The magnetic hysteresis loop (M&#8722;H) confirmed that the introduction of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increased the number of spin electrons, thereby increasing the magnetization intensity. The spin mismatch between photogenerated electrons and holes suppressed charge recombination. Significantly, the d orbitals of the Ni sites in the Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes exhibited strong orbital hybridization with the p orbitals of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as evidenced by the enhanced d-p orbital overlap, facilitating rapid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation. Consequently, the sample featuring lattice-mismatched Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes exhibited an 8.79-fold enhancement in CO production rate compared to the Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes, in the absence of cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P Metathesis: A Direct Route to Structurally Constrained, Cationic PIII Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structurally constrained, cationic PIII compound with the OCO dianionic pincer&#8208;type ligand [LP][SbCl4] was prepared in a single step via the Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P metathesis reaction of the LSb&#8208;Cl with PCl3. The preliminary reactivity of [LP][SbCl4] with water, ammonia, and amines showed that the [SbCl4]&#8722; is not innocent in these reactions. Changing the [SbCl4]&#8722; to [Cb]&#8722; anion, rerouted the reactivity of the resulting [LP][Cb] with water, alcohols, ammonia, and amines to the [LP]+ cation only. In the case of PhOH and PhNH2 activation, the reactions were found to be thermoneutral.







Abstract
Structurally constrained, cationic PIII compound [LP][SbCl4] with an OCO pincer&#8208;type ligand (L) having a central carbene donor was directly synthesized via an Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P metathesis reaction between PCl3 and LSb&#8208;Cl. [LP][SbCl4] was isolated and its reactivity with small molecules (ROH and RNH2) was studied, showing that [SbCl4]&#8722; is not an innocent counter anion, but an active participant in these reactions. When the [SbCl4]&#8722; was replaced with the [CB11H12]&#8722; ([Cb]&#8722;) anion, the reactions were redirected to [LP]+ cation only. The reactions with alcohols and amines led to the equilibrium between the products of the formal E&#8722;H (E=O, N) bond oxidative addition to the P&#8208;center and products of the P&#8208;center/ligand&#8208;assisted bond activation. Remarkably, [LP]+ activated the PhO&#8722;H and PhN(H)&#8722;H bonds in a reversible, thermoneutral fashion.

         <title>A Hollowed&#8208;Out Heterometallic Cluster for Catalytic Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural lanthanide&#8208;nickel clusters Ln132Ni78 (Ln=Gd, Eu) were synthesized by the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ln3+ and Ni2+ in the presence of iminodiacetate. Both clusters feature a hollow truncated tetrahedral structure with trumpet&#8208;shaped passageways that connect the exterior and the interior of the cluster cage. The solution&#8208;stable cluster has been shown to catalyze size&#8208;selective Knoevenagel condensation and one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component synthesis of 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;containing clusters are synthetically challenging and with significant chemical and materials applications. Herein, two isostructural heterometallic clusters of the formula (NO3)12@[Ln132Ni78(OH)292(IDA)48(CH3COO)96(NO3)12(H2O)78]Cl44&#8901;xH2O&#8901;yCH3OH (IDA=iminodiacetate; Ln=Gd 1, x=110, y=0; Ln=Eu 2, x=95, y=40) were obtained via co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ln3+ (Gd3+ or Eu3+) and Ni2+ in the presence of iminodiacetate (IDA). Crystallographic studies show that each features a truncated tetrahedral core of Ln132Ni78 within which a void of 1.1&#8197;nm in diameter; connecting the central cage and its exterior are four trumpet&#8208;like passageways surface&#8208;decorated with dinuclear units of [Gd(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2Gd]. Mass spectroscopic analyses indicate that both clusters maintained their structural integrity in aqueous solution, with cryo&#8208;electron microscopy providing the most convincing visual evidence in support of the cluster&#8216;s solution stability. Size&#8208;selective Knoevenagel condensation, believed to occur in the passageways on the basis of experimental and molecular modeling results, was achieved in the presence of 1. The application of 1 as a uniquely structured molecular reactor and a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst was further illustrated by the one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component synthesis of biologically and pharmaceutically significant 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.

         <title>Crystal Modulation of Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide toward Long&#8208;Enduring Anionic Redox with Fast Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

An innovative crystal modulation strategy was proposed and implemented on a Mn&#8208;based cathode Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 with highly exposed {010} active facets and reinforced Mn&#8722;O bond, facilitating enduring anionic redox activity with fast kinetics. The robust structural stability and zero&#8208;strain behavior with ultra&#8208;low volume variation (0.1&#8197;C: 1.75&#8201;%, 1&#8197;C: 0.31&#8201;%, 5&#8197;C: 0.04&#8201;%) are directly revealed via advanced nondestructive time&#8208;resolved operando 2D&#8208;XRD.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with anionic redox reactions hold great potential for energy storage applications due to their ultra&#8208;high capacity and cost effectiveness. However, achieving high capacity requires overcoming challenges such as oxygen&#8208;redox failure, sluggish kinetics, and structural degradation. Herein, we employ an innovative crystal modulation strategy, using Mn&#8208;based Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 as a representative cathode material, which shows that the highly exposed {010} active facets enable an enhanced rate capability (119.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C) with fast kinetics. Meanwhile, the reinforced Mn&#8722;O bond inhibits excessive oxidation of lattice oxygen and O&#8722;O cohesion loss, stabilizing and maintaining a long&#8208;enduring reversible oxygen&#8208;redox activity (100&#8201;% high capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C and 84.28&#8201;% retention after 300&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C). Time&#8208;resolved operando two&#8208;dimensional X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the robust structural stability, zero&#8208;strain behavior, and suppressed phase transition with ultra&#8208;low volume variation during cycling at different rates (0.1&#8197;C: 1.75&#8201;%, 1&#8197;C: 0.31&#8201;%, 5&#8197;C: 0.04&#8201;%). Additionally, the full cell coupled with hard carbon achieves a high energy density of approximately 211&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with superior performance. This work highlights the significance of crystal modulation and presents a universal approach in developing Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes with stable anionic redox for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bulk stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers by the coordination of ZrCl4 with tunable spirocyclic phosphoric acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over stereochemistry in poly(vinyl ether)s leads to a notable change in their physical properties, yet remains a grand challenge. Here, we demonstrate the bulk stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid (SPA). The widely variable substituents in SPAs exert a profound impact on the stereochemical and activity outcome of the polymerization: the % m of poly(vinyl ether)s linearly increases with the Hammett substituent constant (&#963;) of SPAs; the catalytic activity increases with the &#963;; the large steric hindrance groups lead to decreased polymerization activity. Mechanism studies suggest that the coordination of ZrCl4 with three equivalents of SPAs generates the chiral complex. The complex can abstract chlorine from the initiator/chain end to form the chiral ion pair allowing the selective facial addition of incoming monomers. The catalyst system features characteristics of no solvent, low loads, high tacticity control, high monomer scope, and recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Blue Color Purity of Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes with the Assistance of F&#183;&#183;&#183;H Interaction towards High&#8208;Performance Blue Phosphorescent OLEDs with EQE over 33%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the various challenges in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), simultaneously achieving high efficiency, a long lifespan, and a narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) in blue OLEDs remains a significant hurdle. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to improve the color purity of tetradentate Pt(II) complexes with the assistance of F&#183;&#183;&#183;H interaction by incorporating trifluoromethyl (&#8208;CF3) groups into the well&#8208;known blue tetradentate Pt(II) phosphorescent complex. The results show that the different substitution positions of &#8208;CF3 have significantly varying effects on the FWHM values of the complexes; specifically, introducing &#8208;CF3 on the benzene ring of carbazole effectively reduces the FWHM, while introducing it on the benzene ring linked to the carbene unit has a minimal impact. When utilized in a mixed host system of SiCzCz/SiTrzCz2, the OLEDs with these new complexes as emitters demonstrated maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 27.1%, 33.8%, and 27.6% for PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;1, PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2, and PtON&#8208;2CF3, respectively, with excellent color purity (CIEy &#8776; 0.14 for the PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2 based device). Notably, the device based on PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2 matched the stability of the benchmark PtON&#8208;TBBI complex.This work offers an important guideline for the design of high efficient Pt(II) phosphorescent complexes with good blue color purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rendering Proteins Fluorescent Inconspicuously: Genetically Encoded 4&#8208;Cyanotryptophan Conserves Their Structure and Enables the Detection of Ligand Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanotryptophans (CN&#8208;Trp) are privileged multimodal reporters on protein structure. They are similar in size to the canonical amino acid tryptophan and some of them exhibit bright fluorescence which responds sensitively to changes in the environment. We selected aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases specific for 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp for high&#8208;yield in vivo production of proteins with a single, site&#8208;specifically introduced nitrile label. The absorption maximum of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp is distinct from Trp, allowing the selective excitation of its intense fluorescence. 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp fluoresces in the visible range with an intensity rivalling that of 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;coumarin. Crystal structures of maltose binding protein demonstrate near&#8208;complete structural conservation when a native buried Trp residue is replaced by 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp. Besides presenting an inconspicuous tag for live cell microscopy, the high fluorescence of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp enables measurements of subnanomolar ligand binding affinities in isotropic solution, as demonstrated by the complex between rapamycin and the peptidyl&#8211;prolyl isomerase FKBP12 furnished with a 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp residue in the substrate binding pocket. Furthermore, 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp residues positioned at different locations of a protein containing multiple tryptophan residues permits using fluorescence quenching experiments to detect the proximity of individual Trp residues to the binding site of aromatic ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Enhanced Metallopolymer Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of polymer electrolytes is seriously hindered by the inferior Li+ ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number (tLi+), and poor interfacial stability. Herein, a structurally novel metallopolymer is designed and synthesized by exploiting a molybdenum (Mo) paddle&#8208;wheel complex as a tetratopic linker to bridge organic and inorganic moieties at molecular level. The prepared metallopolymer possesses combined merits of outstanding mechanical and thermal stability, as well as a low glass transition temperature (Tg &lt; &#8211;50 &#176;C). Based on this metallopolymer, an advanced metal&#8208;organic coordination enhanced metallopolymer electrolyte (MPE) is developed for constructing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the unsaturated coordination of Mo atoms, the uniformly distributed Mo&#8208;polyoxometalates (Mo&#8208;POMs) in metallopolymer skeleton can effectively bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI&#8208;) and promote the dissociation of Li salts. Moreover, dynamic metal&#8208;organic coordination bonds endow the MPE with re&#8208;processability and self&#8208;healing, enabling it to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. Consequently, the MPE achieves a competitive ionic conductivity of 0.712 mS cm&#8208;1 (25 &#176;C), a high tLi+ (0.625), and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt; 5.0 V). This study presents a unique MPE design based on metal&#8208;organic coordination enhanced strategy, providing a promising solution for developing wide&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Magneto&#8208;chiroptical Effects through Introducing Chiral Transition&#8208;metal Complex Cations to Lead Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interplay between chirality with magnetism can break both the space and time inversion symmetry and have wide applications in information storage, photodetectors, multiferroics and spintronics. Herein, we report the chiral transition&#8208;metal complex cation&#8208;based lead halide, R&#8208;CDPB and S&#8208;CDPB. In contrast with the traditional chiral metal halides with organic cations, a novel strategy for chirality transfer from the transition&#8208;metal complex cation to the lead halide framework is developed. The chiral complex cations directly participate the band structure and introduce the d&#8208;d transitions and tunable magneto&#8208;chiroptical effects in both the ultraviolet and full visible range into R&#8208;CDPB and S&#8208;CDPB. Most importantly, the coupling between magnetic moment of the complex cation and chiroptical properties is confirmed by the magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism. For the band&#8208;edge transition, the unprecedented modulation of +514% for S&#8208;CDPB and &#8208;474% for R&#8208;CDPB was achieved at &#8208;1.3 Tesla. Our findings demonstrate a novel strategy to combine chirality with magnetic moment, and provide a versatile material platform towards magneto&#8208;chiroptical and chiro&#8208;spintronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedited SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitor Discovery Through Modular &#8216;Direct&#8208;To&#8208;Biology&#8217; Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive fragment (RF) screening has emerged as an efficient method for ligand discovery across the proteome, irrespective of a target&#8217;s perceived tractability. To date, however, the efficiency of subsequent optimisation campaigns has largely been low&#8208;throughput, constrained by the need for synthesis and purification of target compounds. We report a high&#8208;throughput platform for &#8216;direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology&#8217; (D2B) screening of cysteine&#8208;targeting chloroacetamide RFs, wherein synthesis is performed in 384&#8208;well plates allowing direct assessment in downstream biological assays without purification. Here, the developed platform was used to optimise inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (MPro), an established drug target for the treatment of COVID&#8208;19. An initial RF hit was developed into a series of potent inhibitors, and further exploration using D2B screening enabled a &#8216;switch&#8217; to a reversible inhibitor series. This example of ligand discovery for MPro illustrates the acceleration that D2B chemistry can offer for optimising RFs towards covalent inhibitor candidates, as well as providing future impetus to explore the evolution of RFs into non&#8208;covalent ligands.</dc:description>

This example of ligand discovery for MPro illustrates the acceleration that D2B chemistry can offer for optimising RFs towards covalent inhibitor candidates, as well as providing future impetus to explore the evolution of RFs into non-covalent ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Induced Charge Compensation effect for Boosting Photocatalytic Water Splitting in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising for photocatalytic water splitting, but their performance is often constrained by inefficient charge separation due to the high electron localization nature of polar imine bonds. In this study, we have optimized the electron delocalization across the imine linkage within a COF by implementing a charge compensation effect. This effect&#160;is achieved when a strong electron&#8208;donating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene linker is directly attached to the iminic carbon of a zinc&#8208;porphyrinic COF. This modification significantly reduces the electron binding effect within the imine bonds of the COF, facilitating both in&#8208;plane charge separation and out&#8208;plane charge transfer to the catalytic site. Conversely, the use of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pyrizine linker aggravates the electron localization at the imine linkage in the ZnP&#8208;Pz variant. Consequently, ZnP&#8208;Tt shows a substantially improved photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting activity under visible light irradiation, with a hydrogen evolution of 44288 &#177; 2280 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 in 4 h, which exceeds the ZnP&#8208;Pz counterpart by a factor of 10. These results offer fresh perspectives for the design of imine&#8208;based COFs to overcome their limitations in charge separation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Ultrafast Deposition Kinetics within Bi&#8208;Tailored Core&#8208;Shell Structured Carbon Nanofibers for Highly Efficient and Ultrastable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal anodes (SMA), featuring high energy content, low electrochemical potential and easy availability, are a compelling option for sustainable energy storage. However, notorious sodium dendrite and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) have largely retarded their widespread implantation. Herein, porous amorphous carbon fiber embedded with Bi nanoparticles in nanopores (Bi@NC) was rationally designed as a 3D host for SMA. In&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations, along with theoretical simulations unlock that the in&#8208;situ formed Na&#8208;Bi alloy significantly accelerates sodium metal nucleation and sodium ion diffusion kinetics, enabling uniform sodium plating within the void spaces and a stable SEI outside the carbon fiber. Particularly, the Bi@NC electrode achieved a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.99% at 3 mA cm&#8208;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8208;2 in half&#8208;cell tests, a cycle life of 1000 hours at 5 mA cm&#8208;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8208;2, and sustained performance over 600 cycles under harsh conditions under 30 mA cm&#8208;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8208;2 within symmetrical cells. The full battery assembled with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode and Bi@NC anode delivered long&#8208;term cyclability over 800 cycles, demonstrating its potential for flexible application of sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems. This work highlights the Bi@NC electrode as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance and flexible sodium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Modulation of Nanographenes Enabled by Defects, Size and Doping for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanographenes including 3D graphene, graphene quantum dots and graphene nanoribbons are among the fastest&#8208;growing materials used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The enhanced ORR activity of the nanographenes are original from the heteroatom doping effect, size effect, defects effect, and/or their synergistic effect, which can efficiently modify the charge distribution, optimize intermediate adsorption and accelerate electron transfer steps.







Abstract
Nanographenes are among the fastest&#8208;growing materials used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) thanks to their low cost, environmental friendliness, excellent electrical conductivity, and scalable synthesis. The perspective of replacing precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts with functionalized graphene is highly desirable for reducing costs in energy conversion and storage systems. Generally, the enhanced ORR activity of the nanographenes is typically deemed to originate from the heteroatom doping effect, size effect, defects effect, and/or their synergistic effect. All these factors can efficiently modify the charge distribution on the sp2&#8208;conjugated carbon framework, bringing about optimized intermediate adsorption and accelerated electron transfer steps during ORR. In this review, the fundamental chemical and physical properties of nanographenes are first discussed about ORR applications. Afterward, the role of doping, size, defects, and their combined influence in boosting nanographenes&#8217; ORR performance is introduced. Finally, significant challenges and essential perspectives of nanographenes as advanced ORR electrocatalysts are highlighted.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterizations of Dibenzo&#8208;Fused Perioctacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzoperioctacene (DBPO) with extended zigzag edges was synthesized and characterized. While the bond length analysis indicated a possible open&#8208;shell nature of DBPO, variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis indicated its closed&#8208;shell character. The theoretical investigations revealed the DBPO has nearly degenerate closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell singlet states with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
Dibenzoperioctacene (DBPO) with extended zigzag edges was synthesized and unambiguously characterized by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR analysis indicated the closed&#8208;shell character of DBPO, yet the bond lengths in the single&#8208;crystal structure of DBPO aligned more closely with those of open&#8208;shell teranthene than closed&#8208;shell bisanthene. Spin&#8208;unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using various methods supported that ground state of DBPO might be on the borderline between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;shell singlet states, with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), consistent with the VT&#8197;NMR and bond&#8208;length analyses. UV/Vis&#8208;near infrared (NIR) absorption spectrum showed the longest&#8208;wavelength peak at 905&#8197;nm, marking the NIR optical properties of DBPO. DBPO exhibited a tendency to react with atmospheric oxygen, which additionally hinted at its possible open&#8208;shell character. Furthermore, the oxidized species of non&#8208;fluorescent DBPO exhibited strong emission at 820 and 915&#8197;nm.

         <title>Pseudohalide Anions Driven Structural Modulation in Distorted Tetrahedral Manganese(II) Hybrids Toward Tunable Green&#8208;Red Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4&#8722;x are introduced with R=phenyl, pentyl, or methyl, and x=1&#8211;3, synthesized by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). These hybrids show significant Stokes shifts and red&#8208;shifted emission (549&#8211;613&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Mn(II)&#8208;based halides have recently garnered significant interest as emerging luminescence materials for diverse photonic applications. Generally, Mn(II) hybrids with tetrahedral coordination show green emission, however, ones with octahedral coordination give red emission. Herein, we design the synthesis of tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4&#8722;x (R=phenyl, pentyl or methyl; Ph3P=triphenylphosphine; x=1&#8211;3), achieved by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). Compared to the green&#8208;emitting A2MnBr4 (512&#8197;nm), the mixed hybrids exhibit significantly distorted [MnBrxNCS4&#8722;X] tetrahedra with high dipole moment, thus leading to the distinct Stokes shift energies and noticeable red shift emission in the range of 549&#8211;613&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these hybrids correlates strongly with the pair correlation function of Mn(II) ions, specifically the Mn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Mn distance. These findings highlight the critical role of dipole moments in determining the emission properties and expand the luminescent family of Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids.

Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these hybrids correlates strongly with the pair correlation function of Mn(II) ions, specifically the Mn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Mn distance. These findings highlight the critical role of dipole moments in determining the emission properties and expand the luminescent family of Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this work, we comprehensively reveal the two&#8208;step &#8220;chocolate&#8208;cookie&#8221; shaped CEI formation mechanism in RT Na&#8208;S batteries driven by FEC. The solid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur and impressive performance are achieved in this simplified system (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C), which has the potential for further improvement.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries has attracted growing attentions in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, while the serious shuttle effect and interface side reaction limit its practical application. Despite fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been widely used as an electrolyte additive or co&#8208;solvent to facilitate the optimization of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase in RT Na&#8722;S batteries, its crucial influence and mechanism have not been clearly understood. Herein, we deeply reveal the two&#8208;steps cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation by using FEC as the exclusive electrolyte solvent. The results demonstrate that FEC participates in both rapid nucleophilic reaction and electrochemical decomposition on cathode, which can effectively in situ construct a unique &#8220;chocolate&#8208;cookie&#8221; shaped CEI consisted of NaF&#8208;rich double layers. This CEI eliminates the shuttle effect and ensures the solid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur. Along with the stable F&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the Na anode, the RT Na&#8722;S battery delivers an impressive performance (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C) with almost 100&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency. This significantly simplifies electrolyte design and provides valuable insights into the application of FEC in practical Na&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Unraveling the Configuration Modulation in Spiro&#8208;Based Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) materials show potential for optoelectronic applications. This study unravels how spatial configuration impacts TSCT properties. Different photophysical properties were observed in a series of spiro&#8208;based TSCT materials. Their external quantum efficiencies range from 28.0&#8201;% to 3.6&#8201;%, highlighting the importance of spatial arrangement.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials hold promise for optoelectronic applications. Among various design strategies, through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) systems offer the potential for enhanced performance. However, the relationship between molecular configuration and TSCT properties remains unclear compared to traditional through&#8208;band charge transfer materials. In this study, we investigated the influence of spatial configuration on TSCT features and electronic properties of triplet excited states in these TSCT materials. By manipulating the spatial arrangement between donor and acceptor segments using different spiro skeletons, a series of TSCT materials (DMB2&#8208;DMB5) was synthesized. Together with the parent molecule, DM&#8208;B, these materials exhibited completely different TADF characteristics, demonstrating the impact of spatial arrangements on their optoelectronic properties. Thus, the external quantum efficiency of these materials ranged from as high as 28.0&#8201;% (DMB2) to as low as 3.6&#8201;% (DMB5) due to variations in their TADF characteristics. Our findings highlight the significance of spatial configuration, beyond distance alone, in influencing TSCT properties when donor and acceptor segments are sufficiently close. This insight provides valuable guidance for developing advanced TSCT materials and advancing TADF systems with improved performance and functionality.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer in Hybrid Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Enables Boosted Interface Stability and Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the surface of LLZTO powders is constructed to inhibit the Li+/H+ exchange reaction and provide extra Lewis acid&#8208;base site, which achieving the establishment of a long&#8208;term local conducive microenvironment of Li+ conduction on the surface of LLZTO. This work emphasizes the importance of modulating solvation structure for the hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte.







Abstract
Complex interactions between the inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE) and the liquid electrolyte (LE) give rise to challenges of achieving durable interface stability in hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (HQSE), and the influence on the involved ISE surface ionic conductivity also needs to be investigated. Here, 4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (CBSA) is utilized to establish a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the surface of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO), which is then incorporated into PEGDA&#8208;based in situ polymerized HQSE. The results show that the introduction of CBSA significantly improves the LLZTO/LE interface stability with the optimized solvation structure, resulting in a favorable ionic conductivity (1.19 mS&#8901;cm&#8722;1) and an increasing Li+ transference number (0.647). Mechanisms for the promotion of ionic conduction and interfacial stability of SAM&#8208;HQSE are unveiled through the density functional theory (DFT) combined with Raman spectra and 7Li solid&#8208;state nuclear&#8208;magnetic&#8208;resonance. There are no short&#8208;circuits in the Li|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Li cells after 1000&#8197;h. The LFP|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Li cells or LFP|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Graphite pouch cells respectively achieve the capacity retention of 91.2&#8201;% and 87.0&#8201;% with the 0.5.C&#8208;rate for 500 and 300&#8197;cycles. This facile and effective strategy proposed in this work make it accessible for constructing the stable surface micro&#8208;environments of LLZTO where boost and homogenize the Li+ conduction in a hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte system.

         <title>Self&#8208;adaptive Coordination Evolution Mediated Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partition in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pore space partition (PSP) has been successfully achieved in two isomorphic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) mediated by an unprecedented self&#8208;adaptive coordination evolution (SACE) on low&#8208;symmetric M4 clusters, which provides new perspectives for MOF structural regulation and designing more advanced porous adsorbents.







Abstract
The controllable and precise structural regulation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on isoreticular chemistry is an effective strategy for creating functional material platforms, such as efficient porous adsorbents. Herein, for the first time, mediated by an unprecedented self&#8208;adaptive coordination evolution (SACE) on pseudo&#8208;D2h&#8208;symmetric [M4(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(COO)6] (M=Mn/Fe) clusters, two pore space partitioned MOFs (CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe, CTGU=China Three Gorges University) have been successfully constructed. Owing to the more confined adsorption space and dense binding sites produced by pore space partitioning (PSP), the CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe exhibit significantly enhanced performance in the capture or recovery SF6 (greenhouse/electronic specialty gas) from SF6/N2 mixture compared to their non&#8208;partitioned homologous structures (CTGU&#8208;46&#8208;Mn/Fe) with adsorption selectivity increased from 37/72 to 634/157 (v/v, 10/90, 100&#8197;kPa). The theoretical calculations also elucidated that the implementation of PSP within CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe leads to dramatically strengthened binding affinity for SF6 over N2 through extra multiple F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. This study represents a valuable advance in crystal engineering field: the SACE of polynuclear metal clusters is expected to be useful in the structural regulation of MOFs and the fabrication of advanced porous adsorbents.

This study represents a valuable advance in crystal engineering field: the SACE of polynuclear metal clusters is expected to be useful in the structural regulation of MOFs and the fabrication of advanced porous adsorbents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Methionine Incorporation into Cyclophilin A by Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis for 19F NMR Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;complete incorporation of trifluoromethyl methionine (tfmM) into Cyclophilin A (CypA) was achieved by cell&#8208;free synthesis, preserving its substrate binding affinity and enzymatic activity. Availability of the highly responsive and sensitive tfmM probe paves the way for studying protein&#8208;protein/ligand interactions and protein dynamics by 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;19 NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for studying protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. Of particular interest is the exploitation of trifluoromethyl (tfm) groups, given their high sensitivity and superior transverse relaxation properties, compared to single fluorine atoms. However, biosynthetic incorporation of tfm&#8208;bearing amino acids remains challenging due to cytotoxicity and incompatibility with natural tRNA synthetases. Here, we report on overcoming this challenge using cell&#8208;free synthesis, incorporating trifluoromethyl&#8208;methionine (tfmM) into the protein Cyclophilin A (CypA) with remarkably high efficiency, impossible via biosynthetic means. Importantly, we demonstrate that tfmM CypA binds a native substrate, the N&#8208;terminal domain of HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (HIV&#8208;1 CA&#8208;NTD), and retains peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity. It also binds the peptide inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CsA) with the same affinity as non&#8208;labeled, wild&#8208;type CypA. Furthermore, we show that 19F isotope shifts and 19F solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) provide valuable structural information on surface exposure. Taken together, our study illustrates that tfmM can be readily incorporated into proteins at very high levels by cell&#8208;free synthesis without disturbing protein structure and function, significantly expanding the scope of 19F NMR spectroscopy for studying protein structure and dynamics.

         <title>Engineering Stable Decomposition Products on Cathode Surfaces to Enable High Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of a cost&#8208;effective coating on high&#8208;voltage NCM85 cathode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries&#8212;utilizing the stable decomposition products of LiPO2F2&#8212;successfully suppresses the electrochemical decomposition of the argyrodite Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte. Cells using the LiPOF&#8208;coated NCM85 demonstrated significantly improved capacity retention over 200 cycles, outperforming cells using uncoated NCM85.







Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes such as Li6PS5Cl hold high promise for solid&#8208;state batteries due to their high ionic conductivity; however, their oxidation potential of ~2.5&#8197;V is not compatible with high voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathodes such as LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (x&#8805;0.8). Using guidance from density functional theory, we devise an effective, conformal, and thin coating on the cathode active material, which suppresses the oxidative decomposition of Li6PS5Cl as shown by experiment. The nanometric coating on nickel&#8208;rich NMC85 enabled capacity retention of 82&#8201;% after 200 cycles (2.8&#8211;4.3&#8197;V vs Li+/Li) using Li6PS5Cl as the solid electrolyte. In comparison, cells with an uncoated CAM only displayed 56&#8201;% capacity retention. The coated&#8208;NCM85 cells also demonstrate much better rate performance and higher capacity. The enhanced performance is due to the formation of a stable amorphous cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase accruing from the decomposition products of the LiPO2F2 precursor (as predicted by DFT), which protect the sulfide electrolyte from oxidation. The coating fabricated in this cost&#8208;effective process showed superior performance to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coatings such as LiNbO3. This work highlights the importance of rationally designing stable coating materials based on their potential decomposition products and confirms the suitability of a low&#8208;cost and conformal coating to enable sulfide electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>A Helical Tubular Dyad of [9]Cycloparaphenylene: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties and Post&#8208;Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the site&#8208;specific functionalization strategy, a radially conjugated, helical tubular molecule has been constructed by covalently connecting [9]cycloparaphenylenes with three sp&#8208;hybridized all&#8208;carbon linkers. This compound exhibits intriguing solid&#8208;state packing patterns, exceptional CPL characteristics, and facile post&#8208;functionalization.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of discrete tubular molecules that mimic the structural features of carbon nanotubes has been a long&#8208;standing pursuit for synthetic chemists. As the shortest segments of armchair&#8208;type carbon nanotubes, cycloparaphenylenes are regarded as ideal macrocyclic building blocks for achieving this goal. Here we report the synthesis of a helical tubular molecule featuring three diyne linkers between two site&#8208;specifically functionalized [9]cycloparaphenylenes. Its C3&#8208;symmetrical, radially conjugated structure and solid&#8208;state packing have been elucidated by spectroscopic and crystallographic characterizations. Notably, the resolved enantiomers display a circularly polarized luminescence brightness value of 1.47&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is among the highest values for chiral organic molecules. Furthermore, the diyne&#8208;linked molecule could be directly converted into a thiophene&#8208;linked helical molecule, demonstrating the post&#8208;functionalization approach for the construction of chiral tubular molecules from cycloparaphenylenes.

         <title>Organic Molecule Functionalization Enables Selective Electrochemical Reduction of Dilute CO2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an organic molecule functionalization strategy to boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. With a functionalized Bi catalyst, we attained a formate Faradaic efficiency of 85.8&#8201;% with dilute feedstock (15&#8201;% CO2) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30&#8197;h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production from dilute CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 feedstock to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is a promising pathway for achieving direct valorization of waste gas streams. However, this is challenging due to significant competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lowered CO2 reduction (CO2R) kinetics as compared to systems that employ pure CO2. Here we show that terephthalic acid (TPA) functionalization can boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. For instance, TPA functionalized Bi attained a formate Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO&#8208;) of 96.3&#8201;% at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with pure CO2 feedstock. Density functional theory simulations indicate that this is because TPA functionalization modulates the binding energies of the key reaction intermediates *OCHO and *H. With low&#8208;concentration feedstock (15&#8201;% CO2) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, we achieved a high FEHCOO&#8208; of 85.8&#8201;%, which was double that of an unmodified Bi catalyst. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30&#8197;h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production with a 5&#8201;% CO2 feed. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that molecular tuning of a catalyst can be an effective strategy for enabling selective CO2R using low&#8208;concentration feedstock.

Taken together, our findings demonstrate that molecular tuning of a catalyst can be an effective strategy for enabling selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R using low-concentration feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy engineered polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets were developed as highly efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for the diverse functionalization of electronic&#8208;rich alkenes.







Abstract
Engineered polymeric carbon nitride represents a promising class of metal&#8208;free semiconductor photocatalysts for organic synthesis. Herein, we utilized engineered polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets, which exhibit an increased specific surface area and band gap due to enhanced quantum confinement from vacancy enrichment. These nanosheets serve as a heterogeneous organic semiconductor photocatalyst to facilitate diverse functionalizations of electron&#8208;rich alkenes, including arylsulfonylation, aminodifluoroalkylation, and oxytrifluoromethylation. This catalytic system operates under mild conditions, offering excellent functional group compatibility and high yields. Additionally, the catalyst demonstrates outstanding recyclability and efficiency in flow reactors, highlighting its significant potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Flux Synthesis of Robust Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks with High&#8208;Density Redox Sites for Efficient Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new rich nitrogen triazole&#8208;based monomer was used to fabricate two highly crystalline, porous and robust polyimide COFs with high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active groups through a flux synthesis method for proton batteries. The COF electrodes delivered a high reversible capacity, superior rate performance, and outstanding long&#8208;term stability, and the full cell with the COF anode and the MnO2 cathode achieved both a high energy and power density.







Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries are attracting increasing attention in the large&#8208;scale next&#8208;generation energy storage field. However, the electrode materials for proton batteries often suffer from low specific capacity and unsatisfactory cycle durability. Herein, we synthesize two highly crystalline and robust polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through a solvent&#8208;free flux synthesis approach with benzoic acid as a flux and catalyst. The as&#8208;synthesized COFs possess enriched redox&#8208;active sites for proton storage and intrinsic Grotthuss proton conduction, rendering them ideal candidates for proton electrode materials. The optimal COF electrodes achieve a high specific capacity of 180&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g, among the highest COF&#8208;based proton batteries, and exhibit an outstanding rate capability of up to 100&#8197;A/g and long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A/g. The assembled full cells deliver a specific capacity of 150&#8197;mAh/g at 0.2&#8197;A/g with a maximum energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/kg and a maximum supercapacitor&#8208;level power density of 64&#8197;kW/kg, surpassing all reported COF&#8208;based systems. This work paves a new avenue for the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with high energy density, power density, rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability.

         <title>Pioneering Built&#8208;In Interfacial Electric Field for Enhanced Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni3N@W5N4 nano&#8208;heterostructure catalyst, with built&#8208;in interfacial electric field and ultra&#8208;thin W5N4 shells, significantly enhances alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics involved in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis by reducing energy barriers and demonstrating excellent performance and stability.







Abstract
As a half&#8208;reaction in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) technology, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode is severely hindered by the sluggish reaction kinetics involved in additional water dissociation step, which results in large overpotentials and low energy conversion efficiency. Here, we develop a nano&#8208;heterostructure composed of ultra&#8208;thin W5N4 shells over Ni3N nanoparticles (Ni3N@W5N4) as efficient catalysts, in which built&#8208;in interfacial electric field (BIEF) is created owing to the distinct lattice arrangements and work functions of biphasic metal nitrides. The BIEF facilitates the electron localization around the interface and enables high valence W and more exposed binding sites in the surface W5N4 shell for accelerating the water dissociation step, ultimately leading to a remarkable reduction in the energy barriers of RDS from 1.40&#8197;eV to 0.26&#8197;eV. Theoretical calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis results demonstrated that surface W5N4 serves as the active species for HER. Moreover, the ultra&#8208;thin shell characteristics enable the optimized W5N4 with enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity to be fully exposed as active sites. Consequently, the Ni3N@W5N4 exhibits exceptional performance in alkaline HER (60&#8197;mV@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable long&#8208;term stability (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;hours). When employed as the cathode in the AEMWE device, the synthesized Ni3N@W5N4 demonstrates stable performance for 90&#8197;hours at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Methanolation of Olefins: Low&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Alcohols by the Formal Addition of Methanol to Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanolation of olefins&#8212;the one&#8208;pot 100&#8201;% atom efficient addition of methanol to olefins yielding C1 elongated alcohols&#8212;is achieved using an integrated catalytic system based on the combination of organometallic Mn/pincer and Rh/phosphine catalysts.







Abstract
Methanolation of olefins is introduced as a new low&#8208;pressure synthetic pathway to C1 elongated alcohols. Formally, H3COH is added to the C=C bond in a 100&#8201;% atom efficient manner. Mechanistically, the overall transformation occurs as a tandem reaction sequence by combining the dehydrogenation of methanol to syngas at a CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2 ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 with subsequent hydroformylation to the corresponding aldehyde and its final hydrogenation to the alcohol. The dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps are catalyzed by a Mn/pincer complex, while the hydroformylation is accomplished by a Rh/phosphine catalyst. Using 1&#8208;octene as prototypical substrate, a yield of 80&#8201;% nonanol was achieved with a ratio of 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 of linear to branched alcohols and turnover numbers (TONRh) of more than 17 000 could be obtained in relation to the precious metal Rhodium. The integrated catalytic system provides direct access to alcohols from olefins and &#8220;green&#8221; methanol, avoiding the handling of pressurized CO and H2 and the use of specialized high&#8208;pressure equipment as the process conditions do not exceed 10&#8197;bar with partial pressures of syngas in the range of only 1&#8211;2&#8197;bar.

Self&#8208;assembly presents a remarkable approach for creating intricate structures by positioning nanomaterials in precise locations, with control over molecular interactions. For example, material arrays with interplanar distances similar to the wavelength of light can generate structural color through complex interactions like scattering, diffraction, and interference. Moreover, enzymes, plasmonic nanoparticles, and luminescent materials organized in periodic lattices are envisioned to create functional materials with various applications. Focusing on structural DNA nanotechnology, here, we summarized the recent developments of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional lattices made purely from DNA nanostructures. We review DNA&#8208;based monomer design for different lattices, guest molecule assembly, and inorganic material coating techniques and discuss their functional properties and potential applications in photonic crystals, nanoelectronics, and bioengineering as well as future challenges and perspectives.

         <title>Stabilization Strategies of Buried Interface for Efficient SAM&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview focuses on the analysis of the buried interface instability mechanisms of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) in inverted perovskite solar cells, and highlights representative work to improve their stability. It also proposes potential strategies in material design and processing methods for achieving excellent stability in highly efficient SAM&#8208;based inverted devices.







Abstract
In recent years, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) anchored on metal oxides (MO) have greatly boosted the performance of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by serving as hole&#8208;selective contacts due to their distinct advantages in transparency, hole&#8208;selectivity, passivation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and processing efficiency. While the intrinsic monolayer nature of SAMs provides unique advantages, it also makes them highly sensitive to external pressure, posing a significant challenge for long&#8208;term device stability. At present, the stability issue of SAM&#8208;based PVSCs is gradually attracting attention. In this minireview, we discuss the fundamental stability issues arising from the structural characteristics, operating mechanisms, and roles of SAMs, and highlight representative works on improving their stability. We identify the buried interface stability concerns in three key aspects: 1) SAM/MO interface, 2) SAM inner layer, and 3) SAM/perovskite interface, corresponding to the anchoring group, linker group, and terminal group in the SAMs, respectively. Finally, we have proposed potential strategies for achieving excellent stability in SAM&#8208;based buried interfaces, particularly for large&#8208;scale and flexible applications. We believe this review will deepen understanding of the relationship between SAM structure and their device performance, thereby facilitating the design of novel SAMs and advancing their eventual commercialization in high&#8208;efficiency and stable inverted PVSCs.

         <title>Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox Electrocatalyst for Durable Oxygen Evolution in Acid Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Cl&#8722;&#8208;assisted active site transfer strategy on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, achieving high OER selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in acidic seawater. Typically, *Cl occupies the Ru site, shifting the OER center to CER&#8208;insensitive Mn, preventing metal site dissolution. Additionally, the active Mn sites create an environment that favors OER over CER, offering a selective and durable solution for acidic seawater electrolysis.







Abstract
Currently, direct electrolysis of seawater for green hydrogen production is primarily focused on neutral and alkaline systems. However, the precipitation of calcium and magnesium ions restricts the advancement of this technology. An acidic system can effectively address this issue. Given that Ru/Ir&#8208;based catalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity also exhibit high chlorine evolution reaction (CER) activity, acid seawater splitting requires anodes with higher selectivity and stability compared to the other two systems. In this study, we propose a non&#8208;precious Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox as the active anode for direct acid seawater electrolysis, which exhibits a high OER selectivity and remarkable stability for more than 1200&#8197;hours. Different from the Cl&#8722;&#8208;free system, *Cl occupied on Ru sites could shift the OER active center to Mn on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, which prevents the lattice oxygen consumed on Ru and hinders the metal site dissolution. As the CER&#8208;insensitive catalytic center, Mn activated by the introduction of Ru can adsorb a substantial amount of *OH, creating an OER&#8208;favored local environment that inhibits CER. We introduce Cl&#8722;&#8208;assisted transfer of OER active sites to CER&#8208;insensitive Mn as a fundamental strategy for achieving highly selective and durable oxygen evolution in acidic seawater.

         <title>The Kinetics of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in Metazoan Fatty Acid Synthase and Its Impact on Product Fidelity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain of metazoan fatty acid synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction of an acyl and malonyl substrate with two cooperatively working subunits. The KS ensures the fidelity of the fatty acid biosynthesis i) by increasing the speed with substrate length and ii) by discriminating against the intermediates of the fatty acid cycle.







Abstract
Fatty acid synthase (FAS) multienzymes are responsible for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and crucial in primary metabolism. Despite extensive research, the molecular details of the FAS catalytic mechanisms are still poorly understood. For example, the &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl synthase (KS) catalyzes the fatty acid elongating carbon&#8208;carbon&#8208;bond formation, which is the key catalytic step in biosynthesis, but factors that determine the speed and accuracy of his reaction are still unclear. Here, we report enzyme kinetics of the KS&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, enabled by a continuous fluorometric activity assay. We observe that the KS is likely rate&#8208;limiting to the fatty acid biosynthesis, its kinetics are adapted to the length of the bound fatty acyl chain, and that the KS is also responsible for the fidelity of biosynthesis by preventing intermediates from undergoing KS&#8208;mediated elongation. To provide mechanistic insight into KS selectivity, we performed computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We identify positive cooperativity of the KS dimer, which we suggest to affect the conformational variability of the multienzyme. Advancing our knowledge about the KS molecular mechanism will pave the ground for engineering FAS for biotechnology applications and the design of new therapeutics targeting the fatty acid metabolism.

A stable dicyclopenta[4,3,2,1&#8208;cde:4&#8242;,3&#8242;,2&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8208;pqr]&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracene derivative was successfully synthesized that shows global anti&#8208;aromaticity with small diradical character. The dication exhibits an open&#8208;shell diradical character and a unique [14]annulene&#8208;within&#8208;[22]annulene global aromatic structure, while the dianion is a closed&#8208;shell singlet in the ground state and displays a diatropic ring current on the &#960;&#8208;conjugated periphery.







Abstract
We report a robust strategy for tuning the electronic structure and chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs). By fusing two cyclopentadienyl rings in the peri&#8208;tetracene bay regions, we introduce antiaromatic character into the &#960;&#8208;system, leading to unique photophysical and electronic properties. A stable mesityl&#8208;substituted dicyclopenta&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracene derivative was synthesized through stepwise formylation/intramolecular cyclization at the bay regions of the dihydro peri&#8208;tetracene precursor, followed by oxidative dehydrogenation. This compound features an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, global antiaromaticity, exceptional stability under ambient conditions, and amphoteric redox behavior with a small energy gap. Its dication also possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, and its structure was identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, revealing a unique [14]annulene&#8208;within&#8208;[22]annulene global aromatic structure. In contrast, the dianion exhibits a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state. This work provides valuable insights for designing and synthesizing novel open&#8208;shell PHs with tunable electronic structures and remarkable stability.

         <title>Autocatalytic Reaction Networks: A Pathway to Spatial Temporal Mastery in Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autocatalytic chemical reaction network (CRN) has been developed that enables efficient control over sol(I)&#8208;gel and gel&#8208;sol(II) transitions through autocatalytic fronts. This approach, supported by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, provides a theoretical framework for system preprogramming and demonstrates the potential for reversible, repeatable sol&#8208;gel transitions, shaping new frontiers in material science and bioengineering.







Abstract
Autocatalytic reaction present a significant opportunity for the precise spatial and temporal control of dynamic materials, mimicking the characteristics of living matter within autonomous chemical systems. Herein, we have crafted an autocatalytic chemical reaction network (CRN) designed to be incorporated into a dynamic system, allowing for efficient control of both sol(I)&#8208;gel and gel&#8208;sol(II) transitions through autocatalytic fronts. The CRN incorporates two autocatalytic reactions. The first reaction promotes the formation of disulfide crosslinks while increasing the local pH through base product generation, catalyzing further disulfide bond formation and initiating a polymerization front that transforms the liquid phase into a gel. A subsequent, slower reaction triggered at the gel/air interface, resulted in the breakage of disulfide crosslinks, transforming the gel back into a liquid state through accelerating fronts. The dynamics of these autocatalytic fronts are accurately predicted by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, providing a theoretical framework for system preprogramming. Moreover, our results show that the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition can be reliably repeated multiple times. This approach not only enhances our understanding of autocatalytic CRNs but also pioneers a new approach for developing dynamic materials with life&#8208;like properties, significantly impacting material science and bioengineering.

         <title>Chiroptical Response of Carbon Nanocages Enhanced by Achiral Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geometrical reinforcement of chiral carbon cages by supramolecular technique led to enhancement of sensitivity against circularly polarized red light with an improved dissymmetry factor where the achiral guests such as Ar, CO2, and CH3CN are engaged in inhibition of undesired arrangement of transition dipole moments.







Abstract
Opening up [60]fullerene makes itself inherently chiral without loss of congenital &#960;&#8208;conjugation. An immoderately large aperture on [60]fullerene, however, renders the molecule less rigid and therefore it would reduce dissymmetry factors. Herein, we examined supramolecular technique in geometrical reinforcement of chiral open&#8208;[60]fullerenes by encasing achiral guests such as Ar, CO2, and CH3CN. At a lowest&#8208;energy transition, we confirmed a guest&#8208;dependency on chiroptical responses with increasing a dissymmetry factor by nearly twice to three times. It should be noted that the guests play a negligible role in electronic structures of the carbon cages. Instead, they are engaged in preclusion of an orifice shrinking not to reduce chiroptical response.

         <title>Visualization and Quantification of Single&#8208;Base m6A Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a TadA8.20&#8208;assisted N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA imaging at single&#8208;base resolution (TARS) method for in situ visualization of both A and m6A forms at specific RNA sites within single cells. This method enables the quantification of m6A modification fractions, providing precise and detailed insights into m6A modifications at the single&#8208;base level.







Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as the most prevalent form of RNA modification found across various RNA classes. The detection and quantification of m6A RNA modifications under various physiological conditions are crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, visualizing intracellular m6A modifications at single&#8208;base resolution remains a significant challenge. Existing methods based on high&#8208;throughput sequencing or in vitro assays are not suitable for in situ m6A RNA imaging. In this work, we introduce the TadA8.20&#8208;assisted N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA imaging at single&#8208;base resolution (TARS) method for precise visualization and quantification of both A and m6A forms at specific RNA sites within single cells. Validation studies using TARS on MALAT1 lncRNA in HeLa cells and CCND1 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines demonstrated its high specificity and efficiency in mapping and quantifying m6A modifications at single&#8208;base resolution. TARS represents a novel tool that advances m6A RNA modification research by offering accurate and detailed insights into m6A modifications at the single&#8208;base level.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Esterification of Phosphoric, Phosphonic and Phosphinic Acids with Organosilicates: Phosphorus Chemical Recycling of Sewage Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical recycling of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) recovered from sewage sludge ash into valuable phosphate triesters has been achieved via a novel esterification method with tetraalkyl orthosilicate. The approach offers an innovative recycling pathway, producing key industrial phosphorus chemicals without the use of white phosphorus while addressing phosphorus resource limitations and environmental impact.







Abstract
Global concerns regarding the depletion and strategic importance of phosphorus resources have increased demand for the recovery and recycling. However, waste&#8208;derived phosphorus compounds, primarily as chemically inert phosphoric acid or its salts, present a challenge to their direct conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals. We aimed to develop an innovative technology that utilizes the large quantities of sewage waste, bypasses the use of white phosphorus, and enables esterification of phosphoric acid to produce widely applicable phosphate triesters. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates emerged as highly effective reagents for the direct triple esterification of 85&#8201;% phosphoric acid, as well as the esterification of organophosphinic and phosphonic acids. Furthermore, we achieved esterification of recovered phosphoric acid with tetraalkyl orthosilicate, thus pioneering a recycling pathway from sewage waste to valuable phosphorus chemicals. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a novel mechanism, wherein tetraalkyl orthosilicates facilitate multimolecular aggregation to achieve alkyl transfer from tetraalkylorthosilicate to phosphoric acid via multiple proton shuttling.

         <title>Switching Residues: A Platform for the Synthesis of Fidaxomicin Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching residues: Adding new substituents to natural products increases their molecular weight and often their lipophilicity. We developed a Pd&#8208;catalysed protocol to directly replace the rhamnoside&#8208;arene fragment of the antibiotic fidaxomicin with simple amines in 1 step from the unprotected natural product. This enabled direct access to Fdx derivatives of reduced complexity with activity against RNA polymerase and various bacteria.







Abstract
Peripheral modification is often the main approach to optimize natural products for improved biological activity or desired physicochemical properties. This procedure inevitably increases molecular weight, often accompanied by undesired increased lipophilicity. Removing structural elements from natural products is not always tolerated. This is also the case for the antibiotic fidaxomicin (Fdx), where every structural component has been shown to be crucial for antibiotic activity. In this work, we demonstrate how the residue switching approach can maintain biological activity of Fdx derivatives by replacing the rhamnoside&#8208;dichlorohomoorsellinate moiety of Fdx with smaller, more polar building blocks. We used palladium&#8208;catalysed allylic substitution to selectively install N&#8208;nucleophiles on the core of Fdx. The new derivatives were designed to mimic the binding of Fdx to the bacterial RNA polymerase. Evaluation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Clostridioides difficile, and the Gram&#8208;negative model organism Caulobacter crescentus demonstrated that the newly introduced residues can restore antibiotic activity, which was further supported by on&#8208;target RNA polymerase assays. We combined the allylic substitution with an organocatalysed novioside acylation protocol to enable the functionalisation of two vectors on Fdx in one pot. This platform greatly expands the accessible chemical space for Fdx derivatives and enables the future development of systemic Fdx antibiotics.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Carboxylation of Benzylic Tertiary C&#8722;H Bonds with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalysis combined with cascade hydrogen atom transfer cycles for the carboxylation of benzylic tertiary C&#8722;H bond with CO2 is reported. The power of this strategy is demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of broad bioactive molecule derivatives to obtain benzylic all&#8208;carbon quaternary carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The direct catalytic carboxylation of benzylic tertiary C&#8722;H bonds with CO2 for the synthesis of all&#8208;carbon quaternary carboxylic acids represents a significant challenge. Here, we present a redox&#8208;neutral approach to address this difficulty by leveraging the synergistic interplay between photocatalysis and cascade hydrogen abstraction cycles. Remarkably, this strategy eliminates the need for sacrificial electron donors, electron acceptors, or stoichiometric additives, offering enhanced atom economy and environmental sustainability. It is particular that the combination of &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals with sulfur radicals generated in&#8197;situ from the decomposition of DMSO was employed to realize the abstraction of benzylic tertiary C&#8722;H bonds. Our method enables the direct synthesis of a diverse array of benzylic quaternary carboxylic acids with excellent functional group tolerance as well as the derivatization of bioactive molecules and the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pharmaceuticals under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of the Cyclopiane Family of Diterpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic synthesis of cyclopiane and related diterpenes has been achieved in a three&#8208;stage manner. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were obtained by skeleton construction with an engineered heterologous host, followed by late&#8208;stage functionalization of rings A, B and D by direct redox operations, directed C&#8722;H activation and enzymatic oxidation. Varied cyclopiane&#8208;related skeletons were further obtained by chemical transformation and genome mining.







Abstract
A three&#8208;stage chemoenzymatic synthesis of the cyclopiane family and related diterpenes is reported. Deoxyconidiogenol with a 6/5/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic cyclopiane skeleton was first produced by an engineered E. coli host harboring the corresponding terpene cyclase PchDS. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were synthesized by late&#8208;stage functionalization of rings A, B and D of the cyclopiane skeleton through direct redox operations, directed C&#8722;H activation, and enzymatic hydroxylation, respectively. Skeletal diversification was achieved by taking advantage of the selective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration of a cyclopiane cation generated chemically or enzymatically. Three cyclopiane&#8208;related skeletons, including the spiro 5/5/5/5&#8208;tetracyclic skeleton of spiroviolene, the angular 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused ring system of phomopsene, and the new linear 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic ring system of amycolatene, were produced either by chemical skeletal transformation from the cyclopiane skeleton, or by terpene cyclases discovered by genome mining.

         <title>Mineralizing Biofilm towards Sustainable Conversion of Plastic Wastes to Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biogenetical CdS nanoparticles were integrated with Shewanella oneidensis biofilm to be capable of sustainable plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen production under the air. The upper section of the Figure illustrates the process of mineralized biofilm formation, and the lower section depicts the hydrogen production procedure from the mineralized biofilm through plastic degradation.







Abstract
The integration of inorganic materials with biological machinery to convert plastics into fuels offers a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and energy crisis. Herein, we develop a type of hybrid living material via biomineralization of CdS onto Shewanella oneidensis&#8208;based biofilm, which is capable of sustainable hydrogen production from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) wastes under daylight. We reveal that the formed biofilm microstructure provides an independent anaerobic microenvironment that simultaneously supports cellular viability, maintains hydrogenase activity, and preserves the functional stability of CdS, giving rise to the efficient plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency as high as 3751&#8197;&#956;mol H2 g&#8208;1 PLA. Besides, by genetically engineering transmembrane pili conduit and incorporating conductive nanomaterials to strengthen the electron transfer across cellular interface and biofilm matrices, we show that the conversion efficiency is further enhanced to 5862&#8197;&#956;mol H2 g&#8208;1 PLA. Significantly, we exhibit that a long&#8208;term sustainable plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion of 63 d could be achieved by periodically replenishing PLA wastes. Overall, by the synergistic integration of biotic&#8208;abiotic characteristics the developed biofilm&#8208;based biomineralized hybrid living material is anticipated to provide a new platform toward the efficient conversion of plastic wastes into valuable fuels, and bridge the gap between environmental contamination and green energy production.

         <title>Nanocarriers Made of Natural Fatty Acids: Modulation of Their Release Profiles through Photo&#8208;Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow down: Photo&#8208;crosslinking is used to mitigate the dissolution and degradation of natural fatty acids in a body fluid mimic, achieving sustained release in cells with controllable kinetics for drug delivery, nanomedicine, and related applications.







Abstract
Natural fatty acids are attractive carrier materials for drug delivery, but their rapid dissolution and degradation in vivo calls for new strategies to enhance their stability. Here we report a simple and versatile method capable of photo&#8208;crosslinking carriers made of natural fatty acids for drug delivery under controlled release. By optimizing the crosslinking density, the nanoscale carriers show a high drug loading efficiency, together with a stable network structure for minimal degradation in a body fluid mimic. Fluorescence microscopy analysis also reveals the exceptional intracellular stability of the crosslinked network, resulting in negligible cytotoxicity toward A549 cells up to 24&#8197;h when loaded with a potent anticancer drug. We further extend this strategy to microscale carriers fabricated using electrospray. Upon photo&#8208;crosslinking, the carriers show a retarded release of nerve growth factor, resulting in slower neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion. This work holds promise for addressing the efficacy and safety issues critical to nanomedicine and related applications.

         <title>O&#8722;O Radical Coupling in Ultrathin Reconstructed Co6.8Se8 Nanosheets for Effective Oxygen Evolution and Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance and the underlying catalytic mechanisms are still not clearly distinguished toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we synthesized ultrathin Co6.8Se8 nanosheets with subnanometer thickness by incorporating catalytically inactive selenium into ultrathin Co(OH)2, thereby switching the OER reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM).







Abstract
Designing ultrathin transition metal electrocatalysts with optimal surface chemistry state is crucial for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the structure&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance and the underlying catalytic mechanisms are still not clearly distinguished. Herein, we synthesize ultrathin Co6.8Se8 nanosheets (NSs) with subnanometer thickness by incorporating catalytically inactive selenium (Se) into ultrathin Co(OH)2, thereby switching the OER reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM). The prepared ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit an overpotential of 253&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA/cm2, outperforming the mostly reported Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Advanced operando synchrotron spectroscopies and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs, whose surface is reconstructed into Se&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 during the OER process, could trigger direct O*&#8722;O* radical coupling rather than OOH* intermediates within AEM pathway thus lowering the energy input. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Co6.8Se8 NSs with shorter Co&#8722;Co bond length and stable Co&#8722;Se bond could optimize the rate&#8208;determining step barrier via OPM pathway. Besides, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries based on Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit excellent stability for more than 500&#8197;h of continuous charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 4&#8197;mA/cm2. The present study highlights the structural&#8208;dependent switch of OER pathways and provides valuable insights for further development of ultrathin OER catalysts.

         <title>Thermal Bistability of Magnetic Susceptibility, Light Absorption, Second Harmonic Generation, and Dielectric Properties in a Polar Spin&#8208;Crossover Iron&#8211;Rhenium Chain Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of iron(II) centers with phenyl isonicotinate and octacyanidorhenate(V) leads to a polar molecule&#8208;based material incorporating heterometallic Fe(II)&#8722;Re(V) cyanido&#8208;bridged chains. It exhibits a thermally induced cooperative spin crossover (high&#8208;spin&#8208;to&#8208;low&#8208;spin) transition on Fe(II) sites which results in remarkable thermal bistability of magnetic, visible&#8208;light absorption, second&#8208;harmonic generation, and dielectric properties.







Abstract
The bistability of multiple physical properties driven by external stimuli in a solid is a desired prerequisite for its application in memory devices with convenient data readout. We present a pathway for thermal bistability detectable in four physical properties: magnetic, light absorption, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and dielectric. We report a novel heterometallic (TBA){[FeII(phIN)4][ReV(CN)8]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(phIN) (1) (TBA=tetrabutylammonium cation, phIN=phenyl isonicotinate) cyanido&#8208;bridged chain material. Owing to an appropriate {N6} coordination sphere of Fe(II) centers, 1 reveals a thermal spin crossover (SCO) effect which is complete and cooperative providing a distinct thermal hysteresis loop in magnetic measurements. Moreover, it exhibits simultaneous thermal bistability in (a) visible&#8208;light absorption due to the presence of efficient d&#8208;d electronic transitions in the low&#8208;spin (LS) state, (b) SHG activity as it crystallizes in a polar Cc space group due to the bulky substituent on phIN ligands, and (c) dielectric parameters, including dielectric constant, which can be correlated with subtle changes in polarity between LS and HS (high spin) phases. Thus, we present a remarkable thermally controlled hysteretic behavior in four physical functionalities realized by properly functionalizing an SCO&#8208;active coordination compound.

         <title>A Molecular Engineering Approach to Conformationally Regulated Conductance Dualism in a Molecular Junction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and simple methodology to mechanically addressable molecular conductance switches with large conductance variations (~103) between high&#8208; and low&#8208;G states is presented. By chemical design, rotational flexibility in these molecules and variable anchor group distances are translated into distinct conductance pathways for the different conformers of the same single molecule.







Abstract
One key aspect for the development of functional molecular electronic devices is the ability to precisely tune and reversibly switch the conductance of individual molecules in electrode&#8208;molecule&#8208;electrode junctions in response to external stimuli. In this work, we present a new approach to access molecular switches by deliberately controlling the flexibility in the molecular backbone. We here describe two new conductance switches based on bis(triarylamines) that rely on the reversible toggling between two conformers, each associated with vastly different conductances. By molecular design, we were able to realize an on/off ratio Ghigh/Glow of ~103, which is one of the largest values reported to date. Flicker noise analysis and molecular transport calculations indicate that on/off switching relies on a change of the conduction pathway and vast differences in molecule&#8208;electrode coupling. We thereby provide a new scaffold for further development of molecular conductance switches that are both efficient and easily refined.

         <title>Hexafluorophosphate&#8208;Triggered Hydrogen Isotope Exchange (HIE) in Fluorinated Environments: A Platform for the Deuteration of Aromatic Compounds via Strong Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic route for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in arenes has been developed using catalytic PF6&#8722; in deuterated hexafluoroisopropanol and D2O under mild conditions. This method achieves high yields and excellent deuterium incorporation in phenols, anisoles, anilines, and heteroaromatic substrates. An extended H&#8208;bonding network is responsible for activating the inert P&#8722;F bond in PF6&#8722;, allowing for HIE and the creation of deuterated compounds.







Abstract
There is a perpetual need for efficient and mild methods to integrate deuterium atoms into carbon frameworks through late&#8208;stage modifications. We have developed a simple and highly effective synthetic route for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in aromatic compounds under ambient conditions. This method utilizes catalytic amounts of hexafluorophosphate (PF6&#8722;) in deuterated 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP&#8208;d1) and D2O. Phenols, anilines, anisoles, and heterocyclic compounds were converted with high yields and excellent deuterium incorporations, which allows for the synthesis of a wide range of deuterated aromatic compounds. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies show that an interactive H&#8208;bonding network triggered by HFIP&#8208;d1 activates the typically inert P&#8722;F bond in PF6&#8722; for D2O addition. The thus in situ formed DPO2F2 then triggers HIE, offering a new way to deuterated building blocks, drugs, and natural&#8208;product derivatives with high deuterium incorporation via the activation of strong bonds.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Sensing Analogue Nanopore for Rapid Detection of Protein&#8208;Related Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore) captures SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by specific receptor proteins ACE2 and changes the charge on the outer surface of the nanopore to enable the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This method eliminates the need for sample pre&#8208;treatment, enables rapid target detection, and allows for the detection of different targets by changing the cell membrane.







Abstract
Nanopores offer significant advantages in biosensing. Conventional nanopore sensors require probe modification within the pore, and there are two major obstacles: inhomogeneity of probe modification within the pore, and distortion of the detection signal due to the uncontrollable dynamics of the target within the pore. Here, we constructed a cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore), by coating the outer surface of the nanopore with cell membrane. The inhomogeneity of probe modification and the uncontrollable kinetics of target&#8208;probe binding were also addressed. Specific cells are selected to prepare CeSa&#8208;nanopore, for example, cells with high expression of angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are used to achieve the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. When SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to CeSa&#8208;nanopore the surface potential changes, causing a change in the ionic current, thus enabling its detection with a detection rate of 100&#8201;%. In addition, the detection of different proteins, such as follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone (FSH), can be achieved by changing the cell membrane coating. The identification of cancer cells in ascites can also be achieved by utilizing homologous targeting between cancer cells. Importantly, the use of CeSa&#8208;nanopores for the detection of these targets eliminates the need for pre&#8208;processing and significantly reduces detection time.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Piezoelectric Covalent Triazine&#8208;based Nanotube for Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Water and Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fully conjugated covalent triazine&#8208;based hollow nanotube (CTN&#8208;1) with rich active sites and high surface areas has been prepared for piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution. Benefiting from piezoelectric response and fully conjugated framework, CTN&#8208;1 facilitated piezoelectric carrier separation, leading to highly efficient H2O2 production with a rate of 4115&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is superior to other piezoelectric materials.







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanoscale tubular materials with superior mechanical strength and electronic properties. However, the conventional CNTs are inherently non&#8208;piezoelectric, mainly due to the lack of polar structures with pure carbon elements. The direct synthesis of fully conjugated and polarized organic nanotubes with desired piezoelectric properties remains a challenge. Herein, we report the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a new type of covalent triazine&#8208;based nanotube (CTN&#8208;1) as a novel piezoelectric material.

     alt="Bottom-up Synthesis of Piezoelectric Covalent Triazine-based Nanotube for Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Water and Air"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel fully conjugated covalent triazine-based hollow nanotube (CTN-1) with rich active sites and high surface areas has been prepared for piezocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. Benefiting from piezoelectric response and fully conjugated framework, CTN-1 facilitated piezoelectric carrier separation, leading to highly efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production with a rate of 4115&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is superior to other piezoelectric materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanoscale tubular materials with superior mechanical strength and electronic properties. However, the conventional CNTs are inherently non-piezoelectric, mainly due to the lack of polar structures with pure carbon elements. The direct synthesis of fully conjugated and polarized organic nanotubes with desired piezoelectric properties remains a challenge. Herein, we report the bottom-up synthesis of a new type of covalent triazine-based nanotube (CTN-1) as a novel piezoelectric material. The CTN-1 comprises of high surface area, nitrogen-rich and fully conjugated structure, which provides a series of merits for piezoelectric catalytic processes. These structural features combined with one-dimensional tubular morphology endow CTN-1 with excellent mechanical stimuli response and thus displaying prominent piezoelectric properties via pronounced nanocurvature effect. We further show that the CTN-1 enables the efficient synthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from water in the air via mechanical energy conversion, with an excellent piezocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 4115&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which exceeds other reported piezoelectric materials. The piezocatalysis by the CTN-1 can be practically integrated into a self-Fenton system, which exhibits excellent pollutant degradation capability.

         <title>Precisely Tailoring the Second Coordination Sphere of a Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Halogenated Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom catalyst with an unsymmetric Co&#8208;N4P1 coordination configuration is developed by tailoring second coordination sphere. Due to the greatly improved H2 dissociation and product desorption, the catalyst exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &gt;99&#8201;% yields) at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 pressure.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective nonprecious metal catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes is very appealing yet challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) can be tuned by tailoring the structure of second coordination sphere via P doping. As revealed by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations, such a P doping on N&#8208;coordinated Co SAC results in the unsymmetric Co&#8208;N4P1 coordination structure. With a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, we find that tailoring the second coordination sphere can greatly improve H2 dissociation and product desorption. As a result, the Co&#8208;N4P1 SAC exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &gt;99&#8201;% yields) at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 pressure, significantly outperforming most heterogeneous catalysts reported in the literature. We expect that this work opens a new avenue for the design of highly efficient nonprecious metal SACs for important hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dehydroprolines by an Energy&#8208;Transfer Enabled Cloke&#8208;Wilson Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement of crude aminocyclopropane carboxylate (ACPC) imines is reported. This leverages an energy&#8208;transfer mechanism transforming the core of ACPC to value added dehydroprolines&#8212;a useful synthetic intermediate en route to the synthesis of substituted unnatural proline derivatives. Both the 1,5&#8208;dehydroproline, as well as the uncommon 1,2&#8208;isomer are obtained from the same starting material under slightly modified conditions.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot photocatalytic method is reported for the generation of dehydroprolines, valuable precursors to 5&#8208;aryl prolines. Imines, obtained via simple condensation of aminocyclopropane carboxylates (ACPC) with a broad range of aldehydes, were employed in this transformation without purification. We demonstrate this energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) enabled Cloke&#8208;Wilson&#8208;type rearrangement affords both the rare 1,2&#8208;dehydroprolines or the more thermodynamically favored 1,5&#8208;isomers with up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 selectivity in both directions, using an identical catalytic system from the same starting material. Syntheses of intermediates of bioactive molecules in high yields and selectivity highlight this enabling transformation. Mechanistic studies support the proposed triplet&#8208;triplet EnT mode of activation, distinct from the previously developed singlet excited states accessed via UV excitation.

         <title>Artificial Gold Enzymes Using a Genetically Encoded Thiophenol&#8208;Based Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Binding Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating noble metals in artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is challenging due to the lack of suitable soft coordinating ligands among natural amino acids. We present a new class of ArMs featuring a genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding site based on a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, 4&#8208;mercaptophenylalanine (pSHF), incorporated in the transcriptional regulator LmrR via stop codon suppression. We demonstrate that pSHF is an excellent ligand for noble metals in their low oxidation states. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised by mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and successfully catalysed hydroamination reactions of 2&#8208;ethynyl anilines with over 50 turnover numbers. Interestingly, two equivalents of gold(I) per protein dimer proved to be required for activity. Up to 98% regioselectivity in the hydroamination of an ethynylphenylurea substrate was obtained, yielding the corresponding phenyl&#8208;dihydroquinazolinone product, consistent with a &#960;&#8208;activation mechanism by single gold centres. The ArM was optimized by site saturation mutagenesis, using an on&#8208;bead screening protocol. This resulted in a single mutant that showed higher activity on one class of substrates. This work brings the power of noble&#8208;metal catalysis into the realm of enzyme engineering and establishes thiophenols as alternative ligands for noble metals, providing new opportunities in coordination chemistry and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of H2O2 in Near&#8208;Neutral Zn&#8208;air Batteries Enables Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes hold promise as cheap, safe and sustainable devices, but they suffer from slow charge kinetics and remain poorly studied. Here we reveal a charge storage mechanism of near&#8208;neutral Zn&#8208;air batteries that is mediated by formation of dissolved hydrogen peroxide upon cell discharge and its oxidation upon charge. This H2O2&#8208;mediated pathway facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at ~1.5 V vs. Zn2+/Zn, reducing charge overpotentials by ~0.2&#8211;0.5 V and mitigating carbon corrosion &#8212; a common issue in ZABs. The manifestation of this mechanism strongly depends on the electrolyte composition and positive electrode material, contributing up to ~60% of the capacity with ZnSO4&#160;solutions and carbon nanotubes. Enhancing the H2O2&#8208;mediated pathway offers a route to higher energy efficiency and durability in near&#8208;neutral ZABs, advancing practical, sustainable energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Functionalized Atomically Precise Metal Clusters Exhibit Synergistically Enhanced Performance for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of organometallic compounds with metal nanoparticles can, in principle, generate hybrid nanocatalysts endowed with augmented functionality, presenting substantial promise for catalytic applications. Herein, we synthesize an atomically precise metal cluster (Ag9Cu6) catalyst integrated with alkynylferrocene molecules (Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc). This hybrid catalyst design facilitates a continuous electron transfer channel via an ethynyl bridge and establishes a distinctive local chemical environment, resulting in remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction. The Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc catalyst achieves a record&#8208;high product selectivity of CO Faradaic efficiency of 100% and an industrial&#8208;level CO partial current density of &#8211;680 mA/cm2, surpassing the performance of the Ag9Cu6 cluster (62% and &#8211;230 mA/cm2, respectively) without ferrocene functionalization in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Operando experimental and computational findings offer valuable insights into the role of ferrocene functionalization in synergistically improving the catalytic performance of metal clusters, propelling the advancement of metallic&#8208;organometallic hybrid nanoparticles for energy conversion technologies.</dc:description>

The Ag9Cu6-Fc catalyst achieves a record-high product selectivity of CO Faradaic efficiency of 100% and an industrial-level CO partial current density of &#8211;680 mA/cm2, surpassing the performance of the Ag9Cu6 cluster (62% and &#8211;230 mA/cm2, respectively) without ferrocene functionalization in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Operando experimental and computational findings offer valuable insights into the role of ferrocene functionalization in synergistically improving the catalytic performance of metal clusters, propelling the advancement of metallic-organometallic hybrid nanoparticles for energy conversion technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mn Doping at High&#8208;Activity Octahedral Vacancies of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysis in Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 with the intrinsic cation vacancies is an ideal substrate for heteroatom doping into the highly active octahedral sites in spinel oxide catalysts. However, it is still a challenge to confirm the vacancy location of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 through experiments and obtain enhanced catalytic performance by preferential occupation of octahedral sites for heteroatom doping. Here, a Mn&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 incorporated with carbon nanotubes catalyst was developed to successfully achieve preferential doping into highly active octahedral sites by employing &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 as the precursor. Further, the vacancy in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 was only located on octahedral sites rather than tetrahedral ones, which was first proved by direct experimental evidence through the clarification doping sites of Mn. Notably, the catalyst shows outstanding activity towards oxygen reduction reaction with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82 V and 0.64 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as the maximum power density of 179 mWcm&#8722;2 and 403 mWcm&#8722;2 for Mg&#8208;air batteries and Al&#8208;air batteries, respectively. It could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the doping Mn on octahedral sites and the substrate &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 along with the modification of the adsorption/desorption properties for ORR oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates as well as the optimization of the reaction energy barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Doping Copper(I) in Ag7 Cluster for Circularly Polarized OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiency of 26.7%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hetero&#8208;metal doping or substitution to create alloy clusters is a highly appealing strategy for improving physicochemical characteristics as well as tailoring optical and electronic properties, although high&#8208;yield synthesis of alloy clusters with precise positioning of doped metals is a daunting challenge. Herein, we manifest rational synthesis of chiral alloy cluster enantiomers R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu in 85%&#8208;87% yield by replacing one Ag(I) atom with Cu(I) in homometallic clusters R/S&#8208;Ag7, achieving circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a quantum yield beyond 90%. As a small energy gap (ca. 0.07 eV) between S1 and T1 states facilitates thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), the photoluminescence (PL) of R/S&#8208;Ag7 and R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu at ambient temperature originates mostly from TADF (85% and 86%) in place of phosphorescence (15% and 14%). Relative to those of R/S&#8208;Ag7, copper(I) doping not only triples PL quantum yields of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu due to accelerating intersystem crossing&#160;and RISC, but also doubles CPL asymmetry factors of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu ascribed to rigidizing cluster structure through stronger Ag&#8208;Cu interaction apart from dramatically improving thermodynamic stability. Solution&#8208;processable circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7%, which is superior to most of red&#8208;emitting OLEDs through solution process.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8203;Industry&#8208;Level Electrocatalytic CO2 to CO Enabled by 2D Mesoporous Ni Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has captivated widespread attentions, yet achieving the requisite efficiency, selectivity and stability for industrial applications poses a persistent challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in N&#8208;doped carbon framework via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy. The 2D mesoporous Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst showcases an ultrathin thickness (~6.7 nm) with well&#8208;distributed 5 to 40 nm&#8208;width mesopores in plane and a high surface area. As a result, the Ni single atom sites with a high density (~6.0 wt.%) are almost completely exposed and can be accessible, and the mass transfer can be greatly promoted even at high current densities. Thus, an industry&#8208;level current density of 446 mA cm&#8208;2 with &gt; 95% CO selectivity in a flow cell can be obtained. Concurrently, the catalyst demonstrates an impressive stability, maintaining a 50&#8208;hours continuous electrolysis in the membrane electrode assembly test and achieving an energy efficiency of 42%. Finite element analysis reveals that the 2D mesoporous design enhances CO2 diffusion, ensuring efficient adsorption and swift CO desorption at high current densities. Our study paves a way for the fabrication of 2D mesoporous single atom catalysts with nearly 100% accessibility and expedited mass transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Integrated with Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling desalination with electrocatalytic reactions is an emerging approach to simultaneously addressing freshwater scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the salt removal rate in such processes is slow, and the applicable water sources are often limited to those with high salt concentrations. Herein, we show high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic desalination by coupling with electrochemical CO2 reduction using a carbon catalyst. A ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon catalyst embedded with Cu nanoparticles delivers a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.3% for CO production at 288 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1. The efficient CO2 electroreduction generates high current densities, which drive fast salt ion transfer across ion exchange membranes. The integrated device enables one of the quickest salt removal rates of 1043.49 &#956;g cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 among various desalination methods. Drinking water can be obtained with an ion removal rate of 99% when natural seawater is used as the water source.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conductive Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Ribbon with High&#8208;Density Redox&#8208;Active Centers as Cathode for Stable High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Conductive Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) materials hold significant potential as cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their flexible structural design, high electronic conductivity, and independence from costly resources. However, their practical application is often limited by their capacity and cyclability. In this study, we report a one&#8208;dimensional Cu&#8208;MOF (DDA&#8208;Cu, DDA=1, 5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;4, 8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9, 10&#8208;anthraceneedione) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination ribbon and high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active centers, making it a stable, high&#8208;capacity cathode for LIBs. The &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8208;O&#8323;N motifs embedded within the ribbon not only serve as redox&#8208;active centers for enhanced lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity but also contribute to structural robustness, enabling resistance against electrode solubility in organic electrolytes, thus ensuring superior cyclability. Furthermore, these &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8208;O&#8323;N units promote efficient charge transfer, leading to high electronic conductivity at room temperature. These advantageous properties allow the Cu&#8208;MOF cathode to deliver a remarkable capacity (353 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1) and exceptional cyclability, achieving capacity retention of 78% after 1000 cycles, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF electrodes. Additionally, this DDA&#8208;Cu demonstrates considerable wettability with the electrolyte, achieving outstanding performance even when tested in a lean electrolyte environment (2 &#956;L mg&#8208;1) with a high mass loading of the MOF (6.8 mg cm&#8208;2)</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Adsorption and Selectivity of Acetylene by Nitro Functionalisation in Copper(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purification and storage of acetylene (C2H2) are important to many industrial processes.  The exploitation of metal &#8211;organic framework  (MOF) materials to address the balance  between selectivity for C2H2 vs  carbon dioxide (CO2 ) against maximising uptake of C2H2 has attracted much interest.  Herein, we report that the synergy between unsaturated copper (II) sites and functional groups, fluoro (&#8208;F), methyl (&#8208;CH3), nitro (&#8208;NO2) in a series of isostructural MOF materials MFM&#8208;190(R) that show exceptional adsorption and selectivity of C2H2 . At 298 K, MFM&#8208;190(NO2) exhibits an C2H2  uptake of  216 cm3 g&#8722;1  (320  cm3 g&#8722;1 at 273 K ) at 1.0 bar and a high selectivity for C2H2/CO2 (up to ~150 for v/v = 2/1) relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream. Dynamic breakthrough studies validate and confirm the excellent separation of C2H2/CO2 by  MFM&#8208;190(NO2) under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction reveals the cooperative binding, packing and selectivity of C2H2 by unsaturated Cu(II) sites and free &#8208;NO2 groups.</dc:description>

         <title>mPatch: a wearable hydrogel microneedle patch for in vivo optical sensing of calcium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents an in vivo optical hydrogel microneedle platform that measures levels of analytes in interstitial fluid. The platform builds on a previously published technique for molding hydrogel microneedles by developing a composite hydrogel (i.e., PEGDA and polyacrylamide) that is sufficiently stiff to penetrate skin in the hydrated state and whose fluorescence changes dynamically&#8212;via a conjugated aptamer&#8212;depending on level of analyte. In a demonstration relevant to hypercalcemia, the hydrogel microneedle distinguished varying concentrations of calcium (within a range of 0 to 2 mM, which spans physiologically meaningful variations for hypoparathyroidism) within 10 minutes. In rats, a compact CMOS sensor measuring fluorescence from microneedles distinguished low hypercalcemic (1.7 mM) from high hypercalcemic (2.3 mM) ionized calcium levels as determined from reference blood measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates in vivo feasibility of a concept&#8212;which we call mPatch&#8212;for an optical hydrogel microneedle to measure small changes in levels of analytes in interstitial fluid, which does not rely on extraction of interstitial fluid out of the dermis.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Machine Learning and Large Language Models to Advance Exploration of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical C&#8208;H oxidation reactions offer a sustainable route to functionalize hydrocarbons, yet identifying suitable substrates and optimizing synthesis remain&#160;challenging. We report an integrated approach combining machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to streamline the exploration of electrochemical C&#8208;H oxidation reactions. Utilizing a batch rapid screening electrochemical platform, we evaluated a wide range of reactions, initially classifying substrates by their reactivity, while LLMs text&#8208;mined literature data to augment the training set. The resulting ML models for reactivity prediction achieved high accuracy (&gt;90%) and enabled virtual screening of a large set of commercially available molecules. To optimize reaction conditions for selected substrates, LLMs were prompted to generate code that iteratively improved yields. This human&#8208;AI collaboration proved effective, efficiently identifying high&#8208;yield conditions for 8 drug&#8208;like substances or intermediates. Notably, we benchmarked the accuracy and reliability of 10 different LLMs &#8208;&#160;including LLaMA, Claude, and GPT&#8208;4 &#8208;&#160;on generating and executing codes related to ML based on natural language prompts given by chemists to showcase their tool&#8208;making (code generation) and tool&#8208;use (function calling) capabilities and potentials for accelerating research across four diverse tasks. We also collected an experimental benchmark dataset comprising 1071 reaction conditions and yields for electrochemical C&#8208;H oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal as Template: Reversing the Synthesis Logic in the Preparation of Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conventional synthetic approach to transition metal pincer complexes calls for the preparation of the tridentate pincer (proto)ligand first, with subsequent introduction of the transition metal center as the last step. This work demonstrates that the alternative synthetic logic, where the central main group element is introduced last, can be applicable to a number of PEP pincer complexes (E = B, Al, Si, P) derived from phosphinophenols and phosphinopyrroles. This approach obviates the need to isolate well&#8208;behaved proto&#8208;pincer precursors, and instead relies on the formation of phosphine&#8208;metal adducts first, whose nature determines the stoichiometry of the needed main group reagent to complete the synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#173;&#173;&#173;&#8211;Squeeze Triggers Guest Desorption from Sponge&#8211;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Desorption in conventional porous sorbents often employ external forces including inert gas blowing, heating, vacuum treatment to trigger guest release. We here report an unprecedented molecular&#8211;squeeze triggered guest release behavior from sponge&#8211;like macrocycle crystals. The crystals function as typical sponge to include guest molecules within their microscopic voids that are adaptively formed, thus acting as adsorbents for toluene/pyridine separations. Intriguingly, vaporized ethyl acetate (  EA  ) molecules trigger the guest release from the crystals without entering the pores or voids of the crystals to replace the guests. Instead, they work as external forces applied directly onto the crystals themselves, &#8216;&#8216;squeezing&#8221; the materials to close the voids through supramolecular interactions between  EA  and macrocycles on the crystal surface and release the guest molecules. Various experimental techniques as well as molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism of the molecular&#8211;squeeze induced guest release procedure. The  EA  &#8211;regenerated crystals can be recycled multiple times without the loss of separation performance. Compared with conventional guest release procedure, this method is manipulated in a mild condition, showing the potential in saving cost and energy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Entropy&#8208;driven strategy enables the systematic design of complex systems by using entropy as a quantifiable design parameter for the degree of mixing. In this study, we present mixed&#8208;linker zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), sod&#8208;ZIF&#8208;1 series, that features two types of six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) with aperture sizes of 3.4 &#197; and 1.7 &#197;. By adjusting the configurational entropy, the ratio of these 6MRs can be systematically controlled, which significantly influences adsorptive properties, particularly improving the H2 affinity about 3 times throughout the series. This results in the significant enhancement of retention times in dynamic separation of hydrogen isotopes (D2/H2), even over LNG liquefaction temperature. This approach to entropy&#8208;driven pore engineering provides new opportunities for enhancing gas adsorption and separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Electron Transfer in Copper&#8208;Mediated C(sp2)&#8208;H Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report copper(II) and copper(III) trifluoromethyl complexes supported by pyridinedicarboxamide ligand (L) as a platform for investigating the role of electron transfer in C(sp2)&#8208;H trifluoromethylation. While the copper(II) trifluoromethyl complex is unreactive towards (hetero)arenes, the formal copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex performs C(sp2)&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of a wide range of (hetero)arenes. Mechanistic studies using the copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex suggest that the mechanism of arene trifluoromethylation is substrate&#8208;dependent. When the thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer is high, the reaction proceeds through a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, where an initial electron transfer occurs between the substrate and oxidant prior to CF3 group transfer. Otherwise, a CF3 radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism is followed. These studies provide valuable insights into the role of strong oxidants and potential mechanistic dichotomy in Cu&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8208;H trifluoromethylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Diffusion and Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film via Reducing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;step deposition method effectively mitigates the efficiency decline observed in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPVSCs) with increasing cell area, stemming from film in&#8208;homogeneity. However, the high solubility of SnI2 in the conventionally used solvent isopropyl alcohol, coupled with the absence of effective modulation of reaction&#8208;diffusion process, results in inadequate film coverage and conversion. In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second&#8208;step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction&#8208;diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from &#8208;1.38 to &#8208;10.10 kcal/mol between ligands and Sn2+ significantly enhances the effectiveness of two&#8208;step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large&#8208;scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68% for 0.04 cm2 device and 11.30% for 1 cm2 device among tin&#8208;based perovskite devices in two&#8208;step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. This study lays the groundwork for the potential scale&#8208;up development of lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Asymmetric Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Unidirectional Low&#8208;Friction Water Collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Friction plays a pivotal role in many phenomena of physical chemistry and has long been in the focus of research thereof. As a crucial parameter, frictions in membranes&#8217; inner and/or outer surface&#160;can be minimized to&#160;reduce&#160;solvent inlet pressure and enlarge inner pore fluid flux, ideally reaching&#160;near frictionless transport of water at nanoscale. Inspired by the leaf structure of Tillandsia, a porous membrane with a rough surface and a hydrophilic inlet together with hydrophobic pore channels was designed and fabricated, based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Combined with COFs&#8217; inherent highly oriented pore structures, the&#160;as&#8208;made&#160;asymmetric membranes through chemical etching can minimize the solvent critical intrusion pressure and&#160;enable&#160;inner pore low friction water transport. Ultimately, obtained COF membranes succeeded in&#160;trapping&#160;fog from air and achieved a water harvesting rate&#160;(WHR) of 1570 mg cm&#8208;2&#160;h&#8208;1, together with small molecular pollutants filtrated&#160;off&#160;in the meantime. Intriguingly, the synthesized asymmetric COF membranes illustrated unidirectional low friction water collecting and transporting features, the successful imitation of T. macdougallii. This work presents&#160;a&#160;practical strategy to construct functional porous membranes for low friction water collection and transport,&#160;and created a model paradigm to&#160;design fluid transporting pore channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Cage&#8208;Confined Cations Molecular Dynamics toward High&#8208;Tc Perovskite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cage&#8208;confinement effect that imposes great constriction on the dynamic behaviors of guest molecules is an established platform for tailoring physical properties. Herein, the strategy of enhancing cage&#8208;confinement effect to control molecular motion has been probed for the first time to exploit new high&#8208;Tc ferroelectrics of 2D hybrid perovskites. By fine&#8208;tailoring of the confined cations inside the perovskite cavities, we have successfully obtained new homologous ferroelectrics of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Cl10 (1; BA =n&#8208;butylamine, MA = methylamine) and (BA)2(EA)2Pb3Cl10 (2; EA = ethylamine). Intriguingly, this dynamics modulation of cage&#8208;confined cations leads to a remarkable promotion of Curie temperature (Tc), boosting from 340 K (for 1) to 402 K (for 2). In situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations on energy barrier confirm that the larger EA cation in 2 is subject to stronger confinement effect, of which potential energy barrier of molecular motion is ~3.5 times that of MA cation. This dynamic behavior greatly suppresses the dynamic motions of EA cation, while MA cation can easily accelerate motion and reach a fast motion limit, thus accounting for an enhancement of Tc (&#916;T~62 K) in 2. The finding sheds light on the understanding of cage&#8208;confined electric orders and the precise design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric S&#8208;Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Axially Chiral Sulfilimines Enabled by Anionic Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Cobalt(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient enantioselective coupling reaction between sulfenamides and cyclic diaryliodonium salts is established via adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis, precisely synthesizing a broad range of axially chiral sulfilimines with excellent enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, regioselectivities, and chemoselectivities (67 examples under same conditions, up to 98% ee). The following thermodynamically controlled pyramidal inversion enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers. Mechanistic studies suggest that anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III) complexes serve as counteranions of diaryliodonium and anionic ligand of Cu(I) catalyst simultaneously, which could be regarded as an explanation for outstanding selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Configuration&#8208;Mediated Efficient Non&#8208;Radiative Transition for R848&#8208;Assisted Photothermal Immunotherapy to Inhibit Tumor Growth and&#160;Metastasis by An&#160;In Situ Tumor Vaccine Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer metastasis remains a critical factor contributing to the current limitations in cancer treatment. Photothermal immunotherapy has emerged as a safe and potent therapeutic approach, demonstrating the capability to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. While researchers have extensively investigated various structural modifications to enhance photothermal conversion performance, the influence of molecular configuration has received comparatively limited attention. In this study, we synthesized two isomers, CZTBT and LVTBT, which possessed distinct configurations. LVTBT, characterized by a flatter molecular configuration, exhibited an extended absorption wavelength and a higher molar extinction coefficient. Its excited state facilitated stronger rotation for non&#8208;radiative transitions, leading to a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.3%. When combined with R848, LVTBT@R848 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;mediated photothermal immunotherapy functioned as an in situ tumor vaccine, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cell infiltration, and the differentiation of natural killer (NK) cells and memory T cells, thereby activating the strong immune response. Consequently, it significantly inhibited the growth of both primary and distant tumors, while also limiting lung metastasis. In summary, this study proposed a configuration&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative transition strategy for efficient photothermal immunotherapy, advancing the frontiers of organic photothermal agents (OPTAs) design and synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Strategy to Enhance Long&#8208;Range Order of Poly(Heptazine Imide) Nanorods for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), one of the crystalline or long&#8208;range ordered allotropes of polymeric carbon nitride, is a promising polymeric photocatalyst; however, preparation of highly crystalline PHI remains a challenge. Herein, through a bottom&#8208;up strategy involving repair of structural defects and increase of specific surface area of melon precursor, we prepared PHI nanorods with dramatically improved long&#8208;range order. The resulting PHI exhibited a shift of product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction from CO to CH4 with a high methanation activity in contrast to the pristine PHI with relatively low long&#8208;range order. The improvement of long&#8208;range order for PHI remarkably enhanced the separation efficiency and transfer dynamics of photogenerated charges as well as the adsorption capacity for *CO intermediate. This study revealed the relationship between the precursor structure and PHI crystal growth in ionothermal synthesis, and also showcased the great potential of highly crystalline PHI in artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8211;Vibration Coupling via Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions for Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minimizing energy loss is crucial for breaking through the efficiency bottleneck of organic solar cells (OSCs). The main mechanism of energy loss can be attributed to non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) that occurs due to exciton&#8211;vibration coupling. To tackle this challenge,  tuning intramolecular noncovalent interactions is strategically utilized to tailor novel fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Upon comprehensive analysis of both theoretical and experimental results, this approach can effectively enhance molecular rigidity, suppress structural relaxation, reduce exciton reorganization energy, and weakens exciton&#8722;vibration coupling strength. Consequently, the binary OSC device based on Y&#8208;SeSe, which features dual strong intramolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent interactions, achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.49%, accompanied by an extremely small &#916;Enr of 0.184 eV, much lower than those of Y&#8208;SS and Y&#8208;SSe based devices with weaker intramolecular noncovalent interactions. These achievements not only set an efficiency record for selenium&#8208;containing OSCs, but also mark the lowest reported &#916;Enr value among high&#8208;performance binary devices. Furthermore, the ternary blend device showcases a remarkable PCE of 20.51%, one of the highest PCEs for single&#8208;junction OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of intramolecular noncovalent interactions in suppressing exciton&#8211;vibration coupling, thereby achieving low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mutual Dependence between Membrane Phase Separation and Bacterial Division Protein Dynamics in Synthetic Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell membranes in bacteria are laterally polarized to produce specific environments for membrane proteins, e.g., proteins involved in cell division which accumulate at mid&#8208;cell or the cell poles. An interesting result of such membrane&#8208;lipid interplay is the reorganization of lipid domains together with membrane&#8208;bound proteins at the onset of cell division, suggesting functional significance of membrane compartments in the cell cycle. Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinC, MinD, MinE, FtsA and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle&#8208;based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, Min proteins exhibit preferential binding and macro&#8208;scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase&#8208;separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase&#8208;separated GUVs leads to blebbing&#8208;like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.</dc:description>

         <title>In/Outside Catalytic Sites of the Pore Walls in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pore channels play a decisive for mass transport in catalytic systems. However, the influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were still under&#8208;explored due, because it is difficult to construct sites anchored in or outside of pore walls. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with precisely anchored active sites were used to explore the effects of channels on a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. Electrocatalytic evaluations showed that single Pt sites located inside of the channels exhibited higher kinetic activity compared to those anchored outside. The in situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that local reconstruction of Pt&#8211;Cl breaking and potential&#8208;induced anion transport occurred more effectively inside the channels. The superior anion transportability and kinetic activity of the inside&#8208;channel active sites also facilitated *OH desorption during the ORR process outperforming their outside&#8208;channel counterparts. The results of this study provide strategies for designing active sites in porous catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Freezing&#160;Effect on Electron Conduction&#160;of Ball&#8208;milled Lanthanum Trihydride&#160;for Superionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A recent finding shows that lattice deformation could transform the mixed&#160;electronic/hydride (H&#8208;)&#160;conducting&#160;lanthanum trihydride (LaH3) to a superionic H&#8208;&#160;conductor. Such a feature would enable the development of a&#160;brand&#8208;new all&#8208;solid&#8208;state hydride ion battery. It is essential to elucidate the mechanism of such a phenomenon. Here, we disclose&#160;an abnormal freezing&#160;effect&#160;on the electronic conductivity (&#963;e) of the ball&#8208;milled&#160;LaH3;&#160;that is, &#963;e&#160;can be lowered by over 2&#160;orders of magnitude upon a low&#8208;temperature treatment. Low&#8208;temperature Raman&#160;reveals&#160;that at low temperatures, lattice deformation has a noticeable influence on the interaction of hydrogen at octahedral&#160;(Ho) and&#160;tetrahedral (Ht)&#160;sites, which may play a crucial role in hindering electron conduction. This freezing&#160;effect&#160;can significantly improve the ionic transfer number of rare earth&#8208;based H&#8208;&#160;conductors and provide a new direction to the development of solid electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>CO&#8208;tolerant heterogeneous ruthenium catalysts for efficient formic acid dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of improved and less costly catalysts for dehydrogenation of formic acid (HCOOH) is of general interest for renewable energy technologies involving hydrogen storage and release. Theoretical calculations reveal that ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon should be appropriate catalysts for such transformations. It is predicted that nitrogen doping significantly decreases the formation of CO, but at the same time increases CO tolerance of the catalysts. To prove these hypotheses heterogeneous ruthenium catalysts supported on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Rux/CN) with hierarchical structure were synthesized using carbon nitride (C3N4) as template and phenanthroline (Phen) as ligand. Experimental tests in HCOOH dehydrogenation revealed the optimal catalyst Ru7/CN exhibiting good thermal stability and a high turnover frequency (TOF &gt; 1300 h&#8208;1), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the commercial Ru5/C catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Hidden Photoisomerization of a Symmetric Phosphaalkene Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air&#8208;stable, and solvent&#8208;resistant phosphaalkene switch. Using this symmetric switch, we have demonstrated degenerate photoisomerization experimentally for the first time. With a combination of photochemical&#8208;exchange NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the isomerization mechanism of this symmetric phosphaalkene. Our findings highlight the critical role of the isolobal analogy between C=P and C=C bonds in governing nanoscale molecular motion and break new ground for our understanding of light&#8208;induced molecular processes in symmetric heteroalkene systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Protein poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylation are recently discovered post&#8208;translational modifications that remain poorly characterized due to (1) the difficulty of extracting endogenously polyphosphorylated species without degradation and (2) the absence of synthetic and analytical tools to prepare and characterize poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylated species in biochemical contexts. Herein, we report a methodology for the selective oligophosphorylation of peptides with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (Pn = 3&#8211;6). A library of oligophosphorimidazolide (oligoP&#8208;imidazolide) reagents featuring benzyl and o&#8208;nitrophenylethyl protecting groups were synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (65&#8211;93%). These oligoP&#8208;imidazolide reagents enabled the selective and simultaneous conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphoryl nucleophiles, circumventing tedious iterative processes. The generalizability of this approach is illustrated by a substrate scope study that includes several biologically relevant phosphopeptide sequences, culminating in the synthesis of &gt;60 examples of peptide oligophosphates (Pn = 2&#8211;6). Moreover, we report the preparation of oligoP&#8208;diimidazolides (Pn = 3&#8211;5) and discuss their application in generating unique condensed phosphate&#8208;peptide conjugates. We also demonstrate that human phospho&#8208;ubiquitin (pS65&#8208;Ub) is amenable to functionalization by our reagents. Overall, we envision the methods described here will enable future studies that characterize these newly discovered but poorly understood phosphorylation modes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Pd2L4 Capsules from Readily Accessible Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s Base Ligands Inducing Circular Dichroism on Fullerenes C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The induction of chirality on pristine fullerenes through non&#8208;covalent embedding in an asymmetric nano&#8208;confinement has only been rarely reported. Bringing molecules with such a unique electronic structure and broad application range into a chiral environment is particularly appealing for the development of chiroptical materials, enantioselective photoredox catalysts and systems showing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we report the formation of a chiral, configurationally stable Pd2L4&#160;capsule assembled from a&#160;C2&#8208;symmetric, &#8216;ribbon&#8208;shaped&#8217; ligand with a Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base naphthalimide (TbNaps) backbone, easily synthesized in three steps from commercially available compounds. Embedding chirality directly into the ligand backbone ensures a relatively lightweight receptor design whose aromatic panels create a strongly shielded inner cavity of about 700 &#197;3&#160;volume. Fullerenes C60&#160;and C70, as well as a pair of corannulenes, can be bound in acetonitrile (where unsubstituted fullerenes are insoluble) and X&#8208;ray structures of host&#8208;guest complexes were obtained. Tight interactions between the chiral host and the fullerene guests leads to the induction of a circular dichroism (CD) on the characteristic absorption bands of the forbidden &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transitions of the fullerenes, backed up by sTDA TD&#8208;DFT calculations and detailed investigation of the electronic excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>A Generally Applicable Method for Disentangling the Effect of Individual Noncovalent Interactions on the Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce the fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) scheme for precise quantification of individual interactions contributing to the binding energy of arbitrary chemical entities, such as protein&#8208;ligand binding energies, lattice energies of molecular crystals, or association energies of large biomolecular assemblies. Using fp&#8208;LED, we can assess whether the contribution to the binding energy arising from noncovalent interactions between pairs of molecular fragments in any chemical system is attractive or repulsive, and accurately quantify its magnitude at the coupled cluster level &#8208; commonly considered as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of computational chemistry. Such insights are crucial for advancing molecular and material design strategies in fields like catalysis and therapeutic development. Illustrative applications across diverse fields demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of this theoretical framework, promising profound implications for fundamental understanding and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Affecting Charges and Structures of {Bi6} Architectures by 12&#8208;Electron Transition Metal Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron count affects the shape of Bi6q&#8722; units, from a regular prism in Bi62&#8722; (left) to a regular crown&#8208;type cycle in Bi66&#8722; (right). Such units were previously isolated in the coordination sphere of metal complexes, while the (less symmetric) intermediate with a &#8722;4 charge has only been predicted by theory. In their Research Article (e202417234), Florian Weigend, Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. isolated the Zintl cluster [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; (center), in which two 12&#8208;electron fragments are perfectly suited to stabilize the boat&#8208;type Bi64&#8722; unit, as confirmed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for Precise Control of Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space conjugation in a series of tetraphenylalkanes&#8208;based nonconjugated clusteroluminogens is engineered via high&#8208;pressure structural regulation. Abnormal blue shift and remarkable emission enhancement are realized, exhibiting distinct structural factors. Intense white&#8208;light emission is realized after high&#8208;pressure treatment, disrupting the typical excited&#8208;state even&#8208;odd effects in ambient study.







Abstract
Clusteroluminogens (CLgens) represent an innovative class of nonconjugated luminophores that address the limitations of conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Different from the through&#8208;bond conjugation mechanism in &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminophores, through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) plays dominant roles in CLgens. However, precisely controlling TSC to customize the optical properties of CLgens remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel strategy of high pressure to engineer TSC within tetraphenylalkanes (TPAs)&#8208;based CLgens at molecular level. High&#8208;pressure exploration enables accurate manipulation of clusteroluminescence and elucidates the intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationships involved. Upon initial compression, the predominant molecular distortions marked by increased interfacial angles between benzene rings diminish TSC, resulting in anomalous hypochromatic shift in emission. Subsequently, considerable structural contraction enhances TSC and suppresses molecular motion, resulting in a pronouncedly enhanced and bathochromic&#8208;shifted emission. Notably, a series of TPAs&#8208;based CLgens exhibit intense white&#8208;light emission upon pressure release, attributed to irreversible structural distortion and destruction. This study not only advances the understanding of CLgens, but also underscores the crucial structural factors for effective TSC control, paving the way for establishing new photophysical theories for aggregate science.

&lt;p&gt;Clusteroluminogens (CLgens) represent an innovative class of nonconjugated luminophores that address the limitations of conventional &#960;-conjugated molecules. Different from the through-bond conjugation mechanism in &#960;-conjugated luminophores, through-space conjugation (TSC) plays dominant roles in CLgens. However, precisely controlling TSC to customize the optical properties of CLgens remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel strategy of high pressure to engineer TSC within tetraphenylalkanes (TPAs)-based CLgens at molecular level.

         <title>Precise Separation of Complex Ultrafine Molecules through Solvating Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoporous nanomaterials, with their proven potential for accurate molecular sieving, are of substantial interest in propelling sustainable membrane techniques. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are prominent due to their customizable isopores and chemistry. Still, the discrepancy in experimental and theoretical structures poses a challenge to developing COF membranes for molecular separations. Here, we report high&#8208;selectivity sieving of complex ultrafine molecules through solvating pore&#8208;to&#8208;pore&#8208;aligned two&#8208;dimensional COF membranes. Our structurally oriented membrane shows reversible interlayer expansion with intralayer shift in response to solvent exposure. This dynamic deformation induced by solvents leads to a reduction in the aperture of the membrane&#8217;s sieving pores, which correlates with the number of COF layers. The resultant membranes yield largely improved molecular selectivity to discriminate binary and trinary complex mixtures, exceeding the conventional COF membranes. The membrane&#8217;s robustness against solvents and physical aging permits extremely stable microporosity and reliable operation for over 3000 h. This exceptional performance positions our membrane as an alternative to enriching and purifying value&#8208;added chemicals, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tetrazine Amplification System for Visual Detection of Trace Analytes via Click&#8208;Release Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving visual detection of analytes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in complex mixtures remains a persistent challenge. While sophisticated techniques offer single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, practical hurdles remain, necessitating tailored signal amplification systems for direct visual detection. In this study, we develop a strategy for the visualized detection of tetrazine through a "click&#8208;release&#8208;oxidation&#8208;cycle" (CROC) cascade amplification process. We systematically describe the construction and synthesis of this system, the kinetic process of click release, the kinetics of oxidation to tetrazine and its cascade amplification effect in trace amounts of tetrazine. This system is capable of amplifying the signal of tetrazine at a concentration as low as 2 nM by 105&#8208;fold, thereby providing a clearly visible purple signal. Finally, as proof of concept, we successfully apply this method to visually detect trace &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) and Pd2+.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks by Implanting Cu Sites with Perfluorooctane to Accelerate CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value&#8208;added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously. Yet, it remains an ongoing challenge due to the competition with thermodynamically more preferred ethylene production. Herein, we presented a CO2 reduction predilection switch from ethylene to ethanol (ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of ~5.4) by inherently implanting Cu sites with perfluorooctane to create interfacial non&#8208;covalent interactions. The 1.83%F&#8208;Cu2O organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids (OIHs) exhibited an extraordinary ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) of &#8764;55.2%, with an impressive ethanol partial current density of 166 mA cm&#8208;2 and excellent robustness over 60 hours of continuous operation. This exceptional performance ranks our 1.83%F&#8208;Cu2O OIHs among the best&#8208;performing ethanol&#8208;oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts. Our findings identified that C8F18 could strengthen the interfacial hydrogen bonding connectivity, which consequently promotes the generation of active hydrogen species and preferentially favors the hydrogenation of *CHCOH to *CHCHOH, thus switching the reaction from ethylene&#8208;preferred to ethanol&#8208;oriented. The presented investigations highlight opportunities for using noncovalent interactions to tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, bringing it closer to practical implementation requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Halide Cathode Materials Based on Intercalation&#8208;Conversion Reaction Towards All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with non&#8208;flammable solid&#8208;state electrolytes offer high energy density and enhanced safety. However, their energy densities are greatly limited by low&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity oxide cathode materials, typically relying on the intercalation&#8208;deintercalation mechanism with a catholyte content of 15~30 wt.%. Here we introduce the LixFeXx+2 (X=Cl, Br) families as high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity alternatives, operating via a 3 mol e&#8208; transfer intercalation&#8208;conversion coupling reaction. Notably, the catholyte&#8208;free ASSLBs using 95 wt.% LiFeCl3 active material delivers a remarkable capacity of 446 mAh g&#8208;1 and a high energy density of 912 Wh kg&#8208;1, which surpasses most oxide cathode materials. Of particular interest is the formation of amorphous Fe during the conversion process. The amorphous Fe exhibits high activity, catalyzing the conversion of LiX back to LixFeXx+2, which proves instrumental in realizing reversible intercalation&#8208;conversion reactions. These halide cathode materials represent a significant advancement towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Alloying Strategy Regulating Size and Electronic Structure of Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to Achieve High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of catalysts in lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries has proven to be an efficacious avenue for enhancing the kinetics of polysulfide conversion. Specially, the size and electronic structure of catalysts play a pivotal role in harnessing the active sites and intrinsic catalysis activity. Outstanding MoSe2 and NbSe2 are selected from 16 universal transition metal selenides based on the proposed binary descriptor. Then, an alloying strategy is devised to prepare Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 flakelets for further improvement of the intrinsic catalysis. The integration of density functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis demonstrates that alloying Mo with Nb can regulate the surface energy and indexes of band match and lattice mismatch, thereby enabling Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to possess a small size, suitable adsorption energy and low reaction energy barrier. This optimization enhances the catalysis of sulfur reduction/evolution reaction and the reversible deposition/stripping of lithium. Consequently, an assembled Ah&#8208;level pouch cell is realized with dramatic cycle stability. With the electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 2.36 &#956;L mg S&#8211;1, the cell can deliver a high energy density of up to 505.4&#8201;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1. This work pioneers a universal strategy for sculpting the geometric configurations and electronic structures of catalysts, to achieve enhanced catalytic activity and precise interpretation of structure&#8722;activity relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Rotor Assembly for the Design of a Hybrid Ferroelectric&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Multiferroic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric (FE)&#8208;antiferromagnetic (AFM) multiferroic materials have sparked growing interest due to their huge possibilities in energy&#8208;saving, photoelectric devices, nonvolatile storage, and switches. However, realizing FE&#8208;AFM properties in a hybrid molecular material is difficult because ferroelectric and magnetic orders are commonly mutually exclusive. Here, we report an FE&#8208;AFM multiferroic semiconductor [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[Mn(SCN)4] (NCMS) by supramolecular assembly approach via molecular rotor synthon [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] and inorganic magnetic module [Mn(SCN)4]. Interestingly, NCMS shows good ferroelectricity with a spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 5.94 &#956;C cm&#8722;2 higher than most crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based ferroelectrics. Especially, the realization of antiferromagnetism is for the first time in the crown ether hybrid perovskite ferroic systems. Additionally, semiconductor NCMS displays an X&#8208;ray radiation detection response with a large photo/dark current on&#8208;off ratio (197). Our study not only gives a deep insight into understanding multiferroic properties but also provides a novel and efficient approach to realizing high&#8208;performance hybrid multiferroic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Spin&#8208;Selective Channels in Fully&#8208;Exposed PtFe Clusters Enable   Fast Cathodic Kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 Batter y</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs), the electron transfer between triplet O2 and singlet Li2O2 possesses a spin&#8208;dependent character but is still neglected, while the spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer without losing phase information should guarantee fast kinetics and reduced energy barriers. Here, we provide a paradigm of spin&#8208;selective catalysis for LOB that the ferromagnetic quantum spin exchange interactions between Pt and Fe atoms in fully&#8208;exposed PtFe clusters filter directional e&#8208;spins for spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer at Fe&#8208;Fe sites. The kinetics of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction is markedly accelerated as predicted by theoretical calculations, showing dramatically decreased relaxation time of the rate determining step for more than one order of magnitude, compared with the Fe clusters without spin&#8208;selective behavior. In consequence, the assembled LOB provides ultrahigh energy conversion efficiency of 89.6% at 100 mA g&#8208;1 under a discharge&#8208;charge overpotential of only 0.32 V. This work provides new insights into the spin&#8208;dependent mechanisms of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction, and the strategy of constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Based on a Narrowband Near&#8208;Ultraviolet and a Hot Exciton&#160;Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high efficiency narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet (NUV) emitters in organic light emitting diode (OLED) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) molecule, named ICz&#8208;BO, is prepared and characterized, in which both multiresonant (MR) skeletons are integrated via conjugation connection. A slightly distorted structure and weak intramolecular charge transfer (CT) interaction between two MR subunits lead to a high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (h&#8208;RISC) channel of T6&#8594;S1, also evidenced by both experimental and calculated results. Impressively, the ICz&#8208;BO emitter exhibits outstanding narrowband NUV emission at 404 nm with a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 28 nm in toluene solution. The solution processable OLED shows an excellent device performance with the recorded maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.01%, concomitant with an extremely low y&#8208;axis Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIEy) value of 0.031. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency reported for the HLCT&#8208;based NUV&#8208;OLEDs to date. This research proves that the MR skeleton plays a positive effect on the narrowband hot exciton emitter, which provides an alternative paradigm for developing high&#8208;efficiency NUV emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Aliphatic Amines Unlocked for Selective Transformations through Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While aromatic diazonium salts are important reagents in organic synthesis, &#8216;Diazonium ions generated from ordinary aliphatic primary amines are usually useless for preparative purposes, since they lead to a mixture of products giving not only substitution by any nucleophile present, but also elimination and rearrangements if the substrate permits.&#8217;[1] In this work, we report that the statement is no longer valid, and it is now possible to control diazotization of aliphatic amines by utilizing isopentyl nitrite in HFIP. This transformation enabled electrophilic aromatic substitution with these highly abundant and commercially available alkyl reagents, as well as transforming them into building blocks typically employed in organic synthesis. The methodology opens an avenue for reactions involving aliphatic amines, even such demanding substrates as amino acids, as a source of carbocations thus expanding the degree of chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating Interaction Dynamics of an Enantioselective Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Acylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods like carbon relaxation dispersion in the rotating frame (13C&#8208;R1&#961;) and proton chemical exchange saturation transfer (1H&#8208;CEST) are key methods to investigate molecular recognition in biomacromolecules and to detect molecular motions on the &#181;s to s timescale, revealing transient conformational states. Changes in kinetics can be linked to binding, folding, or catalytic events. Here, we investigated whether these methods allow detection of changes in the dynamics of a small, highly selective peptide catalyst during recognition of its enantiomeric substrates. The flexible tetrapeptide Boc&#8208;l&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;Me)&#8208;His&#8208;AGly&#8208;l&#8208;Cha&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe, used for the monoacetylation of cycloalkane&#8208;diols, is probed at natural abundance using 13C&#8208;R1&#961; and 1H&#8208;CEST. Indeed, we detected differences in dynamics of the peptide upon interaction with the diol. Importantly, these differ depending on the enantiomer of the substrate used. These enantiospecific influences of the substrates on the dynamics of the peptide are rationalized using computational techniques. We find that even though one enantiomer reacts faster, as confirmed by reaction monitoring, the other is more tightly bound in DCM (as confirmed by 1H&#8208;saturation transfer difference (STD) measurements). These findings provide insights into the recognition of the substrates and explain the selectivity differences observed between the solvents toluene and DCM.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adjuvanting Large Pore 2D Covalent Organic Framework as a Vaccine Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vaccines are one of the greatest human achievements in public health, as they help prevent the spread of diseases, reduce illness and death rates, saving thousands of lives with few side effects. Traditional vaccine development is centered around using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which is expensive and has resulted in vaccine&#8208;associated illnesses. Advancements have led to the development of safer subunit vaccines, which contain recombinant proteins isolated from pathogens. Their short half&#8208;life and small size make most subunit vaccines less immunogenic. Here, we introduce a large pore 2D covalent organic framework (COF), PyCOFamide, as a promising solution for an effective subunit platform. Our study demonstrates that simple adsorption of a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), onto PyCOFamide (OVA@COF) significantly enhances humoral and cell&#8208;mediated immune response compared to free OVA. OVA@COF exhibited heightened immune cell activation and acts as an antigen reservoir, facilitating antigen&#8208;presenting cell trafficking to the draining lymph nodes, amplifying the humoral immune response. Additionally, the breakdown of the COF releases monomers that adjuvant the activation of immune cells vital to creating strong immunity. This platform offers a potential avenue for safer, more effective subunit vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>A Supramolecular Approach to Engineering Living Cells with Enzymes for Adaptive and Recyclable Cascade Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic transformation in nature is inherently dynamic, spontaneous, and adaptive, enabling complex chemical synthesis and metabolism. These processes often&#160;involve supramolecular recognition among cells, enzymes, and biomacromolecules, far&#160;surpassing the capabilities of isolated cells and enzymes used in industrial synthesis. Inspired by nature, here we design a supramolecular approach to equip living cells with these capacities, enabling recyclable, efficient cascade reactions. Our two&#8208;step&#160;"plug&#8208;and&#8208;play" methodology&#160;begins by coating&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;cells with guest&#8208;containing polymers&#160;(SupraBAC) via&#160;supramolecular charge interactions, followed by the introduction of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;functionalized host enzymes through host&#8208;guest chemistry, creating a robust cell&#8208;enzyme complex. This supramolecular coating not only protects cells from various stresses, such as UV radiation, heat, and organic solvents, but also facilitates the overexpression of intracellular enzymes and the attachment of extracellular enzymes within and on SupraBAC. This combination results in efficient multienzyme cascade synthesis, enabling two&#8208; and three&#8208;step reactions in one pot. Importantly, the multienzyme system can be recycled up to five times without significant loss of activity. Our findings introduce a versatile, adaptive supramolecular coating for whole&#8208;cell catalysts, offering a sustainable and efficient solution for complex synthesis in both chemistry and industrial biotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling controllable time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence in carbonized polymer dots based on chromophore excited triplet energy level modulation by ionic bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials are highly attractive for realizing multitiered dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. It&#8217;s extremely challenging to modulate puzzle of multiple luminescence species and understand the intrinsic mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and synthesize&#8208;friendly strategy to develop a high contrast TDPC carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with adjustable lifetime and quantum yields. The ionic bonding is introduced in self&#8208;protected CPDs to effectively tune the excited triplet energy level of chromophores, and promote the stable existence of L&#8208;aspartic (AA) with green phosphorescence at 545 nm, and alkali metal aspartates (AA&#8208;M) with red phosphorescence at 665 nm. The precise regulation for TDPC lifetime can be achieved based on heavy atom effort and crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE) effect.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Time-dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials are highly attractive for realizing multitiered dynamic information encryption and anti-counterfeiting. It&#8217;s extremely challenging to modulate puzzle of multiple luminescence species and understand the intrinsic mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and synthesize-friendly strategy to develop a high contrast TDPC carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with adjustable lifetime and quantum yields. The ionic bonding is introduced in self-protected CPDs to effectively tune the excited triplet energy level of chromophores, and promote the stable existence of L-aspartic (AA) with green phosphorescence at 545 nm, and alkali metal aspartates (AA-M) with red phosphorescence at 665 nm. The precise regulation for TDPC lifetime can be achieved based on heavy atom effort and crosslink-enhanced emission (CEE) effect. And, the efficient radiative energy transfer could be proven as an intrinsic mechanism for better understanding the TDPC materials. These results further expand on the fundamental principle to design high-quality TDPC materials with more flexible regulation for luminescence properties, providing a major step forward in broadening the scope of smart phosphorescence applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalysis of Molecular&#8208;Like Au8M(PPh3)8n+ Clusters Cultivated in Mesoporous SBA&#8208;15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a dream of researchers to be able to tailor the catalytic performances by adjusting heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level. Atomically precise metal clusters provide us with the possibility to achieve this challenge. Here, we design a push&#8208;and&#8208;pull synthesis strategy coupled with TiOx coating to prepare the heterogeneous catalysts denoted as TiOx/Au8M@SBA via cultivating atomically precise Au8M(PPh3)8n+ (M = Pd, Pt or Au; n = 2 for Pd/Pt and 3 for Au) clusters in mesoporous molecular sieve. The catalysts are made up of the three functional units, which include Au8M(PPh3)8n+ clusters that can act as the active sites, the pore environment of the SBA&#8208;15 that can announce a catalysis show for the clusters with precise number of atoms maintained during the chemical reactions, and the TiOx coating that can further inhibit the migration of the clusters under reaction conditions. The selective hydrogenation of acetylene performed in the fixed&#8208;bed reactor taken, for example, we learn how the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring of a heterogeneous catalyst can switch on elusive heterogeneous mechanisms with cluster catalysis. This work sheds light on the fundamental insight into catalysis origin of heterogeneous catalysts and achieves a distinguished level of detail for cluster catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;small Metallic Nickel Nanoparticles on Dealuminated Zeolite for Active and Durable Catalytic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Each step in the catalyst synthesis process plays an important role in tuning the catalyst structures. For zeolite&#8208;supported nickel catalysts, we found the conventional calcination&#8208;reduction method typically leads to the formation of large nickel particles, but a pre&#8208;aging in hydrogen or nitrogen at a low temperature prior to final reduction can result in ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles in a metallic state. This pre&#8208;aging treatment facilitates the interaction between Ni2+ cations and silanol nests on zeolite before the decomposition of the metal salt, leading to the formation of nanoparticles with an average diameter of ~1.2 nm. In contrast, the pre&#8208;calcination in oxygen caused the Ni2+ aggregation before the decomposition of the metal salt precursor, yielding nickel nanoparticles larger than 5 nm. Given the structure sensitivity of nickel in cyclohexane dehydrogenation for hydrogen production, the ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles exhibited significantly enhanced activity and durability compared to previous nickel catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Responsive Artificial H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels for Targeted Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ion channels regulate the ion flow across the membranes in response to alterations in the cellular redox state, playing a crucial role in cellular adaptation to oxidative stress. Despite their significance, replicating ROS&#8208;responsive functionality in artificial ion channels remains elusive. In this study, we introduce a novel class of artificial H+/Cl&#8208; ion channels activatable by elevated ROS levels in cancer cells. ROS&#8208;induced decaging of the phenylboronate group triggers the rapid release of the channel&#8208;forming units, leading to self&#8208;assembly of the H&#8208;bonded cascades facilitating the synergistic transport of H+ and Cl&#8208; ions, with H+/Cl&#8208; ion transport selectivity of 7.7. Upon activation, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl exhibits significant apoptotic activity against human breast cancer cells, achieving an IC50 of 2.8 &#956;M, comparable to that of paclitaxel. Exploiting the intrinsic oxidative microenvironment of cancer cells, along with the enhanced oxidative stress arising from H+/Cl&#8208; co&#8208;transport, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl demonstrates exceptional selectivity in targeting cancer cells with a selectivity index of 10.2 over normal breast cells, outperforming that of paclitaxel by 19.4 folds.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangement of Azo Compounds Enables Low&#8208;Potential, High&#8208;capacity Organic Anodes for Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The widespread adoption of rechargeable alkaline batteries is plagued by the performance&#8208;limiting metal anodes, which are prone to (electro)chemical corrosion and raise environmental or economic concerns. Organic redox&#8208;active materials offer a potential solution, but they typically struggle with dissolution&#8208;induced degradation and insufficiently negative reduction potentials. Herein, we introduce benzo[c]cinnoline and its derivatives (collectively referred to as BCCs), a class of aromatic azo compounds with fused&#8208;ring structure, as promising organic anode materials. BCCs exhibit pronounced aromaticity and Br&#248;nsted basicity, conferring low reduction potentials and intrinsic insolubility in alkaline solutions. Paired with the industrially established nickel hydroxide cathode, these batteries deliver high capacity (297 mAh g&#8722;1anode), output voltage of 1.3 V, and extended cycle life (&#8776; 16000 cycles). Notably, they also operate efficiently at extremely low temperatures down to &#8722;85 &#176;C with an 8 M KOH electrolyte. We further explore the feasibility for all&#8208;organic alkaline batteries by paring BCCs with the dihydro form of 4,4'&#8208;azopyridine, utilizing azo compounds for both anode and cathodes. This chemistry leverages the unique properties of small organic molecules to achieve batteries with high capacity (236 mAh g&#8211;1), fast charging (1200 C), and easy recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Diffusive Nonluminescent Carriers in Hybrid Phase Lead Triiodide Perovskite Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated carriers can be captured by phase transition induced defects (PTIDs) formed by hybrid&#8208;phase within the same MAPbI3 single crystal and then be &#8220;protected&#8221; form radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations. The mobility of PTID&#8208;dressed nonluminescent carriers is successfully promoted by about 14&#8208;fold to as high as 1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, comparing with band&#8208;edge free carriers at room temperature. What's more, facilitated by this highly diffusive nonluminescent carrier within, the MAPbI3 NWs&#8208;based photodetector's responsivity is promoted by about three times.







Abstract
Crystal structural rearrangements unavoidably introduce defects into materials, where even these small changes in local lattice structure could arouse a prominent impact on the overall nature of crystals. Contrary to the traditional notion that defects obstruct carrier transport, herein, we report a promoted transport mechanism of nonluminescent carriers in single&#8208;crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires (1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, about a 14&#8208;fold improvement), enabled by the phase transition induced defects (PTIDs). Carriers captured by PTIDs evade both the radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations during the incomplete tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition at low temperatures, forming a specific nonluminescent state that exhibits an efficient long&#8208;distance transport and thereby realize a prominent enhancement of photocurrent responsivity for photodetector applications.

     alt="Highly Diffusive Nonluminescent Carriers in Hybrid Phase Lead Triiodide Perovskite Nanowires"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photogenerated carriers can be captured by phase transition induced defects (PTIDs) formed by hybrid-phase within the same MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal and then be &#8220;protected&#8221; form radiative and non-radiative recombinations. The mobility of PTID-dressed nonluminescent carriers is successfully promoted by about 14-fold to as high as 1345.2&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, comparing with band-edge free carriers at room temperature. What's more, facilitated by this highly diffusive nonluminescent carrier within, the MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NWs-based photodetector's responsivity is promoted by about three times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal structural rearrangements unavoidably introduce defects into materials, where even these small changes in local lattice structure could arouse a prominent impact on the overall nature of crystals. Contrary to the traditional notion that defects obstruct carrier transport, herein, we report a promoted transport mechanism of nonluminescent carriers in single-crystalline CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires (1345.2&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, about a 14-fold improvement), enabled by the phase transition induced defects (PTIDs). Carriers captured by PTIDs evade both the radiative and non-radiative recombinations during the incomplete tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition at low temperatures, forming a specific nonluminescent state that exhibits an efficient long-distance transport and thereby realize a prominent enhancement of photocurrent responsivity for photodetector applications. The findings provide broader insights into the carrier transport mechanism in perovskite semiconductors and have significant implications for their rational design for photoelectronic applications at varied operating temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Comprehensive Profiling of Roquin Binding Preferences for RNA Stem&#8208;Loops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
sRBNS (structured RNA Bind&#8208;n&#8208;Seq) allows precise mapping of RNA&#8208;protein interactions including RNA structures at nucleotide resolution. Using this new method, we dissected the RNA&#8208;binding preferences of Roquin proteins towards RNA stem&#8208;loops, identified new high&#8208;affinity motifs and expanded the mRNA target space in cells. Thus, sRBNS allows for the detailed investigation of complex binding events beyond single stranded RNA motifs.







Abstract
The cellular levels of mRNAs are controlled post&#8208;transcriptionally by cis&#8208;regulatory elements located in the 3&#8217;&#8208;untranslated region. These linear or structured elements are recognized by RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs) to modulate mRNA stability. The Roquin&#8208;1 and &#8722;2 proteins specifically recognize RNA stem&#8208;loop motifs, the trinucleotide loop&#8208;containing constitutive decay elements (CDEs) and the hexanucleotide loop&#8208;containing alternative decay elements (ADEs), with their unique ROQ domain to initiate mRNA degradation. However, the RNA&#8208;binding capacity of Roquin towards different classes of stem&#8208;loops has not been rigorously characterized, leaving its exact binding preferences unclear. Here, we map the RNA&#8208;binding preference of the ROQ domain at nucleotide resolution introducing sRBNS (structured RNA Bind&#8208;n&#8208;Seq), a customized RBNS workflow with pre&#8208;structured RNA libraries. We found a clear preference of Roquin towards specific loop sizes and extended the consensus motifs for CDEs and ADEs. The newly identified motifs are recognized with nanomolar affinity through the canonical RNA&#8208;ROQ interface. Using these new stem&#8208;loop variants as blueprints, we predicted novel Roquin target mRNAs and verified the expanded target space in&#8197;cells. The study demonstrates the power of high&#8208;throughput assays including RNA structure formation for the systematic investigation of (structural) RNA&#8208;binding preferences to comprehensively identify mRNA targets and elucidate the biological function of RBPs.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Enabled Process with Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sustainable Plastic Waste Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a novel plasma&#8208;enabled strategy for rapidly decomposing various plastic wastes into high&#8208;value carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. This innovative approach provides an attractive solution to the pressing issue of plastic waste accumulation, which poses significant environmental challenges and complicates waste management. Our method offers a cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and selective means of directly converting complex plastic wastes into valuable products, thereby supporting a circular plastic economy.







Abstract
The escalating issue of plastic waste generation has prompted the search for an effective solution to address these challenges. In this study, we present a novel plasma&#8208;enabled strategy for the rapid breakdown of various types of plastic wastes, including mixtures, into high&#8208;value carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. The H2 yield and selectivity achieved through the implemented catalyst&#8208;free plasma&#8208;enabled strategy are 14.2 and 5.9&#8197;times higher, respectively, compared to those obtained with conventional thermal pyrolysis under similar conditions. It is noteworthy that this catalyst&#8208;free plasma alone approach yields a significantly higher energy yield of H2 (gH2/kWh) compared to other pyrolysis processes. By coupling plasma pyrolysis with thermal catalytic process, employing of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% M/CeO2 (M=Fe, Co, and Ni) atomically dispersed catalysts can further enhance hydrogen production. Specifically, the 1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Co/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performance throughout the 10&#8197;cycles of plastic waste decomposition, achieving the highest H2 yield of 46.7&#8197;mmol/gplastic (equivalent to 64.4&#8201;% of theoretical H2 production) and nearly 100&#8201;% hydrogen atom recovery efficiency at the 7th cycle. Notably, the H2 yield achieved over the atomically dispersed Fe on CeO2 surface (1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Fe/CeO2) in the integrated plasma&#8208;thermal catalytic process is comparable to that obtained with Fe particles on CeO2 surface (10&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Fe/CeO2). This outcome, demonstrated with single&#8208;atom catalysts, offers a promising avenue for cost&#8208;effective and efficient chemical plastic recycling. Through a combination of experimental and computational efforts, we have provided an in&#8208;depth understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of the investigated single atom catalysts in the developed plasma&#8208;enabled process. This innovative and straightforward approach provides a promising and expedient strategy for continuously converting diverse plastic waste streams, including mixed and contaminated sources, into high&#8208;value products conducive to a circular plastic economy.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation of Indoles with N&#8208;Triftosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclopropanation of indoles has been developed using trifluoromethyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors. The reaction enables rapid construction of diverse cyclopropane&#8208;fused indolines bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocenter in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, even for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex biologically relevant substrates.







Abstract
Herein we report a general rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intermolecular dearomative cyclopropanation of indoles using trifluoromethyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors. The reaction enables the rapid construction of diverse cyclopropane&#8208;fused indolines bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocenter with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). This mild method exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerating various functional groups, and can even be utilized for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex bioactive molecules. DFT calculations suggest that the formation of a key zwitterionic intermediate is responsible for the chiral induction. Overall, this approach opens up new possibilities for asymmetric cyclopropanation of challenging aromatic heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with various nucleophiles driven by visible light has been developed. This metal&#8208;free method is selective and produces diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. Additionally, it allows for full 13C isotopic incorporation.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with different nucleophiles to generate valuable carbonyl derivatives under visible light irradiation. This method is mild, robust, highly selective, and proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions to prepare a range of structurally diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. In addition, we highlight the application of this activation strategy for 13C isotopic incorporation. We propose that the reaction proceeds by a photoinduced reduction to afford carbon&#8208;centered radicals from alkyl halides, which undergo subsequent single electron&#8208;oxidation to form a carbocationic intermediate. Carbon monoxide is trapped by the carbocation to generate an acylium cation, which can be attacked by a series of nucleophiles to give a range of carbonyl products.

This metal-free method is selective and produces diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. Additionally, it allows for full &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopic incorporation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we describe a new strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with different nucleophiles to generate valuable carbonyl derivatives under visible light irradiation. This method is mild, robust, highly selective, and proceeds under metal-free conditions to prepare a range of structurally diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. In addition, we highlight the application of this activation strategy for &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopic incorporation. We propose that the reaction proceeds by a photoinduced reduction to afford carbon-centered radicals from alkyl halides, which undergo subsequent single electron-oxidation to form a carbocationic intermediate. Carbon monoxide is trapped by the carbocation to generate an acylium cation, which can be attacked by a series of nucleophiles to give a range of carbonyl products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Covalent Inhibiting JNK3 by Small Molecules for Parkinson's Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered JC16I, the first JNK3&#8208;selective covalent inhibitor, which could target conserved cysteine in JNK family. JC16I potently and selectively inhibits and labels JNK3 in living cells and cell lysates, and demonstrates neuroprotective effects in PD models without compromising safety.







Abstract
c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinases (JNKs) including JNK1/2/3 are key members of mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase family. Wherein JNK3 is specifically expressed in brain and emerges as therapeutic target, especially for neurodegenerative diseases. However, developing JNK3 selective inhibitors as chemical probes to investigate its therapeutic potential in diseases remains challenging. Here, we adopted the covalent strategy for identifying JNK3&#8208;selective covalent inhibitor JC16I, with high inhibitory activity against JNK3. Despite targeting a conserved cysteine in the vicinity of ATP pocket in JNK family, JC16I exerted a greater than 160&#8208;fold selectivity for JNK3 over JNK1/2. Importantly, even at low concentration, JC16I showed enhanced and long&#8208;lasting inhibition against cellular JNK3. In addition, its alkyne&#8208;containing probe JC&#8208;P1 could label JNK3 in SH&#8208;SY5Y cell lysate and living cells, with good proteome&#8208;wide selectivity. JC16I selectively suppressed the abnormal activation of JNK3 signaling and sufficiently exhibited neuroprotective effect in Parkinson's diseases (PD) models. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of developing isoform&#8208;selective and cell&#8208;active JNK3 inhibitors by covalent drug design strategy targeting a conserved cysteine. This work not only provides a valuable chemical probe for JNK3&#8208;targeted investigations in vitro and in vivo but also opens new avenues for the treatment of PD.

         <title>Isomeric Dimer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells with over 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomer dimer acceptors were designed and synthesized, D&#8208;TPh and D&#8208;TN, which differ in the positional arrangement of their end capping groups. D&#8208;TPh exhibited enhanced planarity, elevated LUMO energy, more ordered stacking, and desirable phase separation. Consequently, the OSC device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh achieved a higher efficiency of 19.05&#8201;% and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
The strategy of isomerization is known for its simple yet effective role in optimizing molecular configuration and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the impact of isomerization on the design of dimer acceptors has been rarely investigated, and the relationship between the chemical structure and optoelectronic property remains unclear. In this study, we designed and synthesized two dimer acceptor isomers named D&#8208;TPh and D&#8208;TN, which differ in the positional arrangement of their end capping groups. Compared to D&#8208;TN, D&#8208;TPh exhibited enhanced backbone planarity, elevated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, and more ordered molecular stacking. Consequently, the OSC device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh achieved a PCE of 19.05&#8201;%, higher than that (PCE=18.42&#8201;%) of the device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TN. Large&#8208;area PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh devices (1&#8197;cm2) yielded a PCE of 18.00&#8201;%. More importantly, the extrapolated T80 lifetime of the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh device is over 2800&#8197;h with MPP tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. These results suggest that isomerization strategy is an effective way to optimize the molecular configuration of dimer acceptors for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and stable OSCs.

         <title>Anion Chemistry towards On&#8208;Site Construction of Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Stable Metallic Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of lacking effective SEI on Zn anode in aqueous Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte, a cathodic route was developed to achieve a uniform OTf&#8722;&#8208;involved artificial SEI on Zn anode, which brings the merits of promoting interfacial kinetics, depressing side reactions, and prolonging ZMB lifespan.







Abstract
Reversibility of metallic Zn anode serves as the corner stone for the development of aqueous Zn metal battery, which motivates scrutinizing the electrolyte&#8208;Zn interface. As the representative organic zinc salt, zinc trifluorosulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) facilitates a broad class of aqueous electrolytes, however, the stability issue of Zn anode remains crucial. The great challenge lies in the lack of Zn anode protection by the pristinely formed surface structure in aqueous Zn(OTf)2 electrolytes. Accordingly, an electrochemical route was developed to grow a uniform zinc trifluorosulfonate hydroxide (ZTH) layer on Zn anode as an artificial SEI, via regulation on metal dissolution and strong coordination ability of zinc ions. Co&#8208;precipitation was proposed to be the formation mechanism for the artificial SEI, where the reduction stability of OTf&#8722; anion and the low&#8208;symmetry layer structure of ZTH was unmasked. This artificial SEI favors interfacial kinetics, depresses side reactions, and well maintains its integrity during cycling, leading to a prolonged lifespan of Zn stripping/plating with a high DOD of ~85&#8201;%, and an improved cycling stability of ~92&#8201;% retention rate for V2O5/Zn cell at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The unveiled role of anion on Zn anode drives the contemplation on the surface chemistry for the blooming aqueous rechargeable battery.

         <title>Red&#8208;Shifting B12&#8208;Dependent Photoreceptor Protein via Optical Coupling for Inducible Living Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;shifting of B12&#8208;dependent photoreceptor CarHC has been accomplished by labeling with the red light&#8208;capturing fluorophore Cy5, which further enables the assembly and disassembly of biomacromolecules or living cells in a B12 and red light&#8208;dependent manner. This optical coupling approach can potentially be expanded for spectral tuning of other optogenetic tools.







Abstract
Cobalamin (B12)&#8208;dependent photoreceptors are gaining traction in materials synthetic biology, especially for optically controlling cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell adhesion in living materials. However, these proteins are mostly responsive to green light, limiting their deep&#8208;tissue applications. Here, we present a general strategy for shifting photoresponse of B12&#8208;dependent photoreceptor CarHC from green to red/far&#8208;red light via optical coupling. Using thiol&#8208;maleimide click chemistry, we labeled cysteine&#8208;containing CarHC mutants with SulfoCyanine5 (Cy5), a red light&#8208;capturing fluorophore. The resulting photoreceptors not only retained the ability to tetramerize in the presence of adenosylcobalamin (AdoB12), but also gained sensitivity to red light; labeled tetramers disassembled on red light exposure. Using genetically encoded click chemistry, we assembled the red&#8208;shifted proteins into hydrogels that degraded rapidly in response to red light. Furthermore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were genetically engineered to display CarHC variants, which, alongside in situ Cy5 labeling, led to living materials that could assemble and disassemble in response to AdoB12 and red light, respectively. These results illustrate the CarHC spectrally tuned by optical coupling as a versatile motif for dynamically controlling cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell interactions within engineered living materials. Given their prevalence and ecological diversity in nature, this spectral tuning method will expand the use of B12&#8208;dependent photoreceptors in optogenetics and living materials.

Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; cells were genetically engineered to display CarH&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; variants, which, alongside in situ Cy5 labeling, led to living materials that could assemble and disassemble in response to AdoB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and red light, respectively. These results illustrate the CarH&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; spectrally tuned by optical coupling as a versatile motif for dynamically controlling cell-to-cell interactions within engineered living materials. Given their prevalence and ecological diversity in nature, this spectral tuning method will expand the use of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent photoreceptors in optogenetics and living materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Modification by Ordered Discotic Liquid Crystals for Thermotolerance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we synthesized a discotic liquid crystal molecule (HAT5) and combined it with o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to construct an interface passivation layer. The introduction of HAT5 promotes the transport of holes in PSCs, changing the edge&#8208;on orientation of o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation for charge transfer, inhibiting the migration of o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to the bottom of perovskite, and increasing the activation energy of ion migration. In the end, we achieved a championship efficiency of 25.02&#8201;%. Unpacked PSCs, whether heated at 85&#8201;&#176;C or aged under continuous sunlight for 1008&#8197;hours, can maintain an initial efficiency of over 80&#8201;%.







Abstract
Traditionally used phenylethylamine iodide (PEAI) and its derivatives, such as ortho&#8208;fluorine o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, in interfacial modification, are beneficial for perovskite solar cell (PSC) efficiency but vulnerable to heat stability above 85&#8201;&#176;C due to ion migration. To address this issue, we propose a composite interface modification layer incorporating the discotic liquid crystal 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(pentoxy)triphenylene (HAT5) into o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI. The triphenyl core in HAT5 promotes &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly and enhances its interaction with o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, forming an oriented columnar phase that improves hole extraction along the one&#8208;dimensional direction. HAT5 repairs structural defects in the interfacial layer and retains the layered structure to inhibit ion migration under heating. Ultimately, our approach increases the efficiency of solar cells from 23.36&#8201;% to 25.02&#8201;%. The thermal stability of the devices retains 80.1&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1008&#8197;hours without encapsulation. Moreover, the optimized PSCs maintained 82.4&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after aging under one sunlight exposure for 1008&#8197;hours. This work provides a simple yet effective strategy using composite materials for interface modification to enhance the thermal and light stability of semiconductor devices.

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution Reactivity of Pentagonal Carbon Rings and p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization Effect with Ru</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological pentagon defects endow carbon nanomaterial with intrinsic hydrogen evolution reactivity and draw forth a strong p&#8208;d orbital hybridization effect with Ru species, which induces favorable electron transfer and weakened hydrogen adsorption strength and reaction barrier of Ru sites, significantly driving electrocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Topological defects are inevitable existence in carbon&#8208;based frameworks, but their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and mechanism remain under&#8208;explored. Herein, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of pentagonal carbon&#8208;rings is probed by constructing pentagonal ring&#8208;rich carbon (PRC), with optimized electronic structures and higher HER activity relative to common hexagonal carbon (HC). Furthermore, to improve the reactivity, we couple Ru clusters with PRC (Ru@PRC) through p&#8208;d orbital hybridization between C and Ru atoms, which drives a shortcut transfer of electrons from Ru clusters to pentagonal rings. The electron&#8208;deficient Ru species leads to a notable negative shift in d&#8208;band centers of Ru and weakens their binding strength with hydrogen intermediates, thus enhancing the HER activity in different pH media. Especially, at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, PRC greatly reduces alkaline HER overpotentials from 540 to 380&#8197;mV. And Ru@PRC even exhibits low overpotentials of 28 and 275&#8197;mV to reach current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Impressively, the mass activity and price activity of Ru@PRC are 7.83 and 15.7&#8197;times higher than that of Pt/C at the overpotential of 50&#8197;mV. Our data unveil the positive HER reactivity of pentagonal defects and good application prospects.

         <title>Oriented Synthesis of Glycine from CO2, N2, and H2O via a Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete production chain was demonstrated for electrorefining glycine directly from air components containing CO2, N2, O2, and H2O. Such a prospective scheme was composed of three modules, linked by a spontaneous C&#8208;N formation process. The full&#8208;path design not only outlines a roadmap for selective C&#8208;N formation but also paves a perspective avenue for green manufacturing and origin&#8208;of&#8208;life research.







Abstract
Air contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen elements that are essential for the constitution of amino acids. Converting the air into amino acids, powered with renewable electricity, provides a green and sustainable alternative to petrochemical&#8208;based methods that produce waste and pollution. Here, taking glycine as an example, we demonstrated the complete production chain for electrorefining amino acids directly from CO2, N2, and H2O. Such a prospective Scheme was composed of three modules, linked by a spontaneous C&#8722;N bond formation process. The high&#8208;purity bridging intermediates, separated from the stepwise synthesis, boosted both the carbon selectivity from CO2 to glycine of 91.7&#8201;% and nitrogen selectivity from N2 to glycine of 98.7&#8201;%. Under the optimum condition, we obtained glycine with a partial current density of 160.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The high&#8208;purity solid glycine product was acquired with a separation efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%. This work unveils a green and sustainable method for the abiotic creation of amino acids from the air components.

         <title>A Thermally Populated Germylene&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A germylene&#8208;based D&#8722;A molecule was synthesized by radical head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization under mild conditions. The coordination of Lewis acids led to intramolecular single electron transfer upon heating to form a thermally populated triplet diradical. This work provided an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species in main group chemistry.







Abstract
This work reports synthesis of a germylene based donor&#8208;acceptor molecule and its thermal excitation to a triplet state by coordination with a Lewis acid. Products have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy, and SQUID measurement, in conjunction with DFT calculation. The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of the donor&#8208;acceptor molecule is dramatically reduced from &#8722;18.8 to &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol by the coordination with B(C6F5)3 (BCF), which enables an intramolecular single electron transfer from one germylene moiety to another upon heating, forming an intramolecular radical ion pair with diradical character. The work provides an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species of heavier main group elements.

         <title>Unveiling the Activity Origin of Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution on Heteroatom&#8208;Decorated Carbon Matrix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
F, N&#8208;doped carbon matrix is selected as the model system to explore the activity origin of carbon towards the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Enriched electrons on O* intermediate can promote the transition from O* to OOH* during OER, fundamentally addressing the rate&#8208;limiting step issue of OOH* generation in carbon materials.







Abstract
Chemical modification via functional dopants in carbon materials holds great promise for elevating catalytic activity and stability. To gain comprehensive insights into the pivotal mechanisms and establish structure&#8208;performance relationships, especially concerning the roles of dopants, remains a pressing need. Herein, we employ computational simulations to unravel the catalytic function of heteroatoms in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), focusing on a physical model of high&#8208;electronegative F and N co&#8208;doped carbon matrix. Theoretical and experimental findings elucidate that the enhanced activity originates from the F and pyridinic&#8208;N (Py&#8722;N) species that achieve carbon activation. This activated carbon significantly lowers the conversion energy barrier from O* to OOH*, shifts the potential&#8208;limiting step from OOH* formation to O* generation, and ultimately optimizes the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;limiting step. This wok elucidates that the critical role of heteroatoms in catalyzing the reaction and unlocks the potential of carbon materials for acidic OER.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Wet Chemistry for the Fast Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Graphyne and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>

Fast gram&#8208;scale production of &#947;&#8208;Graphyne has been successfully achieved by a metal&#8208;free nucleophilic crosslinking wet chemical method. This synthetic strategy shows remarkable tolerance to various functional groups, enabling the preparation of diverse F&#8208;/N&#8208;rich &#947;&#8208;Graphyne derivatives.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Graphyne (GY), an emerging carbon allotrope, is envisioned to offer various alluring properties and broad applicability. While significant progress has been made in the synthesis of GY over recent decades, its widespread application hinges on developing efficient, scalable, and accessible synthetic methods for the production of GY and its derivatives. Here we report a facile metal&#8208;free nucleophilic crosslinking method using wet chemistry for fast gram&#8208;scale production of GY and its derivatives. This synthesis method involves the aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions between fluoro&#8208;(hetero)arenes and alkynyl silanes in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride, where the fluoride plays a crucial role in removing protective groups from alkynyl silanes and generating reactive alkynylides. Our comprehensive analysis of the as&#8208;prepared GY reveals a layered structure, characterized by the presence of the C(sp)&#8722;C(sp2) bond. The synthetic strategy shows remarkable tolerance to various functional groups and enables the preparation of diverse F&#8208;/N&#8208;rich GY derivatives, using electron&#8208;deficient fluoro&#8208;substituted (hetero)arenes as precursors. The feasibility of producing GY and derivatives from fluorinated (hetero)arenes through the metal&#8208;free, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective approach paves the way for broad applications of GY and may inspire the development of new carbon materials.

         <title>An Expedient Route to Bio&#8208;Based Polyacrylate Alternatives with Inherent Post&#8208;Chemical Modification and Degradation Capabilities by Organic Catalysis for Polymerization of Muconate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalyzed group transfer polymerization (O&#8208;GTP) of muconic esters leads to bio&#8208;sourced and degradable polymers analogous to polyacrylates. This O&#8208;GTP method proves ultra&#8208;fast, converting 100&#8201;% of the monomer in one minute in toluene at room temperature. Chemical modification of the internal double bonds offers additional leverage either for modulating polymer properties or for chemical degradation.







Abstract
The quest for polymers that would be at the same time bio&#8208;based and degradable after usage, in addition to offering chemical post&#8208;modification options, remains a daunting challenge in contemporary polymer science. Despite advances in polymer chemistry, attempts at controlling the chain&#8208;growth polymerization of muconate esters remain unexplored. Here we show that dialkyl muconates can be rapidly polymerized by organocatalyzed group transfer polymerization (O&#8208;GTP). O&#8208;GTP is conducted to completion at room temperature in toluene within a few minutes, using 1&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (ETSB) as initiator and 1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4,4,4&#8208;tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis[tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;phosphoranylidenamino]&#8208;2

This is showcased through the hydrolysis of the ester side chains leading to well&#8208;defined poly(muconic acid), and by epoxidation of the C=C double bonds of the main chain. Last but not least, these internal alkene groups can be selectively cleaved by ozonolysis, demonstrating the upcyclability of polymuconates under oxidative conditions.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Nitric Oxide Modulation via Electrochemical Platform to Profile Tumor Cell Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual nature of nitric oxide (NO) in relation to tumor cells necessitates a precise investigation of the critical concentration window of NO. In this manuscript, we introduce Electrochemical System for Conveyance of Radicals to Tumor cells (ESCoRT) a platform that allows precise control of NO generation through electrochemical nitrite reduction. Our study identifies conditions that induce cytotoxicity, offering valuable insights for therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule intricately implicated in oncologic processes, encompassing the modulation of angiogenesis and instigating apoptosis. Investigation of the antitumor effects of NO is currently underway, necessitating a detailed understanding of its cellular&#8208;level reactions. Regulating the behavior of radical NO species has been a significant challenge, primarily due to its instability in aqueous environments by rapid O2&#8208;induced degradation. In this study, we devised an electrochemical platform to investigate the cellular responses to reactive gaseous molecules. Our designed platform precisely controlled the NO flux and diffusion rates of NO to tumor cells. COMSOL Multiphysics calculations based on diffusion and reaction kinetics were conducted to simulate the behavior of electrochemically generated NO. We discerned that the effective radius, NO flux, and electrolysis duration are pivotal factors governing cellular response by NO.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Diversity of Pt&#8722;O Coordination for Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts Achieved by Oriented Atomic Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via proper preparation methods, oriented atomic deposition of Pt is achieved on different facets of truncated CeO2 octahedrons. Normal impregnation results in Pt location on the predominantly exposed {111} plane on the side, while UV photo&#8208;deposition stabilizes Pt atoms in the &#8220;nano&#8208;pockets&#8221; formed at the top {100} plane. Distinct catalytic performance for CO oxidation is found, where the key is the varied Pt&#8722;O coordination environments on different facets determined by the preparation method.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of CeO2 is dictated by the well&#8208;defined facets, which exert great influence on the supported metal species and the catalytic performance. Here we report Pt1/CeO2 catalysts exhibiting specific structures of Pt&#8722;O coordination on different facets by using adequate preparation methods. The simple impregnation method results in Pt&#8722;O3 coordination on the predominantly exposed {111} facets, while the photo&#8208;deposition method achieves oriented atomic deposition for Pt&#8722;O4 coordination into the &#8220;nano&#8208;pocket&#8221; structure of {100} facets at the top. Compared to the impregnated Pt1/CeO2 catalyst showing normal redox properties and low&#8208;temperature activity for CO oxidation, the photo&#8208;deposited Pt1/CeO2 exhibits uncustomary strong metal&#8208;support interaction and extraordinary high&#8208;temperature stability. The preparation methods dictate the facet&#8208;dependent diversity of Pt&#8722;O coordination, resulting in the further activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. By applying specific preparation routes, our work provides an example of disentangling the effects of support facets and coordination environments for nano&#8208;catalysts.

     alt="Facet-Dependent Diversity of Pt&#8722;O Coordination for Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts Achieved by Oriented Atomic Deposition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via proper preparation methods, oriented atomic deposition of Pt is achieved on different facets of truncated CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; octahedrons. Normal impregnation results in Pt location on the predominantly exposed {111} plane on the side, while UV photo-deposition stabilizes Pt atoms in the &#8220;nano-pockets&#8221; formed at the top {100} plane. Distinct catalytic performance for CO oxidation is found, where the key is the varied Pt&#8722;O coordination environments on different facets determined by the preparation method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface chemistry of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is dictated by the well-defined facets, which exert great influence on the supported metal species and the catalytic performance. Here we report Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts exhibiting specific structures of Pt&#8722;O coordination on different facets by using adequate preparation methods. The simple impregnation method results in Pt&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coordination on the predominantly exposed {111} facets, while the photo-deposition method achieves oriented atomic deposition for Pt&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coordination into the &#8220;nano-pocket&#8221; structure of {100} facets at the top.

         <title>Thermal Annealing Effects on Long&#8208;Lived Fluorenol Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Styrene Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of doped polymer&#8208;based long&#8208;life RTP systems linked to a PVA matrix via thermal annealing was developed. Additionally, by adjusting the doping proportion and annealing time, blue afterglow that lasts for approximately 30&#8197;s was achieved. Fortunately, a new type of styrene detector was prepared while the cross&#8208;linked network between PVA chains were bridged by 9HMF.







Abstract
Fluorene derivatives have been widely developed in OLEDs because of its efficient fluorescence quantum efficiency, but for which unique rigid biphenyl planar structure and large conjugated system, we hypothesize that they have a great potential for room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) applications, and confirmed this conjecture by subjecting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and phosphors to thermal annealing. The cross&#8208;linked structure formed during thermal annealing judiciously modulates the phosphorescence emission characteristics of the fluorenol with the synergistic interaction between PVA and fluorenol. Specifically, the lifetime exhibited a substantial increase from 1352.2&#8197;ms to 2874.1&#8197;ms, accompanied by a quantum yield augmentation from 4.8&#8201;% to 11.3&#8201;%, which substantiate that cross&#8208;linked induced by thermal annealing effectively amplifies the phosphorescent intensity and stability of the phosphors, facilitating ultralong phosphorescent emission at ambient conditions. Furthermore, an effective probe based on this film is developed for its highly sensitive, quantitative and immediate detection of volatile organic compounds. This investigation not only proffers a novel paradigm for the development of advanced RTP materials but also imparts insightful considerations for optimizing the performance of polymers in conjunction with functional materials, encompassing bioimaging, sensing, and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Constructing Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Controlled Desilication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As compared with the conventional alkaline treatment, iPDAs&#8208;assisted desilication allows to break the porosity and acidity trade&#8208;off and build an efficient and orchestrated hierarchical system in zeolites with highly complete framework, opening new avenues to construction of hierarchical zeolites especially with low aluminum stability or high Si/Al ratio.







Abstract
Desilication in alkaline medium has been widely used in construction of hierarchical zeolites for industrially relevant catalytic processes. The built of hierarchy in zeolites, especially with low aluminum stability or high Si/Al ratio, often suffers from uncontrolled destruction of zeolitic framework, accompanied by a significant loss of microporous domains and intrinsic acidity after desilication. Here, we report a novel and simple methodology for preparation of hierarchical zeolites with highly complete framework and minimum sacrifice of microporosity and acidity. The pre&#8208;impregnated amines in zeolite micropores act as inner pore&#8208;directing agents (iPDAs), largely protecting the zeolitic framework and moderating the silicon extraction during the alkaline treatment. The resulting hierarchical zeolites exhibit high crystallinity, tunable hierarchy, stable framework, and well&#8208;preserved acidity, endowing them with significantly improved mass transport properties and enhanced activities in catalytic conversion of methanol or furfural.

GeoSeqBuilder successfully design sequences that fold to the desired protein target structures with atomic consistence.







Abstract
Designing sequences for specific protein backbones is a key step in creating new functional proteins. Here, we introduce GeoSeqBuilder, a deep learning framework that integrates protein sequence generation with side chain conformation prediction to produce the complete all&#8208;atom structures for designed sequences. GeoSeqBuilder uses spatial geometric features from protein backbones and explicitly includes three&#8208;body interactions of neighboring residues. GeoSeqBuilder achieves native residue type recovery rate of 51.6&#8201;%, comparable to ProteinMPNN and other leading methods, while accurately predicting side chain conformations. We first used GeoSeqBuilder to design sequences for thioredoxin and a hallucinated three&#8208;helical bundle protein. All the 15 tested sequences expressed as soluble monomeric proteins with high thermal stability, and the 2 high&#8208;resolution crystal structures solved closely match the designed models. The generated protein sequences exhibit low similarity (minimum 23&#8201;%) to the original sequences, with significantly altered hydrophobic cores. We further redesigned the hydrophobic core of glutathione peroxidase 4, and 3 of the 5 designs showed improved enzyme activity. Although further testing is needed, the high experimental success rate in our testing demonstrates that GeoSeqBuilder is a powerful tool for designing novel sequences for predefined protein structures with atomic details. GeoSeqBuilder is available at https://github.com/PKUliujl/GeoSeqBuilder.

         <title>Understanding the Wettability of C1N1 (Sub)Nanopores: Implications for Porous Carbonaceous Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The common paradigm that water easily enters hydrophilic pores does not apply to C1N1 nanopores of size below a few nanometers. Using solid&#8208;state NMR, we unravel that only a negligible portion of water can enter the nanopores of C1N1 despite their hydrophilic character. In contrast, water enters similar pores of hydrophobic pure carbon material.







Abstract
Understanding how water interacts with nanopores of carbonaceous electrodes is crucial for energy storage and conversion applications. A high surface area of carbonaceous materials does not necessarily need to translate to a high electrolyte&#8208;solid interface area. Herein, we study the interaction of water with nanoporous C1N1 materials to explain their very low specific capacitance in aqueous electrolytes despite their high surface area. Water was used to probe chemical environments, provided by pores of different sizes, in 1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR experiments. We observe that regardless of their high hydrophilicity, only a negligible portion of water can enter the nanopores of C1N1, in contrast to a reference pure carbon material with a similar pore structure. The common paradigm that water easily enters hydrophilic pores does not apply to C1N1 nanopores below a few nanometers. Calorimetric and sorption experiments demonstrated strong water adsorption on the C1N1 surface, which restricts water mobility across the interface and impedes its penetration into the nanopores.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanomaterial with Organelle&#8208;Level Precision Primes Antitumor Immunity via mtDNA&#8208;dependent cGAS&#8208;STING Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
Here we present a strategy of targeting excessive mtDNA damages by the synergistic action of mitochondria&#8208;targeted PDT&#8208;induced oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking, which leads to more release of mtDNA fragments and synergies with Mn2+ in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to significantly repolarized M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype in a STING&#8208;dependent manner. We envision that our metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial offers an attractive tool for initiating robust antitumor immunity at the organelle level.







Abstract
New generation of nanomaterials with organelle&#8208;level precision provide significant promise for targeted attacks on mitochondria, exhibiting remarkable therapeutic potency. Here, we report a novel amphiphilic phenolic polymer (PF) for the mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can trigger excessive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage by the synergistic action of oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking. Moreover, the phenolic units on PF enable further self&#8208;assembly with Mn2+ via metal&#8208;phenolic coordination to form metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial (PFM). We focus on the synergistic activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by Mn2+ and tumor&#8208;derived mtDNA in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), and subsequently repolarizing M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype. We highlight that PFM facilitates the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;dependent immunity at the organelle level for potent antitumor efficacy.

         <title>Fabrication of Scalable Covalent Organic Framework Membrane&#8208;based Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large free&#8208;standing PEG&#8208;COF membrane (COM) has been fabricated to serve as a polymer electrolyte for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. By adjusting the lengths of PEG chains within the framework, a satisfactory ion conductivity of 0.153&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C was achieved. Benefiting from the collaborative effect of guest&#8208;promoted transport, the Li|Li, Li|LFP, and pouch cell assemblies with PEG&#8208;COM polymer electrolytes demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The conventional covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based electrolytes with tailored ionic conducting behaviors are typically fabricated in the powder morphology, requiring further compaction procedures to operate as solid electrolyte tablets, which hinders the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of COF materials. In this study, we present a feasible electrospinning strategy to prepare scalable, self&#8208;supporting COF membranes (COMs) that feature a rigid COF skeleton bonded with flexible, lithiophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, forming an ion conduction network for Li+ transport. The resulting PEG&#8208;COM electrolytes exhibit enhanced dendrite inhibition and high ionic conductivity of 0.153&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The improved Li+ conduction in PEG&#8208;COM electrolytes stems from the loose ion pairing in the structure and the production of higher free Li+ content, as confirmed by solid&#8208;state 7Li NMR experiments. These changes in the local microenvironment of Li+ facilitate its directional movement within the COM pores. Consequently, solid&#8208;state symmetrical Li|Li, Li|LFP, and pouch cells demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy offers a universal approach for constructing scalable COM&#8208;based electrolytes, thereby broadening the practical applications of COFs in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Interfacial Thermoconvection and Atomic Relay Catalysis Enable Equilibrium Shifting and Rapid Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;Fructose Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ fructose removal strategy enabled by interfacial local thermoconvection is developed to significantly bypass the chemical equilibrium limit for glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization. The synergy of isolated and geminal K single atoms and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect can accelerate photothermal glucose isomerization, affording a high fructose yield of 68.2&#8201;% with carbon balance of 95.9&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min at room temperature.







Abstract
The aqueous glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization is controlled by thermodynamics to an equilibrium limit of ~50&#8201;% fructose yield. However, here we report an in situ fructose removal strategy enabled by an interfacial local photothermal effect in combination with relay catalysis of geminal and isolated potassium single atoms (K SAs) on graphene&#8208;type carbon (Ksg/GT) to effectively bypass the equilibrium limit and markedly speed up glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, an unprecedented fructose yield of 68.2&#8201;% was obtained over Ksg/GT in an aqueous solution without any additives under 30&#8208;min solar&#8208;like irradiation. Mechanistic studies expounded that the interfacial thermoconvection caused by the local photothermal effect of the graphene&#8208;type carbon and preferable glucose adsorption on single&#8208;atom K could facilitate the release of in situ formed fructose. The geminal K SAs were prone to form a stable metal&#8208;glucose complex via bidentate coordination, and could significantly reduce the C&#8722;H bond electron density by light&#8208;driven electron transfer toward K. This facilitated the hydride shift rate&#8208;determining step and expedited glucose isomerization. In addition, isolated K SAs favored the subsequent protonation and ring&#8208;closure process to furnish fructose. The integration of the interfacial thermoconvection&#8208;enhanced in situ removal protocol and tailored atomic catalysis opens a prospective avenue for boosting equilibrium&#8208;limited reactions under mild conditions.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Multienzyme Cascades for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Tetrahydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports the synthesis of chiral tetrahydroquinolines (THQs) through one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascades that use up to four enzymes. This highly efficient method demonstrates the preparation of a wide range of enantiocomplementary 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl substituted THQs in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) framework is commonly found in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Apart from using transition metal catalysts and chiral phosphoric acids, the chiral 2&#8208;substituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs are synthesized using amine oxidase biocatalysts. However, the use of imine reductases (IREDs) in their asymmetric synthesis remained unexplored. In the current work, IREDs are employed in telescopic multienzyme cascades to catalyze the intramolecular reductive amination leading to chiral 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines starting from inexpensive nitroalkenones. The cascades containing NtDBR (an ene reductase), NfsB (a nitro reductase) with either Na2S2O4 or V2O5, various IREDs, and glucose dehydrogenase (for NADPH regeneration) are used to synthesize a broad range of (R)/(S)&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted (THQs) (26 examples) with high yield (up to 93&#8201;%) and excellent ee (up to 99&#8201;%) in one&#8208;pot. The method further facilitates the one&#8208;pot biocatalytic synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;aryl substituted THQs (26 examples) from amino chalcones. Lastly, the asymmetric synthesis of several (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;THQ based intermediates of Hancock alkaloids showed the practical application of the newly developed biocatalytic cascades.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phosphonate&#8208;Organic Network as Ion Enrichment Layer for Sustainable Zinc Metal Electrode with High Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion enriching features of the spontaneously constructed metal&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;organic network (MPON) on Zn metal facilitates rapid and uniform transport of Zn&#8208;ions as well as inhibit parasitic reactions of Zn electrode, which greatly improves the reversibility of Zn anode and Zn&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions.







Abstract
Zinc (Zn) metal batteries could be the technology of choice for sustainable battery chemistries owing to its better safety and cost advantage. However, their cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE) are strongly limited by the dendritic growth and side reactions of Zn anodes. Herein, we proposed an in situ construction of a metal&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;organic network (MPON) with three&#8208;dimensional interconnected networks on Zn metal, which can act as an ion enrichment layer for Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;metal batteries. This MPON with abundant porous structure and phosphate sites possesses ion enriching properties and high Zn2+ transference number (0.83), which is beneficial for enhancing Zn2+ migration and self&#8208;concentrating kinetics. Meanwhile, MPON offers hydrophobicity to effectively inhibit the water&#8208;induced Zn anode corrosion. As a result, the Zn electrode exhibits superior Zn/Zn2+ reversibility of over 4&#8197;months at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high CE of 99.6&#8201;%. Moreover, the Zn/NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O and Zn/MnO2 full cells using ultrathin Zn anodes (10&#8197;&#956;m) exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 81&#8201;% and 78&#8201;% after 1400 and 1000&#8197;cycles, respectively. This work provides a unique promise to design high&#8208;performance anode for practical Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>A Regenerable Bi&#8208;Based Catalyst for Efficient and Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs, enriched with Bi/Cu&#8722;O bonds, is electrochemically transformed from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs and exhibits exceptional performance in converting CO2 to formate at industrial current densities. In stability test, the effective repetitive electrochemical treatments extend the selectivity for formate to 90&#8201;% for up to 400&#8197;h.







Abstract
Renewable electricity shows immense potential as a driving force for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in production of formate (HCOO&#8722;) at industrial current density, providing a promising path for value&#8208;added chemicals and chemical manufacturing. However, achieving high selectivity and stable production of HCOO&#8722; at industrial current density remains a challenge. Here, we present a robust Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs catalyst capable of regenerating necessary catalytic core (Bi&#8722;O) through cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment. Notably, at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faradaic efficiency of HCOO&#8722; reaches an exceptional selectivity to 99.23&#8201;%, maintaining above 90&#8201;% even after 400&#8197;h, which is longest reaction time reported at the industrial current density. Furthermore, in stability test, the catalyst was constructed by CV reconstruction to achieve stable and efficient production of HCOO&#8722;. In 20&#8197;h reaction test, the catalyst has a rate of HCOO&#8722; production of 13.24&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1, a HCOO&#8722; concentration of 1.91&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1, and an energy consumption of 129.80&#8197;kWh&#8201;kmol&#8722;1. In&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of Bi&#8722;O structure during the gradual transformation of catalyst from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs to Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs. Theoretical studies highlight the pivotal role of Bi&#8722;O structure in modifying the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, which further reduces energy barrier for *OCHO conversion in CO2RR.

         <title>Self&#8208;Initiated Nano&#8208;Micelles Mediated Covalent Modification of mRNA for Labeling and Treatment of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving in situ spontaneous and precise mRNA covalent modification can effectively interfere with the translation of mRNA in tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. The linked Luminol and Ce6 generated 1O2 in situ by CRET and furan&#8208;mediated covalent modification of mRNAs was triggered for RNA interference in situ. This strategy offers novel insights into in situ RNA interference.







Abstract
As a promising gene therapy strategy, controllable small molecule&#8208;mRNA covalent modification in tumor cells could be initiated by singlet oxygen (1O2) to complete the modification process. However, in vivo generation of 1O2 is usually dependent on excitation of external light, and the limited light penetration of tissues greatly interferes the development of deep tumor photo therapy. Here, we constructed a tumor&#8208;targeting nano&#8208;micelle for the spontaneous intracellular generation of 1O2 without the need for external light, and inducing a high level of covalent modification of mRNA in tumor cells. Luminol and Ce6 were chemically bonded to produce 1O2 by chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) triggered by high levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The sufficient 1O2 oxidized the loaded furan to highly reactive dicarbonyl moiety, which underwent cycloaddition reaction with adenine (A), cytosine (C) or guanine (G) on the mRNA for interfering with the tumor cell protein expression, thereby inhibiting tumor progression. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this self&#8208;initiated gene therapy nano&#8208;micelle could induce covalent modification of mRNA by 1O2 without external light, and the process could be monitored in real time by fluorescence imaging, which provided an effective strategy for RNA&#8208;based tumor gene therapy.

         <title>A Graded Redox Interfacial Modifier for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin oxide is a widely employed charge&#8208;transport material for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. In this work, a graded redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, is found to improve the properties of tin oxide. It reduces the interfacial defect density and improving the crystallinity of the perovskite. The resultant perovskite solar cells show excellent stability under elevated temperatures.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a potential competitor to the silicon photovoltaic technology. The most representative perovskite cells employ SnO2 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as the charge&#8208;transport materials. Despite their high efficiencies, perovskite cells with such a configuration show unsatisfactory lifespan, normally attributed to the instability of perovskites and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Limited attention was paid to the influence of SnO2, an inorganic material, on device stability. Here we show that improving SnO2 with a redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, simultaneously enhances the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the perovskite solar cells. Redox reactions between the bivalent cobalt complexes and oxygen lead to the formation of a graded distribution of trivalent and bivalent cobalt complexes across the surface and bulk regions of the SnO2. The trivalent cobalt complex at the top surface of SnO2 raises the concentration of (SO3NH2)&#8722; which passivates uncoordinated Pb2+ and relieves tensile stress, facilitating the formation of perovskite with improved crystallinity. Our approach enables perovskite cells with PCEs of up to 24.91&#8201;%. The devices retained 93.8&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#8197;hours of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking. These findings showcase the potential of cobalt complexes as redox interfacial modifiers for high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.

Our approach enables perovskite cells with PCEs of up to 24.91&#8201;%. The devices retained 93.8&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#8197;hours of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking. These findings showcase the potential of cobalt complexes as redox interfacial modifiers for high-performance perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Customized Strategy Realizes Stable Cycle of Large&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Voltage Layered Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A concept of customized strategy via multiple rock&#8208;forming elements trace doping is presented to solve the stability&#8211;capacity trade&#8208;off dilemma of layered oxide for high&#8208;voltage sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The designed Na0.67Ni0.28Mg0.04Al0.02Mn0.64Ti0.02O2 cathode exhibits high energy density approaching 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, with good capacity retention of 81.2&#8201;% after 200 cycles. The full cell delivers a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy density of 303.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage P2&#8208;Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 layered oxide cathode exhibits significant potential for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to the elevated operating voltage and theoretical energy density beyond lithium iron phosphate, but the large&#8208;volume phase transition is the devil. Currently, this type cathode still suffers from stability&#8211;capacity trade&#8208;off dilemma. Herein, a concept of customized strategy via multiple rock&#8208;forming elements trace doping is presented to address the mentioned issue. The customized Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;Ti trace doped cathode maintains a notable capacity of 140.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with an energy density approaching 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and shows good cycle stability, retaining 89.0&#8201;% of its capacity after 50 cycles at 0.1&#8197;C. Additionally, the full cell, paired with a hard carbon anode, achieves an advanced energy density of 303.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The multiple characterizations reveal the failure mechanism of contrast sample involving severe intragranular cracks coupled with layer to rock salt transformation, which reduces active substance and increases charge transfer resistance. The doped sample with increased sliding energy barrier well suppresses this phenomenon. Impressively, the customized strategy can be extended to Mg&#8208;Fe&#8208;Ti system. This research provides a novel concept for the design of high energy sodium&#8208;ion cathode.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Chiral Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films with Full&#8208;Color Tunable Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing self&#8208;standing chiral covalent organic framework (CCOF) thin films with controllable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of great significance but remains challenging. Here, we present the fabrication of self&#8208;standing CCOF thin films via a polymerization&#8208;dispersion&#8208;filtration strategy. With preferentially oriented chiral pores, these films show excellent full&#8208;color&#8208;tunable guest&#8208;induced CPL performances.







Abstract
Exploring self&#8208;standing chiral covalent organic framework (COF) thin films with controllable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of paramount significance but remains a challenging task. Herein, we demonstrate the first example of self&#8208;standing chiral COF films employing a polymerization&#8208;dispersion&#8208;filtration strategy. Pristine, low&#8208;quality chiral COF films were produced by interfacial polymerization and then re&#8208;dispersed into COF colloidal solutions. Via vacuum assisted assembly, these COF colloids were densely stacked and assembled into self&#8208;standing, pure chiral COF films (L&#8208;/D&#8208;CCOF&#8208;F) that were transparent, smooth, crack&#8208;free and highly crystalline. These films were tunable in thicknesses, areas, and roughness, along with strong diffuse reflectance circular dichroism (DRCD) and cyan CPL signals, showing an intrinsic luminescence asymmetric factor (glum) of ~4.3&#215;10&#8722;3. Furthermore, these COF films served as host adsorbents to load various achiral organic dye guests through adsorption. The effective chiral transfer and energy transfer between CCOF&#8208;F and achiral fluorescent dyes endowed the dyes with strong chirality and tunable DRCD, resulting in intense, full&#8208;color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state CPL. Notably, the ordered arrangement of dye guest molecules within the preferentially oriented chiral pores of CCOF&#8208;F contributed to an amplified |glum| factor of up to 7.2&#215;10&#8722;2, which is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for COF&#8208;based CPL materials. This work provides new insights into the design and fabrication of self&#8208;standing chiral COF films, demonstrating their great potential for chiroptical applications.

         <title>Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Aminoboration of Alkynes and the Critical Role of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By probing the importance of electronics in alkynes for activating the B&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond of aminoboranes and aminoboronic esters, we here demonstrate the first intermolecular 1,2&#8208;aminoboration of alkynes, affording syn&#8208;addition alkene products with the incorporation of two key functionalities, namely, amino and boryl.







Abstract
The intramolecular 1,2&#8208;aminoboration of alkynes by aminoboranes is rare and invariably requires a catalyst to proceed, while the intermolecular aminoboration of alkynes is yet entirely unknown. Through an exploration of the significance of electronics in alkynes for activating the B&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond of aminoboranes, we demonstrate in this work the first intermolecular 1,2&#8208;aminoboration of alkynes. These reactions employ a series of (amino)dihaloboranes and aminoboronic esters, mild reaction conditions, and no catalysts, yielding syn&#8208;addition alkene products with the incorporation of two crucial functionalities: amino and boryl. While highly electron&#8208;rich examples can afford the aminoborated products (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;borylethenamines, other alkynes, including unactivated and less electron&#8208;rich examples, do not lead to the corresponding aminoborated products due to the fundamental impediment that the reactions are significantly endergonic.

A versatile method for laser&#8208;induced precise 2D&#8208;functionalization of graphene using multifunctional trivalent iodine compounds is developed, allowing for complex and customized molecular engineering of the graphene surface. The tailor&#8208;made and reversible attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties enables programming the surface properties of graphene, paving the way for advanced nanoelectronics.







Abstract
The emerging laser writing represents an efficient and promising strategy for covalent two dimensional (2D)&#8208;patterning of graphene yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of applicable reagents. Here, we report a versatile approach for covalent laser patterning of graphene using a family of trivalent organic iodine compounds as effective reagents, allowing for the engraving of a library of functionalities onto the graphene surface. The relatively weak iodine&#8208;centered bonds within these compounds can readily undergo laser&#8208;induced cleavage to in situ generate radicals localized to the irradiated regions for graphene binding, thus completing the covalent 2D&#8208;structuring of this 2D&#8208;film. The tailor&#8208;made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.

The tailor-made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualizing Active Sites in Electrospun Photoactive Membranes via Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making invisible&#8208;visible: In this study, we used electrospinning to create photoactive membranes from hydrophobic PCL and hydrophilic PAN, embedded with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic photosensitizer. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging we identified photoexcited &#8220;active sites&#8221; within the membranes, thereby establishing a causal link between material activity and the photosensitizer&#8216;s microenvironment.







Abstract
Interest in antibacterial nanomaterials has surged in recent years, driven by the rise in antibiotic resistance among microbes. However, their practical application remains limited because many crucial properties have yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we have developed novel nanofibrous membranes based on hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile (PAN) or hydrophobic polycaprolactone (PCL) with embedded hydrophilic or hydrophobic zinc(II)phthalocyanines (ZnPcs) as photosensitizers and investigated their water disinfection properties. Several key characteristics were evaluated to link the activity of the material and composition/structure. As demonstrated by reflectance UV/Vis spectroscopy, the aggregation states of dyes within the polymer support vary significantly. We have proposed and validated the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) for visualizing &#8220;active sites&#8221; in the membranes. The results of this study provide useful insights for the engineering of photoactive nanomaterials with tailor&#8208;made properties and highlight the crucial role of the nature of polymeric support in modulating the material&#8216;s activity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioconvergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling of aryl electrophiles with racemic secondary organozinc reagents has been developed. This transformation enables access to enantioenriched 1,1&#8208;diaryl motifs in good yields and high enantioselectivities. A detailed computational study has been conducted to fully understand the reaction mechanism and the mechanism of C&#8722;Zn bond inversion.







Abstract
An enantioconvergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling with racemic secondary organozinc reagents has been developed, enabling access to enantioenriched 1,1&#8208;diarylalkane motifs in high yields and enantioselectivities. Computational data indicates that the racemization of organozinc compounds most likely occurs through a bridged bimolecular mechanism.

         <title>Wavy Graphene Nanoribbons Containing Periodic Eight&#8208;Membered Rings for Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavy graphene nanoribbon (wGNR) that incorporates periodic eight&#8208;membered rings into its backbone has been synthesized through bottom&#8208;up solution synthesis. This distinctive non&#8208;planar geometry gives wGNR excellent dispersibility in solution and unlocks its emissive features, making it an emissive layer for organic light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells.







Abstract
Precision graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) offer distinctive physicochemical properties that are highly dependent on their geometric topologies, thereby holding great potential for applications in carbon&#8208;based optoelectronics and spintronics. While the edge structure and width control has been a popular strategy for engineering the optoelectronic properties of GNRs, non&#8208;hexagonal&#8208;ring&#8208;containing GNRs remain underexplored due to synthetic challenges, despite offering an equally high potential for tailored properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of a wavy GNR (wGNR) by embedding periodic eight&#8208;membered rings into its carbon skeleton, which is achieved by the A2B2&#8208;type Diels&#8211;Alder polymerization between dibenzocyclooctadiyne (6) and dicyclopenta[e,l]pyrene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione derivative (8), followed by a selective Scholl reaction of the obtained ladder&#8208;type polymer (LTP) precursor. The obtained wGNR, with a length of up to 30&#8197;nm, has been thoroughly characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis spectroscopy with the support of DFT calculations. The non&#8208;planar geometry of wGNR efficiently prevents the inter&#8208;ribbon &#960;&#8211;&#960; aggregation, leading to photoluminescence in solution. Consequently, the wGNR can function as an emissive layer for organic light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (OLECs), offering a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept exploration in implementing luminescent GNRs into optoelectronic devices. The fast&#8208;responding OLECs employing wGNR will pave the way for advancements in OLEC technology and other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Cryptophycin Derivatives with Modification in Unit D for Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytotoxic cryptophycins with versatile conjugation handles in unit D are accessible by a highly efficient and scalable synthetic route. This ABC+D strategy enabled the creation of a vast array of cryptophycins leading to a quantitative structure activity relationship, allowing for the synthesis of most potent conjugable cryptophycin derivatives being superb candidates for the employment in drug conjugates.







Abstract
Cytotoxic payloads for drug conjugates suitable for directed tumor therapy need to be highly potent and require a functional group for conjugation with the homing device (antibody, peptide, or small molecule). Cryptophycins are cyclodepsipeptides that stand out from the realm of natural products due to their extraordinarily high cytotoxicity. However, the installation of a suitable conjugation handle without compromising the toxicity is highly challenging. The unit D, natively 2&#8208;hydroxyisocaproic acid (leucic acid), was envisaged as a promising attachment site based on structural information from X&#8208;ray analysis. A versatile, scalable and efficient synthetic route towards conjugable cryptophycins with modification in unit D was developed and an array of new cryptophycin analogues was synthesized. Several derivatives, especially those containing lipophilic groups with low steric demand such as alkylated amino groups, exhibit low picomolar cytotoxicity often combined with efficacy against multidrug&#8208;resistant tumor cells. The newly established cryptophycin analogues comprise a broad range of relevant functional groups used as conjugation handles, among them amino, hydroxy, carboxy, as well as sulfur&#8208;containing derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a tubulin&#8208;bound cryptophycin together with quantitative structure activity relationship manifested rationales for the synthesis of most potent cryptophycin derivatives and further confirmed the suitability of modifications in unit D.

         <title>Photocatalytic PPh3&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of C3&#8208;Functionalized Indoles via Radical Annulation of Nitroarenes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economic and highly efficient synthesis of indole derivatives was developed through a photocatalytic radical annulation process of nitroarenes and alkenes. A series of valuable C3&#8208;functionalized indoles were prepared with cheap and commercially available nitroarenes as nitrogen sources via a PPh3&#8208;mediated radical deoxygenation process at room temperature.

Oxidatively generated phosphine radical cations are reactive intermediates that can be used for the generation of carbon and heteroatom centered radicals via deoxygenation processes. Such P&#8208;radical cations can readily be generated via single electron transfer oxidation using a redox catalyst. Cheap and commercially available nitroarenes are ideal nitrogen sources for the construction of organic amines and N&#8208;containing heterocycles. Activation of nitroarenes with phosphines has been achieved in the ionic mode, which requires specially designed P&#8208;nucleophiles and high temperatures. Herein, we report an alternative mode of nitro activation that proceeds via a radical process. The radical strategy leads to open shell intermediates that show interesting unexplored reactivity. This is documented by the development of an economic and highly efficient synthesis of valuable indole derivatives through photocatalytic PPh3&#8208;mediated annulation of nitroarenes with alkenes showing large functional group tolerance. The method allows room&#8208;temperature activation of nitroarenes and a double C&#8722;H bond functionalization of alkenes is achieved to provide rapid access to C3&#8208;functionalized indoles, which are key structural components of diverse natural and drug molecules. Experimental mechanistic studies that are further supported by DFT calculations indicate that a nitrosoarene radical cation plays a key role in the annulation process.

         <title>Micro/Meso&#8208;Porous Double&#8208;Shell Hollow Carbon Spheres through Spatially Confined Pyrolysis for Supercapacitors and Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique confined pyrolysis method has been used for the creation of a hollow structure with a dual shell structure consisting of both microporous and mesoporous features. Basing on the elasticity of this structure, the relationship between the micro/mesoporous depth of the prepared carbon spheres and the energy storage performance in supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor is established.







Abstract
Energy storage in supercapacitors and hybrid zinc ion capacitors (ZIC) using porous carbon materials offers a promising alternative method for clean energy solutions. The unique combination of hierarchical porous structure and nitrogen doping in these materials has demonstrated significant capacity for energy storage. Nevertheless, the full potential of these materials, particularly the relationship between pore structure configuration and performance, remains underexplored. Herein, a confined pyrolysis strategy based on the polymerization characteristics of polydopamine (PDA) was developed to construction of hollow carbon spheres with microporous/mesoporous dual shell structure. The depth of micropores and cavity can be controlled by adjusting the duration of heat treatment and hydrothermal treatment, in accordance with the decomposition and polymerization characteristics of PDA. Due to the elasticity of this structure, the relationship between the micro/mesoporous depth of the prepared carbon spheres and the energy storage performance in supercapacitors and ZIC is established. Through optimizing the ion transport capacity of carbon spheres and considering the influence of its internal cavity structure on energy storage, the resulting carbon spheres exhibit high specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in supercapacitor and specific capacitance of 260&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent stability with 99.3&#8201;% retention after 30000&#8197;chare/discharge cycles in ZIC.

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring in PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 Organic&#8211;inorganic Hybrid Metal Halide via Rigid Benzene Ring Induced Local Lattice Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>

Schematic illustration of combining organic compunds PMA+ (C7H10N+) with the inorganic [NaCl6]&#8208;[InCl6] layer to form a novel and highly efficient luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide PMA4NaInCl8 (PNIC) with Sb3+ doping. The dual emission of PNIC:Sb3+ can be adjusted from cyan to yellow by multimode regulation of temperature and excitation energy.







Abstract
Low dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halide materials have attracted extensive attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. However, low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by parity&#8208;forbidden transition hinder their further application in optoelectronic devices. Herein, a novel yellow&#8208;emitting PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 (C7H10N+, PMA+) low&#8208;dimensional OIMHs single crystal with a PLQY as high as 88&#8201;% was successfully designed and synthesized, originating from the fact that the doping of Sb3+ effectively relaxes the parity&#8208;forbidden transition by strong spin&#8208;orbit (SO) coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) interaction. The as&#8208;prepared crystal shows an efficient dual emission peaking 495 and 560&#8197;nm at low temperature, which are ascribed to different levels of 3P1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Sb3+ in [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedral caused by JT deformation. Moreover, wide&#8208;range luminescence tailoring from cyan to orange can be achieved through adjusting excitation energy and temperature because of flexible [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedral in the PNIC lattice. Based on a relative stiff lattice environment, the 560&#8197;nm yellow emission under 350&#8197;nm light excitation exhibits abnormal anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 8 to 400&#8197;K owing to the suppression of non&#8208;radiative transition. The multimode luminescence regulation enriches PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 great potential in the field of optoelectronics such as temperature sensing, low temperature anti&#8208;counterfeiting and WLED applications.

         <title>Dimerized M&#8208;Series Acceptors with Low Diffusion Coefficients for Efficient and Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ADA&#8208;type small molecule acceptor is used to construct a dimerized acceptor (DMT&#8208;HF) which is featured with a high glass transition temperature and a low diffusion coefficient. When blended with a wide band gap copolymer, the resulting DMT&#8208;HF&#8208;based polymer solar cell exhibits an excellent efficiency of 17.17&#8201;% and outstanding thermal stability.







Abstract
As the simplest oligomeric acceptors, dimerized acceptors (DAs) are easier to synthesize, and more importantly, they can retain good intermolecular interaction and photovoltaic properties of their parent small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs). Nevertheless, currently most efficient DAs are derived from banana&#8208;shaped acceptors and they might suffer from inferior device stability with high diffusion coefficients. Herein, we design and synthesize two planar DAs (DMT&#8208;FH and DMT&#8208;HF) by bridging two linear&#8208;shaped M&#8208;series SMAs with a thiophene unit. The effects of fluorination position on the diffusion coefficients, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and stability of the DAs are systematically studied. Our results suggest that DMT&#8208;HF with fluorination on the ending indanone groups shows enhanced intermolecular interactions, improved PCE and stability compared with the counterpart (DMT&#8208;FH) with fluorination on the central indanone groups. Further optimization on the DMT&#8208;HF&#8208;based devices yields an outstanding PCE of 17.17&#8201;%, which is the highest among all linear&#8208;shaped SMA&#8208;based DAs. Notably, with the low diffusion coefficient (3.36&#215;10&#8722;24&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) of DMT&#8208;HF, the resulting device retains over 93&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 5000&#8197;h of continuous heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C, suggesting its excellent thermal stability. The results highlight the importance of intermolecular interaction and fluorination for achieving efficient and stable polymer solar cells.

A bioinspired semisynthesis of human&#8208;interleukin&#8208;6 bearing N&#8208;glycan at Asn143 (143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6) was performed by intentional glycosylation effects and protein folding chemistry for regioselective peptide&#8208;backbone activation. 143Glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 is a genetically coded cytokine, but isolation was difficult owing to a tiny amount. IL6&#8208;polypeptide (1&#8211;141&#8208;position) with an intentionally inserted cysteine at 142&#8208;position was expressed in E. coli. The expressed polypeptide was treated with a chemical folding process to make a specific helices bundle conformation through native two&#8208;disulfide bonds (43&#8211;49 and 72&#8211;82). Utilizing the successfully formed free&#8208;142&#8208;cysteine, sequential conversions using cyanylation of 142&#8208;cysteine, hydrazinolysis, and thioesterification created a long polypeptide (1&#8211;141)&#8208;thioester. However, the resultant polypeptide&#8208;thioester caused considerable aggregation owing to a highly hydrophobic peptide sequence. After the reduction of two&#8208;disulfide bonds of polypeptide (1&#8211;141)&#8208;thioester, an unprecedented hydrophilic N&#8208;glycan tag was inserted at the resultant cysteine thiols. The N&#8208;glycan tags greatly stabilized polypeptide&#8208;thioester. The subsequent native chemical ligation and desulfurization successfully gave a whole 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 polypeptide (183&#8208;amino acids). Removal of four N&#8208;glycan tags and immediate one&#8208;pot in vitro folding protocol efficiently produced the folded 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6. The folded 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 exhibited potent cell proliferation activity. The combined studies with molecular dynamics simulation, semisynthesis, and bioassays predict the bioactive conformation of latent 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6.

&lt;p&gt;A bioinspired semisynthesis of human-interleukin-6 bearing N-glycan at Asn143 (143glycosyl-IL-6) was performed by intentional glycosylation effects and protein folding chemistry for regioselective peptide-backbone activation. 143Glycosyl-IL-6 is a genetically coded cytokine, but isolation was difficult owing to a tiny amount. IL6-polypeptide (1&#8211;141-position) with an intentionally inserted cysteine at 142-position was expressed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. The expressed polypeptide was treated with a chemical folding process to make a specific helices bundle conformation through native two-disulfide bonds (43&#8211;49 and 72&#8211;82). Utilizing the successfully formed free-142-cysteine, sequential conversions using cyanylation of 142-cysteine, hydrazinolysis, and thioesterification created a long polypeptide (1&#8211;141)-thioester. However, the resultant polypeptide-thioester caused considerable aggregation owing to a highly hydrophobic peptide sequence. After the reduction of two-disulfide bonds of polypeptide (1&#8211;141)-thioester, an unprecedented hydrophilic N-glycan tag was inserted at the resultant cysteine thiols.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Mediated Structural Interchange Between Pd6 and Pd12 Architectures: Selective Recognition of E&#8208;Stilbene by the Pd6 Architecture and its Photoprotection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble trifacial barrel (C1) was synthesized which undergoes transformation into a triangular orthobicupola architecture (C2) upon application of various stimuli. In aqueous media, C1 selectively encapsulates the E&#8208;isomer of stilbene (tS) and prevented its photobleaching to the Z&#8208;isomer (cS) under UV light. Conversely, C1 facilitated the reverse isomerization of cS to tS under visible light by stabilizing tS within its hydrophobic cavity.







Abstract
The dynamic behaviour of metal&#8208;ligand bonding cultivates stimuli&#8208;mediated structural transformations in self&#8208;assembled molecular architectures. The propensity of synthetically designed self&#8208;assembled systems to interchange between higher&#8208;order architectures is increased multi&#8208;fold when the building blocks have higher conformational degrees of freedom. Herein, we report a new ligand, (2,7&#8208;bis(di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one) (L), which, upon self&#8208;assembly with a cis&#8208;[(ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine)Pd(NO3)2] acceptor (M), resulted in the formation of a M6L3 trifacial barrel (C1) in water. Interestingly, during crystallization, a rare M12L6 triangular orthobicupola architecture (C2) was generated along with C1. C2 could also be generated in solution via the application of several stimuli. C1 in aqueous media could stabilize one trans&#8208;stilbene (tS) or cis&#8208;stilbene (cS) molecule in its cavity, with a selectivity for the former from their mixture. Moreover, C1 acted as an effective host to prevent the otherwise facile photoisomerization of tS to cS inside its hydrophobic cavity under UV irradiation. Conversely, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reverse isomerization of encapsulated cS to encapsulated tS could be achieved readily due to the better stabilization of tS within the cavity of C1 and its transparency to visible light. A multi&#8208;functional system was therefore designed, which at the same time is stimuli&#8208;responsive, shows isomer selectivity, and photo&#8208;protects trans&#8208;stilbene.

         <title>Copper Atom Pairs Stabilize *OCCO Dipole Toward Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>

The copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (Cu2) catalyst featuring dual&#8208;Cu atomic pairs, which delivers a high FE of 51&#8201;% toward C2H4 and a current density of 450&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution, markedly surpassing the performance of Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts and Cu nanoparticles. The results reveal that the unique Cu atom pairs in Cu2 regulate the adsorption energy of *CO to facilitate C&#8722;C dimerization and stabilize the *OCCO intermediate dipole to promote the C2H4 pathway.







Abstract
Deeply electrolytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high&#8208;value ethylene (C2H4) is very attractive. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling seriously results in the low selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to C2H4. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;based polyhedron (Cu2) that features uniformly distributed and atomically precise bi&#8208;Cu units, which can stabilize *OCCO dipole to facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling for high selective C2H4 production. The C2H4 faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 51&#8201;% with a current density of 469.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, much superior to the Cu single site catalyst (Cu SAC) (~0&#8201;%). Moreover, the Cu2 catalyst has a higher turnover frequency (TOF, ~520&#8197;h&#8722;1) compared to Cu nanoparticles (~9.42&#8197;h&#8722;1) and Cu SAC (~0.87&#8197;h&#8722;1). In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique Cu2 structural configuration could optimize the dipole moments and stabilize the *OCCO adsorbate to promote the generation of C2H4.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Disordered RuO2 Catalyst for Highly Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realizing an efficient and stable non&#8208;Iridium (Ir)&#8208;based acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for low&#8208;cost practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), yet a tremendous challenge due to the robust oxidation conditions and active species leaching. Long&#8208;range disordered Boron doped RuO2 catalysts demonstrate highly active and durable acidic OER (1200&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and achieve highly efficient (1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.63&#8197;V) and stable (300&#8197;h at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) operating in practical PEMWEs device.







Abstract
Non&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a strategy to modulate the stability of RuO2 by doping boron (B) atoms, leading to the preparation of a RuO2 catalyst with long&#8208;range disorder (LD&#8208;B/RuO2). The structure of long&#8208;range disorder endowed LD&#8208;B/RuO2 with a low overpotential of 175&#8197;mV and an ultra&#8208;long stability, which can maintain OER for about 1.6&#8197;months at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 with almost invariable performance. More importantly, a PEM electrolyzer using LD&#8208;B/RuO2 as the anode demonstrated excellent performance, reaching 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.63&#8197;V with durability exceeding 300&#8197;h at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density. The introduction of B atoms induced the formation of a long&#8208;range disordered structure and symmetry&#8208;breaking B&#8722;Ru&#8722;O motifs, which enabled the catalyst structure to a certain toughness while simultaneously inducing the redistribution of electrons on the active center Ru, which jointly promoted and guaranteed the activity and long&#8208;term stability of LD&#8208;B/RuO2. This study provides a strategy to prepare long&#8208;range disordered RuO2 acidic OER catalysts with high stability using B&#8208;doping to perturb crystallinity, which opens potential possibilities for non&#8208;iridium&#8208;based PEMWE applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-iridium acid-stabilized electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a strategy to modulate the stability of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by doping boron (B) atoms, leading to the preparation of a RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with long-range disorder (LD-B/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The structure of long-range disorder endowed LD-B/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a low overpotential of 175&#8197;mV and an ultra-long stability, which can maintain OER for about 1.6&#8197;months at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density in 0.5&#8197;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with almost invariable performance. More importantly, a PEM electrolyzer using LD-B/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the anode demonstrated excellent performance, reaching 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.63&#8197;V with durability exceeding 300&#8197;h at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density. The introduction of B atoms induced the formation of a long-range disordered structure and symmetry-breaking B&#8722;Ru&#8722;O motifs, which enabled the catalyst structure to a certain toughness while simultaneously inducing the redistribution of electrons on the active center Ru, which jointly promoted and guaranteed the activity and long-term stability of LD-B/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study provides a strategy to prepare long-range disordered RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acidic OER catalysts with high stability using B-doping to perturb crystallinity, which opens potential possibilities for non-iridium-based PEMWE applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ostwald&#8208;Ripening Induced Interfacial Protection Layer Boosts 1,000,000&#8208;Cycled Hydronium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at addressing the issue of unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface caused by the lack of cathode electrolyte interphase in the cathode material of aqueous batteries, by reversing the notorious side reaction&#8212;dissolution of electrode materials, we applied Ostwald ripening in the electrochemical cycling of a copper hexacyanoferrate electrode in hydronium&#8208;ion batteries, thus creating a stable interface layer of cross&#8208;linked cubes on the electrode surface, and leading to an excellent cycle life of one million cycles.







Abstract
Collapsing and degradation of active materials caused by the electrode/electrolyte interface instability in aqueous batteries are one of the main obstacles that mitigate the capacity. Herein by reversing the notorious side reactions include the loss and dissolution of electrode materials, as we applied Ostwald ripening (OR) in the electrochemical cycling of a copper hexacyanoferrate electrode in a hydronium&#8208;ion batteries, the dissolved Cu and Fe ions undergo a crystallization process that creates a stable interface layer of cross&#8208;linked cubes on the electrode surface. The layer exposed the low&#8208;index crystal planes (100) and (110) through OR&#8208;induced electrode particle growth, supplemented by vacancy&#8211;ordered (100) superlattices that facilitated ion migration. Our design stabilized the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface considerably, achieving a cycle life of one million cycles with capacity retention of 91.6&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 91.7&#8201;% after 3000&#8197;cycles for a full battery.

         <title>Cover Picture: Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>

Carbonylation reactions introduce a carbonyl group (C=O) into a molecule to produce key chemicals including carboxylic acids, esters, and amides that are abundant in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and plastics. In their Research Article (e202410928), Robert S. Paton, Garret M. Miyake et al. developed a photocatalytic carbonylation strategy, which enables the conversion of alkyl halides to esters or amides under metal&#8208;free conditions. Additionally, this strategy allows for complete incorporation of the 13C isotope.

Ostwald ripening , as a well&#8208;known classic crystal growth mode, was introduced into the field of electrochemical energy storage by Wei Zhang, Weitao Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202414420). The transition metal ions dissolved in CuHCF undergo a crystallization process (Kongming lantern) and evolve into a stable interfacial layer (shining dome) via Ostwald ripening during electrochemical cycling. Through this process, the stability of the electrode and of the electrode/electrolyte interface are drastically improved.

         <title>Back Cover: Cascading Macrocycle and Helix Motions in a Foldarotaxane Molecular Shuttle (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50/2024)</title>

A foldarotaxane supramolecular machine is reported by Yann Ferrand, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202413977) Depending on pH and concentration, discrete isomers were obtained. The machine operates through gliding of the macrocycle that induces the gliding of the helix along the axle, or via the swapping of the relative position of macrocycle and helix by dissociation and reassociation of the supramolecule. In some cases, the helix sequestrates the macrocycle away from its best station.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Site&#8208;Selective Glycosylation of Native Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Davis, Koh, and co&#8208;workers disclosed a method for transforming native sugars through homolytic cleavage of an isolatable S&#8208;glycoside, in notable &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 &#945;&#8201;:&#8201;&#946; stereoselectivity. The sugar is activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (DMC) for the installation of an S&#8208;moiety that undergoes desulfurative C&#8722;C coupling using a combination of Hantzsch ester (HE) as reductant and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) under LED irradiation.







Abstract
Carbohydrates constitute the largest source of biomass on Earth, but their synthetic modification is challenging due to their high content in oxygen functionalities. The site&#8208; and stereoselective modification of native sugars is a definite goal of glycochemistry research. Recent efforts to bypass the need for protecting groups, leveraging selective activation through photochemical mechanisms for site&#8208;selective C&#8722;C bond formation from native sugars, are likely to largely impact all glycochemistry&#8208;related areas. Davis, Koh, and co&#8208;workers have recently presented their use of photocatalysis to develop a &#8220;cap and glycosylate&#8221; approach for the site&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation of native sugars. A modernized direct radical functionalization of in situ formed thioglycoside using photocatalysis was used in the synthetic manipulation of unprotected carbohydrates. This allowed reaching complex saccharides, and post&#8208;translational modification of proteins.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: From Catalytic Site Design to Microenvironment Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the advances in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for CO2 electroreduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation. Emphasis is placed on the structural and component advantages of MOFs. Additionally, the emerging applications toward practical electrocatalytic CO2 conversion scenarios, including diluted CO2 reduction, photo&#8208;assisted CO2 electroreduction, and C&#8722;N coupling, are also discussed.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;value carbon&#8208;based chemicals provides a sustainable approach to achieving an artificial carbon cycle. In the decade, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a kind of porous crystalline porous materials featuring well&#8208;defined structures, large surface area, high porosity, diverse components, easy tailorability, and controllable morphology, have attracted considerable research attention, serving as electrocatalysts to drive CO2 reduction. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structure/component advantages of MOFs meeting the requirements of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are analyzed. After that, the representative progress for the precise fabrication of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation, are systemically summarized. Furthermore, the emerging applications and promising research for more practical scenarios related to electrochemical CO2 conversion are specifically proposed. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook of MOFs for electrochemical CO2 reduction are further discussed.

In the decade, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a kind of porous crystalline porous materials featuring well-defined structures, large surface area, high porosity, diverse components, easy tailorability, and controllable morphology, have attracted considerable research attention, serving as electrocatalysts to drive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and the structure/component advantages of MOFs meeting the requirements of electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction are analyzed. After that, the representative progress for the precise fabrication of MOF-based electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation, are systemically summarized. Furthermore, the emerging applications and promising research for more practical scenarios related to electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion are specifically proposed. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook of MOFs for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction are further discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals with Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview explores how mechanochemistry can address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The potential of mechanochemistry to address climate change, energy scarcity, food insecurity and waste pollution by providing more efficient and environmentally friendly chemical processes is highlighted. Key advances and applications in sustainable chemistry are discussed.







Abstract
Chemistry traditionally relies on reactions in solution, but this method is increasingly problematic due to the scale of chemical processes and their economic and environmental impact. Handling residual chemical waste, including solvents, incurs significant costs and environmental pressure. Conversely, novel chemical approaches are needed to address pressing societal issues such as climate change, energy scarcity, food insecurity, and waste pollution. Mechanochemistry, a sustainable chemistry discipline that uses mechanical action to induce chemical reactivity without bulk solvents, is a hot topic in academic research on sustainable and green chemistry. Given its fundamentally different working principles from solution chemistry, mechanochemistry offers more efficient chemical processes and the opportunity to design new chemical reactions. Mechanochemistry has a profound impact on many urgent issues facing our society and it is now necessary to use mechanochemistry to address them. This Minireview aims to provide a guide for using mechanochemistry to meet the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby contributing to a prosperous society. Detailed analysis shows that mechanochemistry connects with most UN SDGs and offers more cost&#8208;efficiency than other approaches together with a superior environmental performance.

         <title>Dynamic Active Sites in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolutions of active sites are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis due to the applied potentials and reaction environments. The study on dynamic active sites deciphers the intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationships and provides more comprehensive insights into the interaction between electrocatalysts and electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
In&#8208;depth understanding of the real&#8208;time behaviors of active sites during electrocatalysis is essential for the advancement of sustainable energy conversion. Recently, the concept of dynamic active sites has been recognized as a potent approach for creating self&#8208;adaptive electrocatalysts that can address a variety of electrocatalytic reactions, outperforming traditional electrocatalysts with static active sites. Nonetheless, the comprehension of the underlying principles that guide the engineering of dynamic active sites is presently insufficient. In this review, we systematically analyze the fundamentals of dynamic active sites for electrocatalysis and consider important future directions for this emerging field. We reveal that dynamic behaviors and reversibility are two crucial factors that influence electrocatalytic performance. By reviewing recent advances in dynamic active sites, we conclude that implementing dynamic electrocatalysis through variable reaction environments, correlating the model of dynamic evolution with catalytic properties, and developing localized and ultrafast in situ/operando techniques are keys to designing high&#8208;performance dynamic electrocatalysts. This review paves the way to the development of the next&#8208;generation electrocatalyst and the universal theory for both dynamic and static active sites.

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production with Key Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the coupling of photocatalytic hydrogen production with value&#8208;added oxidation reactions to enhance the efficiency and comprehensive value, encompassing overall water splitting, H2O2 synthesis, biomass conversion, alcohol oxidation, and pollutants treatment. It provides a comprehensive summary of advancements in the field and discusses future research prospects focusing on value, photocatalysts, and systems.







Abstract
Hydrogen represents a clean and sustainable energy source with wide applications in fuel cells and hydrogen energy storage systems. Photocatalytic strategies emerge as a green and promising solution for hydrogen production, which still reveals several critical challenges in enhancing the efficiency and stability and improving the whole value. This review systematically elaborates on various coupling approaches for photocatalytic hydrogen production, aiming to improve both efficiency and value through different oxidation half&#8208;reactions. Firstly, the fundamental mechanism is discussed for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Then, the advances, challenges, and opportunities are expanded for the coupling of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which focuses on the integration of value&#8208;added reactions including O2 production, H2O2 production, biomass conversion, alcohol oxidation, and pollutants treatment. Finally, the challenges and outlook of photocatalytic H2 production technology are analyzed from the aspects of coupling hydrogen production value, photocatalyst design and reaction system construction. This work presents a holistic view of the field, emphasizing the synergistic benefits of coupled reactions and their practical application potential, rather than focusing on catalysts or single reaction systems. This review provides valuable references for the development and application of photocatalytic hydrogen production in energy conversion and environmental conservation through sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly and economic pathways.

         <title>The Perils of Molecular Interpretations from Vibrational Spectra of Complex Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful molecular fingerprinting tool. Yet, interpreting IR spectra of molecularly complex media is challenging. Here, we examine the often&#8208;overlooked intricacies of spectral data analyses, revealing commonly misleading interpretations. Focusing on blood&#8208;based IR spectroscopy, we argue for a viewpoint shift to accept the technique's fingerprinting nature and provide suggestions to improve analytical practices.







Abstract
Vibrational spectroscopy is a widely used technique for chemical characterizations across various analytical sciences. Its applications are increasingly extending to the analysis of complex samples such as biofluids, providing high&#8208;throughput molecular profiling. While powerful, the technique suffers from an inherent limitation: The overlap of absorption information across different spectral domains hinders the capacity to identify individual molecular substances contributing to measured signals. Despite the awareness of this challenge, the difficulty of analyzing multi&#8208;molecular spectra is often underestimated, leading to unsubstantiated molecular interpretations. Here, we examine the prevalent overreliance on spectral band assignment and illuminate the pitfalls of correlating spectral signals to discrete molecular entities or physiological states without rigorous validation. Focusing on blood&#8208;based infrared spectroscopy, we provide examples illustrating how peak overlap among different substances, relative substance concentrations, and preprocessing steps can lead to erroneous interpretations. We advocate for a viewpoint shift towards a more careful understanding of complex spectra, which shall lead to either accepting their fingerprinting nature and leveraging machine learning analysis &#8211; or involving additional measurement modalities for robust molecular interpretations. Aiming to help translate and improve analytical practices within the field, we highlight the limitations of molecular interpretations and feature their viable applications.

         <title>Selective Coupling of &#946;&#8208;(Borylvinyl)silanes by a Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Reaction&#8212;An Easy Way to Diaryl&#8208;Substituted Vinyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>

Gold selects silicon over boron in the light&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;coupling of B, Si&#8208;bifunctional olefins providing an easy way to unsymmetrically substituted 1,2&#8208;diaryl vinyl boronates. The reaction shows a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions with perfect chemo&#8208; and good stereoselectivity (Z/E 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The starting materials themselves are easily accessible by regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydroboration of trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted arylalkynes.







Abstract
The use of diaryl&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates, a class of chemical building blocks with well&#8208;known synthetic utility, is principally limited by the difficulty faced in their preparation. Herein, we present a convenient synthetic strategy based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed Hiyama arylation of (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(borylvinyl)silanes, which are easily accessible by hydroboration of silylalkynes. By exploiting the highly electronegative nature of the gold(III) intermediate (which is accessed by light&#8208;assisted oxidation using aryl diazonium salts), a selective activation of the silyl group in the presence of the boron moiety is achieved. This opens a route to selectively synthesize diaryl&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates. The reaction shows a broad substrate range, excellent functional group tolerance, and perfect chemoselectivity. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction.

     alt="Selective Coupling of &#946;-(Borylvinyl)silanes by a Gold-Catalyzed Hiyama Reaction&#8212;An Easy Way to Diaryl-Substituted Vinyl Boronates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold selects silicon over boron&lt;/b&gt; in the light-assisted cross-coupling of B, Si-bifunctional olefins providing an easy way to unsymmetrically substituted 1,2-diaryl vinyl boronates. The reaction shows a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions with perfect chemo- and good stereoselectivity (Z/E 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The starting materials themselves are easily accessible by regio- and stereoselective hydroboration of trimethylsilyl-substituted arylalkynes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of diaryl-substituted vinyl boronates, a class of chemical building blocks with well-known synthetic utility, is principally limited by the difficulty faced in their preparation. Herein, we present a convenient synthetic strategy based on a gold-catalyzed Hiyama arylation of (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-&#946;-(borylvinyl)silanes, which are easily accessible by hydroboration of silylalkynes. By exploiting the highly electronegative nature of the gold(III) intermediate (which is accessed by light-assisted oxidation using aryl diazonium salts), a selective activation of the silyl group in the presence of the boron moiety is achieved. This opens a route to selectively synthesize diaryl-substituted vinyl boronates. The reaction shows a broad substrate range, excellent functional group tolerance, and perfect chemoselectivity. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction. The synthetic potential was demonstrated by downstream transformations providing a facile route to bifunctional phenanthrenes and triaryl-substituted olefins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Peterson&#8208;Type Olefination Reactivity and its Use in a Silicon&#8208;Promoted Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of a silene and the C=O bond of a variety of carbonyl compounds produces four&#8208;membered silaoxetane heterocycles. These intermediates can be characterized, and engage in alkene&#8208;forming retro&#8208;cycloaddition reactions by the addition of SiO2. Moreover, the silene olefination reagent can be formed in&#8197;situ, giving rise to a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of adamantylsilene and the carbonyl group of aliphatic, aromatic or acetylenic ketones and aldehydes is demonstrated. The product of this reaction that is central to a non&#8208;ionic version of the Peterson olefination is an unusual four&#8208;membered 1,2&#8208;silaoxetane heterocycle that was characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically. In the presence of SiO2, the silaoxetane undergoes retro&#8208;cycloaddition with the formation of alkene products. As the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds without the necessity of any base, enolizable ketones can be converted into olefins. In addition, it is shown that the adamantylsilene can be produced in&#8197;situ by a sila&#8208;Peterson reaction, providing valuable input for the development of a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Oxetanes Catalyzed by an Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective protein engineering of halohydrin dehalogenases was conducted to access both R and S enantiomers starting from racemic oxetanes or &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols. The variants display high stereoselectivity and activity for both the dehalogenation of &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols and ring opening of oxetanes through kinetic resolution, yielding a broad range of functional chiral oxetanes and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols.







Abstract
Although biocatalysis has garnered widespread attention in both industrial and academic realms, the enzymatic synthesis of chiral oxetanes remains an underdeveloped field. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are industrially relevant enzymes that have been engineered to accomplish the reversible transformation of epoxides. In this study, a biocatalytic platform was constructed for the stereoselective kinetic resolution of chiral oxetanes and formation of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols. HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 was engineered to identify key variants capable of catalyzing the dehalogenation of &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols (via HheC M1&#8208;M3) and ring opening of oxetanes (via HheC M4&#8208;M5) to access both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configured products with high stereoselectivity and remarkable catalytic activity, yielding up to 49&#8201;% with enantioselectivities exceeding 99&#8201;% ee and E&gt;200. The current strategy is broadly applicable as demonstrated by expansion of the substrate scope to include up to 18 examples for dehalogenation and 16 examples for ring opening. Additionally, the functionalized products are versatile building blocks for pharmaceutical applications. To shed light on the molecular recognition mechanisms for the relevant variants, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed. The current strategy expands the scope of HHDH&#8208;catalyzed chiral oxetane ring construction, offering efficient access to both enantiomers of chiral oxetanes and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols.

         <title>N&#8208;Halogenation by Vanadium&#8208;Dependent Haloperoxidases Enables 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vanadium&#8208;dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) class of enzymes are discovered as an effective biocatalyst platform for nitrogen&#8208;halogen (N&#8722;X) bond formation. VHPOs perform selective halogenation on a range of substituted benzamidine hydrochlorides to produce the corresponding N&#8217;&#8208;halobenzimidamides and this technology is applied to 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole synthesis.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds are valuable synthetic intermediates and targets in nearly every chemical industry. While methods for nitrogen&#8208;carbon and nitrogen&#8208;heteroatom bond formation have primarily relied on nucleophilic nitrogen atom reactivity, molecules containing nitrogen&#8208;halogen bonds allow for electrophilic or radical reactivity modes at the nitrogen center. Despite the growing synthetic utility of nitrogen&#8208;halogen bond&#8208;containing compounds, selective catalytic strategies for their synthesis are largely underexplored. We recently discovered that the vanadium&#8208;dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) class of enzymes are a suitable biocatalyst platform for nitrogen&#8208;halogen bond formation. Herein, we show that VHPOs perform selective halogenation of a range of substituted benzamidine hydrochlorides to produce the corresponding N&#8217;&#8208;halobenzimidamides. This biocatalytic platform is applied to the synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from the corresponding N&#8208;acylbenzamidines in high yield and with excellent chemoselectivity. Finally, the synthetic applicability of this biotechnology is demonstrated in an extension to nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen bond formation and the chemoenzymatic synthesis of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, ataluren.

         <title>Hydrogenolysis of Haloboranes: from Synthesis of Hydroboranes to Formal Hydroboration Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of hydroboranes is reported from dihydrogen (H2) and haloboranes, using a base to trap the released acid, under both stoichiometric and catalytic conditions. The system is applicable to one&#8208;pot hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.







Abstract
Hydroboranes are versatile reagents in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we report a new method for the preparation of hydroboranes from hydrogen and the corresponding haloboranes. Triethylamine (NEt3) form with dialkylchloroboranes a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H2 and afford the desired hydroborane with ammonium salts. Unreactive haloboranes were unlocked using a catalytic amount of Cy2BCl, enabling the synthesis of commonly used hydroboranes such as pinacolborane or catecholborane. The mechanisms of these reactions have been examined by DFT studies, highlighting the importance of the base selection. Finally, the system&#8216;s robustness has been evaluated in one&#8208;pot B&#8722;Cl hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.

         <title>A Strategy for the Formal C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling of Tertiary Amines</title>

We report a strategy for the formal C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary amines via the in situ generation and displacement of N&#8208;acyl ammonium species. Specifically, treatment of acyclic and cyclic tertiary amines with TFAA or chloroformates in the presence of NaI leads to the generation of alkyl iodides, which can be engaged directly in Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. Applications to the late&#8208;stage modification of complex heterocycles are presented.







Abstract
We report a strategy for the formal C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary amines via the in situ generation and displacement of N&#8208;acyl ammonium species. Specifically, treatment of diverse tertiary amines with TFAA or chloroformates in the presence of NaI leads to the efficient generation of alkyl iodides, which can be engaged directly in Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. The protocol is applicable to acyclic and cyclic systems, including highly hindered variants. Applications to the late&#8208;stage modification of complex heterocycles are presented.

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;stage Benzylic Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly site&#8208;selective acridinium/HAT catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions with simple and inexpensive D2O as an isotope source is reported. Unprecedented selective HIE on competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions was achieved with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation, enabling the effective late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives.







Abstract
A highly regioselective visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of benzylic positions in both simple and complex molecules is reported. The process follows a dual catalytic approach using an acridinium photocatalyst in combination with a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, while the use of D2O as an isotope source ensures operational simplicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. High reactivity has been achieved for electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions. Moreover, targeted radical formation enables unprecedented selective HIE on intramolecular competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation. The utility of the reaction was demonstrated on the late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a single electron transfer (SET) mechanism followed by deprotonation to generate the benzylic radical, and revealed the importance of halogenated solvents or additives. Upon a weak complexation of the halogenated species to the substrate, an oxidation potential lowering effect is induced, as well as a stabilization of the radical&#8208;cation species through spin delocalization.

This study highlights innovative strategies to manage over&#8208;reactions caused by strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, utilizing allyl carbonate as an oxidant for enhanced control and efficiency in synthesis.







Abstract
Here, we report a robust nickel&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation process designed for substrates that contain electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfur and phosphorus groups. Leveraging the formation of organozinc intermediates and the utilization of a mild oxidant, allyl methyl carbonate, this methodology exhibits remarkable efficiency and outstanding diastereoselectivities across a diverse array of substrates, achieving E&#8201;:&#8201;Z ratios exceeding 20&#8201;:&#8201;1. Investigation through deuterium incorporation studies and an analysis of the reaction sequence leading to the formation of the dehydrogenative allylation side product, provide useful insights into reaction optimization.

         <title>Enhancement of Lithium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction by Modifying Center Atom of Tetraalkyl&#8208;Type Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alcoholic proton carriers in lithium mediated nitrogen reduction were replaced with ionic liquids (ILs). Switching the central atom in these ILs notably boosted performance, increasing Faradaic efficiency (FE) by 1.45&#8197;times when switching from phosphonium to ammonium cations with an FE of 39.5&#8201;% and remained stable for over 12&#8197;h.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a viable alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ammonia production. However, ethanol, a common proton carrier in Li&#8208;NRR, exhibits electrochemical instability, leading to oxidation at the anode or byproduct formation at the cathode. This study replaces alcoholic proton carriers with ionic liquids (ILs), specifically tetrabutylphosphonium chloride (TBPCl) and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl), to examine how the electronegativity differences between the central atom and adjacent carbon of the cation affect catalytic performance. The results show that switching the central atom in tetraalkyl&#8208;type ILs markedly enhances performance, specifically resulting in a 1.45&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency (FE) with the transition from phosphonium to ammonium cation of ILs. Additionally, optimal IL concentrations in the electrolyte are identified to maximize ammonia yield. TBACl, in particular, demonstrates enhanced ammonia production and operational stability, achieving an ammonia yield rate of 13.60&#8197;nmol/cm2/s, an FE of 39.5&#8201;%, and operational stability for over 12&#8197;h under conditions of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 and 10&#8197;atm. This research underscores the potential of precise IL modifications for more efficient and sustainable Li&#8208;NRR.

         <title>Recognition and order of multiple sidechains by metal&#8211;organic framework enhances the separation of hexane isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordering of multiple sidechains on a metal&#8211;organic framework is achieved by the assembly of linkers that differ only in the appended functional groups at a chiral centre. The strain induced by the functional groups defines the conformation of each linker and drives their ordering in the crystal structure of the framework. The pore environments formed by this assembly have well&#8208;defined adsorption sites for hexane isomers and enhance their separation.







Abstract
Porous materials perform molecular sorting, separation and transformation by interaction between their framework structures and the substrates. Proteins also interact with molecules to effect chemical transformations, but rely on the precise sequence of the amino acid building units along a common polypeptide backbone to maximise their performance. Design strategies that positionally order sidechains over a defined porous framework to diversify the internal surface chemistry would enhance control of substrate processing. Here we show that different sidechains can be ordered over a metal&#8211;organic framework through recognition of their distinct chemistries during synthesis. The sidechains are recognised because each one forces the common building unit that defines the backbone of the framework into a different conformation in order to form the extended structure. The resulting sidechain ordering affords hexane isomer separation performance superior to that of the same framework decorated only with sidechains of a single kind. The separated molecules adopt distinct arrangements within the resulting modified pore geometry, reflecting their strongly differentiated environments precisely created by the ordered sidechains. The development of frameworks that recognize and order multiple sidechain functionality by conformational control offers tailoring of the internal surfaces within families of porous materials to direct interactions at the molecular level.

         <title>Cobalt Tetracationic 3,4&#8208;Pyridinoporphyrazine for Direct CO2 to Methanol Conversion Escaping the CO Intermediate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigate the electrocatalytic properties of tetracationic cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for CO2 reduction in a heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike previous reports on cobalt&#8208;based phthalocyanine electrocatalysis, which suggested CO as an intermediate in the reduction to methanol, our findings indicate that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol, thereby excluding a mechanistic pathway where CO is an intermediate.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.

         <title>Carbenoids with Sulfinate as Nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;Type Homologation: Direct Insertion of Oxygen&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted Units into Carbon&#8208;Boron Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of carbenoid for Matteson&#8208;type homologation with sulfinate as the nucleofuge has been developed. This coupling partner allows the direct insertion of O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituted methylene units into the C&#8722;B bonds of boronic acid derivatives under non&#8208;cryogenic conditions and in the absence of a strong base.







Abstract
Carbenoid insertion into boronate carbon&#8208;boron bonds, namely the Matteson&#8208;type homologation, has been recognized as a powerful tool for constructing carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. However, some limitations and inconvenience still exist with the carbenoids currently employed, such as the use of highly cryogenic and basic conditions. Herein, we report a new class of stable carbenoids with sulfinate as nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;type homologations, which directly introduce O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituted methylenes into carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Enabled by oxazaborolidines as the boronic substrates, the reaction is operatable at 0&#8201;&#176;C or room temperature with weaker bases. Broad functional groups, including acidic C&#8722;H bonds, can be tolerated. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and iterative insertion of various carbenoids.

Direct Aminophosphonation: A new, metal&#8208;free method has been developed to simultaneously aminate and phosphonylate imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines using eco&#8208;friendly solvents in normal air. This process is simple, sustainable, scalable, and functional&#8208;group tolerant. The resulting compounds have light&#8208;emitting properties, making them promising for use as fluorescent probes (blue to greenish fluorescence).







Abstract
We report a novel, metal&#8208;free procedure for the direct aminophosphonation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in green solvents under open air conditions. This method is characterized by its mild and sustainable conditions, ease of operation, scalability, and excellent functional group compatibility. The synthesized compounds exhibit promising photophysical properties, including significant Stokes shifts and quantum yields, making them potential candidates for innovative fluorescent probes.

         <title>Controlling the Redox Chemistry of Cobalt Radiopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elementally matched 55Co (PET imaging)/58mCo (therapy) radioisotope pair is suitable for tandem diagnostic/therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Modulation of the Co2+/3+ redox couple is facile in mild oxidative conditions compatible with radiopharmaceutical synthesis, including radiolysis by the isotope's endogenous decay properties. Redox control at tracer scale provides access to the varied and unexplored functionality of 2+ and 3+ 55/58mCo complexes.







Abstract
The elementally matched 55Co2+/3+ (t1/2=17.53&#8197;h, I&#946;+=77&#8201;%)/58mCo2+/3+ (t1/2=9.10&#8197;h, internal conversion=100&#8201;%) radioisotope pair is of interest for development of paired diagnostic/therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Due to the accessibility of the nat/55Co2+/3+ redox couple, the redox state can be readily modulated. Here, we show that macroscopic and radiochemical redox reactions can be closely monitored and controlled using spectroscopic and radiochemical methods. We employ model systems to inform how to selectively synthesize thermodynamically favored oxidation state coordination complexes. In addition to exogenous oxidants, our data indicates that 55Co&#8208;induced radiolysis of water efficiently and directly drives selective oxidation to the 55Co3+ species under no&#8208;carrier added (n.c.a.) conditions. Our synthetic strategies subsequently stabilize the respective 55Co2+ or 55Co3+ species for targeted positron emission tomography imaging in a mouse tumor model.

         <title>Magnetically Induced Amination of Alcohols Using MNi@Cu (M=Fe, Co) Nanoparticles as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co4Ni6@Cu and Fe3Ni7@Cu nanoparticles containing a magnetic core and a catalytic shell have been synthesized and found to be highly active catalysts for amination of primary and secondary alcohols with secondary amines when an alternating magnetic field (AMF) is applied. Several tertiary amines have hence been prepared under argon without hydrogen feed. This process allows to limit degradation reactions of the reagents and of the products and can therefore be used for the synthesis of other thermally sensitive molecules.







Abstract
The synthesis of tertiary amines from alcohols (i.e. heptanol, dodecanol, cyclohexanol, benzylalcohol) and secondary amines (Me2NH (DMA), nPr2NH, nBu2NH) has been achieved in one step using trimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) displaying a magnetic core (Co4Ni6 and Fe3Ni7) and a Cu shell as both catalysts and heating agent in the presence of an alternating magnetic field. This methodology limits the redistribution reactions occurring on amines at high temperature leading to both much higher conversion and selectivity in the absence of solvent than usually observed using conventional heating. Moreover, Co4Ni6@Cu NPs were found moisture resistant, thereby allowing for performing the reaction with commercial DMA in water (40&#8201;%&#8201;wt) with again high conversion and selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu nanoparticles containing a magnetic core and a catalytic shell have been synthesized and found to be highly active catalysts for amination of primary and secondary alcohols with secondary amines when an alternating magnetic field (AMF) is applied. Several tertiary amines have hence been prepared under argon without hydrogen feed. This process allows to limit degradation reactions of the reagents and of the products and can therefore be used for the synthesis of other thermally sensitive molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of tertiary amines from alcohols (i.e. heptanol, dodecanol, cyclohexanol, benzylalcohol) and secondary amines (Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH (DMA), &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH, &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH) has been achieved in one step using trimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) displaying a magnetic core (Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) and a Cu shell as both catalysts and heating agent in the presence of an alternating magnetic field. This methodology limits the redistribution reactions occurring on amines at high temperature leading to both much higher conversion and selectivity in the absence of solvent than usually observed using conventional heating. Moreover, Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu NPs were found moisture resistant, thereby allowing for performing the reaction with commercial DMA in water (40&#8201;%&#8201;wt) with again high conversion and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Stable Chiral Aminosulfonium Ylides and Their Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the stabilization effect of an adjacent N&#8208;atom and a cyclic sulfide moiety, conformationally stable acyclic S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylides were accessed for the first time with excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol via a copper catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular carbene transfer reaction. The resulting products allow for further stereospecific elaborations to afford aminosulfonium ylide oxides and sulfinamide.







Abstract
The isolation and catalytic enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable S&#8208;stereogenic sulfonium ylides have been significant challenges in the field of asymmetric synthesis. These reactive intermediates are crucial for a variety of synthetic transformations, yet their inherent tendency towards rapid inversion at the sulfur stereocenter has hindered their practical utilization. Conventional approaches have focused on strategies that incorporate a C=S bond&#8208;containing cyclic framework to help mitigate this stereochemical lability. In this work, we present an alternative tactic that leverages the stabilizing influence of an adjacent N&#8208;atom and cyclic sulfide moiety. Exploiting a copper catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular carbene transfer reaction, structurally diverse S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylides have been achieved in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Experimental results indicate that the careful selection of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketone precursors is crucial for achieving optimal stereoinduction in this transformation. The resulting highly enantioenriched aminosulfonium ylides allow for further stereospecific elaborations to furnish aminosulfonium ylide oxides and sulfinamide. This work expands the boundaries of chiral sulfonium ylide chemistry, providing access to a broad range of previously elusive S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylide scaffolds.

         <title>Improved Energy Transfer in the Sensitization of Americium Enables Observation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reported example of americium circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is presented. The synthesis of a molecular complex supported by 2&#8208;thenoylacetonate and BINAPO yielded a compound that displayed enhanced f&#8208;f luminescence thanks to a unique sensitization pathway. This allowed for the detection of CPL despite weak instrumental detection capabilities.







Abstract
The first example of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a molecular americium (Am) complex is reported. Coordination of Am(III) by a combination of thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and a chiral diphosphine oxide ligand yielded a complex with strong sensitized metal&#8208;centered luminescence. The energy transfer process for sensitization appears to occur via a unique resonant pathway, which results in the removal of the overlap between ligand phosphorescence and sensitized Am luminescence that has often been observed. Owing to this feature, and despite the limited amount of material that could be used due to the radioactivity of 241Am, CPL could be measured. The collected luminescence and CPL spectra provide insight into the crystal field splitting of the 5D1&#8594;7F1 transition. These results pave the way for future studies of Am(III) luminescence to investigate electronic structure effects in this and other 5&#8201;f elements.

         <title>In situ Monitoring of Photocatalysis on Polymeric Carbon Nitride Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes are developed for time&#8208;resolved monitoring of pCN photocatalyzed reaction processes under visible light conditions. This technique allows simultaneous in situ irradiation and monitoring of heterogeneous reactions, which enables the detection of intermediates that are elusive in conventional spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride has attracted significant interest in heterogeneous photocatalysis due to its activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Herein, we report on using carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes for in situ studies of photocatalytic reaction mechanisms. In a first step, we exploited carbon nitride&#8208;coated crimp vials as batch photoreactors for visible photocatalytic fluorinations of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, with moderate to excellent yields and reusability over multiple cycles. Eventually, carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes were used as a photoreactor by coupling them with optical fiber irradiation directly inside the spectrometer. This enabled us to follow the reaction with in situ NMR spectroscopy identifying reactive intermediates otherwise elusive in conventional analyses. The method provides advantages for the study of photocatalytic mechanisms of complex reactions and substantially reduces the need of comparative tests for depicting reaction intermediates and conversion pathways.

         <title>The Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than 100&#8197;years after Staudinger's seminal reports on the reaction of iminophosphoranes with aldehydes, an alternative path, the so&#8208;called &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction&#8221; has been uncovered. We describe the reaction of bulky azides with PMe3 in the presence of aromatic aldehydes to give triazabutadienes (TBDs). This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is a versatile route towards TBDs, tolerating various aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners.







Abstract
The introduction of heteroatoms into conjugated organic molecules is an important strategy to tune their reactivity and physical properties. In this realm triazabutadienes (TBDs) of the general from R2C=N&#8722;N=NR&#8217; are an interesting class of compounds, however, general synthetic protocols for their generation are limited. Based on the serendipitous finding that the sterically encumbered azide Mes*N3 (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2) reacted with PMe3 in the presence of an aromatic aldehyde to form a TBD, we now report on the &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig&#8221; reaction. This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is shown to be a versatile tool for the synthesis of a variety of TBDs, tolerating a wide range of aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners. The preference for azide&#8208;Wittig, rather than aza&#8208;Wittig reactivity was rationalized using computational methods. This study shows how kinetic control can significantly alter the reaction pathway, thereby switching from an aza&#8208;Wittig to an azide&#8208;Wittig regime.

         <title>Mechanochemical Conditions for Intramolecular N&#8722;O Couplings via Rhodium Nitrenoids Generated from N&#8208;Acyl Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical intramolecular N&#8722;O couplings of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides under rhodium catalysis are presented. The solvent&#8208;free method proceeds via rhodium nitrenoids and produces unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in a short reaction time with up to 98&#8201;% yield. Potential synthetic applications of the resulting five&#8208;membered heterocycles as nitrene precursors are demonstrated by reacting a representative compound with DMSO under heat or blue light.







Abstract
Starting from N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides, mechanochemically generated rhodium nitrenoids undergo intramolecular N&#8722;O couplings to provide unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields. The cyclization proceeds efficiently with a catalyst loading of only 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% in the presence of phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) as oxidant. Neither an inert atmosphere nor additional heating is required in this solvent&#8208;free procedure. Under heat or blue light, the newly formed five&#8208;membered heterocycles function as nitrene precursors reacting with sulfoxides as exemplified by the imidation of dimethyl sulfoxide.

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangements in the Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Biosynthesis of Coral&#8208;Type Diterpenes from Chitinophaga pinensis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diterpene synthases were characterised from the bacterium Chitinophaga pinensis that catalyse the formation of typical coral&#8208;derived compounds including known palmatol and a new conformationally rigid eunicellane diterpene, posing interesting questions on the ecological functions in organisms evolutionary as distant as bacteria and corals. The complex enzyme mechanisms were interrogated in isotope labelling experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Two diterpene synthases from the bacterium Chitinophaga pinensis were characterised. The first enzyme mainly produced the rearranged diterpene palmatol, a compound known from octocorals, while the second enzyme made the new coral&#8208;type eunicellane chitinol. The mechanisms of both enzymes were deeply studied through isotopic labelling experiments, DFT calculations, and with a substrate analog containing a saturated double bond, resulting in the formation of derailment products that gave additional insights into the nature of the cyclisation cascade intermediates. The formation of coral&#8208;type diterpenes poses interesting questions on the functions of these compounds in organisms as different as bacteria and corals.

         <title>Cascading Macrocycle and Helix Motions in a Foldarotaxane Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A foldarotaxane molecular shuttle is reported that operates through orchestrated interdependent motions of the macrocycle and foldamer. Depending on the pH and concentration, stable and metastable states could be obtained. In particular, shuttling of the macrocycle triggered the gliding of the foldamer away from its best station. Conversely, the foldamer unit could compartmentalize the rotaxane axle and trap the macrocycle away from its best station.







Abstract
The design of a dynamically assembled foldarotaxane was envisioned with the aim of operating as a two cascading trigger&#8208;based molecular shuttle. Under acidic conditions, both the macrocycle and helix were localized around their respective best molecular stations because they are far enough from each other not to alter the stability of complexes. The pH&#8208;dependent localization of the macrocycle along the encircled axle allowed us to modulate the association between the helical foldamer and its sites of interaction on the axle. Under kinetic control&#8212;at low concentration and room temperature&#8212;when the foldarotaxane supramolecular architecture is kinetically stable, the pH&#8208;responsive translation of the macrocycle along the thread triggered the gliding of the helix away from its initial best station. At higher concentration&#8212;when helix assembly/disassembly process is accelerated&#8212;the system reached the equilibrium state. A new foldarotaxane isomer then appeared through the change of the relative position of the helix and macrocycle along the thread. In this isomer, the helix segregated the macrocycle away from its best station. The fine control of the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, combined with the control of pH, allowed the reciprocal segregation of the helix or the ring away from their respective best sites of interaction.

         <title>Nuclease&#8208;Resistant L&#8208;DNA Tension Probes Enable Long&#8208;Term Force Mapping of Single Cells and Cell Consortia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel class of DNA&#8208;based tension probes, L&#8208;DNA tension probes, based on the non&#8208;biological stereoisomer of D&#8208;DNA. These probes are exceptionally resistant to nuclease degradation and remarkably bioinert. Unlike conventional D&#8208;DNA probes, L&#8208;DNA probes can endure cell culture environments for several days, enabling long&#8208;term imaging of single cells as well as a group of cells.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based tension probes with precisely programmable force responses provide important insights into cellular mechanosensing. However, their degradability in cell culture limits their use for long&#8208;term imaging, for instance, when cells migrate, divide, and differentiate. This is a critical limitation for providing insights into mechanobiology for these longer&#8208;term processes. Here, we present DNA&#8208;based tension probes that are entirely designed based on the stereoisomer of biological D&#8208;DNA, i.e., L&#8208;DNA. We demonstrate that L&#8208;DNA tension probes are essentially indestructible by nucleases and provide days&#8208;long imaging without significant loss in image quality. We also show their superiority already for short imaging times commonly used for classical D&#8208;DNA tension probes. We showcase the potential of these resilient probes to image minute movements, and for generating long term force maps of single cells and of collectively migrating cell populations.

         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl addition of silicon nucleophiles released from the corresponding Si&#8722;B reagent enables the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehydes. The catalyst&#8208;controlled 1,2&#8208;addition is highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective, stopping at the stage of the monoaddition. A subsequent addition to the unreacted carbonyl group is substrate&#8208;controlled in the presence of an achiral ligand. The possible [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement is not seen in either step. The resulting products can be further converted into functionalized, axially chiral compounds.







Abstract
A desymmetrizing 1,2&#8208;addition of silicon nucleophiles to biaryl derivatives containing an 2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde&#8208;1&#8208;yl unit is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by copper with a triazolium&#8208;ion&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene as the chiral ligand and makes use of an Si&#8211;B reagent as the silicon pronucleophile. The practical methodology furnishes axially chiral aromatic carbaldehydes decorated with a centrally chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxysilane moiety in moderate to good yields and with high enantio&#8208; as well as excellent diastereoselectivities. The silicon nucleophile always attacks at the diastereotopic face of either carbonyl group away from the ortho substituent on the phenyl ring at C1 of the 2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde&#8208;1&#8208;yl fragment. The resulting axially and centrally chiral products can be further converted into valuable biaryl compounds with hardly any erosion of the enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Homonuclear Super&#8208;Resolution NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectral resolution is a limiting factor in protein NMR for dynamics analysis and structure elucidation. With the Super Resolution method the peak line&#8208;width is reduced by a factor of 2&#8211;3. For the 20&#8197;kDa protein KRAS, highly resolved 2D NOESY spectra suitable for automated analysis can be acquired within less than 3&#8197;hours.







Abstract
In homonuclear 1H&#8197;NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra such as [1H,1H]&#8208;NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement spectroscopy), which is a historic cornerstone spectrum for biomolecular NMR structural biology, hundreds to thousands of cross peaks are present within a square of approximately 100&#8197;ppm2 leading to a lot of signal overlap. Spectral resolution is thus a limiting factor for unambiguous chemical shift assignment and data interpretation for dynamics and structure elucidation. Acquiring the spectra at higher magnetic fields such as at a 1.2&#8197;GHz 1H frequency helps to reduce spectral crowding, since resolution scales proportionally to the magnetic field strength. Here, we show that the linewidths of cross peaks in [1H,1H]&#8208;NOESY and [1H,1H]&#8208;TOCSY spectra can be further reduced by a factor of 2&#8211;3 in each dimension by super&#8208;resolution spectroscopy. In the indirect dimension a composite exponential&#8208;cosine weighted number of scans along the time increments are recorded and digitally smoothened by a window function, while in the direct dimension an exponential&#8208;cosine window function is applied. Furthermore, measurement time saving by reduced&#8208;acquisition super&#8208;resolution (RASR) is introduced. Application to the 20&#8197;kDa protein KRAS shows that highly resolved NMR spectra suitable for automated analysis can be acquired within less than 3&#8197;hours. The method opens an avenue towards automated chemical shift assignment, dynamics and structure determination of unlabeled small and medium size proteins within 24&#8197;hours.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Depolymerization of Functionalized Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;enzymatic concept is described for the depolymerization of low molecular weight polyethylene. Initial treatment with mCPBA and ultrasonication is followed by the key steps, a four&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction yielding various functionalized medium&#8208;chain products.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most commonly used plastic type in the world, contributing significantly to the plastic waste crisis. Microbial degradation of PE in natural environments is unlikely due to its inert saturated carbon&#8208;carbon backbones, which are difficult to break down by enzymes, challenging the development of a biocatalytic recycling method for PE waste. Here, we demonstrated the depolymerization of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) PE using an enzyme cascade that included a catalase&#8208;peroxidase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, a Baeyer Villiger monooxygenase, and a lipase after the polymer was chemically pretreated with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) and ultrasonication. In a preparative experiment with gram&#8208;scale pretreated polymers, GC&#8208;MS and weight loss determinations confirmed ~27&#8201;% polymer conversion including the formation of medium&#8208;size functionalized molecules such as &#969;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids and &#945;,&#969;&#8208;carboxylic acids. Additional analyses of LMWPE&#8208;nanoparticles using AFM showed that enzymatic depolymerization reduced the sizes of these mCPBA&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;treated LMWPE&#8208;nanoparticles. This multi&#8208;enzyme catalytic concept with distinct chemical steps represents a unique starting point for future development of bio&#8208;based recycling methods for polyolefin waste.

         <title>Enamine Synthesis via Regiocontrolled 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig Tethered Carboamination of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regiocontrolled synthesis of enamines was achieved by the Pd&#8208;catalyzed carboamination of propargylic alcohols using molecular aldimine tethers. 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo cyclic trisubstituted enamines were selectively prepared based on the choice of the amine protecting group. The obtained enamines were easily transformed in 2,1&#8208; and 3,1&#8208;amino alcohols and their fluorinated derivatives.







Abstract
Enamines are versatile building blocks for the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Nevertheless, only a limited number of strategies have been reported for preparing trisubstituted enamines in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. Herein, we report a regiocontrolled 6&#8208;endo and 5&#8208;exo tethered carboamination of propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of trisubstituted enamines. High regioselectivity was achieved through fine&#8208;tuning of the amine protecting group during the Pd&#8208;catalyzed carboamination. The introduced trifluoromethylated tether enables further stereoselective functionalizations, such as hydrogenation and fluorination.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Enhanced by a Non&#8208;Emissive Dual Redox Mediator</title>

         <dc:description>
The [Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722; complex enhances the ECL detection system of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) by up to an order of magnitude without interference from the inherent ECL of previously reported Ir(III) enhancers. In addition to its electrocatalysis of TPrA oxidation and efficient chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminophore, the complex increases the thickness of the ECL layer by extending diffusion of the intermediates from the electrode.







Abstract
A sulfonated tris(1&#8208;phenylpyrazolato)iridium(III) complex ([Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722;) serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept non&#8208;emissive enhancer of the widely used ECL detection system of tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)3]2+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) co&#8208;reactant, acting through electrocatalysis of TPrA oxidation and efficient chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminophore. Using self&#8208;interference ECL spectroscopy, we show that the enhancer extends diffusion of the required electrogenerated precursors from the electrode surface. Previously reported enhancement through these pathways has been confounded by the inherent ECL of the enhancer, but the increase in [Ru(bpy)3]2+ ECL intensity using [Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722; was obtained without its concomitant emission. The most prominent enhancement (11&#8208;fold) occurred at low potentials associated with the &#8216;indirect&#8217; co&#8208;reactant ECL pathway, which translated to between 2&#8208; and 6&#8208;fold enhancement when the luminophore was immobilised on microbeads as a general model for enhanced ECL assays.

         <title>Six&#8208;Membered Ring Directed Assembly of a Zirconium Zeolitic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>

This work demonstrates a new paradigm for zirconium zeolite&#8208;type frameworks through the conversion of extraframework sites in natural zeolite into part of the framework by symmetry&#8208; and size&#8208;matched ring&#8208;directing agent for the size&#8208;exclusion separation of hexane isomers.







Abstract
The synthesis of zirconium MOFs with zeolite net is quite challenging due to the high connectivity of Zr6 clusters, which is far from tetrahedral connection, a requisite for zeolite net. In this work, we demonstrate a six&#8208;membered ring (6MR) strategy through mimicking of mineral zeolites with mixed ditopic and tritopic carboxylate linkers. With this strategy, the ditopic linker cross&#8208;links Zr6 clusters to form 4&#8208;connected zeolite&#8208;like nets, while the tritopic one is used to direct the formation of 6MR and simultaneously consumes extra coordination sites on the cluster. The feasibility of this strategy is shown by one zeolitic metal&#8211;organic framework (NNM&#8208;5) and this strategy has also led to the synthesis of the other dia&#8208;type zirconium MOF (NNM&#8208;6). Interestingly, as the tritopic linker not only directs the formation of 6MR but also partitions 6MR into small segments, NNM&#8208;5 with SOD topology shows a structural feature of small aperture and big cage, which has led to efficient separation of hexane isomers. With both exceptionally high n&#8208;hexane uptake (65.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and size&#8208;exclusion selectivity, an exceptional separation capability is verified by breakthrough experiments. Calculation results demonstrate that the large difference of diffusion energy barrier due to the small aperture accounts for the underlying separation mechanism.
