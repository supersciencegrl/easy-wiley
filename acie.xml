         <title>Dehydrated UiO&#8208;66(SH)2: The Zr&#8208;O Cluster and Its Photocatalytic Role Mimicking the Biological Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports a dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF UiO&#8208;66(SH)  2  as a visible light driven photocatalyst to mimic the biological N  2  fixation process. The  15  N  2  and other control&#8208;experiments demonstrated that the new photocatalyst is highly efficient in converting N  2  to ammonia. In&#8208;situ TGA, XPS, EXAFS etc. and first&#8208;principles simulations were used to demonstrate the role of the thermal treatment and the changes of the local structures around Zr due to the dehydration. It was shown that the dehydration opened a gate for the entry of N  2  molecules into the [Zr  6  O  6  ] cluster where the strong N&#8801;N bond was broken stepwise by &#956;&#8208;N&#8208;Zr type interactions driven by the photoelectrons aided by the protonation. This mechanism was discussed in comparison with the Lowe&#8208;Thorneley mechanism proposed for the MoFe nitrogenase, and with emphasis on the [Zr  6  O  6  ] cluster effect and the leading role of photoelectrons over the protonation. The results shed new light on understanding the catalytic mechanism of biological N  2  fixation and open a new way to fix N  2  under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Extraordinary p&#8208;d Hybridization Interaction in Heterostructural Pd&#8208;PdSe Nanosheets Boosts C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage of Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via one&#8208;step approach. These Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structure, in which unconventional  p&#8208;d  hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect co&#8208;exist. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Pd NSs catalysts, Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs display 5.5 (6.6) and 2.5 (2.6) folds enhancement of specific (mass) activity for EG oxidation reaction (EGOR). Especially, the optimum C1 pathway selectivity of Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs reaches 44.3%, illustrating the superior C&#8211;C Bond cleavage ability. Electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate extraordinary p&#8208;d hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect could effectively reduce the activation energy of C&#8211;C bond breaking and accelerate CO* oxidation, boosting the complete oxidation of EG and improving the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8211;N Axially Chiral Indoles and Pyrroles by De Novo Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first highly atroposelective construction of N&#8208;N axially chiral indole scaffolds were established via a new strategy of de novo ring formation. This strategy makes use of the organocatalytic asymmetric Paal&#8208;Knorr reaction of well&#8208;designed N&#8208;aminoindoles with 1,4&#8208;diketones, thus affording high yields for N&#8208;pyrrolylindoles with excellent atroposelectivities (up to 98% yield, 96% ee). In addition, this strategy is applicable for the atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;N axially chiral bispyrroles (up to 98% yield, 97% ee). More importantly, such N&#8208;N axially chiral heterocycles can be converted into chiral organocatalysts with applications in asymmetric catalysis, and some molecules display potent anticancer activities. This work not only provides a new strategy for the atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;N axially chiral molecules but also offers a new member of the N&#8208;N atropisomer family with promising applications in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron porphyrins are among the best molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction reaction. Powering these catalysts with the help of photosensitizers comes along with a couple of unsolved challenges that need to be addressed with much vigor. We have designed an iron porphyrin catalyst decorated with urea functions (  UrFe  ) acting as a multipoint hydrogen bonding scaffold towards the CO  2  substrate. We found a spectacular photocatalytic activity reaching unreported TONs and TOFs as high as 7270 and 3720 h  &#8208;1  respectively. While the Fe  0  redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, we show here that the Fe  I  species is already involved in the CO  2  activation which represents the rate determining step in the photocatalytic cycle. The urea functions help to dock the CO  2  upon photocatalysis. DFT calculations bring support to our experimental findings that constitute a new paradigm in the catalytic reduction of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Indolenine and Indoline Ring Systems by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomatized indole derivatives bearing a C3&#8208; or C2stereocenter exist ubiquitously in natural products and biologically active molecules. Despite remarkable advances in their chemical synthesis, stereoselective and  regio  &#8208;divergent methods are still in a high demand. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes has been developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement of these indoline derivatives under acidic conditions afforded indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter, where the selectivity for the rearranging group could be controlled by the reaction sequence. The asymmetric spiroannulation together with the subsequent aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement enabled a divergent access to dearomatized indole derivatives with either a C3&#8208; or a C2quaternary stereocenter.</dc:description>

         <title>Intercalation&#8208;Activated Layered MoO3 Nanobelts as Biodegradable Nanozymes for Tumor&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The existence of natural van der Waals gaps in layered materials allows them to be easily intercalated with varying guest species, offering an appealing strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties and application performance. Herein, we report the activation of layered MoO3 nanobelts via aqueous intercalation as an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy. The long MoO3 nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na+ and H2O to obtain the short Na+/H2O co&#8208;intercalated MoO3 nanobelts (NH&#8208;MoO3). In contrast to the inert MoO3 nanobelts, the NH&#8208;MoO3 nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064 nm laser irradiation. Thus, after bovine serum albumin modification, the NH&#8208;MoO3 nanobelts can efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro and eliminate tumors in vivo facilitating with 1064 nm laser irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonate/Phosphine Oxide Dyad Additive for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive plays critical role for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we report a novel phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad molecular additive (PE&#8208;TPPO), with unique dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, to boost the device efficiency of metal&#8208;halide perovskites. In addition to the defect passivation effect of the phosphine oxide group to enhance the photoluminescence intensity and homogeneity of perovskite film, the phosphonate group with strong electron affinity can capture the injected electrons to increase local carrier concentration and accelerate carrier radiative recombination in electroluminescence process. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, quasi&#8208;two dimensional green PeLEDs modified by this dyad additive exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 25.1%, 100.5 cd/A, and 98.7 lm/W, which are among the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma Induced Nanocrystalline Domain Engineering and Surface Passivation in Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous materials is key to realizing high&#8208;performance chemical and biological sensors and optoelectronics. However, minimizing the surface oxidation and enhancing the domain size without affecting the porous nanoarchitecture are daunting challenges. Herein, we report a hybrid technique that combines bottom&#8208;up electrochemical growth with top&#8208;down plasma treatment to produce mesoporous semiconductors with large crystalline domain sizes and excellent surface passivation. By passivating unsaturated bonds without incorporating any chemical or physical layers, these films showed better stability and enhancement in the optoelectronic properties of mesoporous copper telluride (CuTe) with different pore diameters. These results provide exciting opportunities for the development of long&#8208;term, stable, and high&#8208;performance mesoporous semiconductor materials for future technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Platinum Supernanoparticles for Urinary Microfluidic Monitoring of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor&#8208;specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar&#8208;chart chip (V&#8208;Chip) for point&#8208;of&#8208;care analysis. The V&#8208;Chip signals of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow&#8208;up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Depositing Molecular Graphene Nanoribbons on Ag(111) by Electrospray &#8208; Controlled Ion Beam Deposition: Self&#8208;assembly and On&#8208;Surface Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical processing of low dimensional carbon nanostructures is crucial for their integration in future devices. Here we apply a new methodology in atomically precise engineering by combining multistep solution synthesis of N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with mass&#8208;selected ultra&#8208;high vacuum electrospray &#8208; controlled ion beam deposition on surfaces and real space visualisation by scanning tunnelling microscopy. We demonstrate how this method yields solely a controllable amount of single, otherwise unsublimable, GNRs of 2.9 nm length on a planar Ag(111) surface. This methodology allows for further processing by employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols and exploiting the reactivity of the substrate. Following multiple chemical transformations, the GNRs provide reactive building blocks to form extended, metal&#8208;organic coordination polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic FeMo(Se, Te) as Joint Electron Pool Promoting    Nitrogen   Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has been long believed that FeMoS structure, where Fe is bonded with S, plays a pivotal role as a biomimetic catalyst for  electrochemical nitrogen (N  2  ) fixation  . Nevertheless, the structure of Fe bonded to heavier analogues (Se or Te) has never been explored for N  2  electrofixation.  Here, we theoretically  predict the electronic structure of FeMo(Se, Te)  composed of tri&#8208;coordinated Fe species with open shells for binding with Se, which forms a collective electron pool for promoting N  2  activation. Guided by this interesting prediction, we then demonstrate a two&#8208;step procedure to synthesize such structures, which displays remarkable N  2  electrofixation activities with ammonia yield of 72.54 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  &#8208;1  and Faradic efficiency of 51.67% that are more than three times of the FeMoS counterpart. Further mechanism study has been conducted through density function theory (DFT) simulations. This work would provide new clues for designing versatile electrocatalytic materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Unlike many reactions of their six&#8208;membered ring counterparts, the reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates are highly diastereoselective.

The stereoselectivity arises from torsional and steric interactions that develop when electrophiles approach the diastereotopic &#960;&#8208;faces of the enolates, which are differentiated by subtle differences in the orientation of nearby atoms of the ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of an Autocatalytic Hybridization Assembly Circuit for Amplified In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lowly expressed analyte in complex cytoplasmic milieu necessitates the development of non&#8208;enzymatic autocatalytic DNA circuits with high amplification and anti&#8208;interference performance. Herein, we engineered a versatile and robust stimuli&#8208;responsive autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit for high performance  in vivo  bioanalysis. Under a moderately confined condition, the initiator motivated the autonomous and cooperative cross&#8208;activation of cascade hybridization reaction and catalytic DNA assembly for generating an exponentially amplified readout without the parasite steric hindrance and random diffusion side effects.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lowly expressed analyte in complex cytoplasmic milieu necessitates the development of non-enzymatic autocatalytic DNA circuits with high amplification and anti-interference performance. Herein, we engineered a versatile and robust stimuli-responsive autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit for high performance  in vivo  bioanalysis. Under a moderately confined condition, the initiator motivated the autonomous and cooperative cross-activation of cascade hybridization reaction and catalytic DNA assembly for generating an exponentially amplified readout without the parasite steric hindrance and random diffusion side effects. The AHA circuit was systematically investigated by a series of experimental studies and theoretical simulations. The successively guaranteed target-recognition and synergistically accelerated signal-amplification enables the sensitive and selective detection of analyte, and realized the robust miRNA imaging in living cells and mice. This autocatalytic DNA circuit could substantially expand the toolbox for accurate diagnosis and programmable therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topochemical Synthesis of a Heterochiral Peptide Polymer in Different Polymorphic Forms from Crystals and Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have designed a heterochiral dipeptide monomer (N  3  &#8208;D&#8208;Ala&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH  2  C&#8801;CH), modified with  &#160;  azide and alkyne at its termini for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. We obtained two different polymorphs; PI (P2  1  ) from DCM&#8208;toluene mixture, and PII (P&#8208;1) from hexane&#8208;ethyl acetate mixture. PI adopts parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing and PII adopts anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing. In both the cases, molecules from adjacent &#946;&#8208;stacks are arranged in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner. On heating, both the polymorphs undergo TAAC reaction to form linear polymers having parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like ordering (PI) and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure (PII). PI reacted spontaneously at room temperature and the crystals showed cracking after the reaction, but PII was intact even after complete reaction. The dipeptide congeals various solvents and the aerogels are identical to PI. These aerogels also underwent spontaneous TAAC reaction at r.t. yielding pseudoprotein having alternate D&#8208; and L&#8208; amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Ionic Liquid in Copper Electrocatalyst for Improving CO2 Conversion to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of CO2  to valuable fuels is appealing for CO2  fixation and energy storage. The Cu&#8208;based catalysts feature unique superiorities, but achieving high ethylene selectivity is still restricted. In this study, we propose the anchoring of ionic liquid (IL) on Cu electrocatalyst for improving the electrochemical CO2  reduction to ethylene. In water&#8208;based electrolyte and a commonly used H&#8208;type cell, a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 77.3% was achieved at &#8208;1.49 V (  vs  . RHE). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that IL can modify the electronic structure of Cu catalyst through its interaction with Cu, which are more conducive to *CO dimerization for ethylene formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Overlooked Factors Required for Electrolyte Solvents in Li&#8208;O2&#160;Battery: Capabilities of Quenching 1O2&#160;and Forming Highly&#8208;decomposable Li2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although sufficient tolerance against attack by superoxide radicals (O  2  &#8208;  ) has been mainly recognized as an important property for Li&#8211;O  2&#160;  battery (LOB) electrolytes, recent evidence has revealed that other critical factors also govern the cyclability, prompting a reconsideration of the basic design guidelines of LOB electrolytes. Here, we found that LOBs equipped with a  N,N&#8208;  dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited better cyclability compared with other standard LOB electrolytes. This superior cyclability is attributable to the capabilities of quenching  1  O  2  and forming highly decomposable Li  2  O  2  . The  1  O  2  quenching capability is equivalent to that of a tetraglyme&#8208;based electrolyte containing a several millimolar concentration of a typical chemical quencher. Based on these advantageous properties, the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte led to superior cyclability despite its lower O  2  &#8208;  tolerance. Thus, the present work provides a novel design guideline for the development of LOB electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of diarylphosphines and  O  &#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamines is developed. In the cases of symmetrical diarylphosphines, a series of aminophosphinites is prepared in high yields. In the cases of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines, an array of  P  &#8208;chiral aminophosphinites is synthesized by using copper(I)&#8208;(  R  ,  R  P  )&#8208;Ph&#8208;FOXAP complex as a chiral catalyst in high yields with high enantioselectivity. Based on several control experiments and  31  P NMR studies, a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism involving the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines is proposed for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction. Finally, one representative  P  &#8208;chiral phosphoric amide generated through the oxidation with H  2  O  2  is transformed to chiral diarylphosphinate in high yields with maintained enantioselectivity, which allows further transformations towards various  P  &#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry MOF&#8208;Based Patchy Colloids and Their Precise Linking via Site&#8208;Selective Liquid Bridging to Form Supra&#8208;Colloidal and Supra&#8208;Framework Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;symmetry, MOF&#8208;based patchy colloids are reported, which carry both shape and chemical information that enables precise directional colloidal assembly, producing hierarchical, multicomponent, and supra&#8208;framework architectures with unprecedented control over the position, rotation, and orientation of the constituent building blocks.







Abstract
Colloids with surface patches (or patchy particles) can bind and assemble with directionality. However, the bonding between the usually high&#8208;symmetry, dome&#8208;shaped patches is not precise, as it cannot lock the exact position and orientation of the relevant particles. This issue prevents the assembly of well&#8208;defined colloidal superstructures by design. Herein, we introduce low&#8208;symmetry, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based patchy colloids, which feature a polyhedral matrix and flat hexagonal patches, along with anisotropic surfaces and compositions. Guided by the encoded shape/chemical information and mediated by a site&#8208;selective liquid&#8208;bridging interaction, the distinct patchy particles self&#8208;assemble into supra&#8208;colloidal (or supra&#8208;framework) structures with unprecedented precision. In this case, the valence, position, and orientation of the particles within assemblies are fully coordinated and precisely aligned. The dynamic nature of the liquid bridges also allows us to investigate the unique assembly kinetics. Our strategy not only defines new modes of colloidal bonding, but also provides a powerful means toward creating hierarchical and multi&#8208;component MOF materials.

         <title>A Phenanthrocarbazole&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymer with Noncovalent Conformational Locking for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) based on the phenanthrocarbazole derivative PC6 features a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated phenanthrocarbazole and S&#8208;O noncovalent conformational locking. Perovskite solar cells employing PC6 as a dopant&#8208;free HTM afforded an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.2&#8201;% and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Adequate hole mobility is the prerequisite for dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs).

&lt;p&gt;A polymeric hole-transport material (HTM) based on the phenanthrocarbazole derivative &lt;b&gt;PC6&lt;/b&gt; features a two-dimensionally conjugated phenanthrocarbazole and S-O noncovalent conformational locking. Perovskite solar cells employing &lt;b&gt;PC6&lt;/b&gt; as a dopant-free HTM afforded an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.2&#8201;% and long-term stability.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adequate hole mobility is the prerequisite for dopant-free polymeric hole-transport materials (HTMs). Constraining the configurational variation of polymer chains to afford a rigid and planar backbone can reduce unfavorable reorganization energy and improve hole mobility. Herein, a noncovalent conformational locking via S&#8211;O secondary interaction is exploited in a phenanthrocarbazole (&lt;b&gt;PC&lt;/b&gt;) based polymeric HTM, &lt;b&gt;PC6&lt;/b&gt;, to fix the molecular geometry and significantly reduce reorganization energy. Systematic studies on structurally explicit repeats to targeted polymers reveals that the broad and planar backbone of &lt;b&gt;PC&lt;/b&gt; remarkably enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of adjacent polymers, facilitating intermolecular charge transfer greatly. The inserted &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; oxygen atoms passivate the trap sites efficiently at the perovskite/HTM interface and further suppress interfacial recombination. Consequently, a PSC employing &lt;b&gt;PC6&lt;/b&gt; as a dopant-free HTM offers an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.2&#8201;% and significantly improved longevity, rendering it as one of the best PSCs based on dopant-free HTMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Watching Microwave&#8208;Induced Microscopic Hot Spots via the Thermosensitive Fluorescence of Europium/Terbium Mixed&#8208;Metal Organic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;induced micro&#8208;hot spots were detected in liquid solutions through fluorescence thermometers attached on microwave&#8208;absorbing carbon particles. The fluorescent experiments confirmed the established microwave&#8208;irradiated energy&#8208;transfer model, whose results can guide precise control and optimization of conditions in microwave chemistry.







Abstract
The hypothesis of microscopic hot spots is widely used to explain the unique microwave (MW) effect in materials science and chemical engineering, but it has not yet been directly measured. Herein we use Eu/Tb mixed&#8208;metal organic complexes as nano thermometers to probe the intrinsic temperature of MW&#8208;absorbing particles in MW fields based on the thermosensitive fluorescent spectra. According to the measurements of the temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interphase, we derive an MW&#8208;irradiated energy transfer model to predict the extent of microscopic hot spots. The fluorescence results agree with the model predictions that the MW&#8208;induced temperature gradient can be enlarged by increasing MW intensity, as well as the dielectric loss and size of particles. Conversely, the increase in the thermal conductivity and the dielectric loss of the liquid lowers the temperature gradient. This study enables control of MW&#8208;assisted synthesis and MW&#8208;responsive techniques.

         <title>Stereoselective O&#8208;Glycosylations by Pyrylium Salt Organocatalysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosylation method for non&#8208;specialists: Commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective glycosylation reactions with trichloroacetimidate electrophiles. A wide range of phenolic nucleophiles are compatible with the procedure. The standard conditions involve mixing three components at ambient conditions and proceed with minimal formation of undesired by&#8208;products.







Abstract
Despite many years of invention, the field of carbohydrate chemistry remains rather inaccessible to non&#8208;specialists, which limits the scientific impact and reach of the discoveries made in the field. Aiming to increase the availability of stereoselective glycosylation chemistry for non&#8208;specialists, we have discovered that several commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective O&#8208;glycosylations of a wide range of phenols and alkyl alcohols. This catalytic reaction utilizes trichloroacetimidates, an easily accessible and synthetically proven electrophile, takes place under air and only initiates when all three reagents are mixed, which should provide better reproducibility by non&#8208;specialists. The reaction exhibits varying degrees of stereospecificity, resulting in &#946;&#8208;selective glycosylations from &#945;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates, whilst an &#945;&#8208;selective glycosylation proceeds from &#946;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates. A mechanistic study revealed that the reaction likely proceeds via an SN2&#8208;like substitution on the protonated electrophile.

         <title>Radiation Chemistry Provides Nanoscopic Insights into the Role of Intermediate Phases in CeO2 Mesocrystal Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of radiation chemistry, different stages of CeO2 mesocrystal formation are revealed. The nucleation and growth of the primary particles, followed by their self&#8208;assembly into mesocrystals, occur inside a hydrated CeIV hydroxide phase. The hydroxide forms as the initial phase and serves as an intermediate in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation. Mesocrystals can be used as buildings blocks for designing complex hierarchical structures.







Abstract
The role of intermediate phases in CeO2 mesocrystal formation from aqueous CeIII solutions subjected to &#947;&#8208;radiation was studied. Radiolytically formed hydroxyl radicals convert soluble CeIII into less soluble CeIV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of samples from different stages of the process allowed the identification of several stages in CeO2 mesocrystal evolution following the oxidation to CeIV: (1)&#8197;formation of hydrated CeIV hydroxides, serving as intermediates in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transformation; (2)&#8197;CeO2 primary particle growth inside the intermediate phase; (3)&#8197;alignment of the primary particles into &#8220;pre&#8208;mesocrystals&#8221; and subsequently to mesocrystals, guided by confinement of the amorphous intermediate phase and accompanied by the formation of &#8220;mineral bridges&#8221;. Further alignment of the obtained mesocrystals into supracrystals occurs upon slow drying, making it possible to form complex hierarchical architectures.

         <title>Dianion and Dication of Tetracyclopentatetraphenylene as Decoupled Annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;Annulene Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dianion and dication of a tetracyclopentatetraphenylene derivative were generated and investigated as the annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;annulene models. Experiments based on X&#8208;ray crystallography and 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MCD spectroscopies indicate that the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled, strongly supporting the theoretically predicted structures.







Abstract
The dianion and dication of tetramesityl&#8208;substituted tetracyclopentatetraphenylene, a circulene consisting of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings, have been generated by reduction with alkali metals and oxidation with antimony(V) halides, respectively. They are theoretically predicted to adopt double annulenoid structures called annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;annulene models in which the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled. The theoretical structures were experimentally proven by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses and the electronic configurations were supported by MCD spectra. Based on the 13C NMR chemical shifts, negative and positive charges are shown to be located mainly at the outer periphery, indicating that the dianion and dication have delocalized 22&#8208;&#960; and 18&#8208;&#960; electron outer perimeters, respectively, and 8&#8208;&#960; electron structure at the inner ring. Notably, the dianion has an open&#8208;shell character, whereas the dication has a closed&#8208;shell ground state.

         <title>Scalable Molten Salt Synthesis of Platinum Alloys Planted in Metal&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Graphene for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8722;Co nanoalloys planted in the metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;graphene system achieved by a scalable molten salt pyrolysis method demonstrate improved activity and stability for oxygen reduction through a synergistic effect among multiple active sites and a strong metal&#8211;support interaction.







Abstract
Fuel cells are considered as a promising alternative to the existing traditional energy systems towards a sustainable future. Nevertheless, the synthesis of efficient and robust platinum (Pt) based catalysts remains a challenge for practical applications. In this work, we present a simple and scalable molten&#8208;salt synthesis method for producing a low&#8208;platinum (Pt) nanoalloy implanted in metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;graphene. The as&#8208;prepared low&#8208;Pt alloyed graphene exhibits a high oxygen reduction activity of 1.29&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and excellent durability over 30&#8201;000 potential cycles. The catalyst nanoarchitecture of graphene encased Pt nanoalloy provides a robust capability against nanoparticle migration and corrosion due to a strong metal&#8211;support interaction. Similarly, advanced characterization and theoretical calculations show that the multiple active sites in platinum alloyed graphene synergistically account for the improved oxygen reduction. This work not only provides an efficient and robust low&#8208;Pt catalyst but also a facile design idea and scalable preparation technique for integrated catalysts to achieve more profound applications in fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>A DNA Nanocomplex Containing Cascade DNAzymes and Promoter&#8208;Like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite for Combined Gene/Chemo&#8208;dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanocomplex containing cascade DNAzymes and promoter&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite was synthesized. The promoter&#8208;like ZMF decomposed in response to intratumoral glutathione to release a sufficient quantity of metal ions, thus promoting cascade DNA/RNA cleavage and free radical generation, and achieving combined gene/chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy.







Abstract
Sequential control of exogenous chemical events inside cells is a promising way to regulate cell functions and fate. Herein we report a DNA nanocomplex containing cascade DNAzymes and promoter&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite (ZMF), achieving combined gene/chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy. The promoter&#8208;like ZMF decomposed in response to intratumoral glutathione to release a sufficient quantity of metal ions, thus promoting cascade DNA/RNA cleavage and free radical generation. Two kinds of DNAzymes were designed for sequential cascade enzymatic reaction, in which metal ions functioned as cofactors. The primary DNAzyme self&#8208;cleaved the DNA chain with Zn2+ as cofactor, and produced the secondary DNAzyme; the secondary DNAzyme afterwards cleaved the EGR&#8208;1 mRNA, and thus downregulated the expression of target EGR&#8208;1 protein, achieving DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy. Meanwhile, the released Zn2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ induced Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions, during which free radicals were catalytically generated and efficient chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy was achieved. In a breast cancer mouse model, the administration of DNA nanocomplex led to a significant therapeutic efficacy of tumor growth suppression.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Melt&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of polythiourethane soft actuators based on liquid crystal and thiourethane segments has been developed by a one&#8208;pot approach. The formation of well&#8208;defined thiourethane segments affords supramolecular cross&#8208;links through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions yielding materials that can be reprocessed and reprogrammed into arbitrary 3D shapes. A detailed understanding and characterization of the developed material are presented.







Abstract
The application of reprocessable and reprogrammable soft actuators is limited by the synthetic strategies, 3D&#8208;shaping capabilities, and small deformations. In this work, melt&#8208;processable supramolecular soft actuators based on segmented copolymers containing thiourethane and liquid crystal segments have been prepared via sequential thiol addition reactions in a one&#8208;pot approach using commercially available building blocks. The actuators demonstrated immediate, reversible response and weightlifting capabilities with large deformations up to 32&#8201;%. Through exploiting the supramolecular cross&#8208;links, the material could be recycled and reprogrammed into 3D actuators and welded into an actuator assembly with different deformation modes. Our work offers a one&#8208;pot synthesis and straightforward melt&#8208;processable approach to prepare supramolecular soft actuators with large deformations that can be reprocessed and reprogrammed into arbitrary 3D shapes.

         <title>Single&#8208;Bonded Cubic AsN from High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Chemical Reactivity of Arsenic and Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cubic arsenic nitride was synthesized from arsenic and nitrogen under high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions using a laser heated diamond anvil cell. The crystalline structure of AsN (P213), in which every As atom is single&#8208;bonded to three N atoms and vice versa, was determined by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction. The discovery of AsN is relevant to the fundamental chemistry of pnictogens and to synthesis of new advanced materials.







Abstract
Chemical reactivity between As and N2, leading to the synthesis of crystalline arsenic nitride, is here reported under high pressure and high temperature conditions generated by laser heating in a diamond anvil cell. Single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at different pressures between 30 and 40&#8197;GPa provides evidence for the synthesis of a covalent compound of AsN stoichiometry, crystallizing in a cubic P213 space group, in which each of the two elements is single&#8208;bonded to three atoms of the other and hosts an electron lone pair, in a tetrahedral anisotropic coordination. The identification of characteristic structural motifs highlights the key role played by the directional repulsive interactions between non&#8208;bonding electron lone pairs in the formation of the AsN structure. Additional data indicate the existence of AsN at room temperature from 9.8 up to 50&#8197;GPa. Implications concern fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and the synthesis of innovative advanced materials.

         <title>Synthetic Silica Nano&#8208;Organelles for Regulation of Cascade Reactions in Multi&#8208;Compartmentalized Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic silica nano&#8208;organelles designed to regulate kinetics and pathway selection in enzymatic cascade reactions are reported. Like cell organelles, synthetic nano&#8208;organelles can be combined to create integrated systems. Multicompartmentalized synthetic cells were built using synthetic nano&#8208;organelles and giant polymeric vesicles.







Abstract
In eukaryotic cells, enzymes are compartmentalized into specific organelles so that different reactions and processes can be performed efficiently and with a high degree of control. In this work, we show that these features can be artificially emulated in robust synthetic organelles constructed using an enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization strategy. We describe an in&#8197;situ encapsulation approach that allows enzymes to be loaded into silica nanoreactors in well&#8208;defined compositions. The nanoreactors can be combined into integrated systems to produce a desired reaction outcome. We used the selective enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization and nanoreactor integration to regulate competitive cascade reactions and to modulate the kinetics of sequential reactions involving multiple nanoreactors. Furthermore, we show that the nanoreactors can be efficiently loaded into giant polymer vesicles, resulting in multi&#8208;compartmentalized microreactors.

         <title>Titanocene(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Precision Deuteration of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>

Titanocene catalysis delivers D to the more substituted C&#8208;atom of epoxides with high efficiency, deuterium incorporation, and stereoselectivity. A novel method of catalyst activation that prevents isotope scrambling warrants the excellent performance of the reaction.







Abstract
We describe a titanocene(III)&#8208;catalyzed deuterosilylation of epoxides that provides &#946;&#8208;deuterated anti&#8208;Markovnikov alcohols with excellent D&#8208;incorporation, in high yield, and often excellent diastereoselectivity after desilylation. The key to the success of the reaction is a novel activation method of Cp2TiCl2 and (tBuC5H4)2TiCl2 with BnMgBr and PhSiD3 to provide [(RC5H4)2Ti(III)D] without isotope scrambling. It was developed after discovering an off&#8208;cycle scrambling with the previously described method. Our precision deuteration can be applied to the synthesis of drug precursors and highlights the power of combining radical chemistry with organometallic catalysis.

         <title>A Supramolecular Polymer Constituted of Antiaromatic NiII Norcorroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular polymer that consists of an antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;system as the monomer has been created. An amide&#8208;functionalized NiII norcorrole derivative forms a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The formation of a long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking array ensures the persistency of the conducting pathway against thermal perturbation and achieves high charge&#8208;carrier mobility along the tightly&#8208;bound linear aggregates.







Abstract
For the creation of next&#8208;generation organic electronic materials, the integration of &#960;&#8208;systems has recently become a central theme. Such functional materials can be assembled by supramolecular polymerization when aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems are used as monomers, and the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymer strongly depend on the electronic structure of the monomers. Here, we demonstrate the construction of a supramolecular polymer consisting of an antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;system as the monomer. An amide&#8208;functionalized NiII norcorrole derivative formed a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, ensuring the persistency of the conducting pathway against thermal perturbation, which results in higher charge mobility along the tightly bound linear aggregates than that of the aromatic analogue composed of ZnII porphyrins.

         <title>Oriented Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Ion Flux and Smart Gating Nanofluidic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework membranes that offer vertically aligned nanofluidic channel arrays, leading to an ultrahigh ion flux and pH&#8208;gating nanofluidic transport.







Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport holds high promise in bio&#8208;sensing and energy conversion applications. However, smart nanofluidic devices with high ion flux and modulable ion transport capabilities remain to be realised. Herein, we demonstrate smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (2D COF) membranes with vertically aligned nanochannel arrays that achieved a 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher ion flux compared with that of conventional single&#8208;channel nanofluidic devices. The surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion conductance is dominant for electrolyte concentration up to 0.01&#8197;M. Moreover, owing to the customisable pH&#8208;responsivity of imine and phenol hydroxyl groups, the COF&#8208;DT membranes attained an actively modulable ion transport with a high pH&#8208;gating on/off ratio of &#8776;100. The customisable structure and rich chemistry of COF materials will offer a promising platform for manufacturing nanofluidic devices with modifiable ion/molecular transport features.

Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) between organic tris&#8208;carboxylates and tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands afforded an Archimedean solid (truncated tetrahedron) and a double&#8208;walled tetrahedron featuring a ravel topology. The results demonstrate the promising ability of tris&#8208;carboxylates as new anion coordination centers in constructing novel topologies on account of the modifiable size and function of these organic anions.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) is showing increasing power in the construction of anionic supramolecular architectures. Herein, by expanding the anion centers from oxoanion (phosphate or sulfate) to organic tris&#8208;carboxylates, an Archimedean solid (truncated tetrahedron) and a highly entangled, double&#8208;walled tetrahedron featuring a ravel topology have been assembled with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands. The results demonstrate the promising ability of tris&#8208;carboxylates as new anion coordination centers in constructing novel topologies with increasing complexity and diversity compared to phosphate or sulfate ions on account of the modifiable size and easy functionalization character of these organic anions.

         <title>Design and Development of a Bioorthogonal, Visualizable and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a triple&#8208;functional H2S delivery system, which is triggered by the bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction between a newly designed diphenylamino&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) and a strained alkyne. This COS&#8208;based H2S release platform can realize in&#8208;mitochondria H2S release in a controllable manner, and provide a concomitant fluorescence for spatiotemporal feedback of the exogenous H2S in cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important endogenous gasotransmitter, but the targeted delivery and real&#8208;time feedback of exogenous H2S are still challenging. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) compound, which can react with a strained alkyne via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to generate carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the precursor of H2S, and a thiophene derivative with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Moreover, the diphenylamino substituent in DTO greatly increases the mitochondrial targeting of this H2S delivery system. Such a bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has integrated three functions in one system for the first time: (1)&#8197;in situ controllable H2S release, (2)&#8197;concomitant fluorescence response, and (3)&#8197;mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential loss alleviation by using this system in H9c2 cells under oxidative stress.

Moreover, the diphenylamino substituent in DTO greatly increases the mitochondrial targeting of this H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S delivery system. Such a bioorthogonal click-and-release reaction has integrated three functions in one system for the first time: (1)&#8197;in situ controllable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release, (2)&#8197;concomitant fluorescence response, and (3)&#8197;mitochondria-targeted delivery. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential loss alleviation by using this system in H9c2 cells under oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This work reports the novel example of linear non&#8208;conjugated polyester exhibiting yellow&#8208;green clusteroluminescence and a high quantum yield of 38&#8201;%. The formation of ester&#8208;unit cluster is responsible for the emission and is decided by balancing flexible and rigid structures of chains.







Abstract
Preparation of non&#8208;conjugated polymers with long&#8208;wavelength emission and high quantum yield (QY) is still a huge challenge. Herein, we report the first example of linear non&#8208;conjugated polyester exhibiting yellow&#8211;green clusteroluminescence (CL) and a high QY of 38&#8201;%. We discovered that the polyester P3 with balanced flexibility and rigidity showed the longest CL wavelength and highest QY. Systematically photophysical characterization unravel the key role of ester cluster in the CL and the cluster formation via the aggregate of ester units was visualized. Moreover, P3 was demonstrated to be a highly selective, quick&#8208;responsive (ca. 1.2&#8197;min) and sensitive detector (detection limit is 0.78&#8197;&#956;M) for irons owing to the fast disassociation of clusters by irons. This work not only gains further mechanistic insight into CL but also provides a new strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;wavelength CL, meanwhile, enlightens the glorious application prospect of luminescent polyester.

         <title>Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for the Chemiresistive Detection of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isorecticular and heterobimetallic two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks achieves chemiresistive sensing of ppm concentrations of carbon monoxide at low power. Spectroscopic techniques and computational methods, along with comparative experiments, suggest the contribution of Cu nodes to CO binding and the essential role of metallophthalocyanine units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.







Abstract
This paper describes the demonstration of a series of heterobimetallic, isoreticular 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metallophthalocyanine (MPc, M=Co and Ni) units interconnected by Cu nodes towards low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensing of ppm levels of carbon monoxide (CO). Devices achieve a sub&#8208;part&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) limit of detection (LOD) of 0.53&#8197;ppm toward CO at a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V. MPc&#8208;based Cu&#8208;linked MOFs can continuously detect CO at 50&#8197;ppm, the permissible exposure limit required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), for multiple exposures, and realize CO detection in air and in humid environment. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and comparison experiments suggest the contribution of Cu nodes to CO binding and the essential role of MPc units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.

         <title>A Ni0 &#963;&#8208;Borane Complex Bearing a Rigid Bidentate Borane/Phosphine Ligand: Boryl Complex Formation by Oxidative Dehydrochloroborylation and Catalytic Activity for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a rigid bidentate borane/phosphine ligand was explored within the background of statistical olefin copolymerization with group 10 metals. During this work, a mild oxidative dehydrochloroborylation reaction was found to convert different Ni0 &#963;&#8208;borane complexes into NiII boryl chloride complexes. This new ligand also allows the nickel catalyzed polymerization of ethylene, a first for a B&#8208;donor in group 10 olefin polymerization.







Abstract
While of interest, synthetically feasible access to boryl ligands and complexes remains limited, meaning such complexes remain underexploited in catalysis. For bidentate boryl ligands, oxidative addition of boranes to low&#8208;valent IrI or Pt0 are the only examples yet reported. As part of our interest in developing improved group 10 ethylene polymerization catalysts, we present here an optimized synthesis of a novel, rigid borane/phosphine ligand and its Ni0 &#963;&#8208;borane complex. From the latter, an unprecedented oxidative dehydrochloroborylation, to give a NiII boryl complex, was achieved. Furthermore, this new B/P ligand allowed the nickel&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of ethylene, which suggests that Ni0 &#963;&#8208;hydroborane complexes act as masked NiII boryl hydride reagents.

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of Polymerized Dioxolane as Solid Electrolyte and its Thermal Decomposition Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnF2 is an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL and also an effective additive for improving the interfacial wettability with Li&#8208;metal, of benefit in reaching the dendrite free and dense Li&#8208;deposition in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells. However, P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE tends to be thermally decomposed at 110&#8201;&#176;C with the formation of formaldehyde gas and other epoxides, restricting the operating temperature window of P&#8208;DOL based electrolytes.







Abstract
Polymerized&#8208;dioxolane(P&#8208;DOL) is of potential as a solid&#8208;polymer&#8208;electrolyte(SPE) due to its high Li+&#8208;conductivity, good compatibility with Li&#8208;metal and desired preparation method of in situ polymerization in cells. In this study, SnF2 was demonstrated not only to be an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL at room temperature, but also an effective additive for improving interfacial wettability and suppressing dendrite through the reaction with Li&#8208;metal and the formation of LiF/LixSn based composite solid electrolyte interlayer(SEI). Using the SnF2 polymerized P&#8208;DOL containing 1&#8197;M LiTFSI as SPE(P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE), obviously denser Li&#8208;deposition was obtained, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) Li/LiFePO4 cell delivered stable cycling over 350 cycles at 45&#8201;&#176;C. At the same time, the irreversible decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE into formaldehyde and small molecule epoxides are observed at 110&#8201;&#176;C, which is even initiated at lower temperature of 40&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum. This thermal decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE in pouch cell causes huge volume swell, and therefore putting a strict limitation on the operating temperature window for the P&#8208;DOL based electrolytes.

         <title>Circular Permutated PQQ&#8208;Glucose Dehydrogenase as an Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circular permutation of PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase creates an artificial allosteric enzyme controlled by ligand binding to N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal domains. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays.







Abstract
Protein biosensors play an increasingly important role as reporters for research and clinical applications. Here we present an approach for the construction of fully integrated but modular electrochemical biosensors based on the principal component of glucose monitors PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ&#8208;GDH). We designed allosterically regulated circular permutated variants of PQQ&#8208;GDH that show large (&gt;10&#8208;fold) changes in enzymatic activity following intramolecular scaffolding of the newly generated N&#8208; and C termini by ligand binding domain/ligand complexes. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays. For instance, the concentration of Cyclosporine&#8197;A could be measured in 1&#8197;&#956;L of undiluted blood with the same accuracy as the leading diagnostic technique that uses 50 times more sample. We further used this biosensor to construct highly porous gold bioelectrodes capable of robustly detecting concentrations of Cyclosporine&#8197;A as low as 20&#8197;pM and retained functionality in samples containing at least 60&#8201;% human serum.

         <title>PDMS with Tunable Side Group Mobility and Its Highly Permeable Membrane for Removal of Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of phenyl side groups as rigid molecular spacers into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) imparted the methyl side groups with higher mobility and additional degrees of freedom for fast transport of aromatic compounds. Combined with the engineering design of the transport highway, the membrane achieved outstanding performance for aromatic removal.







Abstract
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), as the benchmark of organophilic membrane materials, still faces challenges for removal of aromatic compounds due to the undesirable transport channels. In this work, we propose to reconstruct the PDMS conformation with tunable side group mobility by introducing phenyl as rigid molecular spacer to relieve steric hindrance of large&#8208;sized aromatic molecules; meanwhile, polymer segments are loosely stacked to provide additional degrees of freedom as increasing the permeant size. Moreover, the reconstructed PDMS is engineered into the composite membrane with prevention of condensation of aromatic compounds in the substrate pores. The resulting thin&#8208;film composite membrane achieved one order of magnitude higher flux (11.8&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) with an equivalent separation factor (12.3) compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes for aromatic removal. The permeant&#8208;customized membrane molecular and microstructure designing strategy opens a new avenue to develop membranes for specific separation targets.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Ligation&#8208;Activated Fluorogenic FRET Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept for the transformation of the excellent tetrazine&#8208;ligation dependent fluorogenicity of blue&#8208;excitable cores to biologically preferable emission ranges is presented herein. Such relay mechanism resulted in improved yellow/red fluorogenicities together with increased photostabilities and large apparent Stokes&#8208;shifts. The presented fluorogenic dyads were utilized in multicolor single excitation imaging schemes and STED imaging as well.







Abstract
An energy transfer&#8208;based signal amplification relay concept enabling transmission of bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenicity of blue&#8208;excitable coumarins to yellow/red emitting cyanine frames is presented. Such relay mechanism resulted in improved cyanine fluorogenicities together with increased photostabilities and large apparent Stokes&#8208;shifts allowing lower background fluorescence even in no&#8208;wash bioorthogonal fluorogenic labeling schemes of intracellular structures in live cells. These energy transfer dyads sharing the same donor moiety together with their parent donor molecule allowed three&#8208;color imaging of intracellular targets using one single excitation source with separate emission windows. Sub&#8208;diffraction imaging of intracellular structures using the bioorthogonally activatable FRET dyads by STED microscopy is also presented.

         <title>Stabilizing Interface pH by N&#8208;Modified Graphdiyne for Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. We constructed a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface to stabilize pH by accelerating hydrated zinc ions desolvation, enabling the direct electron transfer from anode to Zn2+ (rather than the coordinated H2O). Operando pH detection reveals the pH stabilization. Zn&#8208;V6O13 battery works well at 20.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.07&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work highlights interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.







Abstract
Zn dendrite issue was intensively studied via tuning zinc ion flux. pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. Here, we construct a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface (NGI) to stabilize pH by mediating hydrated zinc ion desolvation. Operando pH detection reveals pH stabilization by NGI. This works with pores in NGI to achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and an increased symmetric cell lifespan by 116 times. Experimental and theoretical results owe pH stabilization to desolvation with a reduced activation energy achieved by electron transfer from solvation sheath to N atom. The efficient desolvation ensures that electron directly transfers from substrate to Zn2+ (rather than the coordinated H2O), avoiding O&#8722;H bond splitting. Hence, Zn&#8208;V6O13 battery achieves a long lifespan at 20.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.07&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work reveals the significance of interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.

         <title>Metallization&#8208;Prompted Robust Porphyrin&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic and computational studies on a series of porphyrinic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) reveal that metallization of porphyrin centers greatly alters the orbital overlap of the adjacent porphyrin, the geometry of the molecule/layer, and the strength of noncovalent interactions. Therefore, metalloporphyrin HOFs exhibit much higher stability, surface area, and catalytic activity than metal&#8208;free porphyrinic HOFs.







Abstract
Under topological guidance, the self&#8208;assembly process based on a tetratopic porphyrin synthon results in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with the predicted square layers topology (sql) but unsatisfied stability. Strikingly, simply introducing a transition metal in the porphyrin center does not change the network topology but drastically causes noticeable change on noncovalent interaction, orbital overlap, and molecular geometry, therefore ultimately giving rise to a series of metalloporphyrinic HOFs with high surface area, and excellent stability (intact after being soaked in boiling water, concentrated HCl, and heated to 270&#8201;&#176;C). On integrating both photosensitizers and catalytic sites into robust backbones, this series of HOFs can effectively catalyze the photoreduction of CO2 to CO, and their catalytic performances greatly depend on the chelated metal species in the porphyrin centers. This work enriches the library of stable functional HOFs and expands their applications in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Atomic Bridging Structure of Nickel&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>

The atomic bridging structure of nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon active sites confined in channel&#8208;rich porous carbon fibers enables the highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.







Abstract
To meet strategic applications, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemical molecules would be improved by the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed active sites. Herein an electrospun&#8208;pyrolysis cooperative strategy is presented to not only modulate the porous structure of the carbon support for favorable charge and mass transfer, but also adjust the bridging structure of atomically dispersed metal species. Typically, the experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique chemical structure of binuclear nickel bridging with nitrogen and carbon atoms (namely Ni2&#8722;N4&#8722;C2) tunes the electronic nature of the d&#8208;states for the optimal adsorption of carbon dioxide and intermediates, thus inducing the substantial enhancement of CO2 reduction via the thermodynamically more favorable pathway. The identification of such a structure demonstrates the large space to modulate the atomic bridging status for optimizing electrocatalysis.

         <title>Tunable Second&#8208;Level Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Solid Supramolecules between Acrylamide&#8211;Phenylpyridium Copolymers and Cucurbit[7]uril</title>

Solid supramolecules based on acrylamide&#8211;phenylpyridium copolymers with various substituent groups and cucurbit[7]uril not only exhibit tunable ultralong phosphorescence with lifetimes varying from 0.9&#8197;s to 2.2&#8197;s, but also co&#8208;assemble with organic dyes Eosin&#8197;Y or SR101 to display high&#8208;performance phosphorescence energy transfer with multicolor delayed fluorescence properties.







Abstract
A series of solid supramolecules based on acrylamide&#8211;phenylpyridium copolymers with various substituent groups (P&#8722;R: R=&#8722;CN, &#8722;CO2Et, &#8722;Me, &#8722;CF3) and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) are constructed to exhibit tunable second&#8208;level (from 0.9&#8197;s to 2.2&#8197;s) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the amorphous state. Compared with other solid supramolecules P&#8722;R/CB[7] (R=&#8722;CN, &#8722;CO2Et, &#8722;Me), P&#8722;CF3/CB[7] displays the longest lifetime (2.2&#8197;s), which is probably attributed to the fluorophilic interaction of cucurbiturils leading to a uncommon host&#8211;guest interaction between 4&#8208;phenylpyridium with &#8722;CF3 and CB[7]. Furthermore, the RTP solid supramolecular assembly (donors) can further react with organic dyes Eosin Y or SR101 (acceptors) to form ternary supramolecular systems featuring ultralong phosphorescence energy transfer (PpET) and visible delayed fluorescence (yellow for EY at 568&#8197;nm and red for SR101 at 620&#8197;nm). Significantly, the ultralong multicolor PpET supramolecular assembly can be further applied in fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption and painting.

         <title>A {Ni12}&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Coordinative Binding of Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO2 and NO2 on open NiII sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework (NKU&#8208;100) incorporating unprecedented {Ni12}&#8208;wheels has been achieved by in&#8197;situ synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Air pollution by SO2 and NO2 has caused significant risks on the environment and human health. Understanding the mechanism of active sites within capture materials is of fundamental importance to the development of new clean&#8208;up technologies. Here we report the crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO2 and NO2 on open NiII sites in a metal&#8208;organic framework (NKU&#8208;100) incorporating unprecedented {Ni12}&#8208;wheels; each wheel exhibits six open NiII sites on desolvation. Immobilised gas molecules are further stabilised by cooperative host&#8208;guest interactions comprised of hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and dipole interactions. At 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar, NKU&#8208;100 shows adsorption uptakes of 6.21 and 5.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SO2 and NO2, respectively. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have confirmed the selective retention of SO2 and NO2 at low concentrations under dry conditions. This work will inspire the future design of efficient sorbents for the capture of SO2 and NO2.

         <title>Azaphilones as Activation&#8208;Free Primary&#8208;Amine&#8208;Specific Bioconjugation Reagents for Peptides, Proteins and Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unique natural reaction of azaphilones with amines, an efficient, highly chemoselective and activation&#8208;free primary amine bioconjugation protocol has been developed and demonstrated in a variety of applications.







Abstract
Residue&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods for biomolecules are highly sought to expand the scope of their biological and medical applications. Inspired by the mechanism of the generation of natural vinylogous &#947;&#8208;pyridones (vPDNs), we have developed a novel unique azaphilone&#8208;based, activation&#8208;free primary&#8208;amine&#8208;selective bioconjugation method for biomolecules. Our strategy allows facile functionalization of primary amine groups in peptides and proteins, including the clinically used therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, by generating a highly stable vPDN linkage. Excellent chemoselectivity toward primary amines also enables the azaphilone derivatives to specifically modify the lipid components of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while bypassing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and mammalian cells. The new method shows significant advantages including chemoselectivity, efficiency, flexibility and biocompatibility, and therefore provides a valuable addition to the current toolbox for biomolecule conjugation.

         <title>Imaging Membrane Order and Dynamic Interactions in Living Cells with a DNA Zipper Probe</title>

Cholesterol&#8208;modified programmable DNA probes are developed to image transient interactions and membrane order in live cell membranes. The membrane order during the activation of T&#8208;cell receptor signaling has also been measured.







Abstract
The cell membrane is a dynamic and heterogeneous structure composed of distinct sub&#8208;compartments. Within these compartments, preferential interactions occur among various lipids and proteins. Currently, it is still challenging to image these short&#8208;lived membrane complexes, especially in living cells. In this work, we present a DNA&#8208;based probe, termed &#8220;DNA Zipper&#8221;, which allows the membrane order and pattern of transient interactions to be imaged in living cells using standard fluorescence microscopes. By fine&#8208;tuning the length and binding affinity of DNA duplex, these probes can precisely extend the duration of membrane lipid interactions via dynamic DNA hybridization. The correlation between membrane order and the activation of T&#8208;cell receptor signaling has also been studied. These programmable DNA probes function after a brief cell incubation, which can be easily adapted to study lipid interactions and membrane order during different membrane signaling events.

         <title>Highly Durable and Fully Dispersed Cobalt Diatomic Site Catalysts for CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co dual&#8208;atom catalysts were used for CO2 reduction with superior CH4 selectivity. The charge at the inserted Co2 active sites in tri&#8208;3s&#8208;triazine was enriched as compared to that at Co single sites, thus promoting a lower activation energy barrier by stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* and CHO* intermediates.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining the advantages of single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts, such as almost 100&#8201;% atomic efficiency and excellent hydrocarbon selectivity. In this study, cobalt&#8208;based atom site catalysts with a Co2&#8211;N coordination structure were synthesized and used for photodriven CO2 reduction. The resulting CoDAC containing 3.5&#8201;% Co atoms demonstrated a superior atom ratio for CO2 reduction catalytic performance, with 65.0&#8201;% CH4 selectivity, which far exceeds that of cobalt&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (CoSACs). The intrinsic reason for the superior activity of CoDACs is the excellent adsorption strength of CO2 and CO* intermediates at dimeric Co active sites.

         <title>Unraveling the Electrical and Magnetic Properties of Layered Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework With Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unambiguous structural elucidation using microcrystal electron diffraction provides insight into unique properties of a layered conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Cu3(C6O6)2. The presence of strong interlayer electronic coupling exerts a profound effect on the electrical and magnetic properties of the MOF.







Abstract
This paper describes structural elucidation of a layered conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) material Cu3(C6O6)2 by microcrystal electron diffraction with sub&#8208;angstrom precision. This insight enables the first identification of an unusual &#960;&#8208;stacking interaction in a layered MOF material characterized by an extremely short (2.73&#8197;&#197;) close packing of the ligand arising from pancake bonding and ordered water clusters within pores. Band structure analysis suggests semiconductive properties of the MOF, which are likely related to the localized nature of pancake bonds and the formation of a singlet dimer of the ligand. The spin of CuII within the Kagom&#233; arrangement dominates the paramagnetism of the MOF, leading to strong geometrical magnetic frustration.

         <title>M&#246;bius ZnII&#8208;Hexaphyrins Bearing a Chiral Coordinating Arm: A Chiroptical Switch Featuring P/M Twist Inversion Controlled by Achiral Effectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far can the dynamic chirality of M&#246;bius hexaphyrins be controlled lies firstly on the capacity of an attached source of chirality to explore the M&#246;bius ring environment, which depends on several convoluted dynamic processes; secondly on the responsiveness of the system, making this exploration tunable and multi&#8208;reversible; and thirdly on the unwavering optimism of the experimenter.







Abstract
By their conformational flexibility, M&#246;bius aromatic hexaphyrins provide a dynamic chirality attractive to develop stimuli responsive systems such as chiroptical switches. A regular [28]hexaphyrin has been equipped with a chiral coordinating arm to achieve transfer of chirality from a fix stereogenic element to the dynamic M&#246;bius one. The arm allows straightforward formation of labile monometallic ZnII complexes with an exogenous ligand, either a carboxylato or an amino with opposite inwards/outwards orientations relative to the M&#246;bius ring. As a corollary, the chiral coordinating arm is constrained over the ring or laterally, inducing opposite P and M M&#246;bius configurations with unprecedented high stereoselectivity (diast. excess greater than 95&#8201;%). By tuning the transfer of chirality, these achiral effectors generate electronic circular dichroism spectra with bisignate Cotton effect of opposite signs. Switching between distinct chiroptical states was ultimately achieved in mild conditions owing to ligand exchange, with high robustness (10 cycles).

         <title>Fluorescence Imaging of Mitochondrial DNA Base Excision Repair Reveals Dynamics of Oxidative Stress Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;up fluorescent probe (UBER) that reacts rapidly with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites visualizes base excision repair (BER) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in cells. Monitoring of the mtDNA BER process in cells over time illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of DNA repair, along with the effect of DNA defensive enzymes, MTH1 and OGG1.







Abstract
Mitochondrial function in cells declines with aging and with neurodegeneration, due in large part to accumulated mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that arise from deficient DNA repair. However, measuring this repair activity is challenging. We employ a molecular approach for visualizing mitochondrial base excision repair (BER) activity in&#8197;situ by use of a fluorescent probe (UBER) that reacts rapidly with AP sites resulting from BER activity. Administering the probe to cultured cells revealed signals that were localized to mitochondria, enabling selective observation of mtDNA BER intermediates. The probe showed elevated DNA repair activity under oxidative stress, and responded to suppression of glycosylase activity. Furthermore, the probe illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of BER. Absence of MTH1 in cells resulted in elevated demand for BER activity upon extended oxidative stress, while the absence of OGG1 activity limited glycosylation capacity.

         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lasting and broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial agents with the special structure of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid and quaternary ammonium surfactants. HCISs possess high substrate&#8208;adhesion on various substrates and high anti&#8208;water washing property, and can continuously provide antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, avoiding one&#8208;time burst release of antimicrobial units.







Abstract
Microbial infections have become a great threat to human health and one of the main risks arises from direct contact with the surfaces contaminated by pathogenic microbes. Herein, a kind of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are fabricated by non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid with quaternary ammonium surfactants. Different from one&#8208;time burst release of conventional antimicrobial agents, the HCIS acts like a &#8220;antimicrobial molecular bank&#8221; and releases the antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, leading to long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial performance. Taking advantage of strong hydrophobicity and adhesion, HCISs are applicable to various substrates and endowed with anti&#8208;water washing property, thus showing high in vitro antimicrobial efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) even after being used for 10 cycles. Meanwhile, HCISs exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, and have good biocompatibility with mammalian cells. Such a low&#8208;cost and portable long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent meets the growing anti&#8208;infection demand in public spaces.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Embedded Approach to Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Isoelectronic Structures for Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was synthesized by condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde derivative, which was readily converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacing oxonium with nitrogen atoms under the treatment of ammonia.







Abstract
Embedding heteroatoms into the main backbones of polymeric materials has become an efficient tool for tailoring their structures and improving their properties. However, owing to comparatively harsh heteroatom&#8208;doping conditions, this has rarely been explored in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein, upon aldol condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium salt with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde, a two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was achieved, which was further converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacement of oxonium ions with nitrogen atoms under ammonia treatment. The two heteroatom&#8208;embedded COFs are conceptually isoelectronic with each other, featuring similar geometric structures but different electronic structures, rendering them capable of catalyzing the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component synthesis of tri&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives with good recyclability.

Dianion and dication of a tetracyclopentatetraphenylene derivative were generated and characterized by spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray crystallography to reveal that the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled as theoretically predicted. The magnetically induced ring currents of the outer and inner circuits flow clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively, in the same direction as the trains run on the outer and inner loops of Osaka Loop Line, as reported by Ichiro Hisaki, Marina&#8197;A. Petrukhina, Tohru Nishinaga, Masayoshi Nakano, Yoshito Tobe, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202115316).

Aromatics&#8208;permeable membranes made from polydimethylsiloxane with tunable side group mobilities are reported by Gongping Liu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202111810). Phenyl groups were introduced as rigid molecular spacers to endow the methyl groups with high mobility and reconstruct the polymer conformation, creating a highway for the fast transport of aromatic molecules, and thus realizing efficient removal of aromatic compounds from aqueous solution.

SO2 and NO2 are important air pollutants, and understanding the mechanism of capture materials drives the development of new clean&#8208;up technologies. In&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray crystallographic and spectroscopic experiments were used by Sihai Yang, Wei Shi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202115585) to establish a detailed molecular mechanism consisting of reversible coordination of SO2 and NO2 at the six open NiII sites on the unprecedented {Ni12}&#8208;wheel of a robust metal&#8211;organic framework material (NKU&#8208;100) at crystallographic resolution.

         <title>The Mechanism of Piezocatalysis: Energy Band Theory or Screening Charge Effect?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes advances in the mechanistic study of newly developed piezocatalysis systems. The differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the tentative mechanisms of energy band theory and screening charge effect are elaborated. The current challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are provided.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis, a newly emerging catalysis technology that relies on the piezopotential and piezoelectric properties of the catalysts, is attracting unprecedented research enthusiasm for applications in energy conversion, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation. Despite the rapid development in the past three years, the mechanism of piezocatalysis is still under debate. A fundamental understanding of the working principles of this technology should enable the future design and optimization of piezocatalysts. Herein, we provide an overview of the two popular theories used to explain the observed piezocatalysis: energy band theory and screening charge effect. A comprehensive discussion and clarification of the differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the two mechanisms are provided. Finally, challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are highlighted. Hopefully, this Review can help readers gain a better understanding of piezocatalysis and enable its application in their own research.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulations Involving the Activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of methods that exploit transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activations for the assembly of cyclic systems is steadily growing. This Minireview covers the most relevant cyclization and cycloaddition approaches, discussed from a mechanistic perspective.







Abstract
The selective functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using transition&#8208;metal catalysis is among the more attractive transformations of modern synthetic chemistry. In addition to its inherent atom economy, such reactions open unconventional retrosynthetic pathways that can streamline synthetic processes. However, the activation of intrinsically inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and the selection among very similar C&#8722;H bonds, represent highly challenging goals. In recent years there has been notable progress tackling these issues, especially with regard to the development of intermolecular reactions entailing the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Conversely, the assembly of cyclic products from simple acyclic precursors using metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activations has been less explored. Only recently has the number of reports on such annulations started to grow. Herein we give an overview of some of the more relevant advances in this exciting topic.

         <title>Quantifying Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals: A Critical Overview of Experimental Elastic Tensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive overview of experimental elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals employs a rotation&#8208;invariant description of the Young's modulus to critically compare multiple observations and computational results. To encourage the wider use of experimental elastic constant tensors in studies of mechanical properties, outliers are clearly identified, resulting in a curated database of experimental results for molecular crystals.







Abstract
This review presents a critical and comprehensive overview of current experimental measurements of complete elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals. For a large fraction of these molecular crystals, detailed comparisons are made with elastic tensors obtained using the corrected small basis set Hartree&#8211;Fock method S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, and these are shown to be competitive with many of those obtained from more sophisticated density functional theory plus dispersion (DFT&#8208;D) approaches. These detailed comparisons between S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, experimental and DFT&#8208;D computed tensors make use of a novel rotation&#8208;invariant spherical harmonic description of the Young's modulus, and identify outliers among sets of independent experimental results. The result is a curated database of experimental elastic tensors for molecular crystals, which we hope will stimulate more extensive use of elastic tensor information&#8212;experimental and computational&#8212;in studies aimed at correlating mechanical properties of molecular crystals with their underlying crystal structure.

&lt;p&gt;An extensive overview of experimental elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals employs a rotation-invariant description of the Young's modulus to critically compare multiple observations and computational results. To encourage the wider use of experimental elastic constant tensors in studies of mechanical properties, outliers are clearly identified, resulting in a curated database of experimental results for molecular crystals.

&lt;p&gt;This review presents a critical and comprehensive overview of current experimental measurements of complete elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals. For a large fraction of these molecular crystals, detailed comparisons are made with elastic tensors obtained using the corrected small basis set Hartree&#8211;Fock method S-HF-3c, and these are shown to be competitive with many of those obtained from more sophisticated density functional theory plus dispersion (DFT-D) approaches. These detailed comparisons between S-HF-3c, experimental and DFT-D computed tensors make use of a novel rotation-invariant spherical harmonic description of the Young's modulus, and identify outliers among sets of independent experimental results. The result is a curated database of experimental elastic tensors for molecular crystals, which we hope will stimulate more extensive use of elastic tensor information&#8212;experimental and computational&#8212;in studies aimed at correlating mechanical properties of molecular crystals with their underlying crystal structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on an Organic Antimony(III) Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent organic antimony(III) hybrid (MePPh3)2SbCl5 featured with STE emission is prepared with good reproducibility and high stability. High&#8208;efficiency OLEDs are demonstrated with this hybrid as an emitter with the luminance of 3500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, current efficiency of 6.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and EQE of 3.1&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
As low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free hybrids with higher stability and lower toxicity than those of three&#8208;dimensional lead perovskites, organic antimony(III) halides show great application potential in opt&#8208;electronic field owing to diverse topologies along with exceptional optical properties. We report herein an antimony(III) hybrid (MePPh3)2SbCl5 with a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structure, which exhibits brilliant orange emission peaked at 593&#8197;nm with near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yield (99.4&#8201;%). The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that the broadband emission with a microsecond lifetime (3.24&#8197;&#956;s) arises from self&#8208;trapped emission (STE). Electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on neat and doped films of (MePPh3)2SbCl5 were fabricated. The doped devices show significant improvement in comparison to non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Owing to the much improved surface morphology and balanced carrier transport in light&#8208;emitting layers of doped devices, the peak luminance, current efficiency (CE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are boosted from 82&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 3500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, 1.1&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 to 6.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and 0.7&#8201;% to 3.1&#8201;% relative to non&#8208;doped devices, respectively.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation of a Selenopolypeptide to Alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin Enhances Oxidation Resistance and Pharmacological Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biocompatible selenopolypeptide was site&#8208;specifically conjugated to alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin (A1AT). The conjugated A1AT fully retained its inhibitory activity on neutrophil elastase (NE), enhanced oxidation resistance, extended the serum half&#8208;life, and afforded long&#8208;lasting protective activity in a mouse model of acute lung injury.







Abstract
Human alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin (A1AT), a native serine&#8208;protease inhibitor that protects tissue damage from excessive protease activities, is used as an augmentation therapy to treat A1AT&#8208;deficienct patients. However, A1AT is sensitive to oxidation&#8208;mediated deactivation and has a short circulating half&#8208;life. Currently, there is no method that can effectively protect therapeutic proteins from oxidative damage in vivo. Here we developed a novel biocompatible selenopolypeptide and site&#8208;specifically conjugated it with A1AT. The conjugated A1AT fully retained its inhibitory activity on neutrophil elastase, enhanced oxidation resistance, extended the serum half&#8208;life, and afforded long&#8208;lasting protective efficacy in a mouse model of acute lung injury. These results demonstrated that conjugating A1AT with the designed selenopolymer is a viable strategy to improve its pharmacological properties, which could potentially further be applied to a variety of oxidation sensitive biotherapeutics.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Homologation of 4&#8208;Substituted Cyclohexanones with CF3CHN2: Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Cycloheptanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl cycloheptanones containing the C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bond on the chiral centers were accessed through a highly stereoselective ScIII/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed homologation reaction of cyclic ketones with CF3CHN2 as the trifluoromethylation reagent. This reaction could be applied to construct silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers with moderate diastereoselectivities and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Introduction of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) into organic molecules in an enantioselective manner has attracted significant attention, but still remains a challenging problem. We herein report a catalytic asymmetric trifluoromethylation of cyclic ketones via a ScIII/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed homologation reaction by employing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane (CF3CHN2) as the CF3 source. This desymmetrization process is highly efficient and generates two chiral centers with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, affording chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl cyclic ketones in a straightforward manner.

         <title>Electrochemical Desaturative &#946;&#8208;Acylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and simple method of electrochemical desaturative &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of cyclic N&#8208;aryl amines has been developed to access the desired &#946;&#8208;substituted enamines with excellent levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild conditions. This procedure proved to be a powerful route to the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a straightforward, robust, and simple route to access &#946;&#8208;substituted desaturated cyclic amines via an electrochemically driven desaturative &#946;&#8208;functionalization of cyclic amines. This transformation is based on multiple single&#8208;electron oxidation processes using catalytic amounts of ferrocene. The reaction proceeds in the absence of stoichiometric amounts of electrolyte under mild conditions, affording the desired products with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction was tolerant of a broad range of substrates and also enables late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of potentially valuable products. Preliminary mechanistic studies using cyclic voltammetry reveal the key role of ferrocene as a redox mediator in the reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, practical, efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum method for the synthesis of highly versatile and synthetically useful ortho&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonylated anilines from N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and trifluoromethanesulfinic chloride is described.







Abstract
A metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, practical and efficient method for the synthesis of highly versatile and synthetically useful ortho&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonylated anilines from arylhydroxylamines and trifluoromethanesulfinic chloride was developed. This rapid transformation proceeded smoothly with good yields and excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity in the absence of any metals or ligands. Mechanistically, the reaction comprised a noncanonical O&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfinylation of the arylhydroxylamine, and the subsequent [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to afford ortho&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonylated aniline derivatives. The practical application of this reaction was demonstrated by further conversion into a series of functional molecules under different reaction conditions.

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Rhamnolipid Toxin by Redox Liposome Single Impact Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is reported that the electrochemistry of redox liposome single impacts is a powerful and efficient analytical technique for sensing target toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria such as Rhamnolipid from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which interacts destructively with the lipid membrane of liposomes. A high sensitivity of sensing has been reached with a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid detected in less than 30&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
The detection of Rhamnolipid virulence factor produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in nosocomial infections is reported by using the redox liposome single impact electrochemistry. Redox liposomes based on 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine as a pure phospholipid and potassium ferrocyanide as an encapsulated redox content are designed for using the interaction of the target toxin with the lipid membrane as a sensing strategy. The electrochemical sensing principle is based on the weakening of the liposomes lipid membrane upon interaction with Rhamnolipid toxin which leads upon impact at an ultramicroelectrode to the breakdown of the liposomes and the release/electrolysis of its encapsulated redox probe. We present as a proof of concept the sensitive and fast sensing of a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid which is detected after less than 30&#8197;minutes of incubation with the liposomes, by the appearing of current spikes in the chronoamperometry measurement.

         <title>A Lanthanum Ammonium Sulfate Double Salt with a Strong SHG Response and Wide Deep&#8208;UV Transparency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV sulfate La(NH4)(SO4)2, which exhibits a short&#8208;wavelength deep&#8208;UV absorption edge (below 190&#8197;nm) and the strongest SHG response among deep&#8208;UV NLO sulfates (2.4&#215;KDP), has been successfully synthesized by a double&#8208;salt strategy involving introduction of complementary cations.







Abstract
The targeted synthesis of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, especially those with non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated sulfates, has experienced considerable difficulties due to the need to reconcile the oft&#8208;competing requirements for deep&#8208;UV transparency and strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). We report herein the designed synthesis of the first rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV sulfate La(NH4)(SO4)2 by a double&#8208;salt strategy involving introduction of complementary cations, together with optical studies that reveal a short&#8208;wavelength deep&#8208;UV absorption edge (below 190&#8197;nm) and the strongest SHG response among deep&#8208;UV NLO sulfates (2.4&#215;KDP). Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis suggest that the excellent balance between SHG response and deep&#8208;UV transparency can be attributed to a synergistic interaction of the hetero&#8208;cations La3+ and [NH4]+, which optimize alignment of the [SO4] tetrahedra and highly polarizable [LaO8] polyhedra.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dithia[5]helicenes and their Postsynthetic Functionalization to Access Dithia[9]helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a chiral Au catalyst bearing an &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphonite as an ancillary ligand and two successive alkyne hydroarylation events allows the assembly of dithia[5]helicenes with excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, regioselective postsynthetic bromination of the dithia[5]helicene products generates starting materials for the efficient preparation of even more &#960;&#8208;expanded systems, such as dithia[9]helicenes.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective synthesis of 5,13&#8208;disubstituted dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes is reported. Key for the successful assembly of these helical architectures is the last two successive Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation events. Specifically, the second cyclization is the enantiodetermining step of the whole process and provides the desired helicenes with excellent ee values when a TADDOL&#8208;derived 1,2,3&#8208;(triazolium)phosphonite moiety (TADDOL: &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8242;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol) is employed as an ancillary ligand. The absolute stereochemistry of the newly prepared structures has been determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography to be P; the optical properties of these heterohelicenes are also reported. A three&#8208;step procedure was subsequently developed that allows the transformation of the initially obtained dithia[5]helicenes into dithia[9]helicenes without erosion of the enantiopurity.

A cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and benzyl electrophiles proceeds through nickel&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;F bond activation and shows excellent stereoselectivity and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Stereo&#8208; and enantioselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling involving C&#8722;F bond activation is reported. Treatment of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with racemic benzyl electrophiles in the presence of a chiral nickel complex using B2pin2 as a stoichiometric reductant allows the construction of a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond under mild conditions, affording a broad range of monofluoroalkenes bearing stereogenic allylic centers. Initial mechanistic studies indicate that a radical chain pathway may be operating, wherein the ester group in the gem&#8208;difluoroalkene promotes C&#8722;F bond activation through oxidative addition to a Ni species.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stereo- and enantioselective cross-electrophile coupling involving C&#8722;F bond activation is reported. Treatment of gem-difluoroalkenes with racemic benzyl electrophiles in the presence of a chiral nickel complex using B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a stoichiometric reductant allows the construction of a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond under mild conditions, affording a broad range of monofluoroalkenes bearing stereogenic allylic centers. Initial mechanistic studies indicate that a radical chain pathway may be operating, wherein the ester group in the gem-difluoroalkene promotes C&#8722;F bond activation through oxidative addition to a Ni species&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Making the invisible visible. Reactive glycosylation intermediates are identified using chemical exchange saturation transfer NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The stereoselective introduction of the glycosidic bond remains one of the main challenges in carbohydrate synthesis. Characterizing the reactive intermediates of this reaction is key to develop stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Herein we report the characterization of low&#8208;populated, rapidly equilibrating mannosyl dioxanium ions that arise from participation of a C&#8208;3 acyl group using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy. Dioxanium ion structure and equilibration kinetics were measured under relevant glycosylation conditions and highly &#945;&#8208;selective couplings were observed suggesting glycosylation took place via this elusive intermediate.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Gut&#8208;Microbiota&#8208;Derived Lantibiotics Reveals a Subgroup of S8 Family Proteases for Class III Leader Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of rat gut&#8208;microbiota&#8208;derived class III lanthipeptides with moderate antimicrobial activities were discovered by genome mining. The investigation of their biosynthesis revealed a subgroup of S8 family serine proteases for the removal of class III leader peptides.







Abstract
Lanthipeptides are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides with diverse structural features and bioactivities. Gut&#8208;microbiota&#8208;derived lanthipeptides play important roles in gut homeostasis of the host. Herein, we report the discovery and biosynthesis of class III lantibiotics named amylopeptins, which are derived from the gut microbiota of Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats and display a narrow antimicrobial spectrum. In contrast to known class III lanthipeptides, the biosynthesis of amylopeptins employs AmyP, which belongs to a subgroup of S8 family serine proteases, to remove the leader of corresponding precursor peptides in a site&#8208;specific manner during the last step of their maturation. Overall, this study shows for the first time that S8 family proteases participate in the biosynthesis of class III lanthipeptides.

         <title>Synthesis of 20&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products Yields Inducers of LC3 Lipidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of three natural product fragments in 20&#8208;membered macrocyclic pseudo&#8208;natural products led to the discovery of inducers of a novel LC3 lipidation phenotype.







Abstract
Design and synthesis of pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) through recombination of natural product (NP) fragments in unprecedented arrangements enables the discovery of novel biologically relevant chemical matter. With a view to wider coverage of NP&#8208;inspired chemical and biological space, we describe the combination of this principle with macrocycle formation. PNP&#8208;macrocycles were synthesized efficiently in a stereoselective one&#8208;pot procedure including the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of different dipolarophiles with dimeric cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived azomethine ylides formed in situ. The 20&#8208;membered bis&#8208;cycloadducts embody 18 stereocenters and an additional fragment&#8208;sized NP&#8208;structure. After further functionalization, a collection of 163 macrocyclic PNPs was obtained. Biological investigation revealed potent inducers of the lipidation of the microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) protein, which plays a prominent role in various autophagy&#8208;related processes.

         <title>Passerini&#8211;Smiles Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketophosphonates: Platform for Phospha&#8208;Brook/Smiles Embedded Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passerini&#8211;Smiles reactions of &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;nitrophenols afford substrates for complex cascades tuned by further Smiles, Truce&#8211;Smiles and phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangements. DFT studies confirm the proposed reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
The Passerini&#8211;Smiles reactions of &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates with nitrophenols has been used as a platform to observe complex cascades involving multiple Smiles transfers coupled with phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. When using 4&#8208;nitrophenols a rare 1,3&#8208;Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is observed leading to diarylacetamide derivatives. 2&#8208;Nitro&#8208;derivatives lead to a completely different reactivity pattern that may be explained by a nitro to nitroso conversion followed by a &#963;&#8211;&#960; metathesis. All mechanistic assumptions are confirmed by DFT calculations performed on both families of adducts. The potential of this work has been further demonstrated by the use of N&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides as alternative starting materials for these cascades as well as the disclosure of new aza&#8208;Nazarov access to hydroxy&#8208;indolones.

&lt;p&gt;Passerini&#8211;Smiles reactions of &#945;-ketophosphonates with 2- and 4-nitrophenols afford substrates for complex cascades tuned by further Smiles, Truce&#8211;Smiles and phospha-Brook rearrangements. DFT studies confirm the proposed reaction mechanisms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Passerini&#8211;Smiles reactions of &#945;-ketophosphonates with nitrophenols has been used as a platform to observe complex cascades involving multiple Smiles transfers coupled with phospha-Brook rearrangement. When using 4-nitrophenols a rare 1,3-Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is observed leading to diarylacetamide derivatives. 2-Nitro-derivatives lead to a completely different reactivity pattern that may be explained by a nitro to nitroso conversion followed by a &#963;&#8211;&#960; metathesis. All mechanistic assumptions are confirmed by DFT calculations performed on both families of adducts. The potential of this work has been further demonstrated by the use of N-aryl &#945;-ketoamides as alternative starting materials for these cascades as well as the disclosure of new aza-Nazarov access to hydroxy-indolones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Quinolizine AIE System: Visualization of Molecular Motion and Elaborate Tailoring for Biological Application**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quinolizine restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV)&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) system was constructed and used to visualize both single&#8208;molecule motion and macroscopic molecular motion. Further elaborately tailored this impressive core achieved highly efficient reactive oxygen species production as well as fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy applications.







Abstract
Molecular motions are ubiquitous in nature and they immutably play intrinsic roles in all actions. However, exploring appropriate models to decipher molecular motions is an extremely important but very challenging task for researchers. Considering aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens possess their unique merits to visualize molecular motions, it is particularly fascinating to construct new AIE systems as models to study molecular motion. Herein, a novel quinolizine (QLZ) AIE system was constructed based on the restriction intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. It was demonstrated that QLZ could act as an ideal model to visualize single&#8208;molecule motion and macroscopic molecular motion via fluorescence change. Additionally, further elaborate tailoring of this impressive core achieved highly efficient reactive oxygen species production and realized fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy applications, which confirms the great application potential of this new AIE&#8208;active QLZ core. Therefore, this work not only provides an ideal model to visualize molecular motion but also opens a new way for the application of AIEgens.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic Supramolecule via Hydrogen Bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking for Ultrahigh Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust two&#8208;dimensional organic supramolecular network is achieved via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility and rapid ion transport channels for fast&#8208;charge and &#8208;discharge Zn&#8211;organic batteries with record&#8208;breaking ultrahigh capacity and outstanding cyclability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, the reported electrode materials for ZIBs are facing shortcomings including low capacity and unsatisfactory cycling stability etc. Herein, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;quione (HATNQ) is reported for aqueous ZIBs. The HATNQ electrodes delivered an ultrahigh capacity (482.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cyclability of &gt;10&#8201;000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The capacity sets a new record for organic cathodes in aqueous ZIBs. The high performances are ascribed to the rich C=O and C=N groups that endowed HATNQ with a 2D layered supramolecular structure by multiple hydrogen bonds in plane with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility, and rapid ion transport for fast&#8208;charge and &#8208;discharge batteries. Moreover, the 2D supramolecular structure boosted the storage of Zn2+/H+, particularly the storage of Zn2+, due to the more favorable O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N coordination in HATNQ.

         <title>Chiral Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Circularly Polarized Ambient Phosphorescence from Bischromophoric Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appending pyromellitic diimide phosphors to an enantiomeric diaminocyclohexane core results in a chiral bischromophoric phosphor that shows circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) under ambient conditions. Solution&#8208;processable PMMA films of the bischromophoric phosphors show mirror&#8208;imaged cyan CPP with a high phosphorescence quantum yield (18&#8201;% in air and 46&#8201;% under vacuum) and a significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|=4.0&#215;10&#8722;3).







Abstract
Chiral organic phosphors with circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) provide new prospects to the realm of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, owing to the long&#8208;lived triplet states and persistent emission. Although several molecular designs show efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), realization of ambient organic CPP remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a chiral bischromophoric phosphor design to realize ambient CPP emission by appending molecular phosphors to a chiral diaminocyclohexane core. Thus, solution&#8208;processable polymer films of the trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DAC) chiral cores with heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide phosphors, exhibits one of the most efficient exclusive CPP emissions with high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#8776;18&#8201;% in air and &#8776;46&#8201;% under vacuum) and significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;4.0&#215;10&#8722;3).

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Metal&#8211;Nucleobase Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8211;nucleobase frameworks were reported for the highly efficient separation of a Xe/Kr mixture with high IAST selectivity and Henry's selectivity. The selective binding of Xe arises from the enhanced polarization in the confined electric field produced by the electron&#8208;rich anions and the electron&#8208;deficient purine heterocyclic rings.







Abstract
Xe/Kr separation is an industrially important but challenging process owing to their inert properties and low concentrations in the air. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation is a promising technology. Herein, two isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8211;nucleobase frameworks (HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201 and HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;202) are capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions and strike an excellent balance between capacity and selectivity. The Xe capacity of HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201a reaches 3.01&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar, while IAST selectivity and Henry's selectivity are 21.0 and 21.6, respectively. Direct breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent separation performance, affording a Xe capacity of 25.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 from a Xe/Kr mixed&#8208;gas at dilute concentrations. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the selective binding arises from the enhanced polarization in the confined electric field produced by the electron&#8208;rich anions and the electron&#8208;deficient purine heterocyclic rings.

         <title>Enzymatic C&#8208;to&#8208;C Protein Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of substrate mimetics for an asparaginyl ligase, a highly efficient transpeptidase, including a C&#8208;terminal reversed sequence mimetic of the native N&#8208;terminal substrate is reported. This retro substrate mimetic can be introduced onto recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides, enabling enzyme&#8208;catalyzed protein or peptide C&#8208;to&#8208;C ligation.







Abstract
Transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed protein and peptide modifications have been widely utilized for generating conjugates of interest for biological investigation or therapeutic applications. However, all known transpeptidases are constrained to ligating in the N&#8208;to&#8208;C orientation, limiting the scope of attainable products. Here, we report that an engineered asparaginyl ligase accepts diverse incoming nucleophile substrate mimetics, particularly when a means of selectively quenching the reactivity of byproducts released from the recognition sequence is employed. In addition to directly catalyzing formation of l&#8208;/d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;amino acid junctions, we find C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;ethylenediamine (Leu&#8208;Eda) motifs to be bona fide mimetics of native N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;Leu sequences. Appending a C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;Eda to synthetic peptides or, via an intein&#8208;splicing approach, to recombinant proteins enables direct transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;to&#8208;C ligations. This work significantly expands the synthetic scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed protein transpeptidation reactions.

         <title>Shape Permanence in Diarylethene&#8208;Functionalized Liquid&#8208;Crystal Elastomers Facilitated by Thiol&#8208;Anhydride Dynamic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diarylethene is incorporated in liquid&#8208;crystalline elastomers to generate phototropic deformation upon exposure to UV light. Thiol&#8208;anhydride bonds within the network structure allow for alignment of the liquid crystalline elastomer and shape retention after initial deformation.







Abstract
Diarylethene&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8208;crystalline elastomers (DAE&#8208;LCEs) containing thiol&#8208;anhydride bonds were prepared and shown to undergo reversible, reprogrammable photoinduced actuation. Upon exposure to UV light, a monodomain DAE&#8208;LCE generated 5.5&#8201;% strain. This photogenerated strain was demonstrated to be optically reversible over five cycles of alternating UV/Visible light exposure with minimal photochrome fatigue. The incorporation of thiol&#8208;anhydride dynamic bonds allowed for retention of actuated states. Further, re&#8208;programming of the nematic director was achieved by heating above the temperature for bond exchange to occur (70&#8201;&#176;C) yet below the nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) such that order was maintained between mesogens. The observed thermal stability of each of the diarylethene isomers of over 72&#8197;h allowed for decoupling of photo&#8208;induced processes and polymer network effects, showing that both polymer relaxation and back&#8208;isomerization of the diarylethene contributed to LCE relaxation over a period of 12&#8197;hours after actuation unless bond exchange occurred.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO by In Situ Formation of a Hybrid Catalytic System Based on Molecular Iron Quaterpyridine Covalently Linked to Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent&#8208;linked C3N4&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;decorated iron quaterpyridine hybrid catalyst was initially developed by in situ Schiff base reaction, achieving high CO generation and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The enhanced catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the accelerated photoinduced electron transfer and utilization via the formed covalent linkage.







Abstract
Efficient and selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction was obtained within a hybrid system that is formed in situ via a Schiff base condensation between a molecular iron quaterpyridine complex bearing an aldehyde function and carbon nitride. Irradiation (blue LED) of an CH3CN solution containing 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BIH), triethylamine (TEA), Feqpy&#8208;BA (qpy&#8208;BA=4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;:6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quaterpyridin]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzaldehyde) and C3N4 resulted in CO evolution with a turnover number of 2554 and 95&#8201;% selectivity. This hybrid catalytic system unlocks covalent linkage of molecular catalysts with semiconductor photosensitizers via Schiff base reaction for high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic reduction of CO2, opening a pathway for diverse photocatalysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes but have rarely been used in materials science. Here, we have developed doubly methylated DAEs derived from 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine with high thermal stability and fatigue resistance. These new photoswitches not only outperform their predecessors but also rival classical non&#8208;nucleosidic DAEs. To demonstrate the utility of these new DAEs, we have designed an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides: one strand containing a fluorogenic double&#8208;methylated 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form a highly efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer (FRET) pair. The system was operated in liquid and solid phases and showed both strong distance&#8208; and orientation&#8208;dependent photochromic FRET. The superior ON/OFF contrast was maintained over up to 100 switching cycles, with no detectable fatigue.</dc:description>

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network with Distinctive Topology Transformations for Shape&#8208; and Molecular Architecture Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic covalent polymer network was designed to allow independent programming of the macroscopic shape and mechanical properties via two orthogonal topological transformations.







Abstract
Bond exchange in a typical dynamic covalent polymer network allows access to macroscopic shape reconfigurability, but the network architecture is not altered. An alternative possibility is that the network architecture can be designed to switch to various topological states corresponding to different material properties. Achieving both in one network can expand the material scope, but their intrinsically conflicting mechanisms make it challenging. We design a dynamic covalent network that can undergo two orthogonal topological transformations, namely transesterification on the branched chains and olefin metathesis on the mainframe. This allows independent control of the macroscopic shape and molecular architecture. With this design, we illustrate a bottlebrush network with programmable shape and spatially definable mechanical properties. Our strategy paves a way to on&#8208;demand regulation of network polymers.

A Cr&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylation reaction of aldehydes with racemic propargyl halides has been developed. This robust method employs simple and readily accessible materials, exhibits exceptional functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, and provides facile access to a wide range of valuable optically enriched &#945;&#8208;allenols with two or three continuous chiral centers, including both central and axial chirality.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Allenol is a versatile synthon in organic synthesis. The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenols from readily available starting materials remains a prominent challenge, especially when simultaneous control over axial and central chirality is required. Herein, we describe the Cr&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylation of aldehydes with racemic propargyl halides to rapidly access a wide range of chiral &#945;&#8208;allenols with adjacent axial and central chiralities. This method features excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity control with broad substrate scope, and provides facile access to all four stereoisomers when allied with a Mitsunobu reaction. Preliminary mechanistic studies support radical&#8208;based reaction pathways. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the application in late&#8208;stage functionalization and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;varitriol.

         <title>Main&#8208;Chain Fluoropolymers with Alternating Sequence Control via Light&#8208;Driven Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Copolymerization in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;enabled controlled copolymerization compatible with both batch and flow syntheses has been established for the transformation of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides. This work enables on&#8208;demand preparation of main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers with various fractions of alternating units under ambient conditions, and streamlines the generation of block copolymers from gaseous fluoroethylene using two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow systems.







Abstract
Polymers with regulated alternating structures are attractive in practical applications, particularly for main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers. We for the first time enabled controlled fluoropolymer synthesis with alternating sequence regulation using a novel fluorinated xanthate agent via a light&#8208;driven process, which achieved on&#8208;demand copolymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides under both batch and flow conditions at ambient pressure. This method creates a facile access to fluoropolymers with a broad fraction range of alternating units, low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Moreover, a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow platform was established to streamline the in&#8208;situ chain&#8208;extension toward unprecedented block copolymers continuously from fluoroethylene. Influences of structural control were illustrated with thermal and surface properties. We anticipate that this work will promote advanced material engineering with customized fluoropolymers.

         <title>Screening Heteroatom Configurations for Reversible Sloping Capacity Promises High&#8208;Power Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a heteroatom configuration screening strategy upon P/O&#8208;doping, irreversible configurations of C&#8722;O and PO3&#8722; were removed, while the configurations like C=O and PO43&#8722;/PO23&#8722; as well as the free radicals could be retained or even enhanced. The Na storage mechanisms were also studied using the resulting carbon. This work inspires the design and understanding of the &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high&#8208;power Na&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping has been proved to effectively enhance the sloping capacity, nevertheless, the high sloping capacity almost encounters a conflict with the disappointing initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, we propose a heteroatom configuration screening strategy by introducing a secondary carbonization process for the phosphate&#8208;treated carbons to remove the irreversible heteroatom configurations but with the reversible ones and free radicals remaining, achieving a simultaneity between the high sloping capacity and ICE (&#8776;250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 80&#8201;%). The Na storage mechanism was also studied based on this &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon to reveal the reason for the absence of the plateau. This work could inspire to distinguish and filter the irreversible heteroatom configurations and facilitate the future design of practical &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high&#8208;power Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Dissymmetric Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: Secondary Structure Elucidation and Dynamic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D helix adopted by a non&#8208;symmetric substituted poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated, and its ability to self&#8208;assembly into nanospheres or fiber&#8208;like structures under the right conditions is also demonstrated. Moreover, by conformational changes in the pendant group it is possible to produce a helix inversion in the PDPA and create a circular polarized luminescence (CPL) switch.







Abstract
The secondary structure of a dissymmetric and chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated by combining the data from NMR experiments (regioregular head to tail structure), Raman and IR studies (E configuration of the polyene double bonds), and high&#8208;resolution AFM images (helical pitch, packing angle and orientation of the external helix). As a result, an E&#8208;transoidal polyene backbone describing three coaxial helices is obtained. Theoretical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies of the structure show a good correspondence between experimental and theoretical data and allow one to decipher that the first Cotton band is generated by the poly(diphenylacetylene) core and not only by the polyene backbone. The dynamic behavior of poly&#8208;(S)&#8208;2 is also demonstrated by a helix inversion effect produced by conformational changes at the pendant groups when annealed in solvents with different donor abilities. This phenomenon is accompanied by an inversion of the circular polarized luminescence of the PDPA (CPL switch).

         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts in one step via cascade reactions of easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles was developed. Feasibility of the new imidazol(in)ium salts for direct metallation to give M/NHC complexes (M=Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au) was demonstrated.







Abstract
Imidazolium salts have ubiquitous applications in energy research, catalysis, materials and medicinal sciences. Here, we report a new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts from easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes in one step. The strategy relies on a discovered family of unprecedented nucleophilic addition/cyclization reactions with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles. To probe general areas of application, synthesized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors were feasible for direct metallation to give functionalized M/carbene complexes (M=Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au), which were isolated in individual form. The utility of the chloromethyl function for the postmodification of the synthesized salts and Pd/carbene complexes was demonstrated. The obtained complexes and imidazolium salts demonstrated good activities in Pd&#8208; or Ni&#8208;catalyzed model cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8722;H activation reactions.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;Triggered Solar Hydrogen Production via Platinum(II)&#8208;Tethered Chalcogenoviologens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of platinum(II)&#8208;tethered chalcogenoviologens with three&#8208;in&#8208;one functions was prepared. When bacteria were used as a natural sacrificial agent, PtL+&#8208;SeV2+ could realize not only bacteria&#8208;triggered one&#8208;component solar H2 production but also antibacterial action. This system laid the foundation for solving various real&#8208;life problems via a simple system.







Abstract
Multifunctional solar energy conversion offers a feasible strategy to solve energy, environmental and water crises. Herein, a series of platinum(II)&#8208;tethered chalcogenoviologens (PtL+&#8208;EV2+, E=S, Se, Te) is reported, which integrate the functions of photosensitizer, electron mediator and catalyst. PtL+&#8208;EV2+ (particularly for PtL+&#8208;SeV2+)&#8208;based one&#8208;component solar H2 production could be triggered not only by EDTA, but also by facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria relying on a simplified mechanism, along with efficient antibacterial activities. In addition, by using real pool water, PtL+&#8208;SeV2+ achieved multiple functions, including H2 production, antibacterial action and acid removal, which supplied a new strategy to solve various problems in real life via a single system.

         <title>An Efficient Rechargeable Aluminium&#8211;Amine Battery Working Under Quaternization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient rechargeable Al battery was built based on the electrochemical amine quaternization reaction, in which nitrogen (radical) cations (R3N.+ or R4N+) function as the redox&#8208;active sites to store the anionic Al complex. The constructed Al&#8211;amine battery exhibits a high reversible capacity, fast charge capability, and superior stability against long&#8208;term cycling and self&#8208;discharge.







Abstract
Rechargeable aluminium (Al) batteries (RABs) have long&#8208;been pursued due to the high sustainability and three&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer properties of Al metal. However, limited redox chemistry is available for rechargeable Al batteries, which restricts the exploration of cathode materials. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient Al&#8211;amine battery based on a quaternization reaction, in which nitrogen (radical) cations (R3N.+ or R4N+) are formed to store the anionic Al complex. The reactive aromatic amine molecules further oligomerize during cycling, inhibiting amine dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the constructed Al&#8211;amine battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with a superior cycling life (4000&#8197;cycles), fast charge capability and a high energy efficiency of 94.2&#8201;%. Moreover, the Al&#8211;amine battery shows excellent stability against self&#8208;discharge, far beyond conventional Al&#8211;graphite batteries. Our findings pave an avenue to advance the chemistry of RABs and thus battery performance.

         <title>Catalytic Transformation of PET and CO2 into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and CO2, two chemical wastes that urgently need to be transformed in our environment, are converted simultaneously in a one&#8208;pot catalytic process. The process for dual&#8208;promoted conversion overcomes the original thermodynamic equilibrium limits of methanol synthesis and PET methanolysis, leading to a significantly enhanced yield of PET.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and CO2, two chemical wastes that urgently need to be transformed in the environment, are converted simultaneously in a one&#8208;pot catalytic process through the synergistic coupling of three reactions: CO2 hydrogenation, PET methanolysis and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) hydrogenation. More interestingly, the chemical equilibria of both reactions were shifted forward due to a revealed dual&#8208;promotion effect, leading to significantly enhanced PET depolymerization. The overall methanol yield from CO2 hydrogenation exceeded the original thermodynamic equilibrium limit since the methanol was in&#8197;situ consumed in the PET methanolysis. The degradation of PET by a stoichiometric ratio of methanol was significantly enhanced because the primary product, DMT was hydrogenated to dimethyl cyclohexanedicarboxylate (DMCD) or p&#8208;xylene (PX). This synergistic catalytic process provides an effective way to simultaneously recycle two wastes, polyesters and CO2, for producing high&#8208;value chemicals.

         <title>Raman Fiber Photometry for Understanding Mitochondrial Superoxide Burst and Extracellular Calcium Ion Influx upon Acute Hypoxia in the Brain of Freely Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe and Raman fiber photometry were developed, for simultaneous real&#8208;time quantitation of mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal. Using our powerful tools, it was discovered that hypoxic brain injury was caused by O2.&#8722;&#8208;induced mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, which was regulated by ASIC1a, and the overload Ca2+ came from influx of extracellular Ca2+.







Abstract
Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneous quantitation of multiple molecules in mitochondria across the whole brain of freely moving animals is the key bottleneck for understanding the physiological and pathological roles that mitochondria play in the brain events. Here we built a Raman fiber photometry, and created a highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe based on the triple&#8208;recognition strategies of chemical reaction, charge transfer, and characteristic fingerprint peaks, for tracking and simultaneous quantitation of mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal upon hypoxia. It was found that mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH changed from superficial to deep brain regions upon hypoxia. It was discovered that hypoxia&#8208;induced mitochondrial O2.&#8722; burst was regulated by ASIC1a, leading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and acidification. Furthermore, we found the overload of mitochondrial Ca2+ was mostly attributed to the influx of extracellular Ca2+.

         <title>Steering the Glycerol Electro&#8208;Reforming Selectivity via Cation&#8211;Intermediate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycerol oxidation selectivity can be efficiently steered via cation&#8211;intermediate interactions, resulting in highly selective glycerol electro&#8208;reforming into hydrogen and formate. This work emphasizes the significance of engineering the microenvironment at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface for efficient electrochemical processes.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of renewable biomass resources is an alternative technology for sustainable pure H2 production. Herein, we discovered an unconventional cation effect on the concurrent formate and H2 production via glycerol electro&#8208;reforming. In stark contrast to the cation effect via forming double layers in cathodic reactions, residual cations at the anode were discovered to interact with the glycerol oxidation intermediates to steer its product selectivity. Through a combination of product analysis, transient kinetics, crown ether trapping experiments, in situ IRRAS and DFT calculations, the aldehyde intermediates were discovered to be stabilized by the Li+ cations to favor the non&#8208;oxidative C&#8722;C cleavage for formate production. The maximal formate efficiency could reach 81.3&#8201;% under &#8776;60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in LiOH. This work emphasizes the significance of engineering the microenvironment at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface for efficient electrolytic processes.

         <title>Direct and Unified Access to Carbon Radicals from Aliphatic Alcohols by Cost&#8208;Efficient Titanium&#8208;Mediated Homolytic C&#8722;H Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of &#8220;TiCl2(cat)&#8221; and Zn (cat=catecholate) facilitates the homolytic cleavage of &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; alcohol C&#8722;O bonds. All aliphatic primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols serve as good substrates. This method was applied to radical conjugate addition reactions successfully, and mechanistic studies indicate that alkyl chlorides are not intermediates. The active species is a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex of alkoxide and TiIII.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent Ti&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8722;O bond cleavage offers unified access to carbon radicals from ubiquitous non&#8208;activated tertiary, secondary, and even primary alcohols. In contrast to the representative Ti reagents, which were ineffective for this purpose, &#8220;TiCl2(cat)&#8221;/Zn (cat=catecholate) was found to be specifically active. This method was applied to the addition reactions of radicals to alkenes and exhibited high generality and yields. More than 50 combinations were examined. The excellent cost&#8208;efficiency and accessibility of &#8220;TiCl2(cat)&#8221;/Zn further enhance its applicability. Control experiments proved the presence of a carbon radical intermediate and excluded the pathway via alkyl chlorides. Further mechanistic study indicated that the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex of alkoxide (R&#8722;O&#8722;) and TiIII is an active species in the C&#8722;O cleavage.

         <title>Manipulating Selective Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Electron Transfer to Achieve Multi&#8208;Phase Transitions in an Asymmetric [Fe2Co]&#8208;Assembled Mixed&#8208;Valence Chain</title>

A cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence chain complex of {[(Tp)Fe(CN)3]2Co(BIT)}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;CH3OH (1; Tp=hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate and BIT=3,4&#8208;bis&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)thiophene) was synthesized by assembling asymmetric electron transfer&#8208;active {Fe2Co} units with BIT ligands. It showed reversible multi&#8208;phase transitions accompanied by photo&#8208;switchable single&#8208;chain magnet properties and a dielectric anomaly.







Abstract
Manipulation of multi&#8208;functions in molecular materials is promising for future switching and memory devices, although it is currently difficult. Herein, we assembled the asymmetric {Fe2Co} unit into a cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence chain {[(Tp)Fe(CN)3]2Co(BIT)}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH (1) (Tp=hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate and BIT=3,4&#8208;bis&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)thiophene), which showed reversible multi&#8208;phase transitions accompanied by photo&#8208;switchable single&#8208;chain magnet properties and a dielectric anomaly. Variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray structural studies revealed thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;induced selective electron transfer (ET) between the Co and one of the Fe ions. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that 1 displayed on and off single&#8208;chain magnet behavior by alternating 946&#8208;nm and 532&#8208;nm light irradiation. A substantial anomaly in the dielectric constant was discovered during the electron transfer process, which is uncommon in similar ET complexes. These findings illustrate that 1 provided a new platform for multi&#8208;phase transitions and multi&#8208;switches adjusted by selective metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal ET.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopropenols Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Organocatalyzed [2+1] Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An energy transfer photocatalysis strategy was developed for the synthesis of cyclopropenols. The novel donor&#8211;acceptor carbenes derived from trifluoroacetylsilanes reacted efficiently with both activated and non&#8208;activated alkynes to form the 2+1 cyclization products. The synthetic potential of the reaction is highlighted by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the application in diastereoselective synthesis of trifluoromethylated cyclopropanols.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of common cyclopropenes has been well studied, the access to cyclopropenols is rather limited. Herein, we report the first synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated cyclopropenols via 2+1 cycloaddition reactions between alkynes and trifluoroacylsilanes, enabled by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced organocatalysis. The novel ambiphilic donor&#8211;acceptor carbenes derived from trifluoroacetylsilanes reacted efficiently with both activated and non&#8208;activated alkynes. The reaction features simple operation, mild conditions, broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. The synthetic potential of the reaction is highlighted by the gram&#8208;scale reactions and first synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated cyclopropanols through the combination of the 2+1 cyclization and high diastereoselective hydrogenation reaction in one pot.

         <title>Dissipative Organization of DNA Oligomers for Transient Catalytic Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fuel&#8208;driven DNA self&#8208;assemblies with various transient functions such as catalytic activity are realized in an enzymatic reaction network of concurrent ATP&#8208;powered ligation and restriction of DNA species. The catalytic function with a temporal lifetime can be repeatedly activated by multiple additions of ATP fuel, allowing for fuel&#8208;dependent substrate cleavage.







Abstract
The development of synthetic non&#8208;equilibrium systems opens doors for man&#8208;made life&#8208;like materials. Yet, creating distinct transient functions from artificial fuel&#8208;driven structures remains a challenge. Building on our ATP&#8208;driven dynamic covalent DNA assembly in an enzymatic reaction network of concurrent ATP&#8208;powered ligation and restriction, we introduce ATP&#8208;fueled transient organization of functional subunits for various functions. The programmability of the ligation/restriction site allows to precisely organize multiple sticky&#8208;end&#8208;encoded oligo segments into double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA complexes. We demonstrate principles of ATP&#8208;driven organization into sequence&#8208;defined oligomers by sensing barcode&#8208;embedded targets with different defects. Furthermore, ATP&#8208;fueled DNAzymes for substrate cleavage are achieved by transiently ligating two DNAzyme subunits into a dsDNA complex, rendering ATP&#8208;fueled transient catalytic function.

         <title>Ligand Engineering toward the Trade&#8208;Off between Stability and Activity in Cluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diphenylphosphonate&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag21(H2BTCA)3(O2PPh2)6]SbF6 (1) and [Ag21(C&#8801;CC6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;R2)6(O2PPh2)10]SbF6 (2), have identical icosahedral kernels but different number of free electrons. Cluster 2 exhibits much higher activity than the more stable 1 in the catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. This work shows that the electronic structures of metal nanoclusters can be modulated via different combinations of ligands.







Abstract
We report the structures, stability and catalysis properties of two Ag21 nanoclusters, namely [Ag21(H2BTCA)3(O2PPh2)6]SbF6 (1) and [Ag21(C&#8801;CC6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;R2)6(O2PPh2)10]SbF6 (2) (H4BTCA=p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene, R=OMe). Both Ag21 structures possess an identical icosahedral kernel that is surrounded by eight peripheral Ag atoms. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis and ESI&#8208;MS revealed that 1 is an 8&#8208;electron cluster and 2 has four free electrons. Theoretical results show that the P&#8208;symmetry orbitals are found as HOMO&#8208;1 and HOMO states in 1, and the frontier unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) show D&#8208;character, indicating 1 is a superatomic cluster with an electronically closed shell 1S21P6, while 2 has an incomplete shell configuration 1S21P2. These two Ag21 clusters show superior stability under ambient conditions, and 1 is robust even at 90&#8201;&#176;C in toluene and under oxidative conditions (30&#8201;% H2O2). Significantly, 2 exhibits much higher activity than 1 as catalyst in the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. This work demonstrates that ligands can influence the electronic structures of silver clusters, and further affect their stability and catalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;Two diphenylphosphonate-protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BTCA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-3,5-R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), have identical icosahedral kernels but different number of free electrons. Cluster &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits much higher activity than the more stable &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol. This work shows that the electronic structures of metal nanoclusters can be modulated via different combinations of ligands.

         <title>Sensitive Logic Nanodevices with Strong Response for Weak Inputs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a &#8220;weak&#8208;inputs&#8208;strong&#8208;outputs&#8221; strategy was proposed to guide the construction of different sensitive logic nanodevices that have a strong response for weak input signals by coupling an input&#8208;induced reversible DNA computing platform with a hybridization chain reaction&#8208;based signal amplifier.







Abstract
Sensitive sensing is critical when developing new calculation systems with weak input signals (ISs). In this work, a &#8220;weak&#8208;inputs&#8208;strong&#8208;outputs&#8221; strategy was proposed to guide the construction of sensitive logic nanodevices by coupling an input&#8208;induced reversible DNA computing platform with a hybridization chain reaction&#8208;based signal amplifier. By rational design of the sequence of computing elements (CEs) so as to avoid cross&#8208;talking between ISs and signal amplifier, the newly formed logic nanodevices have good sensitivity to the weak ISs even at low concentrations of CEs, and are able to perform YES, OR, NAND, NOR, INHIBIT, INHIBIT&#8208;OR and number classifier operation, showing that the DNA calculation proceeds in dilute solution medium that greatly improves the calculation proficiency of logic nanodevices without the confinement of the lithography process in nanotechnology.

         <title>Multicolour Fluorescence Based on Excitation&#8208;Dependent Electron Transfer Processes in o&#8208;Carborane Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) approach to construct dual&#8208;fluorescence materials is presented. Impressively, the o&#8208;carborane dyads show multicolour fluorescence from single molecules due to the competition of nonradiative relaxation channels between internal conversion (IC) and PeT. Importantly, the multicolour, flexible and transparent films as well as an anticounterfeiting application using this dyad are well demonstrated.







Abstract
Organic materials with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;de) emission are highly attractive for anticounterfeiting, optoelectronics and bioassay applications; however, the realization of Ex&#8208;de fluorescence, independent of aggregation states, remains a challenge. We herein report a photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) strategy to design Ex&#8208;de fluorescence materials by manipulating the relaxation pathways of multiple excited states. As expected, the o&#8208;carborane dyad presents a clear Ex&#8208;de fluorescence colour in the aggregated states, resulting from the tunable relative intensity of the dual&#8208;fluorescence spectra. Taking TP[1]B as an example, the amorphous powders emitted bright blue&#8208;violet, white and yellow colours under 390&#8197;nm, 365&#8197;nm and 254&#8197;nm UV illumination, respectively. Importantly, multicolour, flexible and transparent films as well as an anticounterfeiting application using this o&#8208;carborane dyad are demonstrated.

         <title>N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst: marked ORR activity in acidic media without the contribution by metal sites?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be the most promising substitutes for benchmark Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report that, a N&#8208;doped carbon materials with trace amount of iron (0&#8208;0.08 wt.%) show excellent ORR activity and durability comparable and even superior to those of Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic media without the significant contribution by the metal sites. Such a N&#8208;doped carbon (denoted as N&#8208;HPCs) features a hollow and hierarchically porous architecture, and more importantly, a non&#8208;covalent&#8208;bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich heterostructure providing the&#160;active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation owing to the efficient electron transfer between the layers. The primary Zn&#8208;air battery using N&#8208;HPCs as the cathode delivers a much higher power density of 158 mW cm&#8208;2, and the maximum power density in H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell reaches 486 mW cm&#8208;2, which is comparable to and even better than those using conventional Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts at cathodes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this contribution, a unique donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal material, namely GDPA&#8208;QCN, is presented. Bulky dendritic triphenylamine (GDPA) was grafted onto quinoxaline&#8208;6,7&#8208;dicarbonitrile (QCN) with a phenyl ring as a bridge to form an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; architecture. Benefited from the particular molecular structure, in solid state, GDPA&#8208;QCN molecules adopted a loose packing mode due to the steric effect of &#8220;umbrella head&#8221; dendritic triphenylamine and flexible molecular structure feature, which allows efficient intramolecular motions and consequently elevates energy dissipation by taking the pathway of thermal deactivation within broad absorption range. The GDPA&#8208;QCN solid has high solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with an absorption range from 300 to 1100 nm, which can promote superior water purification and electricity generation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Terpenoid&#8208;Pyrrolobenzoxazine Hybrid Natural Product CJ&#8208;12662</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fungal natural product CJ&#8208;12662 is a structurally complex terpene&#8208;amino acid hybrid, and is a potent anthelmintic compound. The biosynthetic pathway of CJ&#8208;12662 is elucidated based on metabolite analysis from heterologous expression. We demonstrate the terpene portion is derived from successive P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations of amorpha&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene, while three flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes are involved in morphing the esterified tryptophan into a chlorinated pyrrolobenzoxazine, utilizing a cascaded [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Gating Effects for Ion Transport in Three&#8208;Dimensional Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of bioinspired nano/subnano&#8208;sized (&lt; 2 nm) ion channels is still considered a great challenge due to the difficulty in precisely controlling pore's internal structure and chemistry. Herein, for the first time, we report that three&#8208;dimensional functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can act as an effective nanofluidic platform for intelligent modulating the ion transport. By a strategical attaching of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 groups to the monomers as ion&#8208;driver door locks, we demonstrate that gating effects of functionalized COFs can be activated by lithium ion. The obtained materials exhibit an outstanding selective ion transmission performance with a high gating ratio (up to 23.6 for JUC&#8208;590), which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far. Furthermore, JUC&#8208;590 offer high tunability, selectivity, and recyclability of ion transport proved by the experimental and simulated studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Triptycene&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks with hea net for Hydrogen Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the confined building blocks and difficulty in structural identification, it remains a tremendous challenge to directionally design and synthesize three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with predetermined topologies. Herein, we report the first two cases of 3D COFs with the non&#8208;interpenetrated  hea  net, termed JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, by using the combination of tetrahedral and triangular prism building units. Due to the presence of triptycene functional group and fluorine atoms, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in the H  2  adsorption up to 305 cm  3  /g (or 2.72 wt%) at 77 K and 1 bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic materials reported so far. Furthermore, the strong interaction between H  2  and COF materials is validated through the DFT theoretical calculation. This work represents a triumphant example of rational design of functional COFs based on a reticular chemistry guide and demonstrates its promising application in clean energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Interrogation of Cellular Signaling in Live Cells Using a Membrane&#8208;Anchored DNA Multitasking Processor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA multitasking processor acting as a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; for interrogation of cellular signaling is reported. Enhanced and controllable modulation of c&#8208;Met signaling was achieved by membrane&#8208;anchoring of a DNA processor. The multitasking capability of the DNA processor allowed monitoring signaling change directly, providing a powerful chemical tool for fundamental cell biology research and precision medical applications.







Abstract
Systematic interrogation of correlative signaling components in their native environment is of great interest for dissecting sophisticated cellular signaling. However, it remains a challenge because of the lack of versatile and effective approaches. Herein, we propose a cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA multitasking processor acting as a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; for integrated analyses of cellular signal transduction. Enhanced and controllable inhibition of c&#8208;Met signaling was achieved by membrane&#8208;anchoring of DNA processors. Moreover, the multitasking capability of the DNA processor allowed the monitoring of correlative VEGF secretion induced by c&#8208;Met activity regulation directly. By exploiting versatile aptameric nucleic acids, this modular designed DNA multitasking processor dissected how cell surface receptors coordinated with related components in live cells systematically. Therefore, it provides a powerful chemical tool for both fundamental cell biology research and precision medicine applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical stereoselective photoredox nickel&#8208;mediated allylation of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes is reported (89&#8211;94&#8201;% e.e.). The reaction proceeds under visible&#8208;light irradiation using the available organic dye 3DPAFIPN as photocatalyst in combination with a chiral IndaBOX nickel complex and Hantzsch's ester; that is, replacing stoichiometric metal reductants such as Zn and Mn.







Abstract
Here we report a practical, highly enantioselective photoredox allylation of aldehydes mediated by chiral nickel complexes with commercially available allyl acetate as the allylating agent. The methodology allows the clean stereoselective allylation of aldehydes in good to excellent yields and up to 93&#8201;% e.e. using a catalytic amount of NiCl2(glyme) in the presence of the chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived bis(oxazoline) as the chiral ligand. The photoredox system is constituted by the organic dye 3DPAFIPN and a Hantzsch's ester as the sacrificial reductant. The reaction proceeds under visible&#8208;light irradiation (blue LEDs, 456&#8197;nm) at 8&#8211;12&#8201;&#176;C. Compared to other published procedures, no metal reductants (such as Zn or Mn), additives (e.g. CuI) or air&#8208;sensitive Ni(COD)2 are necessary for this reaction. Accurate DFT calculations and photophysical experiments have clarified the mechanistic picture of this stereoselective allylation reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradable bioplastics have attracted growing interest worldwide. However, it is challenging to develop bioplastics with simple processing procedure, strong mechanical performance, good biocompatibility, and adjustable physicochemical properties. Herein, we introduced structural proteins as building blocks and developed a simple environmental&#8208;friendly approach to fabricate diverse protein&#8208;based plastics. A cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;level production approach was developed through batch fermentation of  Escherichia coli  to product the biomaterials. These bioplastics possess super plasticity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high resistance to organic solvents. Their structural and mechanical properties can be precisely controlled. Besides, high density information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in the bioplastic system. The customizable bioplastics have great potential for applications in numerous fields and are capable to scale up to the industrial level.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dynamic control over molecular emission, especially in a time&#8208;dependent manner, holds a great promise for the development of smart luminescent materials. Here we report a series of dynamic multicolor fluorescent systems based on the time&#8208;encoded locking and unlocking of individual vibrational emissive units. The intramolecular cyclization reaction driven by adding chemical fuel acts as a chemical lock to decrease the conformational freedom of the emissive units, thus varying the fluorescence wavelength, while the resulting chemically locked state can be automatically unlocked by the hydrolysis reaction with water molecules. The dynamic molecular system can be driven by adding chemical fuels for multiple times. The emission wavelength and lifetime of the locking states can be readily controlled by elaborating the molecular structures, indicating this strategy as a robust and versatile way to modulate multi&#8208;color molecular emission in a time&#8208;encoded manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating built&#8208;in electric field via variable oxygen affinity for robust hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Work function strongly impacts the surficial charge distribution, especially for metal&#8208;support electrocatalysts when a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is constructed. Therefore, studying the correlation between work function and BEF is crucial for understanding the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Herein, we present a Pt@CoO  x  electrocatalyst with a large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) and strong BEF, which shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in a neutral medium with a 4.5&#8208;fold mass activity higher than 20% Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the interfacial charge redistribution induced by the strong BEF, thus subtly optimizing hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy. This work not only provides fresh insights into the neutral hydrogen evolution mechanism but also proposes new design principles toward efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in a neutral medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of the Bifunctional Multiple Product Sesterterpene Synthase AcldAS from Aspergillus calidoustus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiproduct chimeric sesterterpene synthase AcldAS from Aspergillus calidoustus yielded spirocyclic calidoustene, which exhibits a novel skeleton, besides five known sesterterpenes. The complex cyclisation mechanism to all six compounds was investigated by isotopic labelling experiments in combination with DFT calculations. Chemically synthesised 8&#8208;hydroxyfarnesyl diphosphate was converted with isopentenyl diphosphate and AcldAS into four oxygenated sesterterpenoids that structurally resemble cytochrome P450 oxidation products of the sesterterpene hydrocarbons. Protein engineering of AcldAS broadened the substrate scope and gave significantly improved enzyme yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Norbornenylsilanes: Soluble Polymers with Controllable Molecular Properties via Siloxane Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inverse vulcanization produces high sulfur content

polymers from alkenes and elemental sulfur. Control over properties

such as the molar mass or the solubility of polymers is not well

established, and existing strategies lack predictability or require large

variations of the composition. Systematic design principles are sought

to allow for a targeted design of materials. Herein, we report on the

inverse vulcanization of norbornenylsilanes (NBS), with a different

number of hydrolysable groups at the silicon atom. Inverse

vulcanization of mixtures of NBS followed by polycondensation

yielded soluble high sulfur content copolymers (50 wt% S) with

controllable weight average molar mass (MW), polydispersity (&#272;),

glass transition temperature (TG), or zero&#8208;shear viscosity (&#951;0).

Polycondensation was conducted in the melt with HCl as a catalyst,

abolishing the need for a solvent. Purification by precipitation afforded

polymers with a greatly reduced amount of low molar mass species.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Phe&#8208;BODIPY Amino Acids as Fluorogenic Building Blocks for Peptide&#8208;based Detection of Urinary Tract Candida Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fungal infections caused by  Candida  species are among the most prevalent in hospitalized patients. However, current methods for the detection of  Candida  fungal cells in clinical samples rely on time&#8208;consuming assays that hamper rapid and reliable diagnosis. Herein, we describe the rational development of new Phe&#8208;BODIPY amino acids as small fluorogenic building blocks and their application to generate fluorescent antimicrobial peptides for rapid labelling of  Candida  cells in urine. We have used computational methods to analyse the fluorogenic behaviour of BODIPY&#8208;substituted aromatic amino acids and performed bioactivity and confocal microscopy experiments in different strains to confirm the utility and versatility of peptides incorporating Phe&#8208;BODIPYs. Finally, we have designed a simple and sensitive fluorescence&#8208;based assay for the detection of  Candida albicans  in human urine samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Mechanochemistry in Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer chains, if long enough, are known to undergo bond scission when mechanically stressed. While the mechanochemical response of random coils is well understood, biopolymers and some key synthetic chains adopt well&#8208;defined secondary structures such as helices. To understand covalent mechanochemistry in such structures, poly (&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamates) are prepared while regulating the feed&#8208;monomer chirality, producing chains with similar molecular weights and backbone chemistry but different helicities. Such chains are stressed in solution and their mechanochemistry rates compared by following molecular weight change and using a rhodamine mechanochromophore. Results reveal that while helicity itself is not affected by the covalent bond scissions, chains with higher helicity undergo faster mechanochemistry. Considering that the polymers tested differ only in conformation, these results indicate that helix&#8208;induced chain rigidity improves the efficiency of mechanical energy transduction</dc:description>

         <title>Unmasking the Critical Role of the Ordering Degree of Bimetallic Nanocatalysts on Oxygen Reduction Reaction by In&#8208;situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control and accurate understanding of ordering degree of bimetallic nanocatalysts (BNs) are challenging yet crucial to get advanced materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, AuCu BNs with various ordering degrees were synthesized to evaluate the influence of ordering degree on ORR at a molecular level using  in  &#8208;  situ  Raman spectroscopy. The activity of AuCu BNs was improved by over 2 times after a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition, making the performance of highly ordered AuCu BNs exceed that of benchmark Pt/C. Direct Raman spectroscopic evidence of key intermediate (*OH) demonstrates that the active site is the combination site of Au and Cu. Moreover, two distinct *OH species are observed on the ordered and disordered structure, and the ordered site is more beneficial for ORR due to its lower affinity to *OH. This work deepens the understanding on the important role of ordering degree on BNs and enables the design of improved catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metastatic cancer is difficult to cure because of its uncontrollable nature and side effects during treatment. We constructed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system based on an ROS active site linked with both a targeting group and an anticancer drug for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers. The optimized prodrug (  Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT  ) with biotin as the targeting group displayed high sensitivity towards ROS and selectively targeting ability towards cervical cancer cells, showing highly efficient drug release (up to 92%) in vitro.  Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT  thus exerted strong toxicity towards cervical cancer cells, but unlike the parent drug (camptothecin), showed no toxicity towards normal cells. Moreover, the prodrug displayed significantly enhanced antitumor ef&#64257;cacy in vivo and eradicated the tumor with no obvious side effects (inhibition of the tumor reached up to 99.9%).</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Influenced Fragmentations in Free&#8208;Standing Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Hydrophobicity Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ordered open organic frameworks membranes are attractive candidates for flow&#8208;assisted molecular separations. The physicochemical properties of such membranes mostly depend on their selectively chosen functional building blocks. In this work, we have introduced a novel concept of functional switchability of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) membranes through a simple solvent influenced fragmentation method. This room&#8208;temperature interfacial synthesis provides free&#8208;standing 3D&#8208;COF membranes with distinct physicochemical properties from the same building monomers. Notably, the change of solvent from chloroform to ethyl acetate switches the membrane property from hydrophilic (water contact angle 60&#176;) to hydrophobic (water contact angle 142&#176;) nature. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane selectively passes oil molecules from an oil&#8208;water emulsion with a gravitational flux of 1536 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (  R  )&#8208;tamsulosin, a blockbuster therapeutic drug employed for dysuria associated with urinary stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia, by utilizing sequential heterogeneous catalysis. Two heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for the synthesis, and the key step involves reductive amination of nitriles using dimethylpolysilane&#8208;modified Pd on activated carbon/calcium phosphate. Overall, (  R  )&#8208;tamsulosin was obtained in 60% yield and 64% ee (99% ee after recrystallization) in a flow stream through four catalytic transformations without the need for the isolation or purification of any intermediates or byproduct.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial chemistry triggers ultrafast radiative recombination in metal halide perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient radiative recombination is essential for perovskite luminescence, but the intrinsic radiative recombination rate as a basic material property is challenging to tailor. Here we report an interfacial chemistry strategy to dramatically increase the radiative recombination rate of perovskites. By coating aluminum oxide on the lead halide perovskite, lead&#8211;oxygen bonds are formed at the perovskite&#8211;oxide interface, producing the perovskite surface states with a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite exhibits a ~500 fold enhanced photoluminescence with a ~10 fold reduced lifetime, indicating an unprecedented ~ 5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Radiative Decay in Blue Through&#8208;space Charge Transfer Emitters by Minimizing the Face&#8208;to&#8208;face Donor&#8208;acceptor Distances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorophors (TADF) featuring through&#8208;space charge transfers (TSCT) suffer from low radiative decay rates (krs), especially for blue emitters. Here, a xanthene bridge is adopted to construct space&#8208;confined face&#8208;to&#8208;face donor&#8208;acceptor alignment and minimize their distances down to 2.7&#8208;2.8 &#197;, even shorter than interlayer distance of graphite and thus strengthening the electronic interactions. The resulted blue TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit peaks around ~460 nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90%, and krs of nearly 107 s&#8208;1, almost 2&#8208;10 times higher than previously observations with comparable reverse intersystem crossing rates. The corresponding blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.8% and 34.7% with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage y coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15 using those molecules as emitters and sensitizers, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthoquinone &#8208; Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ordered Channel Structures for Ultrahigh Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborate molecular design on cathodes is of great importance for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries&#8217; performance elevation. Herein, we design a novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework with ordered channel structures (BT&#8208;PTO COF) cathode for an ultrahigh performance aqueous zinc&#8208;organic battery. The ordered channel structure facilitates ions transfer and makes the COF follow redox pseudocapacitance mechanism. Thus, it delivers a high reversible capacity of 225 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and an exceptional long&#8208;term cyclabilities (retention rate 98.0% at 5 A g&#8208;1 (~18 C) after 10,000 cycles). Moreover, a co&#8208;insertion mechanism with Zn2+ first followed by two H+ is uncovered for the first time. Significantly, this co&#8208;insertion behaviour evolves to more H+ insertion routes at high current density and gives the COF ultra&#8208;fast kinetics thus it achieves unprecedented specific power of 184 kW kg&#8208;1(COF) and a high energy density of 92.4 Wh kg&#8208;1(COF). Our work reports a superior organic materials for zinc battery and provides a design idea for future high performance organic cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Energy&#8208;Storage Nanoagent for Continuously Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative Stress Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of cellular oxidative stress plays a critical role in revealing the molecular mechanisms of cellular activities and thus is a potential strategy for tumor treatment. Optical methods have been employed for&#160;intelligent regulation of oxidative stress in tumor regions. However, long&#8208;time continuous irradiation inevitably causes damage to normal tissues. Herein, a ferrocene&#8208;containing nucleic acid&#8208;based energy&#8208;storage nanoagent was designed to achieve the continuous photo&#8208;regulation of cellular oxidative stress in the dark. Specifically, the photoenergy stored in the agent could convert effectively and accelerate Fenton&#8208;like reaction continuously, augmenting cellular oxidative stress. This nanoagent could also silence oxidative damage repair genes to further amplify oxidative stress. This strategy not only provides oxidative stress regulation for studying the molecular mechanisms of biological activities, but also offers a promising step toward tumor microenvironment modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular ROS&#8208;triggered Assembly of Artificial Enzyme for Initiating Catalytic Activity and Selective Imaging of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inside living cells, regulation of catalytic activity of artificial enzymes remains challenging due to issues such as biocompatibility, efficiency, and stability of the catalyst, by which the practical applications of artificial enzymes have been severely hindered. Here, an artificial enzyme, PTT&#8208;SGH, with reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsiveness was obtained by introducing a catalytic histidine residue to pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PTT). The artificial enzyme formed large aggregates in cells via the intracellular ROS&#8208;mediated oxidation of thiol groups. Such process was significantly facilitated in tumor cells because of the higher ROS concentration in tumor microenvironment. The catalytic activity of this artificial enzyme was intensively enhanced through deprotonation of cross&#8208;linked PTT&#8208;SGH, which showed typical esterase activities. Selective fluorescence imaging of tumor cells was achieved using the artificial enzyme to trigger the cleavage of ester bond of caged fluorophore inside living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>CLIPON: A CRISPR&#8208;Enabled Strategy that Turns Commercial Pregnancy Test Strips into General Point&#8208;of&#8208;Need Test Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Desirable biosensing assays need to be sensitive, specific, cost&#8208;effective, instrument&#8208;free, and versatile. Herein we report a new strategy termed CLIPON (CRISPR and  Large DNA assembly  Induced  Pregnancy strips for signal&#8208;ON&#160;detection) that can deliver these traits. CLIPON integrates commercial pregnancy test strip (PTS) with four biological elements: the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a, crRNA and  cauliflower&#8208;like  large&#8208;sized  DNA assemblies (CLD). CLIPON uses Cas12a/crRNA complex both to recognize a target of interest and to release CLD&#8208;bound hCG so that target presence can translate into a colorimetric signal on PTS. We demonstrate the versatility of CLIPON through sensitive and specific detection of HPV genomic DNA, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA and adenosine. We also engineer a cell phone app and hand&#8208;held microchip to achieve signal quantification. CLIPON represents an attractive option for biosensing and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Fluorescent Spherical Nucleic Acids Self&#8208;assembled from a DNA&#8208;Grafted Conjugated Polymer for Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ultralow concentration of nucleic acids in complex biological samples desires fluorescence probes with high specificity and sensitivity. Herein, a new kind of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) is developed by using fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) as a light&#8208;harvesting antenna to enhance the signal transduction of nucleic acid detection. Specifically, amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted FCPs are synthesized and self&#8208;assemble into FCP&#8208;SNA structures. Tuning the hydrophobicity of the graft copolymer can adjust the size and light&#8208;harvesting capability of the FCP&#8208;SNAs. We observe that more efficient signal amplification occurs in larger FCP&#8208;SNAs, as more chromophores are involved, and the energy transfer can go beyond the F&#246;rster radius. Accordingly, the optimized FCP&#8208;SNA shows an antenna effect of up to 37&#8208;fold signal amplification and the limit of detection down to 1.7 pM in microRNA detection. Consequently, the FCP&#8208;SNA is applied to amplified in situ nucleic acid detecting and imaging at the single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Sulfate Optical Materials Exhibiting Giant Second Harmonic Generation and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A HgII&#8208;based sulfate NLO crystal, Hg3O2SO4, which achieves a perfect balance between SHG coefficient and birefringence, exhibits a giant SHG response (14 times that of KDP), as well as an appropriate birefringence (0.10@546&#8197;nm) attributable to the unique component [Hg3O2SO4]&#8734; layers.







Abstract
Discovering novel sulfate optical materials with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and large birefringence is confronted by a great challenge attributed to the intrinsically weak polarizability and optical anisotropy of tetrahedral SO4 groups. Herein, two superior&#8208;performing sulfate optical materials, namely, noncentrosymmetric Hg3O2SO4 and centrosymmetric CsHgClSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, have been successfully synthesized through the introduction of a highly polarizable d10 metal cation, Hg2+. The unique component layers in the reported compounds, [Hg3O2SO4]&#8734; layers in Hg3O2SO4 and [HgClSO4(H2O)]
 layers in CsHgClSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, induce enlarged birefringence in each sulfate. Remarkably, Hg3O2SO4 exhibits a very large SHG response (14 times that of KH2PO4), which is the strongest efficiency among all the reported nonlinear optical sulfates. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the employment of highly polarizable Hg2+ is an effective strategy to design superior optical materials with large birefringence and strong SHG response.

         <title>Protein Ligation and Labeling Enabled by a C&#8208;Terminal Tetracysteine Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrazinolysis of S&#8208;cyanylated peptide provides an alternative way to afford protein &#945;&#8208;hydrazide&#8212;a key reagent used in the native chemical ligation (NCL)&#8212;without the aid of any inteins or enzymes. The currently used non&#8208;selective S&#8208;cyanylation, however, allows no other cysteine in the protein besides the one at the cleavage site. Herein, we report a regioselective S&#8208;cyanylation and hydrazinolysis strategy achieved via the fusion of a tetracysteine tag to the C&#8208;terminal of the protein of interest, and we term it tetracysteine enabled protein ligation (TCEPL). While highly selective, the strategy is applicable for proteins expressed as inclusion bodies, and this was showcased by the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of an iron&#8208;sulfur protein&#8212;rubredoxin and the catalytic and hinge domains of matrix metalloprotease&#8208;14 (MMP&#8208;14) containing 207 amino acid residues. Furthermore, the TCEPL strategy was exploited for protein C&#8208;terminal labeling with amino reagents bearing a variety of functional groups, demonstrating its versatility and generality.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy Effect of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ionic Compound: Dual Interfacial Energy Level Regulation and Passivation to Promote VOC and Stability of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects and energy offsets at the bulk and heterojunction interfaces of perovskite are detrimental to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed an amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound (QAPyBF  4  ), implementing simultaneous defects passivation and interface energy level alignments. The p&#8208;type conjugated cations passivated the surface trap states and optimized energy alignment at the perovskite/hole transport layer. The highly electronegative [BF  4  ]  &#8208;  enriched at the SnO  2  interface featured desired band alignment due to the dipole moment of this interlayer. The planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSC had an efficiency of 23.1% with V  OC  of 1.2 V. Notably, the synergy effect elevated the intrinsic endothermic decomposition temperature of the perovskite. The modified devices showed excellent long&#8208;term thermal (85 &#176;C) and operational stability at the maximum power point for 1000 h at 45 &#176;C under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination with no appreciable efficiency loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 Heteroarylation of Indole with Heteroarylnitriles by Organocatalysis under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first regioselective, parallel methodologies for N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 heteroarylation of indoles via radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling by visible light irradiation has been developed with the aid of organocatalysis. Mechanism studies revealed that the reaction pathway switches from energy&#8208;transfer to proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer by consecutive hydrogen&#8208;bonding association between the organic base and its conjugate acid, with the radical species of the indole and heteroarylnitrile.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 arylation of indole has been sought after because of the prevalent application of arylindoles and the intricate reactivities associated with the multiple sites of the N&#8208;unsubstituted indole. Represented herein is the first regioselective heteroarylation of indole via a radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling by visible&#8208;light irradiation. Steady and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic and computational studies revealed that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction of organic base and its conjugated acid, namely with indole and heteroarylnitrile, determined the reaction pathway, which underwent either proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer or energy&#8208;transfer for the subsequent radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling, leading to the regioselective formation of C&#8208;3 and N&#8208;1 heteroarylation of indoles, respectively. The parallel methodologies for regioisomeric N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 heteroaryl indoles with good functional group compatibility could be applied to large&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage derivatization of bioactive compounds under extremely mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Outstanding Multi&#8208;Photon Absorption at &#960;&#8208;Delocalizable Metallodendrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallodendrimers comprising bis(diphosphine)ruthenium units in a phenyleneethynylene&#8208;derived organic &#960;&#8208;framework are shown to display outstanding instantaneous multi&#8208;photon absorption. The key structural requirements for the rare five&#8208; and six&#8208;photon absorption seen with these compounds have been identified.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon absorption (MPA) has attracted interest for applications exploiting the tight spatial control of interaction volume and long wavelength excitation. However, a deficiency of molecules exhibiting higher&#8208;order nPA (n&#8208;photon absorption, n&gt;2) and a lack of structure&#8211;property studies to define the key structural characteristics needed to optimize higher&#8208;order MPA performance have hindered practical development. We herein report the syntheses of second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation metallodendrimers and assessment of their nonlinear absorption, together with those of zero&#8208; and first&#8208;generation analogues. We report the first 5PA and 6PA data for an organometallic. The largest dendrimer exhibits exceptional three&#8208;, four&#8208;, five&#8208; and six&#8208;photon absorption to femtosecond&#8208;pulsed light. The systematically varied compounds highlight the crucial role of metal&#8208;to&#8208;oligo(phenyleneethynylene) charge transfer in promoting outstanding MPA activity.

         <title>Asymmetrical&#8208;Dendronized TADF Emitters for Efficient Non&#8208;doped Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs by Eliminating Degenerate Excited States and Creating Solely Thermal Equilibrium Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two asymmetric &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8221; and &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8208;half&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; TADF emitters eliminate degenerate excited states, assuring a solely thermal equilibrium route for an effective spin&#8208;flip process. AEE properties can minimize the exciton quenching. The isolated encapsulating tricarbazole unit protects the TADF unit, reducing nonradiative decay. Non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a remarkably high EQEmax of 24.0&#8201;% and low roll&#8208;off are achieved.







Abstract
The mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in dendrimers is not clear. We report that fully&#8208;conjugated or fully&#8208;nonconjugated structures cause unwanted degenerate excited states due to multiple identical dendrons, which limit their TADF efficiency. We have synthesized asymmetrical &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8221; and &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8208;half&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; emitters. By eliminating degenerate excited states, the triplet locally excited state is &#8805;0.3&#8197;eV above the lowest triplet charge&#8208;transfer state, assuring a solely thermal equilibrium route for an effective spin&#8208;flip process. The isolated encapsulating tricarbazole unit can protect the TADF unit, reducing nonradiative decay and enhancing TADF performance. Non&#8208;doped solution&#8208;processed devices reach a high external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.0&#8201;% (65.9&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 59.2&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) with CIE coordinates of (0.24, 0.45) with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off and EQEs of 23.6&#8201;% and 21.3&#8201;% at 100 and 500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Na4B8O9F10: A Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Fluorooxoborate with Unexpected Short Phase&#8208;Matching Wavelength Induced by Optimized Chromatic Dispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na4B8O9F10, the first non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystal with [BF4]&#8722; units among the reported metal&#8208;fluorooxoborate systems, was designed and synthesized. It features isolated [BF4]&#8722; groups and novel [B7O10F6]5&#8722; fundamental building blocks, and achieves an unexpected short &#955;PM of 240&#8197;nm induced by optimized chromatic dispersion with such a small birefringence (0.036@1064&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Exploring significant ultraviolet/deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is hindered by rigorous and contradictory requirements, especially, possessing a moderate optical birefringence to meet phase&#8208;matching (PM). Except for suitable birefringence, small chromatic dispersion is also crucial to blue&#8208;shift the PM wavelength. Here, the introduction of a fluorinated tetrahedral boron&#8208;centred chromophore strategy was proposed to optimize the chromatic dispersion. Herein, the [BF4]&#8722; unit with a large HOMO&#8211;LUMO band gap was introduced to the Na&#8722;B&#8722;O&#8722;F system and Na4B8O9F10 was designed and synthesized successfully for the first time. Na4B8O9F10 with an optimized chromatic dispersion can achieve a short second harmonic generation PM wavelength of 240&#8197;nm with a relatively small birefringence (0.036@1064&#8197;nm). Notably, Na4B8O9F10 is the first acentric crystal with [BF4]&#8722; units among the reported metal&#8211;fluorooxoborate systems, involving isolated [BF4]&#8722; and novel [B7O10F6]5&#8722; fundamental building blocks.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene has been synthesized as the largest fully conjugated hetero[n]circulene via a fold&#8208;in oxidative fusion reaction of a cyclic pentapyrrole precursor. This circulene takes a saddle&#8208;distorted structure with bond lengths of the central ten&#8208;membered&#8208;ring in the range of 1.455&#8211;1.493&#8197;&#197;. The energy barrier for saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle interconversion was estimated to be quite small (&#8776;3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1).







Abstract
A pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene has been synthesized as the largest fully conjugated hetero[n]circulene via a fold&#8208;in oxidative fusion reaction of an ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged cyclic pyrrole pentamer.

Relatively broad absorption and fluorescence spectra were observed, which reflects its flexible structure, in accordance with the low&#8208;temperature NMR spectra and theoretical calculations. The energy barrier for saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle interconversion was estimated to be quite small (&#8776;3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1).

         <title>Asymmetric Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkenylazaarenes via Cooperative Photoredox and Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective hydroaminoalkylation of alkenyl azaarenes is described as the first successful catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition of radicals to activated olefins to directly forge stereocenters at their &#946;&#8208;position. The stereoselective transformation was made possible by the introduction of cooperative nonclassical H&#8208;bonding interactions, thus enabling the chiral catalyst to provide sufficient stereocontrol.







Abstract
Chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition to activated olefins has been widely used to access enantioenriched molecules containing stereocenters at the &#946;&#8208;position of the olefin activating groups. Herein, we report the first highly enantioselective radical&#8208;based manifold. Under a dual organocatalyst system involving a chiral phosphoric acid and DPZ as the photoredox sensitizer, transformations of N&#8208;arylglycines, in which aryls with CF3 substituents are introduced, with alkenyl azaarenes afforded valuable hydroaminoalkylation adducts with satisfactory results. In addition to the diversity of azaarenes, the method can be used to construct aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted stereocenter. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations were performed to elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism and the origin of stereoselectivity, wherein nonclassical H&#8208;bonding interactions were found to assist chiral catalysts in offering sufficient enantiocontrol.

         <title>Robust Luminescent Molecules with High&#8208;Level Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Efficient Near Ultraviolet Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high&#8208;quality near ultraviolet lights are obtained from a tailor&#8208;made molecule featuring high&#8208;level reverse intersystem crossing, providing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiencies with small roll&#8208;offs. Efficient blue OLEDs are realized by adopting this short&#8208;wavelength emission molecule as host for fluorescence, delayed fluorescence or phosphorescence emitters.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) radiating near ultraviolet (NUV) light are of high importance but rarely reported due to the lack of robust organic short&#8208;wavelength emitters. Here, we report a short &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule (POPCN&#8208;2CP) with high thermal and morphological stabilities and strong NUV photoluminescence. Its neat film exhibits an electroluminescence (EL) peak at 404&#8197;nm with a maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext,max) of 7.5&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off. The doped films of POPCN&#8208;2CP in both non&#8208;polar and polar hosts at a wide doping concentration range (10&#8211;80&#8197;wt%) achieve high&#8208;purity NUV light (388&#8211;404&#8197;nm) and excellent &#951;ext,maxs of up to 8.2&#8201;%. The high&#8208;level reverse intersystem crossing improves exciton utilization and accounts for the superb &#951;ext,maxs. POPCN&#8208;2CP can also serve as an efficient host for blue fluorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence emitters, providing excellent EL performance via F&#246;rster energy transfer.

         <title>Exceptional Manganese(II) Stability and Manganese(II)/Zinc(II) Selectivity with Rigid Polydentate Ligands**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the Irving&#8211;Williams series, found close to 75&#8197;years ago, manganese(II) complexes generally are significantly less stable than the corresponding zinc(II) complexes. Indeed, no ligands with manganese(II) versus zinc(II) selectivity have been known so far. Based on metal&#8208;ion size discrimination we now present hepta&#8208; and octadentate bispidine ligands with manganese(II) complex stabilities that are up to 10 orders of magnitude larger than those with zinc(II).







Abstract
While MnII complexes meet increasing interest in biomedical applications, ligands are lacking that enable high MnII complex stability and selectivity vs. ZnII, the most relevant biological competitor. We report here two new bispidine derivatives, which provide rigid and large coordination cavities that perfectly match the size of MnII, yielding eight&#8208;coordinate MnII complexes with record stabilities. In contrast, the smaller ZnII ion cannot accommodate all ligand donors, resulting in highly strained and less stable six&#8208;coordinate complexes. Combined theoretical and experimental data (X&#8208;ray crystallography, potentiometry, relaxometry and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy) demonstrate unprecedented selectivity for MnII vs. ZnII (KMnL/KZnL of 108&#8211;1010), in sharp contrast to the usual Irving&#8211;Williams behavior, and record MnII complex stabilities and inertness with logKMnL close to 25.

         <title>Polyyne [3]Rotaxanes: Synthesis via Dicobalt Carbonyl Complexes and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt carbonyl complexes have been used as temporary masking group, and temporary stoppers, in the synthesis of polyyne [3]rotaxanes with two macrocycles threaded on a C28 thread. Comparison of the thermal stability of two [3]rotaxanes with different threaded macrocycles shows that the 2,6&#8208;pyridyl cycloparaphenylene nanohoop effectively stabilizes the polyyne chain.







Abstract
New strategies for synthesizing polyyne polyrotaxanes are being developed as an approach to stable carbyne &#8220;insulated molecular wires&#8221;. Here we report an active metal template route to polyyne [3]rotaxanes, using dicobalt carbonyl masked alkyne equivalents. We synthesized two [3]rotaxanes, both with the same C28 polyyne dumbbell component, one with a phenanthroline&#8208;based macrocycle and one using a 2,6&#8208;pyridyl cycloparaphenylene nanohoop. The thermal stabilities of the two rotaxanes were compared with that of the naked polyyne dumbbell in decalin at 80&#8201;&#176;C, and the nanohoop rotaxane was found to be 4.5 times more stable.

         <title>Accessing Highly Efficient Photothermal Conversion with Stable Open&#8208;Shell Aromatic Nitric Acid Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic nitric acid radicals exhibit high spin and excellent electrochemical and photothermal stability. A high solar&#8208;energy&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 89.41&#8201;% and water evaporation rate of 1.293&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 were achieved under 1 sun irradiation.







Abstract
It is very challenging to prepare stable radicals as they are usually thermodynamically or kinetically unstable in air. Herein, a series of star&#8208;shaped aromatic nitric acid radicals were prepared via facile demethylation and consequent oxidation. As phenol radicals without steric hindrance group protection, they exhibit high electrochemical and thermal stability due to their rich resonance structures including closed&#8208;shell nitro&#8208;like and open&#8208;shell nitroxide structure with unpaired electrons delocalized in conjugated backbones. Among them, TPA&#8208;TPA&#8208;O6 powder exhibited extremely wide absorption from 300 to 2000&#8197;nm covering the whole solar spectral irradiance, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and negligible photobleaching effect in seawater desalination. Under the irradiation of one sunlight, the water evaporation efficiency of TPA&#8208;TPA&#8208;O6 is recorded to be as high as 89.41&#8201;% and the water evaporation rate is 1.293&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, which represents the top performance in pure organic small molecule photothermal materials.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nano&#8208;regulators with Cascading Activation for Photodynamic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nano&#8208;regulator (SPNT) with cascading intratumoral activation for apoptotic biomarker&#8208;induced indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibition is reported for combinational photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer.







Abstract
Combination photoimmunotherapy holds promise for tumor suppression; however, smart phototherapeutic agents that only activate their immune pharmaceutical action in tumors have been rarely developed. Herein, we report a semiconducting polymer (SP) nano&#8208;regulator (SPNT) with cascading activation for combinational photodynamic cancer immunotherapy. SPNT comprises an immunoregulator (M&#8208;Trp: 1&#8208;methyltryptophan) conjugating to the side chain of the SP backbone via an apoptotic biomarker&#8208;cleavable linker. Under near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPNT produces singlet oxygen to induce immunogenic apoptosis. Concurrently, an apoptotic biomarker is upregulated, which triggers the specific cleavage of M&#8208;Trp for indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) activity inhibition, regulatory T cells reduction and cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration. SPNT&#8208;mediated combination photodynamic immunotherapy thus reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, resulting in efficient suppression of tumors, and inhibition of lung metastasis.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Bispecific Peptide for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a bispecific T&#8208;cell engager (BiTE)&#8208;like molecule is proposed. The peptide consists of dual CD3 and integrin &#945;v&#946;3 targeting sequence, conjugated by a self&#8208;assembling peptide. The molecule is designed to target the CD3 receptor on T&#8197;cells and induce T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated cytolysis against tumor cells overexpressing integrin &#945;v&#946;3.







Abstract
Precise and effective manipulation of protein functions still faces tremendous challenges. Herein we report a programmable peptide molecule, consisted of targeting and self&#8208;assembly modules, that enables specific and highly efficient assembly governed by targeting receptor proteins. Upon binding to the cell membrane receptor, peptide conformation is somewhat stabilized along with decreased self&#8208;assembly activation energy, promoting peptide&#8208;protein complex oligomerization. We first design a GNNQQNY&#8208;RGD peptide (G7&#8208;RGD) to recognize integrin &#945;V&#946;3 receptor for proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. In the presence of &#945;V&#946;3 protein, the critical assembly concentration of free G7&#8208;RGD decreases from 525 to 33&#8197;&#956;M and the resultant G7&#8208;RGD cluster drives integrin receptor oligomerization. Finally, a bispecific assembling peptide antiCD3&#8208;G7&#8208;RGD is rationally designed for cancer immunotherapy, which validates CD3 oligomerization and concomitant T cell activation, leading to T cell&#8208;mediated cancer cell cytolysis.

         <title>Topochemical Polymerization of a Diacetylene in a Chalcogen&#8208;Bonded (ChB) Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No strong hydrogen bonding but weaker chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions are used for the first time to organize diacetylene molecules in the solid state for thermal topochemical polymerization. The obtained polydiacetylene, free of the pyridine&#8208;based ChB acceptor, exhibits an 8 orders of magnitude increase in conductivity upon iodine doping.







Abstract
The successful topochemical polymerization of bis(selenocyanatomethyl)butadyine 1 is achieved upon association in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;crystal with 1,2&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (2&#8208;bpen) through strong and linear (NC)&#8722;Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NPy chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions, allowing for an appropriate parallel alignment of the diacetylene moieties toward the solid&#8208;state reaction. Co&#8208;crystal 1&#8901;(2&#8208;bpen) undergoes polymerization upon heating at 100&#8201;&#176;C. The reaction progress was monitored by IR, DSC and PXRD. An enhancement of the polymer conductivity by 8 orders of magnitude is observed upon iodine doping. Strikingly, the course of polymerization is accompanied with sublimation of the ChB acceptor molecules 2&#8208;bpen, providing the polymer in a pure form with full recovery of the co&#8208;former, at variance with the usual hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal strategies toward polydiacetylenes.

         <title>Carbamoylated Guanidine&#8208;Containing Polymers for Non&#8208;Covalent Functional Protein Delivery in Serum&#8208;Containing Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenyl carbamoylated guanidine (Ph&#8208;CG) group contributes to the efficient delivery of bioactive proteins in serum&#8208;containing media owing to substantially low pKa, increased hydrophobicity, enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, and cellular entry.







Abstract
Despite the high potential of controlling cellular processes and treating various diseases by intracellularly delivered proteins, current delivery systems exhibit poor efficiency due to poor serum stability, cellular entry, and cytosolic availability of proteins. Here, we report a novel functional group, phenyl carbamoylated guanidine (Ph&#8208;CG), that greatly enhances the delivery efficiency to various types of cells. Owing to the substantially lowered pKa, the hydrophobic Ph&#8208;CG offers optimized inter&#8208;macromolecular interactions via enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The coplanarity of Ph&#8208;CG also leads to the better intracellular entry of protein complexes. Intracellularly delivered apoptosis&#8208;inducing enzymes and antibodies significantly induce cell viability inhibitions in a serum&#8208;containing medium. The newly developed Ph&#8208;CG can be introduced to various existing carriers, leading to the realization of future therapeutic protein delivery.

         <title>Torque&#8208;Driven Orientation Motion of Chemotactic Colloidal Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic cascade reactions occurring in the cavity of flasklike colloidal motors have been shown to lead to the consumption of the glucose fuel and a decreased glucose concentration gradient at the opening. The resulting imbalance of self&#8208;diffusiophoretic forces generates a phoretic torque on the flasklike colloidal motors, which continuously steers them to the glucose concentration gradient and thus results in a positive chemotaxis motion







Abstract
We report a direct experimental observation of the torque&#8208;driven active reorientation of glucose&#8208;fueled flasklike colloidal motors to a glucose gradient exhibiting a positive chemotaxis. These streamlined flasklike colloidal motors are prepared by combining a hydrothermal synthesis and a vacuum infusion and can be propelled by an enzymatic cascade reaction in the glucose fuel. Their flasklike architecture can be used to recognize their moving posture, and thus the dynamic glucose&#8208;gradient&#8208;induced alignment and orientation&#8208;dependent motility during positive chemotaxis can be examined experimentally. The chemotactic mechanism is that the enzymatic reactions inside lead to the glucose acid gradient and the glucose gradient which generate two phoretic torques at the bottom and the opening respectively, and thus continuously steer it to the glucose gradient. Such glucose&#8208;fueled flasklike colloidal motors resembling the chemotactic capability of living organisms hold considerable potential for engineering active delivery vehicles in response to specific chemical signals.

         <title>Inorganic Chiral Hybrid Nanostructures for Tailored Chiroptics and Chirality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of chiral hybrid nanostructures comprising chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and functional semiconductors are constructed via a general synthesis. The obtained hybrids show new and tunable chiroptical activity, and exhibit chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance of water splitting under circularly polarized light, paving the way for complex chiral nanostructures and new chiral light&#8211;matter interactions.







Abstract
Inorganic chiral hybrid nanostructures that embed chirality within distinct material compositions can create novel chiral properties and functionalities absent from achiral nanostructures; however, they remain largely unexplored. We report, for the first time, a class of chiral plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor core&#8208;shell nanostructures that employ structurally chiral nanoparticles as chirality inducing templates to grow functional shell materials, which allowed us to independently control material parameters such as core geometry and shell thickness, as well as handedness of the system. We experimentally and theoretically achieved enhanced and tunable chiroptical activity of the heterostructures as a result of the core&#8208;shell strong coupling effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we demonstrate that the chiral hybrid nanostructures can drive chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic hydrogen generation under circularly polarized light. This study enables rational design and functionalization of chiral hybrid nanomaterials towards enhanced chiral light&#8211;matter interactions and chiral device applications.

         <title>Direct Observation of Ultrafast Proton Rocking in the BLUF Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes of the OaPAC BLUF domain W mutant are uncovered to be forward sequential electron transfer and proton transfer followed by reverse sequential proton transfer and electron transfer mechanism. Significantly, the Grotthuss&#8208;type proton rocking process is unambiguously resolved in this system and the associated kinetic isotope effect is measured.







Abstract
We present direct observation of ultrafast proton rocking in the central motif of a BLUF domain protein scaffold. The mutant design has taken consideration of modulating the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) driving forces by replacing Tyr in the original motif with Trp, in order to remove the interference of a competing electron transfer pathway. Using femtosecond pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy and detailed kinetics analysis, we resolved an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;coupled Grotthuss&#8208;type forward and reverse proton rocking along the FMN&#8211;Gln&#8211;Trp proton relay chain. The rates of forward and reverse proton transfer are determined to be very close, namely 51&#8197;ps vs. 52&#8197;ps. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) constants associated with the forward and reverse proton transfer are 3.9 and 5.3, respectively. The observation of ultrafast proton rocking is not only a crucial step towards revealing the nature of proton relay in the BLUF domain, but also provides a new paradigm of proton transfer in proteins for theoretical investigations.

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Copper(I) Halides for High Efficiency Second Harmonic Generation with a Broadband Transparency Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides based on CuI with a large band gap have been constructed, which feature well&#8208;balanced nonlinear optical performances with highly efficient SHG response, outstanding optical transparency and stability. The effective second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient is two orders of magnitude higher than that of their CuII counterparts, which promises potential nonlinear photonic applications in wide wavelength regions.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) with intrinsic noncentrosymmetry have shown great promise for applications in second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO). However, established chiral HOMHs often suffer from their relatively small band gaps, which lead to negative impacts on transparent window and laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT). Here, we have synthesized two chiral HOMHs based on CuI halides, namely (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)CuBr2, which feature well&#8208;balanced NLO performances with a highly efficient SHG response, outstanding optical transparency, and high LDT. The effective second&#8208;order NLO coefficient of (R&#8208;MBA)CuBr2 has been determined to be &#8776;24.7&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of their CuII counterparts. This work shows the promising potential of CuI&#8208;based chiral HOMHs for nonlinear photonic applications in wide wavelength regions.

         <title>A Fluorescent Sensor for Quantitative Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Amyloid Fibril Assembly**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applicable in single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy, AmyBlink&#8208;1 facilitates nanoscale imaging of a range of amyloid fibrils, achieving a resolution of 30&#8197;nm. Cluster&#8208;detection analyses of the super&#8208;resolution images enable the quantification of the nanoscale morphological features of intermediates formed at different times in the amyloid assembly cascade.







Abstract
Many soluble proteins can self&#8208;assemble into macromolecular structures called amyloids, a subset of which are implicated in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. The nanoscale size and structural heterogeneity of prefibrillar and early aggregates, as well as mature amyloid fibrils, pose significant challenges for the quantification of amyloid morphologies. We report a fluorescent amyloid sensor AmyBlink&#8208;1 and its application in super&#8208;resolution imaging of amyloid structures. AmyBlink&#8208;1 exhibits a 5&#8208;fold increase in ratio of the green (thioflavin T) to red (Alexa Fluor 647) emission intensities upon interaction with amyloid fibrils. Using AmyBlink&#8208;1, we performed nanoscale imaging of four different types of amyloid fibrils, achieving a resolution of &#8776;30&#8197;nm. AmyBlink&#8208;1 enables nanoscale visualization and subsequent quantification of morphological features, such as the length and skew of individual amyloid aggregates formed at different times along the amyloid assembly pathway.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Functional Materials: Outstanding Catalysts to Support Efficient CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As hot topics in chemical conversion of CO2, photo/electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and using CO2 as a supporter for energy storage have shown great potential for CO2 utilization. However, many obstacles still exist on the road to realize high&#8208;efficient chemical CO2 conversion, such as inefficient uptake/activation of CO2 and mass transport in catalysts. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a kind of porous material, have been widely explored as catalysts in chemical CO2 conversion owing to their unique features. Especially, COFs&#8208;based functional materials offer great potential to realize CO2 conversion and energy storage when anchored with diverse active sites (such as single metal sites, metal nanoparticles, and metal oxides et al.). This minireview discusses the recent breakthroughs in basic knowledge, mechanisms, and pathways of these chemical CO2 conversion strategies using COFs&#8208;based functional catalysts. In addition, the challenges and prospects of COFs&#8208;based functional catalysts for efficient CO2 utilization have also been introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Organic Reactions by Resonant Acoustic Mixing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate catalytic organic synthesis by Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM): a methodology that does not require bulk solvent or milling media. Using as model reactions ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis and copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamide&#8208;isocyanate coupling, RAM mechanosynthesis is shown to be faster, operationally simpler than conventional ball&#8208;milling, while providing the first example of mechanochemical ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ene&#8208;yne metathesis. Reactions by RAM are readily scaled&#8208;up without significant changes in reaction conditions, as shown by the straightforward 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the synthesis of the antidiabetic drug Tolbutamide, from hundreds of milligrams directly to 30 grams.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed silylcyanation of ynamides is described. This reaction is fully regioselective, delivering tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles derivatives exclusively. Unexpectedly, the nature (aryl or alkyl) of the substituent located at the&amp;nbsp;&amp;beta;&#8208;position of the ynamide directly controls the stereoselectivity. The reaction tolerates a number of functional groups and can be considered as the first general access to fully substituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles. Given the singular reactivity observed, a computational study was performed to shed light on the mechanism of this intriguing transformation. Relying on the specific reactivity of the newly installed vinylsilane functionality, the scope of 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles has been enlarged by postfunctionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Lessons from an Array: Using an Electrode Surface to Control the Selectivity of a Solution&#8208;Phase Chemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of a preparative reaction to the surface of an electrode offers new opportunities to induce selectivity into the transformation.







Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a variety of novel means by which selectivity can be introduced into synthetic organic transformations. In the work reported, it is shown how methods used to confine chemical reactions to specific sites on a microelectrode array can also be used to confine a preparative reaction to the surface of an electrode inserted into a bulk reaction solution. In so doing, the surface of a modified electrode can be used to introduce new selectivity into a preparative reaction that is not observed in the absence of either the modified electrode surface or the effort to confine the reaction to that surface. The observed selectivity can be optimized in the same way that confinement is optimized on an array and is dependent on the nature of the functionalized surface.

         <title>Photoswitchable Epothilone&#8208;Based Microtubule Stabilisers Allow GFP&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Compatible, Optical Control over the Microtubule Cytoskeleton**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable epothilone&#8208;based microtubule stabiliser, STEpo, is introduced for high&#8208;precision cytoskeleton photocontrol in live cells. STEpo features a novel styrylthiazole photoswitch that is isosteric to azobenzene, but is compatible with GFP imaging, and can photomodulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding as well as sterics. STEpo photocontrols microtubule dynamics and cell division with micron&#8208; and second&#8208;scale resolution, and has mid&#8208;nanomolar potency.







Abstract
Optical methods to modulate microtubule dynamics show promise for reaching the micron&#8208; and millisecond&#8208;scale resolution needed to decrypt the roles of the cytoskeleton in biology. However, optical microtubule stabilisers are under&#8208;developed. We introduce &#8220;STEpos&#8221; as GFP&#8208;orthogonal, light&#8208;responsive epothilone&#8208;based microtubule stabilisers. They use a novel styrylthiazole photoswitch in a design to modulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding and steric effects that control epothilone potency. STEpos photocontrol microtubule dynamics and cell division with micron&#8208; and second&#8208;scale spatiotemporal precision. They substantially improve potency, solubility, and ease&#8208;of&#8208;use compared to previous optical microtubule stabilisers, and the structure&#8208;photoswitching&#8208;activity relationship insights in this work will guide future optimisations. The STEpo reagents can contribute greatly to high&#8208;precision research in cytoskeleton biophysics, cargo transport, cell motility, cell division, development, and neuroscience.

         <title>The Role of Copper Salts and O2 in the Mechanism of C&#926;N Bond Activation for Facilitating Nitrogen Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8801;N bond scission can be a potential avenue for functionalization of chemical bonds. We have conducted a computational study, using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio multireference CASSCF method, to unravel the intricate mechanistic pathways traversed in the copper&#8208;promoted, dioxygen assisted reaction for formation of aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehyde. This aryl isocyanate species acts as an active species for C&#8801;N bond cleavage of coordinated cyanide anion enabling nitrogen transfer to various aldehydes. Electronic structure analysis revealed that in all the reaction conditions radical&#8208;based pathways are operatives, which is in sound agreement with the experimental findings. The major driving force is CuII/I redox cycle initiated by single electron transfer from the carbon centre of the nitrile moiety. Our study revealed that the copper salts act as the &#8220;electron pool&#8221; in this unique nitrogen transfer reaction forming an aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Bipolar Hosts for RGB Phosphorescent OLEDs: Boosted by a &#8220;Butterfly&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Medium&#8208;Ring Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emitting layer based on host&#8208;guest system plays a crucial role in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While emitters have witnessed rapid progress in structural diversity, hosts still rely heavily on traditional structures and are underdeveloped. Herein, a &#8220;medium&#8208;ring&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design structurally nontraditional host molecules, which is not only rotatable enough to suppress close &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, thus reducing exciton annihilation, but also rigid enough to prevent excessive conformational flipping, thus inhibiting non&#8208;radiative decay. Accordingly, a brand&#8208;new type of bipolar hosts with a twisted &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped heptagonal acceptor (  EtBP  ), which features an electron&#8208;deficient benzophenone fragment with a flexible ethylidene bridge, have been developed. With satisfactory morphological stability and well&#8208;balanced hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting property, the  EtBP  &#8208;based bipolar hosts enable high&#8208;performance RGB phosphorescent OLEDs with small efficiency roll&#8208;off, which are superior to those of acyclic benzophenone&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones through allenylic alkylation of vinyl azides is reported. In these chemodivergent reactions, cooperatively catalyzed by a Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) complex and Sc(OTf)3, vinyl azides act as the surrogate for both amide enolates and ketone enolates. The desiccant (molecular sieves) plays a crucial role in controlling the chemodivergency of this enantioconvergent and regioselective reaction: Under otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of the desiccant led to &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides while its absence resulted in &#945;&#8208;allenylic ketones. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, the overall process represents a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT), where both the products are formed with the same absolute configuration. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of vinyl azide as the ketone enolate surrogate in an enantioselective transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Sulfinates as Source of Alkyl Radicals in the Photo&#8208;Enantiocontrolled &#946;&#8208;Functionalization of Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented use of gem&#8208;difluoro sulfinates in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis for the construction of new C&#8722;C bonds in a chiral fashion is presented. This was tackled by rerouting the chemical pathway of alkyl sulfonyl radicals from traditional sulfonylation to alkylation performance. The efficacy of these sulfinates for assisting SO2 extrusion is shown by allowing the installation of CF2&#8208;bearing scaffolds, a modern task in the pharmaceutical arena.







Abstract
The generation of sulfonyl radicals has long been known as a flexible strategy in a wide range of different sulfonylative transformations. Meanwhile their use in alkylation processes has been somehow limited due to their inherent difficulty in evolving to less&#8208;stable radicals after sulfur dioxide extrusion. Herein we report a convenient strategy that involves gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfinates as an &#8220;upgrading&#8208;mask&#8221;, allowing these precursors to decompose into their corresponding alkyl radicals. The electron&#8211;donor character of sulfinates in the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex with transient iminium ions is displayed, achieving the first example of a stereocontrolled light&#8208;driven insertion of gem&#8208;difluoro derivatives into unsaturated aldehydes. This methodology is compatible with flow conditions, maintaining identical levels of enantiocontrol.

The efficacy of these sulfinates for assisting SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extrusion is shown by allowing the installation of CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bearing scaffolds, a modern task in the pharmaceutical arena.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation of sulfonyl radicals has long been known as a flexible strategy in a wide range of different sulfonylative transformations. Meanwhile their use in alkylation processes has been somehow limited due to their inherent difficulty in evolving to less-stable radicals after sulfur dioxide extrusion. Herein we report a convenient strategy that involves &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorinated sulfinates as an &#8220;upgrading-mask&#8221;, allowing these precursors to decompose into their corresponding alkyl radicals. The electron&#8211;donor character of sulfinates in the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex with transient iminium ions is displayed, achieving the first example of a stereocontrolled light-driven insertion of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoro derivatives into unsaturated aldehydes. This methodology is compatible with flow conditions, maintaining identical levels of enantiocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium salts were used as new phase&#8208;transfer organocatalysts for asymmetric alkylation to construct 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine motifs containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon centers in high yields with excellent cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the possible reaction mechanism and the origins of the exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Novel asymmetric mono&#8208; and dialkylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;substituted 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines catalyzed by new chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium organocatalysts have been developed, resulting in a range of enantioenriched 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine derivatives containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters. The reactions feature high yields (up to 98%), and excellent cis&#8208;diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and they provide a new asymmetric synthetic approach to important functionalized 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine skeletons. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed based on both control experiments and extensive DFT calculations.

         <title>The Assembly and Jamming of Nanoparticle Surfactants at Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The attachment mechanism of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs), which are generated by the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and polymeric ligands at the interface, is demonstrated. The binding energy of the NPS to the interface can be adjusted, and a size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be triggered or suppressed by controlling the packing state of NPSs.







Abstract
Using the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and polymeric ligands to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface, the binding energy of the NP to the interface can be significantly increased, irreversibly binding the NPSs to the interface. By designing a simplified NPS model, where the NP size can be precisely controlled and the characteristic fluorescence of the NPs be used as a direct probe of their spatial distribution, we provide new insights into the attachment mechanism of NPSs at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. We find that the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be reduced by competitive ligands, resulting in the dissociation and disassembly of NPSs at the interface, and allowing the construction of responsive, reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid systems. Smaller NPSs that are loosely packed (unjammed) and irreversibly bound to the interface can be displaced by larger NPSs, giving rise to a size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface. However, when the smaller size NPSs are densely packed and jam at the interface, the size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be completely suppressed.

         <title>Mechanochemical Grignard Reactions with Gaseous CO2 and Sodium Methyl Carbonate**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grignard&#8208;type reactions have been performed in ball mills providing carboxylic acids from organobromides with gaseous CO2 or sodium methyl carbonate (SMC) as C1&#8208;synthon. The transformations are solvent&#8208;free and occur in the presence of LiOH under liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) conditions with 2&#8197;equivalents of 2&#8208;MeTHF as ethereal additive.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step protocol for the preparation of Grignard reagents from organobromides in a ball mill and their subsequent reactions with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) or sodium methyl carbonate providing aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids in up to 82&#8201;% yield is reported. Noteworthy are the short reaction times and the significantly reduced solvent amounts [2.0&#8197;equiv. for liquid assisted grinding (LAG) conditions]. Unexpectedly, aryl bromides with methoxy substituents lead to symmetric ketones as major products.

         <title>Insight into Structural Evolution, Active Sites, and Stability of Heterogeneous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution is crucial to the development of active sites for renewable energy&#8208;conversion technologies involving heterogeneous electrocatalysis. In this Minireview, fundamental concepts related to structural evolution are described. A critical overview of multiple triggers, reversibility and operando characterizations is presented, and the application of structural evolution in important electrocatalytic reactions is presented.







Abstract
Studying structure&#8211;activity correlations of electrocatalysts is essential for improving the conversion of electrical to chemical energy. Recently, increasing evidence obtained by operando characterization techniques reveal that the structural evolution of catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates brings about the formation of real active sites. Hence, it is time to summarize structural evolution related research advances and envisage future developments. In this Minireview, we first introduce the fundamental concepts associated with structural evolution (e.g., catalysts, active sites/centers and stability/lifetime) and their relevance. Then, the multiple triggers of structural evolution and advanced operando characterizations are discussed. Significantly, a brief overview of structural evolution and its reversibility in heterogeneous electrocatalysis is provided, especially for the representative electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) processes. Lastly, key challenges and opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Structural evolution is crucial to the development of active sites for renewable energy-conversion technologies involving heterogeneous electrocatalysis. In this Minireview, fundamental concepts related to structural evolution are described. A critical overview of multiple triggers, reversibility and operando characterizations is presented, and the application of structural evolution in important electrocatalytic reactions is presented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying structure&#8211;activity correlations of electrocatalysts is essential for improving the conversion of electrical to chemical energy. Recently, increasing evidence obtained by operando characterization techniques reveal that the structural evolution of catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates brings about the formation of real active sites. Hence, it is time to summarize structural evolution related research advances and envisage future developments. In this Minireview, we first introduce the fundamental concepts associated with structural evolution (e.g., catalysts, active sites/centers and stability/lifetime) and their relevance. Then, the multiple triggers of structural evolution and advanced operando characterizations are discussed. Significantly, a brief overview of structural evolution and its reversibility in heterogeneous electrocatalysis is provided, especially for the representative electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) processes. Lastly, key challenges and opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Perovskite Solar Cells: A New Tool for Improving Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their poor stability in air and moisture still hinders their practical implementation. Preliminary data have shown that halogen bonding affords improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures, paving the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (HOIHPs) have recently emerged as a flourishing area of research. Their easy and low&#8208;cost production and their unique optoelectronic properties make them promising materials for many applications. In particular, HOIHPs hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their practical implementation is still hindered by their poor stability in air and moisture, which is responsible for their short lifetime. Optimizing the chemical composition of materials and exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions for interfacial and defects engineering, as well as defect passivation, are efficient routes towards enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Due to the rich halogen chemistry of HOIHPs, exploiting halogen bonding, in particular, may pave the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs. Improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures have already been preliminarily demonstrated.

         <title>A Metallofullertube of Ce2@C100 with Carbon Nanotube Segment: Synthesis, Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end&#8208;capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterizations of a metallofullertube Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  , which has a tubular C  100  cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  and spherical Ce  2  @  I  h  &#8208;C  80  , the structure&#8208;property relationship has been compared for them by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single&#8208;molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  was up to eight times larger than that of Ce  2  @  I  h  &#8208;C  80  . Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  and [12]CPP nanohoop was investigated, and theoretical calculations revealed that metallofullertube Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  adopted a &#8220;standing&#8221; configuration in the cavity of [12]CPP. These results demonstrate the special nature of this kind of metallofullertube.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;natural protein&#8208;protein communication mediated by a DNA&#8208;based, antibody&#8208;responsive device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the rational design and optimization of an antibody responsive, DNA&#8208;based device that enables communication between pairs of otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins. The device is designed to recognize and bind a specific antibody and, in response, undergo a conformational change that leads to the release of a DNA strand, termed the &#8220;translator,&#8221; that regulates the activity of a downstream target protein. As proof of principle, we demonstrate antibody&#8208;induced control of the proteins thrombin and Taq DNA polymerase. The resulting strategy is versatile and, in principle, can be easily adapted to control artificial protein&#8208;protein communication in artificial regulatory networks.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric reductive cyclization/coupling of 1,6&#8208;dienes. The reaction provides an efficient method for constructing a chiral tertiary alcohol and a quaternary stereocenter by a single operation. The method has excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, a broad substrate scope, as well as good tolerance of functional groups. Preliminary mechanism studies show that alkyl nickel(I) species are&#160;involved in the reaction.</dc:description>

The In SAs/NSBC exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity of above 95% in a wide range of pH. Furthermore, the In SAs/NSBC&#8208;modified natural air diffusion electrode exhibits an unprecedented production rate of 6.49 peroxide gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte and 6.71 mol peroxide gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte, respectively.

         <title>Inhibition of ACE2&#8208;Spike interaction by an ACE2 binder suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants is a significant concern in developing effective therapeutics and vaccines in the middle of the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we identified a novel small molecule that inhibited the interactions between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBDs and ACE2 by modulating ACE2 without impairing its enzymatic activity necessary for normal physiological functions. Furthermore, the identified compounds suppressed viral infection in cultured cells by inhibiting the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our study suggests that targeting ACE2 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry into host cells and prevent the development of COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Potential Hold Method for Fostering Inorganic Solid&#8208;electrolyte Interphase for Anode&#8208;free Lithium&#8208;metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free lithium batteries are regarded as an ultimate form of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, irreversible lithium loss during cycling plays a major role in degrading the overall cell performance in the anode&#8208;free configuration. To alleviate the deterioration, building a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interface on an anode current collector is an indispensable requirement. Here, we present a facile in&#8208;situ electrochemical method of a potential hold during the first charge to guide more salt&#8208;derived (less solvent&#8208;derived) decomposition on the anode interface. We show the distinctive decomposition potential of lithium salts and ether/carbonate solvents, where the Li&#8208;solvation structures with salt contact&#8208;ion&#8208;pairs preferentially decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich and less organic components, leading to enhanced lithium Coulombic efficiency in Li||Cu cells as well as mitigating the capacity fade of Cu||LiFePO4 and Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical hydrogenation of furfural in aqueous acetic acid media with enhanced 2&#8208;methylfuran selectivity using CuPd bimetallic catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a series of CuPd catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF or FurCH  3  where Fur = furyl) in aqueous 0.1 M acetic acid (pH 2.9). The highest faradaic efficiency (FE) for MF reached 75 % at &#8208;0.58 V  vs  . reversible hydrogen electrode with an average partial current density of 4.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  .  In situ  surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic experiments&#160;suggested that electrogenerated adsorbed hydrogen (H  ads  ) was involved in the reaction and incorporation of Pd enhanced the surface coverage of H  ads  and optimized the adsorption pattern of furfural, leading to a higher FE for MF.&#160;Density functional theory calculations revealed that Pd incorporation reduced the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of FurCH  2  *  to FurCH  3  *  . Our study demonstrates that catalyst surface structure/composition plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity in ECH and provides a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for ECH of bio&#8208;derived oxygenates.</dc:description>
