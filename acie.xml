         <title>Enantioconvergent Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkylation of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioconvergent catalysis enables the conversion of racemic molecules into a single enantiomer in perfect yield and is considered an ideal approach for asymmetric synthesis. Despite remarkable advances in this field, enantioconvergent transformations of inert tertiary C&#8722;H bonds remain largely unexplored due to the high bond dissociation energy and the surrounding steric repulsion that pose unparalleled constraints on bond cleavage and formation. Here, we report an enantioconvergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds of &#945;&#8208;alkenes, providing a unique approach to access a broad range of enantioenriched &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that a stereoablative event occurs through the rate&#8208;limiting cleavage of tertiary allylic C&#8211;H bonds to generate &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species, and the achieved E/Z&#8208;selectivity of &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species effectively regulates the diastereoselectivity via a nucleophile coordination&#8208;enabled SN2'&#8208;allylation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Changes the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Pathway over Cu Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S atoms adsorbed on metallic Cu surfaces can significantly inhibit CO2 reduction to CO while promoting formate formation in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported as capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We show that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote the formation of the *OCHO intermediate but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.

         <title>BiBr3&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization of Aza&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed to construct the versatile 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;ABN) ring system with a variety of substitution patterns and then applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of six suaveoline and sarpagine alkaloids: macrophylline, suaveoline, norsuaveoline, affinisine, normacusine B and Na&#8208;Me&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine.







Abstract
An intramolecular aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed in which bismuth tribromide (BiBr3) plays a dual role as an efficient Lewis acid and source of the bromide nucleophile. This approach enables the facile construction of highly functionalized 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes (9&#8208;ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform for the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products and drug molecules. Suitable substrates for the aza&#8208;Prins cyclization include 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes, with good to excellent yields observed. Finally, we showcase the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total synthesis of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;suaveoline (1), (&#8722;)&#8208;norsuaveoline (2), (&#8722;)&#8208;macrophylline (3), (+)&#8208;normacusine B (4), (+)&#8208;Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine (5) and (+)&#8208;affinisine (6) in a total of 9&#8211;14&#8197;steps. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of the aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement, and the strategy (aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/aza&#8208;Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.

         <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing and Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated State Induced by Space Intramolecular Charge Transfer in a Parallel Geometry Carbazole&#8208;Bodipy Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through space intramolecular charge transfer, a compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor (cabazole&#8208;bodipy) dyad with face&#8208;to&#8208;face geometry exhibits long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns) and efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%). This discovery opens a new avenue for designing efficient photosensitizers and photonic applications that depend on long&#8208;lived excited states generation.







Abstract
The design of efficient heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) based on through bond charge transfer (TBCT) features is a formidable challenge due to the criteria of orthogonal donor&#8208;acceptor geometry. Herein, we propose using parallel (face&#8208;to&#8208;face) conformation carbazole&#8208;bodipy donor&#8208;acceptor dyads (BCZ&#8208;1 and BCZ&#8208;2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%) and long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (&#964;T=186&#8197;&#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyad BCZ&#8208;1 compared to BCZ&#8208;3 (&#934;&#916;=0.4&#8201;%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor&#8208;acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ&#8208;1 (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11&#8201;% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;to&#8208;Small Molecule Converter through Amplified Hairpin DNA Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realize the conversion of nucleic acid input into small molecule output using hairpin DNA circuits. The systems are combined with the biorthogonal Staudinger reduction to release fluorophore, dye, and anticancer agent triggered by oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Our approach would have great potential for efficient detection and chemotherapy of cancers based on nucleic acid expression profiles.







Abstract
Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid&#8208;to&#8208;small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR&#8208;21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR&#8208;21&#8208;abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN&#8208;38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small&#8208;molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.

&lt;p&gt;We realize the conversion of nucleic acid input into small molecule output using hairpin DNA circuits. The systems are combined with the biorthogonal Staudinger reduction to release fluorophore, dye, and anticancer agent triggered by oncogenic miR-21. Our approach would have great potential for efficient detection and chemotherapy of cancers based on nucleic acid expression profiles.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid-to-small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR-21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR-21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR-21-abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN-38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small-molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Molecular Structure and Confining Environment of an Organometallic Catalyst Heterogenized within Amorphous Porous Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural elucidation of active sites in amorphous host materials is demonstrated by combining cutting&#8208;edge NMR techniques with pair distribution function analysis and computational chemistry. The detailed structure of the heterogenized organometallic complex and its confinement within two amorphous porous organic polymers is revealed by computation and confirmed by dedicated NMR techniques.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of multifunctional, microporous materials is directly linked to the spatial arrangement of their structural building blocks. Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic&#8208;level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non&#8208;crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR, and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh&#8208;based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine&#8208;based porous polymers is obtained. Small, but significant, differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Arylglycines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Sch&#246;llkopf Bis&#8208;Lactim Ethers with Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide promote the coupling of chiral tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived Sch&#246;llkopf bis&#8208;lactim ether with cheap aryl chlorides at room temperature in yields up to 95&#8201;% and &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. This enables a convenient access to non&#8208;natural tertiary arylglycines, which are key structural motifs in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This protocol is also suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of common pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Arylglycines are important pharmacophores present in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This compound class has now been made accessible from abundant aryl chlorides by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type amino acid synthesis. In the presence of the catalyst methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide, the base lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidide and the additive ZnCl2, tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived bis&#8208;lactim ethers were efficiently arylated at room temperature, reaching yields of 95&#8201;% and diastereoselectivities of 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Hydrolysis gave the corresponding arylglycines in high enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Melleolides from Basidiomycota Fungi: Mechanistic Analysis of the Multifunctional GMC Oxidase Mld7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the total biosynthesis of the melleolide sesquiterpenoids produced by Basidiomycota fungi revealed that the glucose&#8208;methanol&#8208;choline oxidase enzyme Mld7 is a key enzyme that catalyzes multistep reactions leading to two different types of melleolides. Notably, these two reactions are highly regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.







Abstract
Mushroom terpenoids are biologically and chemically diverse fungal metabolites. Among them, melleolides are representative sesquiterpenoids with a characteristic protoilludane skeleton. In this study, we applied a recently established hot spot knock&#8208;in method to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxymelleolide. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene core involves the cytochrome P450 catalyzing stepwise hydroxylation of the &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene framework and a stereochemical inversion process at the C5 position catalyzed by short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. The highlight of the biosynthesis is that the flavoprotein Mld7 catalyzes an oxidation&#8208;triggered double&#8208;bond shift accompanying dehydration and acyl&#8208;group&#8208;assisted substitution with two different nucleophiles at the C6 position to afford the &#916;7&#8208;protoilludene derivatives, such as melleolide and armillarivin. The complex reaction mechanism was proposed by DFT calculations. Of particular importance is that product distribution is regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.

         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, highlighting the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering strategy.







Abstract
It is of great strategic significance to develop highly efficient narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be utilized to manufacture ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays and meet or approach the requirements of Broadcast Television 2020 (B.T.2020) color gamut standards. This motif poses challenges for molecular design and synthesis, especially for developing generality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular structures. The emergence of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters has ingeniously solved the problems and demonstrated bright application prospects in the field of UHD displays, sparking a research boom. This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, with emphasis on the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) strategy. It combines the outstanding advantages of MR framework and donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, and can achieve red&#8208;shift and narrowband emission simultaneously, which is of great significance in the development of long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters with emission maxima especially exceeding 500&#8197;nm. We hope that this Minireview would provide some inspiration for what could transpire in the future.

         <title>StereoPHIP: Stereoselective Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral enol pyruvate ester with chiral catalysts followed by polarization transfer to 13C affords highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate derivatives with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) followed by polarization transfer to 13C is a rapidly developing technique for the generation of 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized substrates. Chirality plays an essential role in living systems and differential metabolism of enantiomeric pairs of metabolic substrates is well documented. Inspired by asymmetric hydrogenation, here we report stereoPHIP, which involves the addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral substrate with a chiral catalyst followed by polarization transfer to 13C spins. We demonstrate that parahydrogen could be rapidly added to the prochiral precursor to both enantiomers of lactic acid (D and L), with both the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of a chiral rhodium(I) catalyst to afford highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate ester derivatives, respectively, with excellent stereoselectivity. We also show that the hyperpolarized 1H signal decays obtained with the (R,R) and (S,S) catalysts were markedly different. StereoPHIP expands the scope of conventional PHIP to the production of 13C hyperpolarized chiral substrates with high stereoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral enol pyruvate ester with chiral catalysts followed by polarization transfer to &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C affords highly &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-lactate derivatives with excellent stereoselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) followed by polarization transfer to &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is a rapidly developing technique for the generation of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-hyperpolarized substrates. Chirality plays an essential role in living systems and differential metabolism of enantiomeric pairs of metabolic substrates is well documented. Inspired by asymmetric hydrogenation, here we report stereoPHIP, which involves the addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral substrate with a chiral catalyst followed by polarization transfer to &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C spins. We demonstrate that parahydrogen could be rapidly added to the prochiral precursor to both enantiomers of lactic acid (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;), with both the (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) enantiomers of a chiral rhodium(I) catalyst to afford highly &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-lactate ester derivatives, respectively, with excellent stereoselectivity. We also show that the hyperpolarized &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H signal decays obtained with the (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) catalysts were markedly different. StereoPHIP expands the scope of conventional PHIP to the production of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C hyperpolarized chiral substrates with high stereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Golgi&#8208;Targeted Platinum Complex Plays a Dual Role in Autophagy Regulation for Highly Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum(II) complex can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk, resulting in complete elimination of tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo.







Abstract
Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but the Golgi&#8208;autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum (II) complex Pt3, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano&#8208;encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti&#8208;tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that Pt3 induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down&#8208;regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi&#8208;dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, Pt3 is the first Golgi&#8208;targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence in Multi&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Type Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules has been observed. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion in organic molecular systems is one of the promising technologies for future energy harvesting systems because these systems can generate excitons that possess higher energy than excitation energy. The photon&#8208;upconversion caused by absorbing ambient heat as additional energy is particularly interesting because it could ideally provide a light&#8208;driving cooling system. However, only a few organic molecular systems have been reported. Here, we report the anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state. The anti&#8208;Stokes shift corresponded well to the 1&#8211;0 vibration transition from the ground state to the excited singlet state, and we further evaluated a correlation between the activation energy for the ASPL intensity and the TADF process. Our demonstration underlines that MR&#8208;TADF molecules have become a novel class of ASPL materials for various future applications, such as light&#8208;driving cooling systems.

         <title>Eutectic&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte with the Enhanced Lithium Salt Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of eutectic&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte is elaborately designed and prepared. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations confirm that the electrophilic succinonitrile (SN) interacts with poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA), effectively promotes the dissociation of lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB), thus resulting the excellent comprehensive electrochemical performances.







Abstract
The deployment of lithium metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries with polymer electrolytes has been recognized as a promising approach to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technologies. However, the practical application of the polymer electrolytes is currently constrained by various challenges, including low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrochemical window, and poor interface stability. To address these issues, a novel eutectic&#8208;based polymer electrolyte consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) is developed. The research results demonstrate that the interactions between SN and PEGMEA promote the dissociation of the lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) salt and increase the concentration of free Li+. The well&#8208;designed eutectic&#8208;based PAN1.2&#8208;SPE (PEGMEA: SN=1: 1.2 mass ratio) exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.30&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and superior interface stability with Li anode. The Li/Li symmetric cell based on PAN1.2&#8208;SPE enables long&#8208;term plating/stripping at 0.3 and 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li/LiFePO4 cell achieves superior long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 1500 cycles). Moreover, Li/LiFePO4 and Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 pouch cells employing PAN1.2&#8208;SPE demonstrate excellent cycling and safety characteristics. This study presents a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes and promotes the practical application of high&#8208;stable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Enamides or Enecarbamates with Racemic &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides

         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of enamides or enecarbamates with racemic &#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts with full control of the newly formed vicinal stereocenters is reported. A wide variety of enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically enriched chiral &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives were directly obtained through a key sequential process of enantioselective hydronickelation&#8211;enantioconvergent alkylation.







Abstract
Catalytic methods which control multiple stereogenic centers simultaneously are highly desirable in modern organic synthesis and chemical manufacturing. Herein, we report a regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation process which proceeds with simultaneous control of vicinal stereocenters originating from two readily accessible partners, prochiral internal alkenes (enamides or enecarbamates) and racemic alkyl electrophiles (&#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts). This reaction produces high&#8208;value &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives under mild conditions and with precise selectivity. Preliminary studies of the mechanism indicate that the reaction involves an enantioselective syn&#8208;hydronickelation to generate an enantiomerically enriched alkylnickel(II) species. Subsequent enantioconvergent alkylation with a racemic alkyl electrophile generates the desired product as a single stereoisomer.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Stereoconvergent C&#8722;H Borylation of Enamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides through C&#8722;H borylation, providing a versatile means of creating stereodefined enamides. The remarkable feature of this methodology is its stereoconvergent nature, which enables the utilization of starting materials with both E and Z configurations.







Abstract
Enamides, functional derivatives of enamines, play a significant role as synthetic targets. However, the stereoselective synthesis of these molecules has posed a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry, particularly for acyclic enamides that are less thermodynamically stable. In this study, we present a general strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides by C&#8722;H borylation, which provides a versatile platform for generating the stereodefined enamides. Our approach involves the utilization of metalloid borenium cation, generated through the reaction of BBr3 and enamides in the presence of two different additives, avoiding any exogenous catalyst. Importantly, the stereoconvergent nature of this methodology allows for the use of starting materials with mixed E/Z configurations, thus highlighting the unique advantage of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations have shed light on the pivotal roles played by the two additives, the reactive boron species, and the phenomenon of stereoconvergence.

         <title>N = 8 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons: Solution Synthesis and High Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have emerged as promising candidates for nanoelectronic devices. Low bandgap (&lt; 1 eV) GNRs are particularly important when considering the Schottky barrier in device performance. Here, we demonstrate the first solution synthesis of 8&#8208;AGNRs through a carefully designed arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The efficiency of the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of the tailor&#8208;made polymer precursor into 8&#8208;AGNRs was validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy, and further supported by the synthesis of naphtho[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene derivatives (1 and 2) as subunits of 8&#8208;AGNR, with a width of 0.86 nm as suggested by the X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and solid&#8208;state NMR analyses provided further structural support for 8&#8208;AGNR. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibited a remarkable NIR absorption extending up to &#8764;2400 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap as low as &#8764;0.52 eV. Moreover, optical&#8208;pump TeraHertz&#8208;probe spectroscopy revealed charge&#8208;carrier mobility in the dc limit of &#8764;270 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 for the 8&#8208;AGNR.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Role of Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Tethered Benzimidazolium Cation in Promoting CO2/Pure Water Co&#8208;Electrolysis to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), as a promising route to realize negative carbon emissions, is known to be strongly affected by electrolyte cations (i.e., cation effect). In contrast to the widely&#8208;studied alkali cations in liquid electrolytes, the effect of organic cations grafted on alkaline polyelectrolytes (APE) remains unexplored, although APE has already become an essential component of CO2 electrolyzers. Herein, by studying the organic cation effect on CO2RR, we find that benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) significantly outperforms other commonly&#8208;used nitrogenous cations (R4N+) in promoting C2+(mainly C2H4) production over copper electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and in&#8208;situ spectroscopy studies reveal that the Beim+ can synergistically boost the CO2 to *CO conversion and reduce the proton supply at the electrocatalytic interface, thus facilitating the *CO dimerization toward C2+&#160;formation. By utilizing the homemade APE ionomer, we further realize efficient C2H4 production at an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 331 mA cm&#8208;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis, thanks to the dual&#8208;role of Beim+ in synergistic catalysis and ionic conduction. This study provides a new avenue to boost CO2RR through the structural design of polyelectrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Biogenetic Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents that Produce Self&#8208;Assembled Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) show particular properties compared to ionic liquids and other traditional organic solvents. Controlled synthesis of chiral materials in DESs is unprecedented due to the complex interplays between DESs and solutes. In this work, all bio&#8208;derived chiral DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, which performed as chiral matrices for the rational synthesis of chiroptical materials taking advantages of efficient chirality transfer between DESs and solutes. In a very selective manner, building units with molecular pockets could facilitate the strong binding affinity towards chiral acid components of DESs disregarding the presence of competitive hydrogen bonding acceptors. Chirality transfer from DESs to nanoassemblies undergoes chirality amplification in the presence of minimal entrapped chiral acids, thanks to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of solutes during aggregation. This work firstly utilizes chiral DESs to control supramolecular chirality, and illustrates the structural basis for the fabrication of DESs&#8208;based chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Solvent Processable, Asymmetric Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport&#160;Layer Material&#160;for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of dopant&#8208;free hole transport layers (HTLs) is critical in stabilizing n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). However, these HTL materials are often processed with toxic solvents, which is not ideal for industrial production. Upon substituting them with green solvents, a trade&#8208;off emerges between maintaining the high crystallinity of the HTL materials and ensuring high solubility in the new solvents. In this paper, we designed a novel, linear, organic small molecule, BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O, by introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. This method not only overcomes the solubility limitations in green solvents but also enables stacking the conjugated main chains in two patterns, which further enhances crystallinity and hole mobility. As a result, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p pero&#8208;SCs based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or green (natural compound) solvent 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL that without any dopant delivered world&#8208;recorded PCEs of 24.11% (certified of 23.82%) and 23.53%, respectively. The devices also demonstrated remarkable operational and high&#8208;temperature stabilities, maintaining over 84% and 79.5% of their initial efficiency for 2000 h, respectively. Encouragingly, dopant&#8208;free BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL exhibits significant advantages in large&#8208;area fabrication, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCEs exceeding 20% for 5&#215;5 cm2 modules (active area: 15.64 cm2), even when processed using green solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Cyclodextrin Polymer&#160;Enables&#160;Dendrite&#8208;Free and Ultra&#8208;Long Life&#160;Solid&#8208;State Zn&#8208;I 2 &#160;Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;I2&#160;batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their performance is still limited by the irreversible growth of Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and shuttle effect of polyiodide. In this work, we have prepared&#160;a new&#160;porous polymer (CD&#8208;Si) by nucleophilic reaction&#160;of&#160;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with SiCl4, and CD&#8208;Si is applied to the solid polymer electrolyte (denoted PEO/PVDF/CD&#8208;Si) to solve above&#8208;mentioned problems. Through the anchoring of the CD&#8208;Si, a conductive network with dual transmission channels was successfully constructed. Due to the non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect, the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytes&#160;(SPE) can reach 1.64 &#215; 10&#8208;3&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;at 25 &#186;C. The assembled symmetrical batteries can achieve highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free galvanizing/stripping (stable cycling for 7500 h at 5 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and 1200 h at 20 mA cm&#8208;2). The solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2&#160;battery shows an&#160;ultra&#8208;long life of over 35,000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to elucidate the working mechanism of CD&#8208;Si in the polymer matrix. This work provides&#160;a novel strategy towards solid electrolytes for Zn&#8208;I2&#160;batteries.</dc:description>

However, their performance is still limited by the irreversible growth of Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and shuttle effect of polyiodide. In this work, we have prepared&#160;a new&#160;porous polymer (CD-Si) by nucleophilic reaction&#160;of&#160;&#946;-cyclodextrin with SiCl4, and CD-Si is applied to the solid polymer electrolyte (denoted PEO/PVDF/CD-Si) to solve above-mentioned problems. Through the anchoring of the CD-Si, a conductive network with dual transmission channels was successfully constructed. Due to the non-covalent anchoring effect, the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytes&#160;(SPE) can reach 1.64 &#215; 10-3&#160;S cm-1&#160;at 25 &#186;C. The assembled symmetrical batteries can achieve highly reversible dendrite-free galvanizing/stripping (stable cycling for 7500 h at 5 mA cm-2&#160;and 1200 h at 20 mA cm-2). The solid-state Zn-I2&#160;battery shows an&#160;ultra-long life of over 35,000 cycles at 2 A g-1. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to elucidate the working mechanism of CD-Si in the polymer matrix. This work provides&#160;a novel strategy towards solid electrolytes for Zn-I2&#160;batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymerization of a Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycle into a Brick&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a dendronized bis&#8208;urea macrocycle 1 self&#8208;assembling via a cooperative mechanism into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets formed solely by alternated urea&#8208;urea hydrogen bonding interactions. The pure macrocycle self&#8208;assembles in bulk into one&#8208;dimensional liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. In contrast, its self&#8208;assembly mode drastically changes in CHCl3 or tetrachloroethane leading to 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. Theoretical calculations, complemented by previously reported crystalline structures, indicate that the 2D assembly is formed by a brick&#8208;like hydrogen bonding pattern between bis&#8208;urea macrocycles. This assembly is promoted by the swelling of the trisdodecyloxyphenyl groups upon solvation, which frustrates, due to steric effects, the formation of the thermodynamically more stable columnar macrocycle stacks. This work proposes a new design strategy to access 2D supramolecular polymers by means of a single non&#8208;covalent interaction motif, which is of great interest for materials development.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafluorogenic Monochromophore&#8208;Type BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazine Series for Dual&#8208;Color Bioorthogonal Imaging with a Single Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various fluorogenic probes utilizing tetrazine (Tz) as a fluorescence quencher and bioorthogonal reaction partner have been extensively studied over the past few decades. Herein, we synthesized a series of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;Tz probes using monochromophoric design strategy for bioorthogonal cellular imaging. The BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes exhibited excellent bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN)&#8208;selective fluorogenicity with three&#8208; to four&#8208;digit&#8208;fold enhancements in fluorescence over a wide range of emission wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes in bioorthogonal fluorescence imaging of cellular organelles without washing steps. We also elucidated the aromatized pyridazine moiety as the origin of BCN&#8208;selective fluorogenic behavior. Additionally, we discovered that the fluorescence of the trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) adducts was quenched in aqueous media via photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process. Interestingly, we observed a distinctive recovery of the initially quenched fluorescence of BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;TCO upon exposure to hydrophobic media, accompanied by a significant bathochromic shift of its emission wavelength relative to that exhibited by the corresponding BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;BCN. Leveraging this finding, for the first time, we achieved dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging with a single BODIPY&#8208;Tz probe.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional polythioamides derived from thiocarbonyl fluoride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polythioamide is a unique type of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with advanced functionalities. Nonetheless, the prevailing synthetic methods, reliant upon elemental sulfur, tend to react readily with unsaturated functional groups, thereby limiting the scope of eligible substrates. Inspired by the highly efficient sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) polymerization through discrete hubs, we present herein a pioneering and versatile approach to the synthesis of polythioamides from diboronic acids, secondary diamines, and thiocarbonyl fluoride as the central connective hub.Well&#8208;defined structures, including previously inaccessible unsaturated substrates, were realized. These newly devised polythioamides can efficiently and selectively bind to metal ions and were applied in precious metal recovery. Further development results in PdII&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;chain nanoparticles serving as recyclable homogeneous catalysts, demonstrating the vast potential of these unprecedented polythioamides. We anticipate that thiocarbonyl fluoride could emerge as a potent hub for facilitating the intricate synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Studies of Soluble Inorganic Nanostructures with X&#8208;rays and Neutrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review addresses the use of X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering and X&#8208;ray absorption to describe how inorganic nano&#8208;structured materials assemble, evolve, and function in solution. We first provide an overview of techniques and instrumentation (both large user facilities and benchtop). We review recent studies of soluble inorganic nanostructure assembly, covering the disciplines of materials synthesis, processes in nature, nuclear materials, and the widely applicable fundamental processes of hydrophobic interactions and ion&#8208;pairing. Reviewed studies cover size regimes and length scales ranging from sub&#8208;angstrom (coordination chemistry and ion&#8208;pairing) to several nanometers (molecular clusters; i.e. polyoxometalates, polyoxocations and metal&#8208;organic polyhedra), to meso&#8208;scale (supramolecular assembly processes). Reviewed studies predominantly exploit 1) SAXS/SWAXS/SANS (small and wide angle X&#8208;ray or neutron scattering), 2) PDF (pair distribution function analysis of X&#8208;ray total scattering), and 3) XANES and EXAFS (respectively X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure). While the scattering techniques provide structural information, X&#8208;ray absorption yields oxidation state, in addition to local coordination. Our goal for this review is to provide information and inspiration for the inorganic/materials science communities that may benefit from elucidating the role of solution speciation in natural and synthetic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Locking the Conformation of a Paddlewheel Rhodium Complex: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Catalytic Nitrene Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exponential proliferation of conformers makes it impossible to examine the entire population in most systems. Controlling conformational ensembles is thus pivotal in many areas of chemistry. Rh2(esp)2, a dicarboxylate&#8208;derived paddlewheel rhodium complex, is one of the most effective catalysts for nitrene chemistry. Its enormous success has led to preparing many analogous complexes. However, there has been little consideration for the conformational dynamics of the parent catalyst. Herein, we report a new ligand modification principle that prevents conformer interconversion. The resulting complex comprises two isolable conformers, whose structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Combined experimental and computational data has revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the conformationally confined and parent complexes. Three model cases have demonstrated the utility of conformational fixation in the development of stereoselective catalysts for nitrene transfer reactions. The design principle described in this study can be combined with other established modification strategies, serving as a springboard for further advancement of the chemistry of paddlewheel metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Photosensitizer Controlled Reactions of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins and Unactivated Olefins: Hydroarylation and Subsequent [2 + 2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a photoinduced approach for hydroarylation of unactivated olefins using 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins as the arylating reagent. Key to the success of this reaction is the conversion of nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, which not only circumvents the polarity&#8208;mismatch issue encountered under ionic conditions but also accommodates a broad substrate scope and inhibits side reactions that were previously observed. Moreover, divergent reactivity was achieved by changing the photocatalyst, enabling a subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition to deliver cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products that are otherwise challenging to access in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reactions and the origin of the divergent reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Interphases in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The narrow electrochemical stability window of water poses a challenge to the development of aqueous electrolytes. In contrast to non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, the products of water electrolysis do not contribute to the formation of a passivation layer on electrodes. As a result, aqueous electrolytes require the reactions of additional components, such as additives and co&#8208;solvents, to facilitate the formation of the desired solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the cathode. This review highlights the fundamental principles and recent advancements in generating electrolyte interphases in aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Is &#8216;Water in Salt&#8217; Electrolytes the Ultimate Solution? Achieving High Stability of Organic Anodes in Diluted Electrolyte Solutions Via a Wise Anions Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) concept, using highly concentrated electrolyte solutions to prevent water splitting and widen the electrochemical stability window, has greatly influenced modern aqueous batteries. The successful implementation of these electrolyte solutions in many electrochemical systems shifts the focus from diluted to WIS electrolyte solutions. Considering the high costs and the tendency of these nearly saturated solutions to crystallize, this trend can be carefully re&#8208;evaluated. Herein we show that the stability of organic electrodes comprising the active material perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is strongly influenced by the solvation character of the anions rather than the concentration of the electrolyte solution. Even though the charging process of PTCDA involves solely insertion of cations (i.e., principal counter&#8208;ions), surprisingly, the dominant factor influencing its electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;term electrode stability, is the type of the co&#8208;ions (i.e., electrolytic anions). Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Dispersion Photopolymerization of Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polystyrene (PS) particles were synthesized in ethanol/water mixture by dispersion polymerization using visible light irradiation, with either a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene borane&#8208;based photoinitiating system (PIS) or a disulfide. With the full PIS and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) as stabilizer, the size distributions were broad and the amount of PEGMA had a strong impact on the experiment reproducibility. The addition of a base solved the problem, leading to faster polymerizations, narrower size distributions and larger particles. With the disulfide as sole PIS, bigger and narrowly distributed PS particles were again formed. Quantitative conversion was achieved in each system, with particle size ranging between 100 and 350 nm. The use of poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer led to significantly larger particles, up to 1.2&#160;&#956;m, with narrow size distributions. The production of such large latex particles by photoinitiated polymerizations is unprecedented.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Selectivity of CO Electrolysis to Acetate by Constructing Metal&#8208;Organic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically converting CO2 to valuable chemicals holds great promise for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Owing to complex reaction pathways and shared rate&#8208;determining steps, directing the selectivity of CO2/CO electrolysis to a specific multi&#8208;carbon product is very challenging. We report here a strategy for highly selective production of acetate from CO electrolysis by constructing metal&#8208;organic interfaces. We demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;organic interfaces constructed by in situ reconstruction of Cu complexes show very impressive acetate selectivity, with a high Faradaic efficiency of 84.2% and a carbon selectivity of 92.1% for acetate production, in an alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The maximum acetate partial current density and acetate yield reach as high as 605 mA cm&#8722;2 and 63.4%, respectively. Thorough structural characterizations, control experiments, operando Raman spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculation results indicate that the Cu&#8208;organic interface creates a favorable reaction microenvironment that enhances *CO adsorption, lowers the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling, and facilitates the formation of CH3COOH over other multicarbon products, thus rationalizing the selective acetate production.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Eco&#8208;friendly lead&#8208;free organic&#8208;inorganic manganese halides (OIMHs) have attracted considerable attention in various optoelectronic applications because of their superior optical properties and flexible solution processibility. Herein, we report a novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered OIMH (MTP)2MnBr4 (MTP: methyltriphenylphosphonium), which exhibits intense green emission under UV/blue or X&#8208;ray excitation, with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, high resistance to thermal quenching (T150 &#176;C = 84.1%) and good photochemical stability. These features enable (MTP)2MnBr4 as an efficient green phosphor for blue&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes, demonstrating a commercial&#8208;level luminous efficiency of 101 lm W&#8211;1 and a wide color gamut of 116% NTSC. Moreover, these (MTP)2MnBr4 crystals showcase outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties, delivering a light yield of 67000 photon MeV&#8211;1, a detection limit of 82.4 nGy s&#8211;1, and a competitive spatial resolution of 6.2 lp mm&#8211;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Fabrication of Pillar&#8208;Cage Fluorinated Anion Pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via a Pillar Embedding Strategy and Efficient Separation of SO2 through Multi&#8208;Site Trapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flue gas desulfurization is crucial for both human health and ecological environments. However, developing efficient SO2 adsorbents that can break the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity is still challenging. In this work, a new type of fluorinated anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) with a pillar&#8208;cage structure is fabricated through pillar&#8208;embedding into a highly porous and robust framework. This type of APMOFs comprises smaller tetrahedral cages and larger icosahedral cages interconnected by embedded [NbOF5]2&#8208; and [TaOF5]2&#8208; anions acting as pillars. The APMOFs exhibits high porosity and density of fluorinated anions, ensuring exceptional SO2 adsorption capacity and ultrahigh selectivity for SO2/CO2 and SO2/N2 gas mixtures. Furthermore, these two structures demonstrate excellent stability towards water, acid/alkali, and SO2 adsorption. Cycle dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm the excellent separation performance of SO2/CO2 gas mixtures and their cyclic stability.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Flue gas desulfurization is crucial for both human health and ecological environments. However, developing efficient SO2 adsorbents that can break the trade-off between adsorption capacity and selectivity is still challenging. In this work, a new type of fluorinated anion-pillared metal-organic frameworks (APMOFs) with a pillar-cage structure is fabricated through pillar-embedding into a highly porous and robust framework. This type of APMOFs comprises smaller tetrahedral cages and larger icosahedral cages interconnected by embedded [NbOF5]2- and [TaOF5]2- anions acting as pillars. The APMOFs exhibits high porosity and density of fluorinated anions, ensuring exceptional SO2 adsorption capacity and ultrahigh selectivity for SO2/CO2 and SO2/N2 gas mixtures. Furthermore, these two structures demonstrate excellent stability towards water, acid/alkali, and SO2 adsorption. Cycle dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm the excellent separation performance of SO2/CO2 gas mixtures and their cyclic stability. SO2-loaded single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferred adsorption domains for SO2 molecules. The multiple-site host-guest and guest-guest interactions facilitate selective recognition and dense packing of SO2 in this hybrid porous material. This work will be instructive for designing porous materials for flue gas desulfurization and other gas-purification processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8208;N Vinylindole Atropisomers by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylation of 1&#8208;Alkynylindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Moreover, the enantioselective hydroarylation of alkynes using organoboron reagents has not been reported. Herein, we report for the first time that palladium compounds can catalyze the hydroarylation of organoborons with 1&#8208;alkynylindoles for the synthesis of chiral C&#8208;N atropisomers. A series of rarely reported vinylindole atropisomers was synthesized with excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; (Z&#8208;selectivity), and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The ready availability of organoborons and alkynes and the simplicity, high stereoselectivity, and good functional group tolerance of this catalytic system make it highly attractive.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the &#8220;Solid&#8211;Liquid&#8211;Solid&#8221; Conversion Reaction via Bifunctional Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life Potassium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A bifunctional concentration electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate) with high ion conductivity is developed to reduce the dissolution of polysulfides and stabilize the K anode for advanced K&#8722;S batteries. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries based on &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; conversion mechanism display superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8722;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF&#8208;riched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Improbable Rotaxanes Constructed From Surrogate Malonate Rotaxanes as Encircled Methylene Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surrogate malonate&#8208;based rotaxanes allow the construction of improbable rotaxanes, with the final dumbbell&#8208;shaped component assembled from two different stoppers and the only structure inherited from the malonate rotaxane being a methylene group. The syntheses of improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components demonstrate the practicality and generality of this approach.







Abstract
We have developed a new approach for the synthesis of &#8220;improbable&#8221; rotaxanes by using malonate&#8208;centered rotaxanes as interlocked surrogate precursors. Here, the desired dumbbell&#8208;shaped structure can be assembled from two different, completely separate, portions, with the only residual structure introduced from the malonate surrogate being a methylene group. We have synthesized improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components to demonstrate the potential structural flexibility and scope of the guest species that can be interlocked when using this approach.

         <title>Dinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Arylation of Undirected Arenes by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of various monofluoroaromatic is disclosed with readily available aromatic silanes and germanes as coupling partners at room temperature. The flexibility of the binuclear gold catalyst skeleton and the noncovalent interactions between hexafluorobenzene and fluorobenzene can furnish a high para selectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2).







Abstract
The regioselectivity of C&#8722;H functionalization is commonly achieved by directing groups, electronic factors, or steric hindrance, which facilitate the identification of reaction sites. However, such strategies are less effective for reactants such as simple monofluoroarenes due to their relatively low reactivity and the modest steric demands of the fluorine atom. Herein, we present an undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air&#8208;stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high para&#8208;regioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)2 (dppm=bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse para&#8208;arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8722;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that para&#8208;C&#8722;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8722;Au(III)&#8722;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.

         <title>Stereoselective Photoredox Catalyzed (3+3) Dipolar Cycloaddition of Nitrone with Aryl Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical type (3+3) cycloaddition of cyclopropane is realized with aryl cyclopropane and nitrone under photoredox catalysis in a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. The reaction includes a stereospecific three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic ring opening and a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization.







Abstract
By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrate the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction takes place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution triggered cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening and a diastereoselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well&#8208;developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional&#8208;group compatibility. A mechanism involving an aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrate the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single-electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction takes place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three-electron-type nucleophilic substitution triggered cyclopropane ring-opening and a diastereoselective 6-endo-&lt;i&gt;trig&lt;/i&gt; radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with excellent regio- and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well-developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor-acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional-group compatibility. A mechanism involving an aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Work&#8208;Function&#8208;Induced Interfacial Electron/Ion Transport in Carbon Hosts toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon fiber host with high work function was designed to promote electron transfer and surface Li+ diffusion, thus leading to uniform dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition on the fiber scaffold. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibited high reversibility and long&#8208;term cycling stability (EVac: vacuum level; Ef : Fermi level; EVBM: maximum valence&#8208;band energy level; ECBM: minimum conduction&#8208;band energy level).







Abstract
Coupled electron/ion transport is a decisive feature of Li plating/stripping, wherein the compatibility of electron/ion transport rates determines the morphology of deposited Li. Local Li+ hotspots form due to inhomogeneous interfacial charge transfer and lead to uncontrolled Li deposition, which decreases the Li utilization rate and safety of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a method to obtain dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes by driving electron pumping and accumulating and boosting Li ion diffusion by tuning the work function of a carbon host using cobalt&#8208;containing catalysts. The results reveal that increasing the work function provides an electron deviation from C to Co, and electron&#8208;rich Co shows favorable binding to Li+. The Co catalysts boost Li+ diffusion on the carbon fiber scaffolds without local aggregation by reducing the Li+ migration barrier. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99.0&#8201;%, a cycle life of over 2000&#8197;h, a Li utilization rate of 50&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 83.4&#8201;% after 130 cycles in pouch cells at a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5. These findings provide a novel strategy to stabilize Li metal by regulating the work function of materials using electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Halides as Selectively Bifunctional Catalysts Enabling the Syntheses of Recyclable High Molecular Weight Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Copolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis system of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester (salicylic methyl glycolide), and yields salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters with high molecular weights (Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#272;=1.25). Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation can synergistically activate monomer and initiator. Moreover, these polymers can be recycled to monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.







Abstract
To synthesize high molecular weight poly(phenolic ester) via a living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester monomers remains a critical challenge due to serious transesterification and back&#8208;biting reactions. Both phenolic ester bonds in monomer and polymer chains are highly active, and it is difficult so far to distinguish them. In this work, an unprecedented selectively bifunctional catalytic system of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered to mediate the syntheses of high molecular weight salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters via a living ROP of salicylate cyclic esters (for poly(salicylic methyl glycolide) (PSMG), Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#208;&lt;1.30). Compared to previous catalysis systems, the side reactions were suppressed remarkably in this catalysis system because phenolic ester bond in monomer can be selectively cleaved over that in polymer chains during ROP progress. Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation work synergistically, where the alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation moiety interacts with the carbonyl group of substrates via non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding. Moreover, these salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters can be recycled to dimeric monomer under solution condition, and can be recycled to original monomeric monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Oriented Design Based on Elementary Reactions (CODER) for Triarylamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst design strategy designated &#8220;catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER)&#8221; enabled the development of a Pd catalyst based on cyclopropane skeleton, which improves the efficiency of catalytic C&#8722;N coupling reaction by up to 3 orders of magnitude, and is expected to be applied to the efficient production of triarylamine optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Recently, the application of computational tools to the rational design of catalysts has received considerable attention, but progress has been limited by the reliance on databases and because mechanistic data have been almost neglected. Herein, we report a new strategy for catalyst design, designated catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER), which fully utilizes mechanistic data, combines the strengths of computational tools and researcher experience. CODER enabled the development of extremely efficient Pd catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, which markedly improved the efficiency of the synthesis of widely used triarylamine optoelectronic materials by enhancing the turnover numbers (up to 340000) to 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude towards literature values.

         <title>FINDER: A Fluidly Confined CRISPR&#8208;Based DNA Reporter on Living Cell Membranes for Rapid and Sensitive Cancer Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is of great significance. Herein, we developed a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) on living cell membranes for rapid and sensitive cancer cells identification. The FINDER can rapidly identify target cancer cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieve over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells in clinical blood samples.







Abstract
The accurate, rapid, and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is significant in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the naturally confined enzymes on fluid cell membranes, a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamer&#8208;based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system capable of accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER rapidly identified target cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieved over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Polyimide Compounds For Post&#8208;Lithium Energy Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyimides have proven to be highly versatile in nearly all areas of rechargeable battery applications, spanning from active electrode materials to separator coatings. This review presents a summary of significant research conducted over the past 15 years, showcasing their potential to pave the way for a new era of effective utilization of these polymers in next&#8208;generation batteries.







Abstract
The exploration of cathode and anode materials that enable reversible storage of mono and multivalent cations has driven extensive research on organic compounds. In this regard, polyimide (PI)&#8208;based electrodes have emerged as a promising avenue for the development of post&#8208;lithium energy storage systems.

         <title>Interphasial Pre&#8208;lithiation and Reinforcement of Micro&#8208;Si Anode through Fluorine&#8208;free Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;functional fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte was specifically designed for the micro&#8208;Si anodes. Benefiting from pre&#8208;lithiation of the native SiOx, limited accumulation of LiF&#8208;free interphase with high modulus and fast interphasial kinetics, the optimized micro&#8208;Si anode (&gt;5 mAh/cm2) exhibits exceptional performance, which can be comparable to the best one reported for a particular fluorinated electrolyte.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;sized silicon (mSi) anodes offer advantages in cost and tap density over nanosized counterparts. However, its practical application still suffers from poor cyclability and low initial and later&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency (CE), caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and irreversible lithiation of the surface oxide layer. Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)&#8208;free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre&#8208;lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH4, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network. The significance of this F&#8208;free electrolyte brings unprecedented F&#8208;free interphase that also enables the high&#8208;performance mSi electrode (80&#8197;wt&#8201;% mSi), including high specific capacity of 2900&#8197;mAh/g, high initial CE of 94.7&#8201;% and excellent cyclability capacity retention of 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C. This work confirms the feasibility of F&#8208;free interphase, thus opening up a new avenue toward cost&#8208;advantaged and environmentally friendly electrolytes for more emerging battery systems.

         <title>Toward Understanding the Formation Mechanism and OER Catalytic Mechanism of Hydroxides by In Situ and Operando Techniques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discussing the current status and challenges in studying hydroxide formation and OER catalytic mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques can help expedite the preparation of cost&#8208;effective hydroxide electrocatalysts. This review summarizes in situ/operando techniques&#8242; capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages, and discusses recent findings on hydroxide formation and OER catalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Developing efficient and affordable electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant barrier that needs to be overcome for the practical applications of hydrogen production via water electrolysis, transforming CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Recently, hydroxides have shown promise as electrocatalysts for OER. In situ or operando techniques are particularly indispensable for monitoring the key intermediates together with understanding the reaction process, which is extremely important for revealing the formation/OER catalytic mechanism of hydroxides and preparing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for OER. However, there is a lack of comprehensive discussion on the current status and challenges of studying these mechanisms using in situ or operando techniques, which hinders our ability to identify and address the obstacles present in this field. This review offers an overview of in situ or operando techniques, outlining their capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages. Recent findings related to the formation mechanism and OER catalytic mechanism of hydroxides revealed by in situ or operando techniques are also discussed in detail. Additionally, some current challenges in this field are concluded and appropriate solution strategies are provided.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difluoro&#8208;bicycloheptatriene has been trapped in cryogenic matrices and full spectroscopic characterization is reported. This is in stark contrast to the parent bicycloheptatriene, which remains elusive to this day. A heavy&#8208;atom tunneling rearrangement of the difluoro derivative to cycloheptatetraene is observed and calculations suggest that the lifetime of the parent bicycloheptatriene is too short to be detected in cryogenic matrices.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom tunneling limits the lifetime and observability of bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene, a key intermediate in the rearrangement of phenylcarbene. Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene had been proposed as the primary intermediate of the rearrangement of phenylcarbene, but despite many efforts evaded its characterization even in cryogenic matrices. By introducing fluorine substituents into the ortho&#8208;positions of the phenyl ring of phenylcarbene, the highly strained cyclopropene 1,5&#8208;difluorobicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene becomes stable enough to be characterized in argon matrices. However, even at 3&#8197;K this cyclopropene is only metastable and rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to the corresponding cycloheptatetraene. Calculations suggest that fluorination is necessary to slow down the tunneling rearrangement of the bicycloheptatriene. The parent bicycloheptatriene rapidly rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling and therefore cannot be detected under matrix isolation conditions.

         <title>Liposomal Enzyme Nanoreactors Based on Nanoconfinement for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed liposome&#8208;based enzyme nanoreactors that enable efficient cascade reactions for catalytic antitumor therapy. These nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting tumor nutrient supply and by producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), marrying liposomes biocompatibility with high efficiency of tandem enzymatic reactions making them promising for antitumor nanomedicines.







Abstract
Enzymatic reactions can consume endogenous nutrients of tumors and produce cytotoxic species and are therefore promising tools for treating malignant tumors. Inspired by nature where enzymes are compartmentalized in membranes to achieve high reaction efficiency and separate biological processes with the environment, we develop liposomal nanoreactors that can perform enzymatic cascade reactions in the aqueous nanoconfinement of liposomes. The nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by consuming tumor nutrients (glucose and oxygen) and producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH). Co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in liposomes could increase local concentration of the intermediate product hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as well as the acidity due to the generation of gluconic acid by GOx. Both H2O2 and acidity accelerate the second&#8208;step reaction by HRP, hence improving the overall efficiency of the cascade reaction. The biomimetic compartmentalization of enzymatic tandem reactions in biocompatible liposomes provides a promising direction for developing catalytic nanomedicines in antitumor therapy.

         <title>Varying the Stiffness and Diffusivity of Rod&#8208;Shaped Microgels Independently through Their Molecular Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, it is not yet fully understood how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of microgels and how this affects specific biomedical applications. We reveal how the architecture and molar mass of PEG precursor molecules affect fundamental properties of bulk PEG hydrogels and microgels, such as chemical crosslinking, stiffness and diffusion, as well as cell interaction.







Abstract
Microgels are water&#8208;swollen, crosslinked polymers that are widely used as colloidal building blocks in scaffold materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Microgels can be controlled in their stiffness, degree of swelling, and mesh size depending on their polymer architecture, crosslink density, and fabrication method&#8212;all of which influence their function and interaction with the environment. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of soft microgels and how this morphology affects specific biomedical applications. In this report, we systematically vary the architecture and molar mass of polyethylene glycol&#8208;acrylate (PEG&#8208;Ac) precursors, as well as their concentration and combination, to gain insight in the different parameters that affect the internal structure of rod&#8208;shaped microgels. We characterize the mechanical properties and diffusivity, as well as the conversion of acrylate groups during photopolymerization, in both bulk hydrogels and microgels produced from the PEG&#8208;Ac precursors. Furthermore, we investigate cell&#8208;microgel interaction, and we observe improved cell spreading on microgels with more accessible RGD peptide and with a stiffness in a range of 20&#8197;kPa to 50&#8197;kPa lead to better cell growth.

     alt="Varying the Stiffness and Diffusivity of Rod-Shaped Microgels Independently through Their Molecular Building Blocks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, it is not yet fully understood how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of microgels and how this affects specific biomedical applications. We reveal how the architecture and molar mass of PEG precursor molecules affect fundamental properties of bulk PEG hydrogels and microgels, such as chemical crosslinking, stiffness and diffusion, as well as cell interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microgels are water-swollen, crosslinked polymers that are widely used as colloidal building blocks in scaffold materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Microgels can be controlled in their stiffness, degree of swelling, and mesh size depending on their polymer architecture, crosslink density, and fabrication method&#8212;all of which influence their function and interaction with the environment. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of soft microgels and how this morphology affects specific biomedical applications. In this report, we systematically vary the architecture and molar mass of polyethylene glycol-acrylate (PEG-Ac) precursors, as well as their concentration and combination, to gain insight in the different parameters that affect the internal structure of rod-shaped microgels. We characterize the mechanical properties and diffusivity, as well as the conversion of acrylate groups during photopolymerization, in both bulk hydrogels and microgels produced from the PEG-Ac precursors. Furthermore, we investigate cell-microgel interaction, and we observe improved cell spreading on microgels with more accessible RGD peptide and with a stiffness in a range of 20&#8197;kPa to 50&#8197;kPa lead to better cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wetting vs Droplet Aggregation: A Broadband Rotational Spectroscopic Study of 3&#8208;Methylcatechol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Clusters</title>

How does microsolvation occur in 3&#8208;methylcatechol? Wetting or droplet aggregation? Using a combination of rotational spectroscopic and computational techniques, we discover an unexpected hydration pathway by following the solvation process one water molecule at a time.







Abstract
Two competing solvation pathways of 3&#8208;methylcatechol (MC), an atmospherically relevant aromatic molecule, with up to five water molecules were explored in detail by using a combination of broadband rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Theoretically, two different pathways of solvation emerge: the commonly observed droplet pathway which involves preferential binding among the water molecules while the solute serves as an anchor point for the formation of a water cluster, and an unexpected wetting pathway which involves interactions between the water molecules and the aromatic face of MC, i.e., a wetting of the &#960;&#8208;surface. Conclusive identification of the MC hydrate structures, and therefore the wetting pathway, was facilitated by rotational spectra of the parent MC hydrates and several H218O and 13C isotopologues which exhibit splittings associated with methyl internal rotation and/or water tunneling motions. Theoretical modelling and analyses offer insights into the tunneling and conversion barriers associated with the observed hydrate conformers and the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interactions involved in choosing the unusual wetting pathway.

         <title>Anchoring a Structurally Editable Proximal Cofactor&#8208;like Module to Construct an Artificial Dual&#8208;center Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An editable organic cofactor was anchored to the proximal position of the heme center of P450BM3 as a co&#8208;catalytic center to construct an artificial dual&#8208;center peroxygenase. High binding affinity ensures a low load requirement for the efficient co&#8208;activation of H2O2, resulting in high peroxygenase activity. Structure editability enriches cofactor library diversity to widen the substrate range and increase the catalytic promiscuity of peroxygenase.







Abstract
A recent novel strategy for constructing artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) that target new&#8208;to&#8208;nature functions uses dual&#8208;functional small molecules (DFSMs) with catalytic and anchoring groups for converting P450BM3 monooxygenase into a peroxygenase. However, this process requires excess DFSMs (1000 equivalent of P450) owing to their low binding affinity for P450, thus severely limiting its practical application. Herein, structural optimization of the DFSM&#8208;anchoring group considerably enhanced their binding affinity by three orders of magnitude (Kd&#8776;10&#8722;8&#8197;M), thus approximating native cofactors, such as FMN or FAD in flavoenzymes. An artificial cofactor&#8208;driven peroxygenase was thus constructed. The co&#8208;crystal structure of P450BM3 bound to a DFSM clearly revealed a precatalytic state in which the DFSM participates in H2O2 activation, thus facilitating peroxygenase activity. Moreover, the increased binding affinity substantially decreases the DFSM load to as low as 2&#8197;equivalents of P450, while maintaining increased activity. Furthermore, replacement of catalytic groups showed disparate selectivity and activity for various substrates. This study provides an unprecedented approach for assembling ArMs by binding editable organic cofactors as a co&#8208;catalytic center, thereby increasing the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes.

         <title>Electrochemical NiH&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling of Alkyl Halides and Alkyl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general protocol for electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes has been established, providing tunable linear and branched products. Alkyl halides perform dual function as both coupling substrates and hydrogen sources in this reaction. Excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope can be extended to late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecular structures.







Abstract
Herein, an electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes for the construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds is firstly reported. Notably, alkyl halides serve dual function as coupling substrates and as hydrogen sources to generate NiH species under electrochemical conditions. The tunable nature of this reaction is realized by introducing an intramolecular coordinating group to the substrate, where the product can be easily adjusted to give the desired branched products. The method proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits a broad substrate scope, and affords moderate to excellent yields with over 70 examples, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug derivatives. Mechanistic insights offer evidence for an electrochemically driven coupling process. The sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be activated through single electron transfer (SET) by the nickel catalyst in its low valence state, generated by cathodic reduction, and the generation of NiH species from alkyl halides is pivotal to this transformation.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Assembly of Copper Nanoclusters with Enhanced Electrochemcial Excitation and Radiative Transition for Electrochemiluminescence
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transforming disordered aggregates to ordered assemblies lights up electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of CuNCs. A self&#8208;assembly strategy was adopted to promote the electrochemcial excitation and radiative transition, allowing efficient enhancement of the electrochemiluminescence (ECL). This work proposes a simple and effective way to improve the inherent ECL performance of metal NCs for bioassays and clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are emerging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters with unique molecule&#8208;like electronic structures, high abundance, and low cost. However, the synthesis of CuNCs with high ECL efficiency and stability in a scalable manner remains challenging. Here, we report a facile gram&#8208;scale approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled CuNCs (CuNCsAssy) induced by ligands with exceptionally boosted anodic ECL and stability. Compared to the disordered aggregates that are inactive in ECL, the CuNCsAssy shows a record anodic ECL efficiency for CuNCs (10&#8201;%, wavelength&#8208;corrected, relative to Ru(bpy)3Cl2/tripropylamine). Mechanism studies revealed the unusual dual functions of ligands in simultaneously facilitating electrochemical excitation and radiative transition. Moreover, the assembly addressed the limitation of poor stability of conventional CuNCs. As a proof of concept, an ECL biosensor for alkaline phosphatase detection was successfully constructed with an ultralow limit of detection of 8.1&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;U/L.

         <title>Schiff Base Reaction in a Living Cell: In Situ Synthesis of a Hollow Covalent Organic Polymer To Regulate Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schiff base reaction has been artificially conducted in living cells and enabled the in situ synthesis of a hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) that inhibited the polymerization of actin filaments and consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The proposed intracellular synthesis approach may provide an efficient strategy to regulate cellular behavior and biological functions.







Abstract
Artificially performing chemical reactions in living biosystems to attain various physiological aims remains an intriguing but very challenging task. In this study, the Schiff base reaction was conducted in cells using Sc(OTf)3 as a catalyst, enabling the in situ synthesis of a hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) without external stimuli. The reversible Schiff base reaction mediated intracellular Oswald ripening endows the HCOP with a spherical, hollow porous structure and a large specific surface area. The intracellularly generated HCOP reduced cellular motility by restraining actin polymerization, which consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The presented intracellular synthesis system inspired by the Schiff base reaction has strong potential to regulate cell fate and biological functions, opening up a new strategic possibility for intervening in cellular behavior.

         <title>A Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Enhancing Curcumin&#8208;Based Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to enhance the efficacy of curcumin for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. The strategy employs hollow mesoporous copper silicate nanoparticles to load Zn&#8208;curcumin, which can not only form a Cu&#8722;Cur complex with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect in arthritic area for anti&#8208;inflammation, but also promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts for bone tissue repair.







Abstract
Curcumin (Cur) has been clinically used for rheumatoid arthritis treatment by the means of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and immune microenvironment regulation. However, this compound has a poor water solubility and moderate antioxidative activity, favoring no further broadened application. Metal complexes of curcumin such as zinc&#8208;curcumin (Zn&#8722;Cur) features enhanced water solubilities, while copper&#8208;curcumin (Cu&#8722;Cur) shows a higher antioxidant activity but lower solubility than Zn&#8722;Cur. Based on their inherent biological properties, this work proposes a nanomedicine&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange strategy to enhance the efficacy of Cur for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Copper silicate nanoparticles with hollow mesoporous structure were prepared to load water&#8208;soluble Zn&#8722;Cur for constructing a composite nanomedicine, which can degrade in acidic microenvironment of arthritic region, releasing Cu2+ and Zn&#8722;Cur. Cu2+ then substitute for Zn2+ in Zn&#8722;Cur to form Cu&#8722;Cur with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect, capable of efficiently scavenging ROS in M1 macrophages, promoting their transition to an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, the silicate released after nanocarrier degradation and the Zn2+ released after ion exchange reaction synergistically promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts. This work provides a new approach for enhancing the antiarthritic effect of Cur via an ion&#8208;exchange strategy.

         <title>Photo&#8208;thermal Cooperative Carbonylation of Ethanol with CO2 on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source has been achieved via photo&#8208;thermal cooperation on an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy, which are both abundant in SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O. The oxygen vacancies facilitate the thermal dissociation of alcoholic O&#8722;H bond, providing not only the carbonyl counterpart but also the active *H for photo&#8208;catalysis of CO2 to reactive CO on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x interfacial sites. A production of up to 320&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 86&#8201;% has been afforded.







Abstract
Carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source into value&#8208;added esters is of considerable significance and interest, while remains of great challenge due to the harsh conditions for activation of inert CO2 in that the harsh conditions result in undesired activation of &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and even cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in ethanol to deteriorate the specific activation of O&#8722;H bond. Herein, we propose a photo&#8208;thermal cooperative strategy for carbonylation of ethanol with CO2, in which CO2 is activated to reactive CO via photo&#8208;catalysis with the assistance of *H from thermally&#8208;catalyzed dissociation of alcoholic O&#8722;H bond. To achieve this proposal, an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy both abundant SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O (Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x) has been designed. A production of up to 320&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 85.6&#8201;% to targeted alcoholic O&#8722;H activation has been afforded in photo&#8208;thermal assisted gas&#8208;solid process under 3.29&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1 of UV/Vis light irradiation (144&#8201;&#176;C) and 0.2&#8197;MPa CO2. In the photo&#8208;driven activation of CO2 and following carbonylation, CO2 activation energy decreases to 12.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and the cleavage of alcoholic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond has been suppressed.

         <title>Intrinsic Stress&#8208;strain in Barium Titanate Piezocatalysts Enabling Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Batteries with Low Overpotential and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic stress&#8208;assisted catalysis concept established provide an effective, practical strategy for accelerating the commercial application of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Benefiting from the piezopotential as the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers, the redox reaction kinetics, the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries can cycle steadily for 2200&#8197;h with a low overpotential.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries with high theoretical energy density are considered as promising candidates for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, whereas their commercial application is hindered due to poor cyclic stability caused by the sluggish kinetics and cathode passivation. Herein, the intrinsic stress originated from the growth and decomposition of the discharge product (lithium peroxide, Li2O2) is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to induce the built&#8208;in electric field, further improving the reaction kinetics and interfacial Lithium ion (Li+) transport during cycling. Piezopotential caused by the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain of solid Li2O2 is capable of providing the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers, enhancing the Li+ transfer, and thus improving the redox reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Combined with a variety of in situ characterizations, the catalytic mechanism of barium titanate (BTO), a typical piezoelectric material, was systematically investigated, and the effect of stress&#8208;strain transformation on the electrochemical reaction kinetics and Li+ interface transport for the Li&#8722;O2 batteries is clearly established. The findings provide deep insight into the surface coupling strategy between intrinsic stress and electric fields to regulate the electrochemical reaction kinetics behavior and enhance the interfacial Li+ transport for battery system.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence CuI/CuIII Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Non&#8208;innocent Ligand for Multielectron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metal&#8211;organic frameworks with formally Cu(I)/Cu(III) mixed valency are reported. These bench stable Cu(III)&#8208;containing frameworks coordinated by a non&#8208;innocent ligand are characterized and investigated for multielectron redox properties, unveiling the redox&#8208;active sites at both the copper and organic ligand. This is also the first time that formally Cu(III) species are witnessed in metal&#8211;organic extended solids.







Abstract
We report two novel three&#8208;dimensional copper&#8208;benzoquinoid metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu4L3]n and [Cu4L3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cu(iq)3]n (LH4=1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahydroxybenzene, iq=isoquinoline).

&lt;p&gt;The first metal&#8211;organic frameworks with formally Cu(I)/Cu(III) mixed valency are reported. These bench stable Cu(III)-containing frameworks coordinated by a non-innocent ligand are characterized and investigated for multielectron redox properties, unveiling the redox-active sites at both the copper and organic ligand. This is also the first time that formally Cu(III) species are witnessed in metal&#8211;organic extended solids.

         <title>Cu2+&#8208;Anchored Carbon Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts for Visible Water Splitting to Boost Hydrogen Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)&#8208;anchored CD&#8208;doped C3N4 nanosheet (Cu@CDCN) enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic generation of H2. Cu2+ efficiently catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 and reduces photocatalyst poisoning by H2O2, which promotes the conversion to Cu+ and boosts cuproptosis. Cu@CDCN with efficient photocatalytic H2 production and anchored Cu2+ enables a combination of hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis that can cause mitochondrial damage and inhibit tumor growth.







Abstract
Both hydrogen (H2) and copper ions (Cu+) can be used as anti&#8208;cancer treatments. However, the continuous generation of H2 molecules and Cu+ in specific sites of tumors is challenging. Here we anchored Cu2+ on carbon photocatalyst (Cu@CDCN) to allow the continuous generation of H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors using the two&#8208;electron process of visible water splitting. The photocatalytic process also generated redox&#8208;active Cu&#8208;carbon centers. Meanwhile, the Cu2+ residues reacted with H2O2 (the obstacle to the photocatalytic process) to accelerate the two&#8208;electron process of water splitting and cuprous ion (Cu+) generation, in which the Cu2+ residue promoted a pro&#8208;oxidant effect with glutathione through metal&#8208;reducing actions. Both H2 and Cu+ induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular redox homeostasis destruction, which enabled hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis to inhibit cancer cell growth and suppress tumor growth. Our research is the first attempt to integrate hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis using metal&#8208;enhanced visible solar water splitting in nanomedicine, which may provide a safe and effective cancer treatment.

         <title>Complete Peripheral Fluorination of the Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor in Organic Solar Cells Yields Efficiency over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete peripheral fluorination was performed on a two&#8208;dimensional conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series small molecular acceptors (SMAs), rendering an acceptor of CH8F with eight fluorine atoms surrounding molecular backbone. More importantly, the highest efficiency of 19.28&#8201;% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based organic solar cells has been achieved so far.







Abstract
Due to the intrinsically flexible molecular skeletons and loose aggregations, organic semiconductors, like small molecular acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), greatly suffer from larger structural/packing disorders and weaker intermolecular interactions comparing to their inorganic counterparts, further leading to hindered exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge carrier migration in resulting OSCs. To overcome this challenge, complete peripheral fluorination was performed on basis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series SMAs, rendering an acceptor of CH8F with eight fluorine atoms surrounding the molecular backbone. Benefitting from the broad 2D backbone, more importantly, strengthened fluorine&#8208;induced secondary interactions, CH8F and its D18 blends afford much enhanced and more ordered molecular packings accompanying with enlarged dielectric constants, reduced exciton binding energies and more obvious fibrillary networks comparing to CH6F controls. Consequently, D18:CH8F&#8208;based OSCs reached an excellent efficiency of 18.80&#8201;%, much better than that of 17.91&#8201;% for CH6F&#8208;based ones. More excitingly, by employing D18&#8208;Cl that possesses a highly similar structure to D18 as a third component, the highest efficiency of 19.28&#8201;% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based OSCs has been achieved so far. Our work demonstrates the dramatical structural multiformity of CH&#8208;series SMAs, meanwhile, their high potential for constructing record&#8208;breaking OSCs through peripheral fine&#8208;tuning.

         <title>Switching Lead for Tin in PbHfO3: Noncubic Structure of SnHfO3
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The replacement of Pb(II) for Sn(II) cations in perovskite oxides is challenging because of their high thermodynamic instability. A new orthorhombic SnHfO3 perovskite has been synthesized via removal of Pb(II) cations from PbHfO3 by reaction with a SnClF salt.







Abstract
The removal of lead from commercialized perovskite&#8208;oxide&#8208;based piezoceramics has been a recent major topic in materials research owing to legislation in many countries. In this regard, Sn(II)&#8208;perovskite oxides have garnered keen interest due to their predicted large spontaneous electric polarizations and isoelectronic nature for substitution of Pb(II) cations. However, they have not been considered synthesizable owing to their high metastability. Herein, the perovskite lead hafnate, i.e., PbHfO3 in space group Pbam, is shown to react with SnClF at a low temperature of 300&#8201;&#176;C, and resulting in the first complete Sn(II)&#8208;for&#8208;Pb(II) substitution, i.e. SnHfO3. During this topotactic transformation, a high purity and crystallinity is conserved with Pbam symmetry, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction, elemental analysis, and 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. In situ diffraction shows SnHfO3 also possesses reversible phase transformations and is potentially polar between &#8776;130&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C. This so&#8208;called &#8216;de&#8208;leadification&#8217; is thus shown to represent a highly useful strategy to fully remove lead from perovskite&#8208;oxide&#8208;based piezoceramics and opening the door to new explorations of polar and antipolar Sn(II)&#8208;oxide materials.

         <title>Electron Delocalization Enables Sulfone&#8208;based Single&#8208;solvent Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron delocalization through resonance and electron withdrawing effect by F substitution solves the wettability issue and addresses the Li metal anode instability of sulfone solvents to enable the use of sulfone&#8208;based single&#8208;solvent single&#8208;salt electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMB), although providing high energy density, face the grand challenge of identifying good electrolyte solvents for cycling. Common solvents are either only stable against lithium metal anode or only stable against LiNixMnyCo1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NMC) cathode. There is significant effort trying to increase the cathode stability for ether electrolytes, which are in general stable against lithium metal anode. In comparison, there is much less effort trying to increase the anode stability of electrolytes that are stable against NMC cathode. One example is the sulfone&#8208;based electrolyte. It has good cathode stability but is hindered from practical application because of (1) high viscosity and poor wetting capability and (2) poor anode stability. Here, we solve these issues by modifying the sulfone molecules using resonance and electron withdrawing effect. The viscosity is significantly reduced by delocalizing the electrons through introducing additional oxygen on the molecular backbone and applying appropriate fluorination. The resulting molecule 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl mesylate (TFEM) has decreased Lewis basicity and less reactivity toward Li+. The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMB under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21&#8197;mg/cm2 NMC811 and 50&#8197;&#956;m Li) with 90&#8201;% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.

&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NMC) cathode. There is significant effort trying to increase the cathode stability for ether electrolytes, which are in general stable against lithium metal anode. In comparison, there is much less effort trying to increase the anode stability of electrolytes that are stable against NMC cathode. One example is the sulfone-based electrolyte. It has good cathode stability but is hindered from practical application because of (1) high viscosity and poor wetting capability and (2) poor anode stability. Here, we solve these issues by modifying the sulfone molecules using resonance and electron withdrawing effect. The viscosity is significantly reduced by delocalizing the electrons through introducing additional oxygen on the molecular backbone and applying appropriate fluorination. The resulting molecule 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl mesylate (TFEM) has decreased Lewis basicity and less reactivity toward Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMB under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21&#8197;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; NMC811 and 50&#8197;&#956;m Li) with 90&#8201;% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Geminal Cross Couplings of Dihaloalkanes with Cr Catalysis: Rapid Access to Tertiary and Quaternary Alkanes via a Metal&#8211;Carbene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;component geminal couplings have been achieved by design of a chromium catalytic system using dihaloalkanes to selective react with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes/alkyl tosylates. These newly developed reactions are effective for rapidly forming tertiary and quaternary alkanes via a Cr carbene intermediate with a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism, showing great potential in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Geminal cross couplings using multiple components enable the formation of several different bonds at one site in the building of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. Nevertheless, there are remaining issues of concern&#8212;cleavage of two geminal bonds and control of selectivity present challenges. We report here the geminal cross couplings of three components by reactions of dihaloalkanes with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes or alkyl tosylates by Cr catalysis, affording the formation of geminal C&#8722;C/C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;C/C&#8722;C bonds in the creation of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. The geminal couplings are catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2, enabling the sluggishness of competitive Kumada&#8208;type side couplings and homocouplings of Grignard reagents, in achieving high chemoselectivity. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that two geminal C&#8208;halide bonds are continuously cleaved by Cr to afford a metal carbene intermediate, which couples with a Grignard reagent, followed by silylation, in the formation of geminal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Si bonds via a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism. These three&#8208;component geminal cross couplings are value&#8208;addition to the synthesis of commercial drugs and bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Proton Shuttling by Polyaniline of High Br&#248;nsted Basicity for Improved Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand on how the Br&#248;nsted basicity of amines at the Cu/polymer interface enables to modulate the reaction pathway, PPy/Cu and PANI/Cu interfaces were successfully synthesized through an in situ electrochemical reconstruction approach. It was found that the neutral &#8208;NH&#8208; moieties in PPy enabled to afford a high CH4 selectivity, while the more basic benzenoid &#8208;NH&#8208; in PANI significantly promoted C2H4 production.







Abstract
Hybrid organic/inorganic composites with the organic phase tailored to modulate local chemical environment at the Cu surface arise as an enchanting category of catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A fundamental understanding on how the organics of different functionality, polarity, and hydrophobicity affect the reaction path is, however, still lacking to guide rational catalyst design. Herein, polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) manifesting different Br&#248;nsted basicity are compared for their regulatory roles on the CO2RR pathways regarding *CO coverage, proton source and interfacial polarity. Concerted efforts from in situ IR, Raman and operando modelling unveil that at the PPy/Cu interface with limited *CO coverage, hydridic *H produced by the Volmer step favors the carbon hydrogenation of *CO to form *CHO through a Tafel process; Whereas at the PANI/Cu interface with concentrated CO2 and high *CO coverage, protonic H+ shuttled through the benzenoid &#8208;NH&#8208; protonates the oxygen of *CO, yielding *COH for asymmetric coupling with nearby *CO to form *OCCOH under favored energetics. As a result of the tailored chemical environment, the restructured PANI/Cu composite demonstrates a high partial current density of 0.41&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a maximal Faraday efficiency of 67.5&#8201;% for ethylene production, ranking among states of the art.

         <title>Sabatier Relations in Electrocatalysts Based on High&#8208;entropy Alloys with Wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band Centers for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is enabled by a high&#8208;entropy strategy to achieve wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers. The typical volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity as demonstrated by the Sabatier principle has been observed. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle for designing LOB catalysts and provides insights into adjusting d&#8208;band centers in wide range.







Abstract
Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is a promising &#8220;beyond Li&#8208;ion&#8221; technology with ultrahigh theoretical energy density (3457&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1), while currently impeded by the sluggish cathodic kinetics of the reversible gas&#8208;solid reaction between O2 and Li2O2. Despite many catalysts are developed for accelerating the conversion process, the lack of design guidance for achieving high performance makes catalysts exploring aleatory. The Sabatier principle is an acknowledged theory connecting the scaling relationship with heterogeneous catalytic activity, providing a tradeoff strategy for the topmost performance. Herein, a series of catalysts with wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers (i.e., wide range of adsorption strength) are elaborately constructed via high&#8208;entropy strategy, enabling an in&#8208;depth study of the Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for LOBs. A volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity emerges. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that a moderate d&#8208;band center with appropriate adsorption strength propels the catalysts up to the top. As a demonstration of concept, the LOB using FeCoNiMnPtIr as catalyst provides an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of over 80&#8201;%, and works steadily for 2000&#8197;h with a high fixed specific capacity of 4000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle as a guidance for designing advanced heterogeneous catalysts assembled in LOBs.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Boosted Kinetic and Selective Molecular Sieving of C6 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous molecular sorbents have excellent selectivity towards hydrocarbon separation with energy saving techniques. However, to realize commercialization, molecular sieving processes should be faster and more efficient compared to extended frameworks. In this work, we show that utilizing fluorine to improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes affords a substantial kinetic selective adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane (20:1 for benzene). The crystal structure shows a porous macrocycle that acts as a perfect match for benzene in both the intrinsic and extrinsic cavities with strong interactions in the solid state. The fluorinated leaning pillararene surpasses all reported organic molecular sieves and is comparable to the extended metal organic frameworks that were previously employed for this separation such as UIO&#8208;66. Most importantly, this sieving system outperformed the well&#8208;known zeolitic imidazolate frameworks under low pressure, which opens the door to new generations of molecular sieves that can compete with extended frameworks for more sustainable hydrocarbon separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Modulation of Intramolecular Aggregation&#8208;induced Electrochemiluminescence by Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based Supramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precisely modulated synthesis of programmable light&#8208;emitting materials remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we construct four tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures (SA, SB, SC, and SD), revealing that they exhibit higher electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensities and efficiencies than the tetraphenylethylene monomer and can be classified as highly efficient and precisely modulated intramolecular aggregation&#8211;induced electrochemiluminescence (PI&#8208;AIECL) systems.

The electrochemical characterization of these architectures in an organic solvent provides deeper mechanistic insights, revealing that SD features the lowest electrochemical bandgap. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the bandgap of the guest ligand in the SD structure is the smallest and most closely matched to that of the host scaffold.

         <title>Assessing the Productivity of the Direct Conversion of Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol over Copper&#8208;Exchanged Zeolite Omega (MAZ) via Oxygen Looping</title>

         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;omega (MAZ) is a very active and selective material for the methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) conversion using the oxygen looping approach. By determining the productivity via a novel screening method combining operando XAS and mass spectrometry, this body of work shows the potential this material exhibits for industrial valorization, as well as a screening method for other materials utilizing the oxygen looping approach.







Abstract
The methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) conversion via the oxygen looping approach using copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites has been extensively studied over the last decade. While a lot of research has focussed on maximizing yield and selectivity, little has been directed toward productivity&#8212;a metric far more meaningful for evaluating industrial potential. Using copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega), a material highly active and selective for the MtM conversion using the isothermal oxygen looping approach, we show that this material exhibits unprecedented potential for industrial valorization. In doing so, we also present a novel methodology combining operando XAS and mass spectrometry for the screening of materials for the MtM conversion in oxygen looping mode.

         <title>An Experimental and Computational Investigation Rules Out Direct Nucleophilic Addition on the N2 Ligand in Manganese Dinitrogen Complex [Cp(CO)2Mn(N2)]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peculiar reactivity of [CpMn(CO)2(N2)] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) is revisited to shed light on the proposed nucleophilic attack of PhLi on its N2 ligand. Our study shows that such reactivity doesn't happen while the attack of the carbanion on CO is favored, albeit giving rise to a very labile compound. The latter decomposes above &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C into a N2&#8208;free phenyl manganate that was erroneously proposed to be an anionic phenyldiazenido complex.







Abstract
We have re&#8208;examined the reactivity of the manganese dinitrogen complex [Cp(CO)2Mn(N2)] (1, Cp=&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, C5H5) with phenylithium (PhLi). By combining experiment and density functional theory (DFT), we have found that, unlike previously reported, the direct nucleophilic attack of the carbanion onto coordinated dinitrogen does not occur. Instead, PhLi reacts with one of the CO ligands to provide an anionic acylcarbonyl dinitrogen metallate [Cp(CO)(N2)MnCOPh]Li (3) that is stable only below &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Full characterization of 3 (including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) was performed. This complex decomposes quickly above &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with N2 loss to give a phenylate complex [Cp(CO)2MnPh]Li (2). The latter compound was erroneously formulated as an anionic diazenido compound [Cp(CO)2MnN(Ph)=N]Li in earlier reports, ruling out the claimed and so&#8208;far unique behavior of the N2 ligand in 1. DFT calculations were run to explore both the hypothesized and the experimentally verified reactivity of 1 with PhLi and are fully consistent with our results. Direct attack of a nucleophile on metal&#8208;coordinated N2 remains to be demonstrated.

         <title>Modulating Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Boost Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane: Nickel&#8208;Platinum Nanoparticles Supported on Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Titania</title>

Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles supported on P&#8208;doped TiO2 mediate visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ammonia borane hydrolysis. The optimized Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency of 967.8&#8197;molH2&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1. P doping enhances the visible&#8208;light absorption and modulates the electronic states of the metals to enhance the strong metal&#8208;support interactions, thereby promoting the hydrogen&#8208;evolving activity and stability of the catalyst.







Abstract
Ammonia borane (AB) is a promising material for chemical H2 storage owing to its high H2 density (up to 19.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%). However, the development of an efficient catalyst for driving H2 evolution through AB hydrolysis remains challenging. Therefore, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for generating H2 through AB hydrolysis was implemented in this study using Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles supported on phosphorus&#8208;doped TiO2 (Ni&#8208;Pt/P&#8208;TiO2) as photocatalysts. Through surface engineering, P&#8208;TiO2 was prepared by phytic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted phosphorization and then employed as an ideal support for immobilizing Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles via a facile co&#8208;reduction strategy. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation at 283&#8197;K, Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 exhibited improved recyclability and a high turnover frequency of 967.8&#8197;mol
&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1. Characterization experiments and density functional theory calculations indicated that the enhanced performance of Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 originated from a combination of the Ni&#8722;Pt alloying effect, the Mott&#8211;Schottky junction at the metal&#8208;semiconductor interface, and strong metal&#8208;support interactions. These findings not only underscore the benefits of utilizing multipronged effects to construct highly active AB&#8208;hydrolyzing catalysts, but also pave a path toward designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by surface engineering to modulate the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions for other visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Efficient Polyethylene Hydrocracking over Two&#8208;Dimensional Platinum&#8208;Anchored Tungsten Trioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D platinum&#8208;anchored tungsten trioxide (Pt/WO3) catalyst with abundant vacancies and acidic sites activates high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer chains by forming C=O intermediates. Hydrocracking occurs when the intermediates are hydrogenated by the dissociated H2 on Pt/WO3 to form alkanes. The well&#8208;dispersed Pt on 2D WO3 nanosheets achieved almost complete HDPE conversion with a yield of 88.9&#8201;% fuel at a low temperature of 200&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Chemical upcycling of polyethylene (PE) can convert plastic waste into valuable resources. However, engineering a catalyst that allows PE decomposition at low temperatures with high activity remains a significant challenge. Herein, we anchored 0.2&#8197;wt.% platinum (Pt) on defective two&#8208;dimensional tungsten trioxide (2D WO3) nanosheets and achieved hydrocracking of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE) waste at 200&#8211;250&#8201;&#176;C with a liquid fuel (C5&#8211;18) formation rate up to 1456&#8197;gproducts&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gmetal species&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1. The reaction pathway over the bifunctional 2D Pt/WO3 is elucidated by quasi&#8208;operando transmission infrared spectroscopy, where (I) well&#8208;dispersed Pt immobilized on 2D WO3 nanosheets trigger the dissociation of hydrogen; (II) adsorption of PE and activation of C&#8722;C cleavage on WO3 are through the formation of C=O/C=C intermediates; (III) intermediates are converted to alkane products by the dissociated H. Our study directly illustrates the synergistic role of bifunctional Pt/WO3 catalyst in the hydrocracking of HDPE, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance catalysts with optimized chemical and morphological properties.

&lt;p&gt;A 2D platinum-anchored tungsten trioxide (Pt/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) catalyst with abundant vacancies and acidic sites activates high-density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer chains by forming C=O intermediates. Hydrocracking occurs when the intermediates are hydrogenated by the dissociated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Pt/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to form alkanes. The well-dispersed Pt on 2D WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets achieved almost complete HDPE conversion with a yield of 88.9&#8201;% fuel at a low temperature of 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Induced&#8208;Fit&#8208;Identification in a Rigid Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for ppm&#8208;Level CO2 Removal and Ultra&#8208;Pure CO Enrichment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atypical thermoresponsive feature is incorporated into a rigid Mg&#8208;MOF, which realizes ppm&#8208;level CO2 capture and ultra&#8208;pure CO enrichment (&#8805;99.99&#8201;%) at elevated working temperature. The property is demonstrated by comprehensive in situ variable&#8208;temperature tests showing outstanding performance in syngas purification and CO upgrading through an induced&#8208;fit&#8208;identification mechanism.







Abstract
Removing CO2 from crude syngas via physical adsorption is an effective method to yield eligible syngas. However, the bottleneck in trapping ppm&#8208;level CO2 and improving CO purity at higher working temperatures are major challenges. Here we report a thermoresponsive metal&#8211;organic framework (1&#8201;a&#8208;apz), assembled by rigid Mg2(dobdc) (1&#8201;a) and aminopyrazine (apz), which not only affords an ultra&#8208;high CO2 capacity (145.0/197.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.01/0.1&#8197;bar) at 298&#8197;K) but also produces ultra&#8208;pure CO (purity &#8805;99.99&#8201;%) at a practical ambient temperature (TA). Several characterization results, including variable&#8208;temperature tests, in situ high&#8208;resolution synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (HR&#8208;SXRD), and simulations, explicitly unravel that the excellent property is attributed to the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;identification in 1&#8201;a&#8208;apz that comprises self&#8208;adaption of apz, multiple binding sites, and complementary electrostatic potential (ESP). Breakthrough tests suggest that 1&#8201;a&#8208;apz can remove CO2 from 1/99 CO2/CO mixtures at practical 348&#8197;K, yielding 70.5&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of CO with ultra&#8208;high purity of &#8805;99.99&#8201;%. The excellent separation performance is also revealed by separating crude syngas that contains quinary mixtures of H2/N2/CH4/CO/CO2 (46/18.3/2.4/32.3/1, v/v/v/v/v).

         <title>Tuning C1/C2 Selectivity of CO2 Electrochemical Reduction over in&#8208;Situ Evolved CuO/SnO2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we report a tuning C1/C2 selectivity of CO2 electrochemical reduction over in situ electrochemically evolved CuO/SnO2 heterostructure. Specifically, the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of the newly evolved Cu/SnO2&#8208;x facilitates ethanol generation.







Abstract
Heterostructured oxides with versatile active sites, as a class of efficient catalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER), are prone to undergo structure reconstruction under working conditions, thus bringing challenges to understanding the reaction mechanism and rationally designing catalysts. Herein, we for the first time elucidate the structural reconstruction of CuO/SnO2 under electrochemical potentials and reveal the intrinsic relationship between CO2ER product selectivity and the in situ evolved heterostructures. At &#8722;0.85&#8197;VRHE, the CuO/SnO2 evolves to Cu2O/SnO2 with high selectivity to HCOOH (Faradaic efficiency of 54.81&#8201;%). Mostly interestingly, it is reconstructed to Cu/SnO2&#8208;x at &#8722;1.05&#8197;VRHE with significantly improved Faradaic efficiency to ethanol of 39.8&#8201;%. In situ Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of Cu/SnO2&#8208;x favors the formation of *CO and decreases the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling, leading to high selectivity to ethanol.

         <title>Elucidating the Underlying Reactivities of Alternating Current Electrosynthesis by Time&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Short&#8208;Lived Reactive Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;resolved operando electrochemical mass spectrometry platform was developed to elucidate the unique reactivities of alternating current (AC) electrosynthesis. Minimization of over&#8208;oxidation and effective reaction of the electrogenerated intermediates in AC electrolysis was demonstrated. Notably, the kinetics of reactive N&#8208;centered radical intermediates in multistep sequential AC electrosynthesis could be controlled to minimize side reactions.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) electrolysis is an emerging field in synthetic chemistry, however its mechanistic studies are challenged by the effective characterization of the elusive intermediate processes. Herein, we develop an operando electrochemical mass spectrometry platform that allows time&#8208;resolved mapping of stepwise electrosynthetic reactive intermediates in both direct current and alternating current modes. By dissecting the key intermediate processes of electrochemical functionalization of arylamines, the unique reactivities of AC electrosynthesis, including minimizing the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction through the inverse process, and enabling effective reaction of short&#8208;lived intermediates generated by oxidation and reduction in paired electrolysis, were evidenced and verified. Notably, the controlled kinetics of reactive N&#8208;centered radical intermediates in multistep sequential AC electrosynthesis to minimize the competing reactions was discovered. Overall, this work provides direct evidence for the mechanism of AC electrolysis, and clarifies the underlying reasons for its high efficiency, which will benefit the rational design of AC electrosynthetic reactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a novel synthetic methodology for covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that utilizes an electrogenerated acid (EGA), which is produced at an electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation of a precursor, acting as an effective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for imine bond formation from amine and aldehyde monomers. Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface with high crystallinity and porosity.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous materials with prospective uses in various devices. However, general bulk synthetic methods usually produce COFs as powders that are insoluble in most of the common organic solvents, arising challenges for the subsequent molding and fixing of these materials on substrates. Here, we report a novel synthetic methodology that utilizes an electrogenerated acid (EGA), which is produced at an electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation of a suitable precursor, acting as an effective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for imine bond formation from the corresponding amine and aldehyde monomers. Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface. The COF structures obtained with this method exhibited high crystallinities and porosities, and the film thickness could be controlled. Furthermore, such process was applied for the synthesis of various imine&#8208;based COFs, including a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COF structure.

         <title>Sodium Bicarbonate Nanoparticles for Amplified Cancer Immunotherapy by Inducing Pyroptosis and Regulating Lactic Acid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and drug&#8208;free inorganic nanomaterial, alkalescent sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (NaHCO3 NPs), was obtained to regulate lactic acid metabolism through acid&#8208;base neutralization, and thus to reverse the mildly acidic immunosuppressive tumor environment. Furthermore, it can release high amounts of Na+ ions and induce a surge in intracellular osmolarity to activate the pyroptosis pathway and improve immune responses.







Abstract
Although immunotherapy has a broad clinical application prospect, it is still hindered by low immune responses and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a simple and drug&#8208;free inorganic nanomaterial, alkalescent sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (NaHCO3 NPs), is prepared via a fast microemulsion method for amplified cancer immunotherapy. The obtained alkalescent NaHCO3 regulates lactic acid metabolism through acid&#8208;base neutralization so as to reverse the mildly acidic immunosuppressive tumor environment. Additionally, it can further release high amounts of Na+ ions inside tumor cells and induce a surge in intracellular osmolarity, and thus activate the pyroptosis pathway and immunogenic cell death (ICD), release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory factors, and improve immune responses. Collectively, NaHCO3 NPs observably inhibit primary/distal tumor growth and tumor metastasis through acid neutralization remitted immunosuppression and pyroptosis induced immune activation, showing an enhanced antitumor immunity efficiency. This work provides a new paradigm for lactic acid metabolism and pyroptosis mediated tumor treatment, which has a potential for application in clinical tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Maximizing Electrostatic Polarity of Non&#8208;Sacrificial Electrolyte Additives Enables Stable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of different saccharide molecules as non&#8208;sacrificial electrolyte additives in regulating Zn2+ desolvation and Zn deposition was investigated for the first time through experimental and theoretical studies.







Abstract
Although additives are widely used in aqueous electrolytes to inhibit the formation of dendrites and hydrogen evolution reactions on Zn anodes, there is a lack of rational design principles and systematic mechanistic studies on how to select a suitable additive to regulate reversible Zn plating/stripping chemistry. Here, using saccharides as the representatives, we reveal that the electrostatic polarity of non&#8208;sacrificial additives is a critical descriptor for their ability to stabilize Zn anodes. Non&#8208;sacrificial additives are found to continuously modulate the solvation structure of Zn ions and form a molecular adsorption layer (MAL) for uniform Zn deposition, avoiding the thick solid electrolyte interphase layer due to the decomposition of sacrificial additives. A high electrostatic polarity renders sucrose the best hydrated Zn2+ desolvation ability and facilitates the MAL formation, resulting in the best cycling stability with a long&#8208;term reversible plating/stripping cycle life of thousands of hours. This study provides theoretical guidance for the screening of optimal additives for high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>Universal Sub&#8208;Nanoreactor Strategy for Synthesis of Yolk&#8208;Shell MoS2 Supported Single Atom Electrocatalysts toward Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by theoretical prediction of the &#8220;E&#8208;Lock&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8208;Channel&#8221; at sulfur vacancy and intercalation carbon, we report a universal sub&#8208;nanoreactor strategy to precisely regulate the spatial location and local microenvironment of metal single atoms (Co, Ni, Fe, Zn, W, Cu, Mn, and Cd) over yolk&#8208;shell C&#8722;MoS2 dual&#8208;support for robust hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction in acid.







Abstract
The coordination structure determines the electrocatalytic performances of single atom catalysts (SACs), while it remains a challenge to precisely regulate their spatial location and coordination environment. Herein, we report a universal sub&#8208;nanoreactor strategy for synthesis of yolk&#8208;shell MoS2 supported single atom electrocatalysts with dual&#8208;anchored microenvironment of vacancy&#8208;enriched MoS2 and intercalation carbon toward robust hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8220;E&#8208;Lock&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8208;Channel&#8221; are conducive to stabilize and activate metal single atoms. A group of SACs is subsequently produced with the assistance of sulfur vacancy and intercalation carbon in the yolk&#8208;shell sub&#8208;nanoreactor. The optimized C&#8722;Co&#8722;MoS2 yields the lowest overpotential (&#951;10=17&#8197;mV) compared with previously reported MoS2&#8208;based electrocatalysts to date, and also affords a 5&#8211;9 fold improvement in activity even comparing with those as&#8208;prepared single&#8208;anchored analogues. Theoretical results and in situ characterizations unveil its active center and durability. This work provides a universal pathway to design efficient catalysts for electro&#8208;refinery.

         <title>Harnessing Aromatic&#8208;Histidine Interactions through Synergistic Backbone Extension and Side Chain Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational and coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension, by replacing &#945;&#8208;amino acid residues with &#946;&#8208;amino acid residues, enables favorable interaction between a His side chain on a target protein and an aromatic side chain on a synthetic peptide ligand. This strategy, which enhances affinity, is showcased with peptides that bind to the parathyroid hormone receptor 1.







Abstract
Peptide engineering efforts have delivered drugs for diverse human diseases. Side chain alteration is among the most common approaches to designing new peptides for specific applications. The peptide backbone can be modified as well, but this strategy has received relatively little attention. Here we show that new and favorable contacts between a His side chain on a target protein and an aromatic side chain on a synthetic peptide ligand can be engineered by rational and coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension. Side chain modification alone was unsuccessful. Binding measurements, high&#8208;resolution structural studies and pharmacological outcomes all support the synergy between backbone and side chain modification in engineered ligands of the parathyroid hormone receptor&#8208;1, which is targeted by osteoporosis drugs. These results should motivate other structure&#8208;based designs featuring coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension to enhance the engagement of peptide ligands with target proteins.

         <title>A Rapidly Responsive Sensor for Wireless Detection of Early and Mature Microbial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A setup for wireless detection of early and mature microbial biofilms has been developed by combining inkjet printing of nanomaterials, chip&#8208;less antenna, and electrogenicity of biofilms. Wireless sensing relies on the biofilm ability to electro&#8208;reduce antenna integrated AgCl to Ag. Detection of medically relevant biofilms formed by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa has been demonstrated, aiming for wireless wound infection sensing in clinics.







Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated infections, which are able to resist antibiotics, pose a significant challenge in clinical treatments. Such infections have been linked to various medical conditions, including chronic wounds and implant&#8208;associated infections, making them a major public&#8208;health concern. Early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation offers significant advantages in mitigating adverse effects caused by biofilms. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of employing a novel wireless sensor for tracking both early&#8208;stage and matured&#8208;biofilms formed by the medically relevant bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sensor utilizes electrochemical reduction of an AgCl layer bridging two silver legs made by inkjet&#8208;printing, forming a part of near&#8208;field&#8208;communication tag antenna. The antenna is interfaced with a carbon cloth designed to promote the growth of microorganisms, thereby serving as an electron source for reduction of the resistive AgCl into a highly&#8208;conductive Ag bridge. The AgCl&#8722;Ag transformation significantly alters the impedance of the antenna, facilitating wireless identification of an endpoint caused by microbial growth. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time presents the evidence showcasing that electrons released through the actions of bacteria can be harnessed to convert AgCl to Ag, thus enabling the wireless, battery&#8208;less, and chip&#8208;less early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation.

         <title>Engineering Soluble Diketopyrrolopyrrole Chromophore Stacks from a Series of Pd(II)&#8208;Based Ravels
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking of one, two, three, or four diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes was achieved by employing recent progress in Pd(II)&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Two unprecedented self&#8208;penetrated motifs have been identified: a Pd2L3 triple and a Pd2L4 quadruple stack. With increasing stack size, the absorption bathochromically shifts and emission quenches, except for Pd2L2L&#8242;2, which stands out with an exceptional luminescence quantum yield of 51&#8201;%.







Abstract
A strategy to engineer the stacking of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes based on non&#8208;statistical metallosupramolecular self&#8208;assembly is introduced. For this, the DPP backbone is equipped with nitrogen&#8208;based donors that allow for different discrete assemblies to be formed upon the addition of Pd(II), distinguished by the number of &#960;&#8208;stacked chromophores. A Pd3L6 three&#8208;ring, a heteroleptic Pd2L2L&#8242;2 ravel composed of two crossing DPPs (flanked by two carbazoles), and two unprecedented self&#8208;penetrated motifs (a Pd2L3 triple and a Pd2L4 quadruple stack), were obtained and systematically investigated. With increasing counts of stacked chromophores, UV/Vis absorptions red&#8208;shift and emission intensities decrease, except for compound Pd2L2L&#8242;2, which stands out with an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 51&#8201;%. This is extraordinary for open&#8208;shell metal containing assemblies and explainable by an intra&#8208;assembly FRET process. The modular design and synthesis of soluble multi&#8208;chromophore building blocks offers the potential for the preparation of nanodevices and materials with applications in sensing, photo&#8208;redox catalysis and optics.

         <title>Sonodynamic Cytokine Nanocomplexes with Specific Stimulation towards Effector T Cell for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sonodynamic cytokine nanocomplexes (SPNAI) can not only specifically activate effector T cells (Teffs) rather than regulatory T cells (Tregs), but also generate 1O2 under sono&#8208;irradiation for induction of immunogenic cell death, which synergistically elevates the ratio of Teffs/Tregs for effective antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Cytokine therapy mediates the interaction between immune cells and non&#8208;immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), forming a promising approach in cancer therapy. However, the dose&#8208;dependent adverse effects and non&#8208;selective stimulation of cytokines limit their clinical use. We herein report a sonodynamic cytokine nano&#8208;immunocomplex (SPNAI) that specifically activates effector T cells (Teffs) for antitumor immunotherapy. By conjugating anti&#8208;interleukin&#8208;2 (anti&#8208;IL&#8208;2) antibodies S4B6 on the semiconducting polymer nanoparticles to afford SPNA, this nanoantibody SPNA can bind with IL&#8208;2 to form SPNAI which can block the interaction between IL&#8208;2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), selectively activating Teffs in TME. Moreover, SPNAI generates 1O2 to trigger immunogenic cell death of cancer cells upon sono&#8208;irradiation, which promotes the maturation of dendritic cells and the proliferation of Teffs. This SPNAI&#8208;mediated combination sonodynamic immunotherapy thus elevates the ratio of Teffs/Tregs in TME, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth, suppression of lung metastasis and prevention of tumor relapse.

         <title>Thermodynamic Phase Transition of Three&#8208;Dimensional Solid Additives Guiding Molecular Assembly for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional solids were developed to optimize the nanoscale structure of the active layer in organic solar cells by offering ample assembly space during the phase&#8208;transition process, yielding a high power&#8208;conversion efficiency of over 19&#8201;%. This research not only established a valuable pre&#8208;selection approach for solid additives but also deepened our understanding of the underlying working mechanism.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning the thermodynamic self&#8208;assembly of molecules via volatile solid additives has emerged to be an effective way to construct high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Here, three&#8208;dimensional structured solid molecules have been designed and applied to facilitate the formation of organized molecular assembly in the active layer. By means of systematic theory analyses and film&#8208;morphology characterizations based on four solid candidates, we preselected the optimal one, 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline (FPA), which possesses good volatility and strong charge polarization. The three&#8208;dimensional solids can induce molecular packing in active layers via strong intermolecular interactions and subsequently provide sufficient space for the self&#8208;reassembly of active layers during the thermodynamic transition process. Benefitting from the optimized morphology with improved charge transport and reduced energy disorder in the FPA&#8208;processed devices, high efficiencies of over 19&#8201;% were achieved. The strategy of three&#8208;dimensional additives inducing ordered self&#8208;assembly structure represents a practical approach for rational morphology control in highly efficient devices, contributing to deeper insights into the structural design of efficient volatile solid additives.

Using a combination of theoretical techniques, we separated the bulk and surface contributions of ionisation potentials of metal oxides, highlighting the critical role of electrostatics. Low bulk ionisation potentials and a high degree of tunability from surfaces were found in CeO2, HfO2, and ZrO2, explaining the discrepancies from measurements and guiding the future design of band&#8208;edge&#8208;related photocatalytic, photovoltaic, and electrochemical devices.







Abstract
Determining the absolute band edge positions in solid materials is crucial for optimising their performance in wide&#8208;ranging applications including photocatalysis and electronic devices. However, obtaining absolute energies is challenging, as seen in CeO2, where experimental measurements show substantial discrepancies in the ionisation potential (IP). Here, we have combined several theoretical approaches, from classical electrostatics to quantum mechanics, to elucidate the bulk and surface contributions to the IP of metal oxides. We have determined a theoretical bulk contribution to the IP of stoichiometric CeO2 of only 5.38&#8197;eV, while surface orientation results in intrinsic IP variations ranging from 4.2&#8197;eV to 8.2&#8197;eV. Highly tuneable IPs were also found in TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2, in which surface polarisation plays a pivotal role in long&#8208;range energy level shifting. Our analysis, in addition to rationalising the observed range of experimental results, provides a firm basis for future interpretations of experimental and computational studies of oxide band structures.

         <title>Balancing Interfacial Reactions through Regulating p&#8208;Band Centers by an Indium Tin Oxide Protective Layer for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>

A new principle of regulating p&#8208;band center of metal oxide protective layer to balance Zn adsorption energy and migration energy barrier for effective Zn anode with long lifetime and low overpotential.







Abstract
Metallic zinc (Zn) is considered as one of the most attractive anode materials for the post&#8208;lithium metal battery systems owing to the high theoretical capacity, low cost, and intrinsic safety. However, the Zn dendrites and parasitic side reaction impede its application. Herein, we propose a new principle of regulating p&#8208;band center of metal oxide protective coating to balance Zn adsorption energy and migration energy barrier for effective Zn deposition and stripping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that benefiting from the uniform zincophilic nucleation sites and fast Zn transport on indium tin oxide (ITO), highly stable and reversible Zn anode can be achieved. As a result, the I&#8722;Zn symmetrical cell achieves highly reversible Zn deposition/stripping with an extremely low overpotential of 9&#8197;mV and a superior lifespan over 4000&#8197;h. The Cu/I&#8722;Zn asymmetrical cell exhibits a long lifetime of over 4000&#8197;cycles with high average coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. Furthermore, the assembled I&#8722;Zn/AC full cell exhibits an excellent lifetime for 70000&#8197;cycles with nearly 100&#8201;% capacity retention. This work provides a general strategy and new insight for the construction of efficient Zn anode protection layer.

         <title>Chemical Bonding Tuned Lattice Anharmonicity Leads to a High Thermoelectric Performance in Cubic AgSnSbTe3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of p&#8208;d and s&#8208;p antibonding states near the Fermi level as well as metavalent bonding provide an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining a high electrical conductivity, resulting in a high thermoelectric performance of the cubic AgSnSbTe3 single crystal.







Abstract
Comprehension of chemical bonding and its intertwined relation with charge carriers and heat propagation through a crystal lattice is imperative to design compounds for thermoelectric energy conversion. Here, we report the synthesis of large single crystal of new p&#8208;type cubic AgSnSbTe3 which shows an innately ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.47&#8211;0.27&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8197;K&#8722;1 and a high electrical conductivity (1238 &#8211; 800&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in the temperature range 294&#8211;723&#8197;K. We investigated the origin of the low &#954;lat by analysing the nature of the chemical bonding and its crystal structure. The interaction between Sn(5&#8197;s)/Ag(4d) and Te(5p) orbitals was found to generate antibonding states just below the Fermi level in the electronic band structure, resulting in a softening of the lattice in AgSnSbTe3. Furthermore, the compound exhibits metavalent bonding which provides highly polarizable bonds with a strong lattice anharmonicity while maintaining the superior electrical conductivity. The electronic band structure exhibits nearly degenerate valence&#8208;band maxima that help to achieve a high Seebeck coefficient throughout the measured temperature range and, as a result, the maximum thermoelectric figure of merit reaches to &#8776;1.2 at 661&#8197;K in pristine single crystal of AgSnSbTe3.

         <title>Elastic Polymer Coated Nanoparticles with Fast Clearance for 19F&#8197;MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastic polymer&#8208;coated nanoparticles (NPs) were developed as novel contrast agents for 19F&#8197;MRI. These NPs encapsulated liquid perfluorocarbon, resulting in high elasticity and robust sensitivity in 19F&#8197;NMR and MRI. Moreover, in vivo imaging of these NPs implied that elastic NPs suppressed long&#8208;term accumulation in the liver.







Abstract
19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful molecular imaging technique that enables high&#8208;resolution imaging of deep tissues without background signal interference. However, the use of nanoparticles (NPs) as 19F&#8197;MRI probes has been limited by the immediate trapping and accumulation of stiff NPs, typically of around 100&#8197;nm in size, in the mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly in the liver. To address this issue, elastic nanomaterials have emerged as promising candidates for improving delivery efficacy in vivo. Nevertheless, the impact of elasticity on NP elimination has remained unclear due to the lack of suitable probes for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term monitoring. In this study, we present the development of perfluorocarbon&#8208;encapsulated polymer NPs as a novel 19F&#8197;MRI contrast agent, with the aim of suppressing long&#8208;term accumulation. The polymer NPs have high elasticity and exhibit robust sensitivity in 19F&#8197;MRI imaging. Importantly, our 19F&#8197;MRI data demonstrate a gradual decline in the signal intensity of the polymer NPs after administration, which contrasts starkly with the behavior observed for stiff silica NPs. This innovative polymer&#8208;coated NP system represents a groundbreaking nanomaterial that successfully overcomes the challenges associated with long&#8208;term accumulation, while enabling tracking of biodistribution over extended periods.

         <title>Facile, Versatile and Stepwise Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Oligomer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>

The stepwise method proposed to synthesize non&#8208;fullerene oligomer acceptors via consecutive Stille coupling reactions offers significant advantages compared to the traditional approach, resulting in fewer unwanted by&#8208;products and easier purification processes. By utilizing this method, the obtained Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based organic solar cells achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;%, along with excellent stability.







Abstract
Oligomer acceptors have recently emerged as promising photovoltaic materials for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited availability of diverse acceptors, resulting from the sole synthetic approach, has hindered their potential for future industrialization. In this study, we present a facile and effective stepwise approach that utilizes two consecutive Stille coupling reactions for the synthesis of oligomer acceptors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach, we successfully synthesize a trimer acceptor, Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD, and further systematically investigate the impact of oligomerization on device performance and stability. The results reveal that this approach has significant advantages compared to the conventional method, including reduced formation of unwanted by&#8208;products and lower difficulties in purification. Remarkably, the OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD achieves an impressive PCE of 18.03&#8201;% and maintains 80&#8201;% of the initial PCE (T80) for 1523&#8197;h under illumination, surpassing the performance of the corresponding small molecule acceptor Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based device. Furthermore, the versatility of the synthetic strategy in obtaining diverse acceptors is further demonstrated. Overall, our findings provide a facile, versatile and stepwise way for synthesizing oligomer acceptors, thereby facilitating the development of stable and efficient OSCs.

     alt="Facile, Versatile and Stepwise Synthesis of High-Performance Oligomer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stepwise method proposed to synthesize non-fullerene oligomer acceptors via consecutive Stille coupling reactions offers significant advantages compared to the traditional approach, resulting in fewer unwanted by-products and easier purification processes. By utilizing this method, the obtained Tri-Y6-OD-based organic solar cells achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;%, along with excellent stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oligomer acceptors have recently emerged as promising photovoltaic materials for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited availability of diverse acceptors, resulting from the sole synthetic approach, has hindered their potential for future industrialization. In this study, we present a facile and effective stepwise approach that utilizes two consecutive Stille coupling reactions for the synthesis of oligomer acceptors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach, we successfully synthesize a trimer acceptor, Tri-Y6-OD, and further systematically investigate the impact of oligomerization on device performance and stability. The results reveal that this approach has significant advantages compared to the conventional method, including reduced formation of unwanted by-products and lower difficulties in purification. Remarkably, the OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Tri-Y6-OD achieves an impressive PCE of 18.03&#8201;% and maintains 80&#8201;% of the initial PCE (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) for 1523&#8197;h under illumination, surpassing the performance of the corresponding small molecule acceptor Y6-OD-based device. Furthermore, the versatility of the synthetic strategy in obtaining diverse acceptors is further demonstrated. Overall, our findings provide a facile, versatile and stepwise way for synthesizing oligomer acceptors, thereby facilitating the development of stable and efficient OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl lithium diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane (Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl; Bn=benzyl) starting from a diborane(4). We demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers (Au, Cu, Zn and Sn) under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring's 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.







Abstract
Diboriranides are the smallest conceivable monoanionic aromatic cycles, yet only limited examples have been reported and their reactivity and complexation behavior remain completely unexplored. We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; as its lithium salt in three steps via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane from a readily available 1,2&#8208;dichlorodiborane(4) (Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl). With the preparation and complete characterization of representative complexes with tin, copper, gold and zinc, we demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring's 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.

         <title>A Molecular Z&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System Under the Bias&#8208;Free Condition for CO2 Reduction Coupled with Two&#8208;electron Water Oxidation: Photocatalytic Production of CO/HCOOH and H2O2</title>

The molecular Z&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthesis with a photocathode of CO2 reduction and a photoanode of two&#8208;electron water oxidation into H2O2 by visible light as the only energy input was developed for the first time.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired molecular&#8208;engineered systems have been extensively investigated for the half&#8208;reactions of H2O oxidation or CO2 reduction with sacrificial electron donors/acceptors. However, there has yet to be reported a device for dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photoanodes coupled with molecular photocathodes in an aqueous solution without the use of sacrificial reagents. Herein, we will report the integration of SnIV&#8208; or AlIII&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (SnTPyP or AlTPyP) decorated tin oxide particles (SnTPyP/SnO2 or AlTPyP/SnO2) photoanode with the dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photocathode on nickel oxide particles containing [Ru(diimine)3]2+ as the light&#8208;harvesting unit and [Ru(diimine)(CO)2Cl2] as the catalyst unit covalently connected and fixed within poly&#8208;pyrrole layer (RuCAT&#8208;RuC2&#8208;PolyPyr&#8208;PRu/NiO). The simultaneous irradiation of the two photoelectrodes with visible light resulted in H2O2 on the anode and CO, HCOOH, and H2 on the cathode with high Faradaic efficiencies in purely aqueous conditions without any applied bias is the first example of artificial photosynthesis with only two&#8208;electron redox reactions.

         <title>Defect Rich Structure Activated 3D Palladium Catalyst for Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of defect&#8208;rich structures (stacking faults, twin boundaries, lattice distortion, steps, and edges), low coordination number (CN), and tensile strain in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) urchin&#8208;like palladium nanoparticles through chlorine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY) can regulate the arrangement of metal atoms. The as&#8208;prepared Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY are highly efficient and durable methanol oxidation reaction electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Controlling the structure and properties of catalysts through atomic arrangement is the source of producing a new generation of advanced catalysts. A highly active and stable catalyst in catalytic reactions strongly depends on an ideal arrangement structure of metal atoms. We demonstrated that the introduction of the defect&#8208;rich structures, low coordination number (CN), and tensile strain in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) urchin&#8208;like palladium nanoparticles through chlorine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY) can regulate the arrangement of metal atoms in the palladium nanoparticles to form a special structure. In situ Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculation results show that Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY catalyst is beneficial to the oxidation and removal of CO intermediates. The Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) that display high current density (363.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and mass activity (3.6&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1), 12.0 and 10.9&#8197;times higher than Pd nanoparticles, respectively. The Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY catalyst also exhibited robust stability with still retained 95&#8201;% activity after 2000 cycles. A defects libraries of the face&#8208;centered cubic and hexagonal close&#8208;packed crystal catalysts (FH&#8208;NPs) were synthesized by introducing chlorine in graphdiyne. Such defect&#8208;rich structures, low CN, and tensile strain tailoring methods have opened up a new way for the catalytic reaction of MOR.

         <title>Design of Furan&#8208;Based Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>

Efficient and photostable furan&#8208;based n&#8208;type semiconductors were developed for organic solar cells. Important photodegradation mechanisms were revealed and analyzed and the findings lead to effective strategies to improve the photostability of non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors.







Abstract
We explore a series of furan&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and report their optoelectronic properties, solid&#8208;state packing, photodegradation mechanism and application in photovoltaic devices. Incorporating furan building blocks leads to the expected enhanced backbone planarity, reduced band gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of these acceptors. Still, their position in the molecule is critical for stability and device performance. We found that the photodegradation of these acceptors originates from two distinct pathways: electrocyclic photoisomerization and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of singlet oxygen. These mechanisms are of general significance to most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, and the photostability depends strongly on the molecular structure. Placement of furans next to the acceptor termini leads to better photostability, well&#8208;balanced hole/electron transport, and significantly improved device performance. Methylfuran as the linker offers the best photostability and power conversion efficiency (&gt;14&#8201;%), outperforming all furan&#8208;based acceptors reported to date and all indacenodithiophene&#8208;based acceptors. Our findings show the possibility of photostable furan&#8208;based alternatives to the currently omnipresent thiophene&#8208;based photovoltaic materials.

These mechanisms are of general significance to most non-fullerene acceptors, and the photostability depends strongly on the molecular structure. Placement of furans next to the acceptor termini leads to better photostability, well-balanced hole/electron transport, and significantly improved device performance. Methylfuran as the linker offers the best photostability and power conversion efficiency (&amp;gt;14&#8201;%), outperforming all furan-based acceptors reported to date and all indacenodithiophene-based acceptors. Our findings show the possibility of photostable furan-based alternatives to the currently omnipresent thiophene-based photovoltaic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Corrole Radicals by Polycyclic Aromatic Fusion: Towards Open&#8208;Shell Near&#8208;Infrared Materials for Efficient Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable &#960;&#8208;extended nickel corrole radicals and their cations exhibiting superior absorbing capacities across the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region are synthesized via the radial fusion of aromatic rings. The nanoparticles encapsulating corrole radicals are high&#8208;performance photothermal agents and enable efficient NIR&#8208;triggered photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy in vivo.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell radicals are promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs) owing to their easily accessible narrow band gaps, but their stabilization and functionalization remain challenging. Herein, highly stable &#960;&#8208;extended nickel corrole radicals with [4n+1] &#960; systems are synthesized and used to prepare NIR&#8208;absorbing PTAs for efficient phototheranostics. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of corrole radicals gradually improves as the number of fused benzene rings on &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic locations increases radially, with naphthalene&#8208; and anthracene&#8208;fused radicals and their one&#8208;electron oxidized [4n] &#960; cations exhibiting panchromatic visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorption. The extremely low doublet excited states of corrole radicals promote heat generation via nonradiative decay. By encapsulating naphthocorrole radicals with amphiphilic polymer, water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles Na&#8208;NPs are produced, which exhibit outstanding photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency of 71.8&#8201;%. In vivo anti&#8208;tumor therapy results indicate that Na&#8208;NPs enable photoacoustic imaging of tumors and act as biocompatible PTAs for tumor ablation when triggered by 808&#8197;nm laser light. The &#8220;aromatic&#8208;ring fusion&#8221; strategy for energy&#8208;gap tuning of corrole radicals opens a new platform for developing robust NIR&#8208;absorbing photothermal materials.

         <title>A Fixable Fluorescence&#8208;Quenched Substrate for Quantitation of Lysosomal Glucocerebrosidase Activity in Both Live and Fixed Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence&#8208;quenched substrate for glucocerebrosidase that can be conveniently fixed using standard conditions enables quantitative measurement of enzyme activity within lysosomes in both live and fixed cells, as well as antibody co&#8208;staining of cellular proteins.







Abstract
Fluorogenic substrates are emerging tools that enable studying enzymatic processes within their native cellular environments. However, fluorogenic substrates that function within live cells are generally incompatible with cellular fixation, preventing their tandem application with fundamental cell biology methods such as immunocytochemistry. Here we report a simple approach to enable the chemical fixation of a dark&#8208;to&#8208;light substrate, LysoFix&#8208;GBA, which enables quantification of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity in both live and fixed cells. LysoFix&#8208;GBA enables measuring responses to both chemical and genetic perturbations to lysosomal GCase activity. Further, LysoFix&#8208;GBA permits simple multiplexed co&#8208;localization studies of GCase activity with subcellular protein markers. This tool will aid studying the role of GCase activity in Parkinson's Disease, creating new therapeutic approaches targeting the GCase pathway. This approach also lays the foundation for an approach to create fixable substrates for other lysosomal enzymes.

One electron reduction of the 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene unit in heterocycle 2 with KC8 yields the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene radical anion, which can be re&#8208;oxidized with [Fc][B(C6F5)4].

         <title>Searching the Chemical Space of Bicyclic Dienes for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage Candidates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Illustration of the relative speed with which a large chemical space of bicyclic dienes can be screened for molecular solar thermal energy storage candidates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is as illustrated not a feasible route due to computational cost, while extended tight binding (xTB) methods are much faster and can give estimates.







Abstract
Photoswitches are molecular systems that are chemically transformed subsequent to interaction with light and they find potential application in many new technologies. The design and discovery of photoswitch candidates require intricate molecular engineering of a range of properties to optimize a candidate to a specific applications, a task which can be tackled efficiently using quantum chemical screening procedures. In this paper, we perform a large scale screening of approximately half a million bicyclic diene photoswitches in the context of molecular solar thermal energy storage using ab initio quantum chemical methods. We further device an efficient strategy for scoring the systems based on their predicted solar energy conversion efficiency and elucidate potential pitfalls of this approach. Our search through the chemical space of bicyclic dienes reveals systems with unprecedented solar energy conversion efficiencies and storage densities that show promising design guidelines for next generation molecular solar thermal energy storage systems.

Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio&#8208; and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid. Its 6/6/6/5&#8208;membered carbocyclic framework is functionalized with two double bonds, a six&#8208;membered hemiacetal, a seven&#8208;membered oxazepane, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group. By a novel and simple convergent strategy involving Pd/Ag&#8208;promoted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling and Dieckmann condensation reactions, the total synthesis of batrachotoxin was realized in 22 steps.







Abstract
Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio&#8208; and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid found in certain species of frogs, birds, and beetles. The steroidal 6/6/6/5&#8208;membered carbocycle (ABCD&#8208;ring) is U&#8208;shaped and functionalized with two double bonds, a six&#8208;membered C3&#8208;hemiacetal across the AB&#8208;ring, a seven&#8208;membered oxazepane on the CD&#8208;ring, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group at the D&#8208;ring carbon chain. These structural features present an unusual and formidable synthetic challenge. Herein we report a total synthesis of batrachotoxin based on a newly devised convergent strategy through a 22&#8208;step sequence. Enantiopure AB&#8208;ring and D&#8208;ring fragments were prepared and subjected to a crucial C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling reaction. Although both C(sp2) centers were sterically encumbered by proximal tetrasubstituted carbon atoms, Ag2O strongly promoted the Pd(PPh3)4&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction at room temperature, thereby connecting the two fragments without damaging their preexisting functionalities. Subsequent treatment with t&#8208;BuOK induced Dieckmann condensation to cyclize the C&#8208;ring. The judiciously optimized functionalizations realized oxazepane formation, carbon chain extension, and pyrrole carboxylic acid condensation to deliver batrachotoxin.

         <title>Unlocking the Transition of Electrochemical Water Oxidation Mechanism Induced by Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by using P and S&#8208;doped Ni&#8722;Fe mixed oxides as model catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we discover that heteroatom doping triggers the OER mechanism transition from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM) by enlarging metal&#8208;oxygen covalency.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping has emerged as a highly effective strategy to enhance the activity of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is widely accepted that the doping does not switch the OER mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM), and the enhanced activity is attributed to the optimized binding energies toward oxygen intermediates. However, this seems inconsistent with the fact that the overpotential of doped OER electrocatalysts (&lt;300&#8197;mV) is considerably smaller than the limit of AEM (&gt;370&#8197;mV). To determine the origin of this inconsistency, we select phosphorus (P)&#8208;doped nickel&#8208;iron mixed oxides as the model electrocatalysts and observe that the doping enhances the covalency of the metal&#8208;oxygen bonds to drive the OER pathway transition from the AEM to the LOM, thereby breaking the adsorption linear relation between *OH and *OOH in the AEM. Consequently, the obtained P&#8208;doped oxides display a small overpotential of 237&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Beyond P, the similar pathway transition is also observed on the sulfur doping. These findings offer new insights into the substantially enhanced OER activity originating from heteroatom doping.

         <title>Dearomatization of (Hetero)arenes through Photodriven Interplay between Polysulfide Anions and Formate
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic protocol was developed for the dearomatization of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and related heteroaromatic compounds through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism induced by single&#8208;electron transfer from photoexcited polysulfide anions in the presence of methanol. The catalytic turnover is maintained by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer between polysulfide radical anions and formate.







Abstract
The facile construction of C(sp3)&#8208;rich carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic compounds is a pivotal synthetic strategy to foster contemporary drug discovery programs. The downstream dearomatization of readily accessible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) planar arenes represents a direct pathway towards accessing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) aliphatic scaffolds. Here, we demonstrate that polysulfide anions are capable of catalyzing a dearomatization process of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and other related heteroaromatic compounds in the presence of potassium formate and methanol under visible light irradiation. The developed protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, scalability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the arene dearomatization.

         <title>An Ultrathin Inorganic Molecular Crystal Interfacial Layer for Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic molecular crystalline Sb2O3 film with an ultrathin thickness of 10&#8197;nm serves as an effective protection layer for Zn anodes to enable uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed side reaction and tip growth effect, achieving a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan over 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
Zn metal anode suffers from dendrite growth and side reactions during cycling, significantly deteriorating the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Herein, we introduced an ultrathin and ultra&#8208;flat Sb2O3 molecular crystal layer to stabilize Zn anode. The in situ optical and atomic force microscopes observations show that such a 10&#8197;nm Sb2O3 thin layer could ensure uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed tip growth effect, while the traditional WO3 layer undergoes an uncontrolled up&#8208;layer Zn deposition. The superior regulation capability is attributed to the good electronic&#8208;blocking ability and low Zn affinity of the molecular crystal layer, free of dangling bonds. Electrochemical tests exhibit Sb2O3 layer can significantly improve the cycle life of Zn anode from 72&#8197;h to 2800&#8197;h, in contrast to the 900&#8197;h of much thicker WO3 even in 100&#8197;nm. This research opens up the application of inorganic molecular crystals as the interfacial layer of Zn anode.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembled J&#8208;Aggregate Nanofibers of Glycosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY for Synergetic Cell Membrane Disruption and Type&#8197;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a lactosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY compound that self&#8208;assembles in situ to form J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers acting as type&#8197;I photosensitizers. The J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers exhibited remarkable superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;.) generation efficiency, the ability to damage the tumor cell membrane, and long&#8208;term retention at tumor sites. This efficient synergistic therapeutic effect was confirmed in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
The in situ self&#8208;assembly of exogenous molecules is a powerful strategy for manipulating cellular behavior. However, the direct self&#8208;assembly of photochemically inert constituents into supramolecular nano&#8208;photosensitizers (PSs) within cancer cells for precise photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a glycosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY compound (LMBP) capable of self&#8208;assembling into J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers in situ for cell membrane destruction and type&#8197;I PDT. LMBP selectively entered human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and subsequently self&#8208;assembled into intracellular J&#8208;aggregate nanovesicles and nanofibers through supramolecular interactions. Detailed studies revealed that these J&#8208;aggregate nanostructures generated superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;&#8901;) exclusively through photoinduced electron transfer, thus enabling effective PDT. Furthermore, the intracellular nanofibers exhibited an aggregation&#8208;induced retention effect, which resulted in selective toxicity to HepG2 cells by disrupting their cellular membranes and synergizing with PDT for powerful tumor suppression efficacy in vivo.

     alt="In Situ Self-Assembled J-Aggregate Nanofibers of Glycosylated Aza-BODIPY for Synergetic Cell Membrane Disruption and Type&#8197;I Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed a lactosylated Aza-BODIPY compound that self-assembles in situ to form J-aggregate nanofibers acting as type&#8197;I photosensitizers. The J-aggregate nanofibers exhibited remarkable superoxide anion radical (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;.&lt;/sup&gt;) generation efficiency, the ability to damage the tumor cell membrane, and long-term retention at tumor sites. This efficient synergistic therapeutic effect was confirmed in HepG2 cells and tumor-bearing mice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in situ self-assembly of exogenous molecules is a powerful strategy for manipulating cellular behavior. However, the direct self-assembly of photochemically inert constituents into supramolecular nano-photosensitizers (PSs) within cancer cells for precise photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a glycosylated Aza-BODIPY compound (&lt;b&gt;LMBP&lt;/b&gt;) capable of self-assembling into J-aggregate nanofibers in situ for cell membrane destruction and type&#8197;I PDT. &lt;b&gt;LMBP&lt;/b&gt; selectively entered human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and subsequently self-assembled into intracellular J-aggregate nanovesicles and nanofibers through supramolecular interactions. Detailed studies revealed that these J-aggregate nanostructures generated superoxide radicals (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;) exclusively through photoinduced electron transfer, thus enabling effective PDT. Furthermore, the intracellular nanofibers exhibited an aggregation-induced retention effect, which resulted in selective toxicity to HepG2 cells by disrupting their cellular membranes and synergizing with PDT for powerful tumor suppression efficacy in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pushing the Upper Limit of Nucleophilicity Scales by Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) was synthesized and their reactions with Michael acceptors and CO2 investigated. The outstandingly high nucleophilicities of mNHOs were determined by kinetic measurements and located on the Mayr scale where they belong to the strongest carbon nucleophiles reported to date.







Abstract
A series of mesoionic, 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs), which have an extraordinarily electron&#8208;rich exocyclic CC&#8208;double bond, was synthesized and spectroscopically characterized, in selected cases by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The kinetics of their reactions with arylidene malonates, ArCH=C(CO2Et)2, which gave zwitterionic adducts, were investigated photometrically in THF at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The resulting second&#8208;order rate constants k2(20&#8201;&#176;C) correlate linearly with the reported electrophilicity parameters E of the arylidene malonates (reference electrophiles), thus providing the nucleophile&#8208;specific N and sN parameters of the mNHOs according to the correlation lg k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E). With 21&lt;N&lt;32, the mNHOs are much stronger nucleophiles than conventional NHOs. Some mNHOs even excel the reactivity of mono&#8208; and diacceptor&#8208;substituted carbanions. It is exemplarily shown that the reactivity parameters thus obtained allow to calculate the rate constants for mNHO reactions with further Michael acceptors and predict the scope of reactions with other electrophilic reaction partners including carbon dioxide, which gives zwitterionic mNHO&#8208;carboxylates. The nucleophilicity parameters N correlate linearly with a linear combination of the quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl cation affinities and buried volumes of mNHOs, which offers a valuable tool to tailor the reactivities of strong carbon nucleophiles.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of Bi&#8208;Functionalized Porphyrins: A Novel Class of Hole&#8208;Layer&#8208;Coordinating Perovskites and Indium Tin Oxide in Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a series of new self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) based on ZnII porphyrin for use as hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Our study successfully demonstrates the superior performance of dual carboxylic acid functionalized porphyrins can boost the solar efficiency of PSCs. The outstanding performance of these porphyrin SAMs lies in their inherent self&#8208;assembled properties and the presence of dual carboxylic acid groups that facilitate effective anchoring to both the ITO surface and perovskites.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) offer the advantage of facile interfacial modification, leading to significant improvements in device performance. In this study, we report the design and synthesis of a new series of carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized porphyrin derivatives, namely AC&#8208;1, AC&#8208;3, and AC&#8208;5, and present, for the first time, a strategy to exploit the large &#960;&#8208;moiety of porphyrins as a backbone for interfacing the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and perovskite active layer in an inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) configuration. The electron&#8208;rich nature of porphyrins facilitates hole transfer and the formation of SAMs, resulting in a dense surface that minimizes defects. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies demonstrate that the double&#8208;anchored AC&#8208;3 and AC&#8208;5 enhance SAMs on ITO, passivate the perovskite layer, and function as conduits to facilitate hole transfer, thus significantly boosting the performance of PSCs. The champion inverted PSC employing AC&#8208;5 SAM achieves an impressive solar efficiency of 23.19&#8201;% with a high fill factor of 84.05&#8201;%. This work presents a novel molecular engineering strategy for functionalizing SAMs to tune the energy levels, molecular dipoles, packing orientations to achieve stable and efficient solar performance. Importantly, our comprehensive investigation has unraveled the associated mechanisms, offering valuable insights for future advancements in PSCs.

         <title>Dynamically Restructuring NixCryO Electrocatalyst for Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Real Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a NixCryO electrocatalyst that can dynamically restructure itself during the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and increase its porosity by Cr leaching. The enhancement of porosity improved electrolyte penetration and boosted electronic interaction between OH&#8722; and active sites, resulting in 2000, 275, and 100&#8197;h stability at 10, 100, and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in real seawater.







Abstract
In the pursuit of long&#8208;term stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater, retaining the intrinsic catalytic activity is essential but has remained challenging. Herein, we developed a NixCryO electrocatalyst that manifested exceptional OER stability in alkaline condition while improving the activity over time by dynamic self&#8208;restructuring. In 1&#8197;M KOH, NixCryO required overpotentials of only 270 and 320&#8197;mV to achieve current densities of 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, with excellent long&#8208;term stability exceeding 475&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 280&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The combination of electrochemical measurements and in situ studies revealed that leaching and redistribution of Cr during the prolonged electrolysis resulted in increased electrochemically active surface area. This eventually enhanced the catalyst porosity and improved OER activity. NixCryO was further applied in real seawater from the Red Sea (without purification, 1&#8197;M KOH added), envisaging that the dynamically evolving porosity can offset the adverse active site&#8208;blocking effect posed by the seawater impurities. Remarkably, NixCryO exhibited stable operation for 2000, 275 and 100&#8197;h in seawater at 10, 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The proposed catalyst and the mechanistic insights represented a step towards realization of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based direct seawater splitting.

Continuous saline water electrolysis increases the concentration of Cl&#8722;, leading to severe anode corrosion. In this work, we have developed the anodes that could efficiently catalyze water oxidation in alkaline saturated saline water at ultra&#8208;high current densities up to 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over hundreds of hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most stable brine oxidation electrodes reported to date.







Abstract
The direct seawater electrolysis at high current density and low overpotential affords an effective strategy toward clean and renewable hydrogen fuel production. However, the severe corrosion of anode as a result of the saturation of Cl&#8722; upon continuous seawater feeding seriously hamper the electrolytic process. Herein, cobalt ferricyanide / cobalt phosphide (CoFePBA/Co2P) anodes with Cap/Pin structure are synthesized, which stably catalyze alkaline saturated saline water oxidation at 200&#8211;2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over hundreds of hours without corrosion. Together with the experimental findings, the molecular dynamics simulations reveal that PO43&#8722; and Fe(CN)63&#8722; generated by the electrode play synergistic role in repelling Cl&#8722; via electrostatic repulsion and dense coverage, which reduced Cl&#8722; adsorption by nearly 5&#8208;fold. The novel anionic synergy endow superior corrosion protection for the electrode, and is expected to promote the practical application of saline water electrolysis.

         <title>Charging Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes by Incorporating Crown Ethers to Capture Cations for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charging metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane realizes charge inversion from negative to positive by including crown ethers to capture cations. The result is enhanced Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. The improved Li+/Mg2+ selectivity is associated with the expanding of energy&#8208;barrier deviation between Li+ and Mg2+ caused by the steric effect and the electrostatic repulsion.







Abstract
Protein channels on the biofilm conditionally manipulate ion transport via regulating the distribution of charge residues, making analogous processes on artificial membranes a hot spot and challenge. Here, we employ metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) membrane with charge&#8208;adjustable subnano&#8208;channel to selectively govern ion transport. Various valent ions are binded with crown ethers embedded in the MOF cavity, which act as charged guest to regulate the channels&#8217; charge state from the negativity to positivity. Compared with the negatively charged channel, the positive counterpart obviously enhances Li+/Mg2+ selectivity, which benefit from the reinforcement of the electrostatic repulsion between ions and the channel. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations reveal that Mg2+ transport through the more positively charged channel needed to overcome higher entrance energy barrier than that of Li+. This work provides a subtle strategy for ion&#8208;selective transport upon regulating the charge state of insulating membrane, which paves the way for the application like seawater desalination and lithium extraction from salt lakes.

         <title>Room Temperature Anhydrous Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Polymerization Enabled by C&#8722;S Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anhydrous room temperature CAS&#8208;Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction between (hetero)aryl boronic esters and aryl sulfides was explored, of which universality was exemplified with thirty small molecules and twelve alternating conjugated polymers. Mechanism studies revealed the importance of room temperature and anhydrous condition in reducing the homocoupling defects and enhancing the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated polymers.







Abstract
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most important and powerful methods for constructing C&#8722;C bonds. However, the protodeboronation of arylboronic acids hinder the development of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling in the precise synthesis of conjugated polymers (CPs). Here, an anhydrous room temperature Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction between (hetero)aryl boronic esters and aryl sulfides was explored, of which universality was exemplified by thirty small molecules and twelve CPs. Meanwhile, the mechanistic studies involving with capturing four coordinated borate intermediate revealed the direct transmetalation of boronic esters in the absence of H2O suppressing the protodeboronation. Additionally, the room temperature reaction significantly reduced the homocoupling defects and enhanced the optoelectronic properties of the CPs. In all, this work provides a green protocol to synthesize alternating CPs.

         <title>Introducing Spiro&#8208;locks into the Nitrogen/Carbonyl System towards Efficient Narrowband Deep&#8208;blue Multi&#8208;resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various spiro&#8208;locks were introduced into the nitrogen/carbonyl&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) system via a designed synthetic route. The introduction of spiro&#8208;locks increased molecular rigidity and suppressed intermolecular interactions. Thus, narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence spectra and improved device efficiencies were achieved simultaneously.







Abstract
The current availability of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with excellent color purity and high device efficiency in the deep&#8208;blue region is appealing. To address this issue in the emerged nitrogen/carbonyl MR&#8208;TADF system, we propose a spiro&#8208;lock strategy. By incorporating spiro functionalization into a concise molecular skeleton, a series of emitters (SFQ, SOQ, SSQ, and SSeQ) can enhance molecular rigidity, blue&#8208;shift the emission peak, narrow the emission band, increase the photoluminescence quantum yield by over 92&#8201;%, and suppress intermolecular interactions in the film state. The referent CZQ without spiro structure has a more planar skeleton, and its bluer emission in the solution state redshifts over 40&#8197;nm with serious spectrum broadening and a low PLQY in the film state. As a result, SSQ achieves an external quantum efficiency of 25.5&#8201;% with a peak at 456&#8197;nm and a small full width at half maximum of 31&#8197;nm in a simple unsensitized device, significantly outperforming CZQ. This work discloses the importance of spiro&#8208;junction in modulating deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <dc:description>
We report a solvent&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tunable arylation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene, which allows the synthesis of monofluoroalkenes and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes from readily available feedstocks. This study provides a useful strategy for the divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds and sheds light on the importance of solvent selection in catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds starting from a suite of raw materials is an intriguing topic. Herein, we report the solvent&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tunable arylation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene. The selection of the reaction solvents provides switchable defluorinated or debrominated arylation from readily available feedstock resources (both arylboronic acids/esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene are commercially available). This switch is feasible because of the difference in coordination ability between the solvent (CH2Cl2 or CH3CN) and the rhodium center, resulting in different olefin insertion. This protocol allows the convenient synthesis of monofluoroalkenes and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, both of which are important scaffolds in the fields of medicine and materials. Moreover, this newly developed solvent&#8208;regulated reaction system can be applied to the site&#8208;selective dechlorinated arylation of trichloroethylene. Overall, this study provides a useful strategy for the divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds and provides insight into the importance of solvent selection in catalytic reactions.

This switch is feasible because of the difference in coordination ability between the solvent (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN) and the rhodium center, resulting in different olefin insertion. This protocol allows the convenient synthesis of monofluoroalkenes and &lt;i&gt;gem-&lt;/i&gt;difluoroalkenes, both of which are important scaffolds in the fields of medicine and materials. Moreover, this newly developed solvent-regulated reaction system can be applied to the site-selective dechlorinated arylation of trichloroethylene. Overall, this study provides a useful strategy for the divergent synthesis of fluorine-containing scaffolds and provides insight into the importance of solvent selection in catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Flow Electrochemistry Enables Practical and Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a practical and cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical method for the highly selective monooxygenation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using continuous flow reactors. The electrochemical method demonstrates excellent scope and scalability by producing 115&#8197;g of one of the alcohol products.







Abstract
The selective oxygenation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds remains a highly sought&#8208;after method in both academia and the chemical industry for constructing functionalized organic molecules. However, it is extremely challenging to selectively oxidize a certain C(sp3)&#8722;H bond to afford alcohols due to the presence of multiple C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with similar strength and steric environment in organic molecules, and the alcohol products being prone to further oxidation. Herein, we present a practical and cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical method for the highly selective monooxygenation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using continuous flow reactors. The electrochemical reactions produce trifluoroacetate esters that are resistant to further oxidation but undergo facile hydrolysis during aqueous workup to form benzylic alcohols. The method exhibits a broad scope and exceptional site selectivity and requires no catalysts or chemical oxidants. Furthermore, the electrochemical method demonstrates excellent scalability by producing 115&#8197;g of one of the alcohol products. The high site selectivity of the electrochemical method originates from its unique mechanism to cleave benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds through sequential electron/proton transfer, rather than the commonly employed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT).

         <title>Electroreductive Radical Borylation of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Without Light by Using Cumulene&#8208;Based Redox Mediators
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically promoted functionalization of unactivated chloroarenes without light is achieved by using novel tetraarylcumulene&#8208;based redox mediators.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) plays a critical role in many chemical processes, from organic synthesis to environmental remediation. However, the selective reduction of inert substrates (Ep/2&lt;&#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+), such as ubiquitous electron&#8208;neutral and electron&#8208;rich (hetero)aryl chlorides, remains a major challenge. Current approaches largely rely on catalyst photoexcitation to reach the necessary deeply reducing potentials or suffer from limited substrate scopes. Herein, we demonstrate that cumulenes&#8211;organic molecules with multiple consecutive double bonds&#8211;can function as catalytic redox mediators for the electroreductive radical borylation of (hetero)aryl chlorides at relatively mild cathodic potentials (approximately &#8722;1.9&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl) without the need for photoirradiation. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies support that step&#8208;wise electron transfer from reduced cumulenes to electron&#8208;neutral chloroarenes is followed by thermodynamically favorable mesolytic cleavage of the aryl radical anion to generate the desired aryl radical intermediate. Our findings will guide the development of other sustainable, purely electroreductive radical transformations of inert molecules using organic redox mediators.

         <title>The Power of Action Plots: Unveiling Reaction Selectivity of Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of action plots is demonstrated by unveiling a reaction selective window between two different substituted triazolinediones that exhibit near identical absorbance spectra. The remarkable difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a dual&#8208;gated reaction manifold, which demonstrates the site&#8208;selective (photo)chemical behavior of both triazolinedione substrates within a single small molecule.







Abstract
Exploiting the optimum wavelength of reactivity for efficient photochemical reactions has been well&#8208;established based on the development of photochemical action plots. We herein demonstrate the power of such action plots by a remarkable example of the wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemistry of two triazolinedione (TAD) substrates, i.e., aliphatic and aromatic substituted, that exhibit near identical absorption spectra yet possess vastly disparate photoreactivity. We present our findings in carefully recorded action plots, from which reaction selectivity is identified. The profound difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; bisfunctional TAD molecule, enabling the formation of a dual&#8208;gated reaction manifold that demonstrates the exceptional and site&#8208;selective (photo)chemical behavior of both TAD substrates within a single small molecule.

         <title>Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization for the Modular Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Vinylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization for the regio&#8208; and atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones. The catalysis system was achieved by means of asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis which afforded trisubstituted as well as E&#8208; and Z&#8208;tetrasubstituted N&#8208;vinylquinazolinone atropisomers, respectively.







Abstract
Axially chiral N&#8208;substituted quinazolinones are important bioactive molecules, which are presented in many synthetic drugs. However, most strategies toward their atroposelective synthesis are mainly limited to the axially chiral arylquinazolinone frameworks. The development of modular synthetic methods to access diverse quinazolinone&#8208;based atropisomers remains scarce and challenging. Herein, we report the regio&#8208; and atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones via the strategy of asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization. The catalysis system utilized both asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis to efficiently afford trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted N&#8208;vinylquinazolinone atropisomers, respectively. With the meticulous design of &#946;&#8208;substituted allylic substrates, both Z&#8208; and E&#8208;tetrasubstituted axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones were obtained in good yields and high enantioselectivities.

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Investigating the Role of Biothiols in Signaling Pathways Associated with Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe for crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier was constructed via a rational molecular design strategy. The probe allowed the investigation of the biothiol&#8208;mediated nuclear factor kappa&#8208;light&#8208;chain&#8208;enhancer of activated B cells (NF&#8208;&#954;B) signaling pathway in cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury mice models.







Abstract
Cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (CIRI) is intimately associated with the redox regulation of biothiol, a crucial antioxidant marker that precludes the onset of ROS. We designed a novel fluorescent probe, DCI&#8208;Ac&#8208;Py, showing various physicochemical properties, such as high selectivity, exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) optical window, and blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetrability, for detecting biothiols in the brain. The picolinate serves as a specific recognition group that is rapidly activated by biothiol and undergoes nucleophilic substitution with the adjacent acrylic ester to yield the desired NIR probe. Additionally, the probe's lipid solubility is improved through the inclusion of halogen atoms, which aids in penetrating the BBB. Using DCI&#8208;Ac&#8208;Py, we investigated changes of biothiols in vivo in the brains of mice during CIRI. We found that biothiol&#8208;mediated NF&#8208;kB classical (P65&#8208;related) and nonclassical (RelB&#8208;related) pathways contribute to abundant ROS production induced by CIRI and that biothiols are involved in redox regulation. These findings provide new insights into the study of CIRI and shed light on the physiological and pathological mechanisms of biothiols in the brain.

&lt;p&gt;A novel near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe for crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier was constructed via a rational molecular design strategy. The probe allowed the investigation of the biothiol-mediated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) signaling pathway in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury mice models.

         <title>Promoting Solar&#8208;driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production over Thiazole&#8208;based Conjugated Polymers via Generating and Converting Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that singlet oxygen (1O2) can react with benzobisthiazole&#8208;based photocatalysts via [4+2] cycloaddition, leading to the formation of endoperoxide intermediate species, which promotes the separation of charge carriers and reduces the barrier for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. The H2O2 production rate of the catalyst is as high as 7274&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water in air.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air provides a low&#8208;cost and eco&#8208;friendly alternative route to the traditional anthraquinone method. Herein, four thiazole&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Tz&#8208;CPs: TTz, BTz, TBTz and BBTz) are synthesized via aldimine condensation. BBTz exhibits the highest H2O2 production rate of 7274&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water. Further, the reaction path is analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) and theoretical calculation, highlighting the prominent role of singlet oxygen (1O2). The generation of 1O2 occurs through the oxidation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;) and subsequent conversion into endoperoxides via [4+2] cycloaddition over BBTz, which promotes charge separation and reduces the barrier for H2O2 production. This work provides new insight into the mechanism of photocatalytic O2 reduction and the molecular design of superior single&#8208;polymer photocatalysts.

         <title>Triple&#8208;function Hydrated Eutectic Electrolyte for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;function eutectic electrolyte is designed by introducing tetramethylene sulfone (TMS) as hydrogen bond acceptor. The preferentially adsorbed TMS on the Zn surface provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress dendrite growth. TMS modulates the primary solvation shell of Zn2+ to realize a novel solvent co&#8208;intercalation situation, and the intercalated TMS remains in the cathode as a &#8220;pillar&#8221; to stabilize the structure.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZBs) are impeded by the mutual problems of unstable cathode, electrolyte parasitic reactions, and dendritic growth of zinc (Zn) anode. Herein, a triple&#8208;functional strategy by introducing the tetramethylene sulfone (TMS) to form a hydrated eutectic electrolyte is reported to ameliorate these issues. The activity of H2O is inhibited by reconstructing hydrogen bonds due to the strong interaction between TMS and H2O. Meanwhile, the preferentially adsorbed TMS on the Zn surface increases the thickness of double electric layer (EDL) structure, which provides a shielding buffer layer to suppress dendrite growth. Interestingly, TMS modulates the primary solvation shell of Zn2+ ultimately to achieve a novel solvent co&#8208;intercalation ((Zn&#8208;TMS)2+) mechanism, and the intercalated TMS works as a &#8220;pillar&#8221; that provides more zincophilic sites and stabilizes the structure of cathode (NH4V4O10, (NVO)). Consequently, the Zn||NVO battery exhibits a remarkably high specific capacity of 515.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a low current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for over 40&#8197;days. This multi&#8208;functional electrolytes and solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism will significantly propel the practical development of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Isoreticular Preparation of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based Multicomponent Metallacages towards Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isoreticular tetraphenylethylene(TPE)&#8208;based multicomponent metallacages were prepared using TPE derivatives as the faces and different tetracarboxylic ligands as the pillars. The integration of TPE&#8208;based photosensitizers and open Re catalytic sites into a single metallacage promoted the directional electron transfer within the metallacage, offering good photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.







Abstract
Multicomponent metallacages can integrate the functions of their different building blocks to achieve synergetic effects for advanced applications. Herein, based on metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, we report the preparation of a series of isoreticular tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metallacages, which are well characterized by multinuclear NMR, ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The suitable integration of photosensitizing tetraphenylethylene units as faces and Re catalytic complexes as the pillars into a single metallacage offers a high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 1707&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values among reported metallacages. Femtosecond transient absorption and DFT calculations reveal that the metallacage can serve as a platform for the precise and organized arrangement of the two building blocks, enabling efficient and directional electron transfer for highly efficient photocatalytic performance. This study provides a general strategy to integrate multifunctional ligands into a certain metallacage to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which will guide the future design of metallacages towards photocatalysis.

         <title>Polymeric Carbon Nitride with Chirality Inherited from Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral polymeric carbon nitride (CN) powder and electrode capable of enantioselective recognition from chiral supramolecular assemblies as monomers is reported. The optimized chiral CN exhibits good chiral recognition for tartaric acid, with an enantioselective preference of ca. 14&#8201;% for the D enantiomer.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of chiral materials is of paramount importance for various applications. Supramolecular preorganization of monomers for thermal polymerization has been proven as an effective tool to synthesize carbon and carbon nitride&#8208;based (CN) materials with ordered morphology and controlled properties. However, the transfer of an intrinsic chemical property, such as chirality from supramolecular assemblies to the final material after thermal condensation, was not shown. Here, we report the large&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral CN materials capable of enantioselective recognition. To achieve this, we designed supramolecular assemblies with a chiral center that remains intact at elevated temperatures. The optimized chiral CN demonstrates an enantiomeric preference of ca. 14&#8201;%; CN electrodes were also prepared and show stereoselective interactions with enantiomeric probes in electrochemical measurements.

     alt="Polymeric Carbon Nitride with Chirality Inherited from Supramolecular Assemblies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large-scale synthesis of chiral polymeric carbon nitride (CN) powder and electrode capable of enantioselective recognition from chiral supramolecular assemblies as monomers is reported. The optimized chiral CN exhibits good chiral recognition for tartaric acid, with an enantioselective preference of ca. 14&#8201;% for the D enantiomer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facile synthesis of chiral materials is of paramount importance for various applications. Supramolecular preorganization of monomers for thermal polymerization has been proven as an effective tool to synthesize carbon and carbon nitride-based (CN) materials with ordered morphology and controlled properties. However, the transfer of an intrinsic chemical property, such as chirality from supramolecular assemblies to the final material after thermal condensation, was not shown. Here, we report the large-scale synthesis of chiral CN materials capable of enantioselective recognition. To achieve this, we designed supramolecular assemblies with a chiral center that remains intact at elevated temperatures. The optimized chiral CN demonstrates an enantiomeric preference of ca. 14&#8201;%; CN electrodes were also prepared and show stereoselective interactions with enantiomeric probes in electrochemical measurements. By adding chirality to the properties transferrable from monomers to the final product of a thermal polymerization, this study confirms the potential of using supramolecular precursors to produce carbon and CN materials and electrodes with designed chemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type ESIPT Chromophores with Distinctive Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;bonding Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophores with distinctive hydrogen bonding selectivity between competitive hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) were reported. Single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical studies unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) and their impact on the ESIPT process. This Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophore skeleton provides new opportunities for the design of solid luminescent materials.







Abstract
Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;based solid luminescent materials with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) remain unexplored. Herein, we introduced a family of Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophores featuring distinctive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) selectivity between competitive HBAs in a single molecule. Our investigations showed that the central hydroxyl group preferentially forms intramolecular H&#8208;bonds with imines in imine&#8208;modified 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzothiazole (HBT) chromophores but tethers the benzothiazole moiety in hydrazone&#8208;modified HBT chromophores. Imine&#8208;derived HBTs generally exhibit higher fluorescence efficiency, while hydrazone&#8208;derived HBTs show a reduced overlap between the absorption and fluorescence bands. Quantum chemical calculations unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and their impact on the ESIPT process. This Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophore skeleton provides new opportunities for the design of solid luminescent materials.

Chemical upcycling of high&#8208;density polyethylene at low temperatures remains a significant challenge. In their Research Article (e202305644), Qingyue Wang, Pingwei Liu and co&#8208;workers report a two&#8208;dimensional platinum&#8208;anchored tungsten trioxide catalyst with abundant vacancies and acidic sites that converts polyethylene effectively to fuel. A quasi&#8208;operando spectroscopic study reveals that polymer chains are activated by forming olefinic intermediates, and then hydrocracked by the dissociated hydrogen&#160;on two&#8208;dimensional catalyst&#160;to form fuel alkanes.

         <dc:description>
The oxygen looping approach &#8230;. &#8230;, a potential scale&#8208;flexible methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion process, has been a focus of research for over a decade. Such a process would be essential to avoid the flaring of methane at remote oil exploitation sites, where methane emerges as an associated gas. Using a novel screening methodology, in their Research Article (e202305140) Mark A. Newton, Jeroen&#8197;A. van Bokhoven et&#8197;al. show the significant potential that copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega exhibits for such a looping process.

         <title>Liquids with Permanent Macroporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tao Li and co&#8208;workers reported a material based on metal&#8211;organic framework nanocrystals which contains the largest reported permanent pores for a liquid. They described the CO2 and water adsorption, as well as the thermal switching properties of the porous liquid. This is the first example of a dual micro&#8208;macroporous liquid created using design rules of hierarchical porosity.







Abstract
Permanent macropores (&gt;50&#8197;nm) had not been reported in the liquid state until a recent report by Tao Li and co&#8208;workers describing a synthetic strategy to form a porous liquid with dual micro&#8208;macroporosity. This is prepared by producing hierarchically porous particles that are surface coated and fluidised by dispersion. Surface micropores enable permanent porosity by steric exclusion of the fluid phase. The material has a considerable water uptake capacity (27&#8201;% w/w) due to large (480&#8197;nm) unoccupied macropores. This also enables switching of thermal conductivity on uptake of water. These are new properties translated from porous solids to the liquid state.

         <title>Non&#8208;activated Esters as Reactive Handles in Direct Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of non&#8208;activated esters represents interesting opportunities in polymer science. While early attempts indicated severe synthetic challenges in this area, recently several researchers have made significant progress, thus enabling structural diversification and synthetic upcycling of various polymers. This review summarizes this progress, and highlights unique structural features that can be exploited in a macromolecular context.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated esters are prominently featured functional groups in polymer science, as ester functional monomers display great structural diversity and excellent compatibility with a wide range of polymerization mechanisms. Yet, their direct use as a reactive handle in post&#8208;polymerization modification has been typically avoided due to their low reactivity, which impairs the quantitative conversion typically desired in post&#8208;polymerization modification reactions. While activated ester approaches are a well&#8208;established alternative, the modification of non&#8208;activated esters remains a synthetic and economically valuable opportunity. In this review, we discuss past and recent efforts in the utilization of non&#8208;activated ester groups as a reactive handle to facilitate transesterification and aminolysis/amidation reactions, and the potential of the developed methodologies in the context of macromolecular engineering.

         <title>Nascent Proteomics: Chemical Tools for Monitoring Newly Synthesized Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nascent proteomics selectively analyzes newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) by labeling them with either isotopes or chemical tags, allowing for the detection of rapid changes in translational profiles upon acute biological modulations. Programmable variants of nascent proteomics enable the control of NSP labeling via optical or genetic manipulations, ensuring selectivity towards cell types and/or cellular states.







Abstract
Cellular proteins are dynamically regulated in response to environmental stimuli. Conventional proteomics compares the entire proteome in different cellular states to identify differentially expressed proteins, which suffers from limited sensitivity for analyzing acute and subtle changes. To address this challenge, nascent proteomics has been developed, which selectively analyzes the newly synthesized proteins, thus offering a more sensitive and timely insight into the dynamic changes of the proteome. In this Minireview, we discuss recent advancements in nascent proteomics, with an emphasis on methodological developments. Also, we delve into the current challenges and provide an outlook on the future prospects of this exciting field.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by paired metal sites in enzymes, dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) were developed as a frontier in heterogeneous catalysis. DACs possess many unique advantages and surpass their counterparts in various catalytic processes. Herein, we summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advancements in synthesis, characterization, structure&#8208;activity relationship of DACs and outlook the future development in this field with combination from computational insights.







Abstract
The pursuit of high metal utilization in heterogeneous catalysis has triggered the burgeoning interest of various atomically dispersed catalysts. Our aim in this review is to assess key recent findings in the synthesis, characterization, structure&#8208;property relationship and computational studies of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), which cover the full spectrum of applications in thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In particular, combination of qualitative and quantitative characterization with cooperation with DFT insights, synergies and superiorities of DACs compare to counterparts, high&#8208;throughput catalyst exploration and screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms are highlighted. Undoubtably, it would be wise to expect more fascinating developments in the field of DACs as tunable catalysts.

         <title>Recoverable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells for Next&#8208;Generation Portable Power Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>

Flexible perovskite solar cells have attracted wide attention because of their unique advantages, such as light weight and high flexibility. This review article discusses the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability of flexible perovskite solar cells, and highlights the practical applications. The outlook and challenges of durable flexible perovskite devices in future commercialization are also considered.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) with excellent recoverability show a wide range of potential applications in portable power sources. The recoverability of FPSCs requires outstanding bendability of each functional layer, including the flexible substrates, electrodes, perovskite light absorbers, and charge transport materials. This review highlights the recent progress and practical applications of high&#8208;recoverability FPSCs, and illustrates the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability through the choice of flexible substrates and the preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films, as well as the optimization of charge&#8208;selective contacts. In addition, we explore the intrinsic properties of each functional layer from the physical perspective and analyze how to select suitable functional layers. Additionally, some effective strategies are summarized, including material modification engineering of selective contacts, additives and interface engineering of interlayers, which can release mechanical stress and increase the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and recoverability of the FPSCs. The challenges of making high&#8208;performance FPSCs with long&#8208;term stability and high recoverability are discussed. Finally, future applications and perspectives for FPSCs are discussed, aiming to promote more extensive commercialization processes for lightweight and durable FPSCs.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes catalyzed by Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* is developed, affording a series of phosphine derivatives in high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes is reported. It provides a series of phosphine derivatives in high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The methodology enjoys broad substrate scope on both 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes and diarylphosphines. The high stereoselectivity is attributed to both the high stability of the Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* complex in the presence of stoichiometric HPPh2 and the produced phosphines, and the high&#8208;performance asymmetric induction of the Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* complex. Finally, the method is used for the synthesis of new chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin compounds built on a cyclopropane skeleton, one of which serves as a wonderful ligand in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of phenylboronic acid to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Large Pore Apertures and High Surface Areas for NO2 Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) were synthesized via coordination of a new ligand (HAOTP) with metal ions (Ni2+ and Cu2+). The resulting HIOTP&#8208;Ni MOF has a large pore aperture of 3.3&#8197;nm and a high surface area of 1300&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. As a result, it has exceptional performance as a chemiresistive sensor, with a highly selective (405&#8201;%) and rapid response (1.69&#8197;min) towards 10&#8197;ppm NO2 gas.







Abstract
The emergence of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with pronounced electrical properties (e.g., high conductivity) has provided a novel platform for efficient energy storage, sensing, and electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the limited availability of suitable ligands restricts the number of available types of 2D c&#8208;MOFs, especially those with large pore apertures and high surface areas are rare. Herein, we develop two new 2D c&#8208;MOFs (HIOTP&#8208;M, M=Ni, Cu) employing a large p&#8208;&#960; conjugated ligand of hexaamino&#8208;triphenyleno[2,3&#8208;b:6,7&#8208;b&#8242;:10,11&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]tris[1,4]benzodioxin (HAOTP). Among the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, HIOTP&#8208;Ni exhibits the largest pore size of 3.3&#8197;nm and one of the highest surface areas (up to 1300&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). As an exemplary application, HIOTP&#8208;Ni has been used as a chemiresistive sensing material and displays high selective response (405&#8201;%) and a rapid response (1.69&#8197;min) towards 10&#8197;ppm NO2 gas. This work demonstrates significant correlation linking the pore aperture of 2D c&#8208;MOFs to their sensing performance.

         <title>Revision of the Absolute Configurations of Chelocardin and Amidochelocardin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelocardin and its bioengineered derivative, amidochelocardin, are known to exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. Herein, we describe the revised absolute configurations of amidochelocardin and chelocardin using a combination of XRD, NMR, ECD, and TDDFT&#8208;ECD calculations. The absolute configuration assigned via XRD analysis for a closely related semisynthetic analogue of 6&#8208;desmethyl&#8208;chelocardin (1) also supports this conclusion.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Chelocardin and its bioengineered derivative, amidochelocardin, are known to exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Herein, we describe the revised absolute configurations of amidochelocardin and chelocardin using a combination of XRD, NMR, ECD, and TDDFT-ECD calculations. The absolute configuration assigned via XRD analysis for a closely related semisynthetic analogue of 6-desmethyl-chelocardin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) also supports this conclusion.

Abstract
X&#8208;ray imaging technology has achieved important applications in many fields and has attracted extensive attentions. Dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging for the real&#8208;time observation of the internal structure of complex materials is the most challenging type of X&#8208;ray imaging technology, which requires high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with high X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) efficiency as well as excellent processibility and stability. Here, a macrocyclic bridging ligand with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature was introduced for constructing a copper iodide cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) scintillator. This strategy endows the scintillator with high XEL efficiency and excellent chemical stability. Moreover, a regular rod&#8208;like microcrystal was prepared through the addition of polyvinyl pyrrolidone during the in situ synthesis process, which further enhanced the XEL and processibility of the scintillator. The microcrystal was used for the preparation of a scintillator screen with excellent flexibility and stability, which can be used for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray imaging in extremely humid environments. Furthermore, dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging was realized for the first time. The internal structure of flexible objects was observed in real time with an ultrahigh resolution of 20 LP mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Gold and Copper from Electronic Waste by Selective Precipitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and selective recovery of gold and copper is achieved using triphenylphosphine oxide and 2,3&#8208;pyrazinedicarboxylic acid, respectively from 2&#8197;M HCl e&#8208;waste leach solutions. The selectivity of these precipitation methods, together with their ease of operation and capacity to recycle and reuse the precipitants, offers potential applications in the purification of Au and Cu from various metal sources.







Abstract
The recycling of metals from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) using efficient, selective, and sustainable processes is integral to circular economy and net&#8208;zero aspirations. Herein, we report a new method for the selective precipitation of metals such as gold and copper that offsets the use of organic solvents that are traditionally employed in solvent extraction processes. We show that gold can be selectively precipitated from a mixture of metals in hydrochloric acid solution using triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), as the complex [(TPPO)4(H5O2)][AuCl4]. By tuning the acid concentration, controlled precipitation of gold, zinc and iron can be achieved. We also show that copper can be selectively precipitated using 2,3&#8208;pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (2,3&#8208;PDCA), as the complex [Cu(2,3&#8208;PDCA&#8208;H)2]n&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2n(H2O). The combination of these two precipitation methods resulted in the recovery of 99.5&#8201;% of the Au and 98.5&#8201;% of the Cu present in the connector pins of an end&#8208;of&#8208;life computer processing unit. The selectivity of these precipitation processes, combined with their straightforward operation and the ability to recycle and reuse the precipitants, suggests potential industrial uses in the purification of gold and copper from e&#8208;waste.

         <title>Constructing Photoactivatable Protein with Genetically Encoded Photocaged Glutamic Acid</title>

Photocaged glutamic acid analogues are genetically encoded into proteins for the first time, opening up new opportunities for directly and effectively generating photoactivatable proteins.







Abstract
Genetically replacing an essential residue with the corresponding photocaged analogues via genetic code expansion (GCE) constitutes a useful and unique strategy to directly and effectively generate photoactivatable proteins. However, the application of this strategy is severely hampered by the limited number of encoded photocaged proteinogenic amino acids. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of photocaged glutamic acid analogues in E. coli and mammalian cells and demonstrate their use in constructing photoactivatable variants of various fluorescent proteins and SpyCatcher. We believe genetically encoded photocaged Glu would significantly promote the design and application of photoactivatable proteins in many areas.

         <title>Photothermal Conversion by Carbon Black Facilitates Aryl Migration by Photon&#8208;Promoted Temperature Gradients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal conversion enables thermal gradients that facilitate high activation barrier reactions, such as the Newman Kwart Rearrangement. Substrates normally requiring bulk temperatures &gt;250&#8201;&#176;C are easily converted via visible light irradiation with short reaction times. Wavelength and intensity tunability enable selective product formation.







Abstract
The Newman Kwart Rearrangement (NKR) offers an efficient and high&#8208;yielding method for producing substituted thiophenols from phenols. While an industrially important protocol, it suffers from high activation energy barriers (35&#8211;43&#8197;kcal/mol), requiring the use of extreme temperatures (&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) and specialty equipment. This report details a highly efficient and straightforward method for facilitating the NKR using photothermal conversion. This underused, unique reactivity pathway arises from the irradiation of nanomaterials that relax via a non&#8208;radiative decay pathway to generate intense thermal gradients. We show carbon black (CB) can be an inexpensive and abundant photothermal agent under visible light irradiation to achieve a facile NKR under mild conditions. The scope includes a wide array of stereo&#8208; and electronically diverse substrates with increasing difficulty of rearrangement, including BHT and BINOL as effective substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the unique application for temporal control in a thermal reaction and tunability of thermal gradients by modulating light intensity. Ultimately, photothermal conversion enables high&#8208;temperature reactions with simple, visible light irradiation.

         <title>Fragment Screening and Fast Micromolar Detection on a Benchtop NMR Spectrometer Boosted by Photoinduced Hyperpolarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benchtop NMR spectrometers are compact, lower in cost, and operate cryogen&#8208;free. The presented method using photoinduced hyperpolarization allows the detection of a protein&#8208;fragment interaction by a reduction of the ligand signal, simply by comparing the spectra measured in absence and presence of protein. Our approach enables to screen at micromolar concentrations of ligand and low micromolar concentrations of protein on a benchtop NMR.







Abstract
Fragment&#8208;based drug design is a well&#8208;established strategy for rational drug design, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on high&#8208;field spectrometers as the method of reference for screening and hit validation. However, high&#8208;field NMR spectrometers are not only expensive, but require specialized maintenance, dedicated space, and depend on liquid helium cooling which became critical over the recurring global helium shortages. We propose an alternative to high&#8208;field NMR screening by applying the recently developed approach of fragment screening by photoinduced hyperpolarized NMR on a cryogen&#8208;free 80&#8197;MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer yielding signal enhancements of up to three orders in magnitude. It is demonstrated that it is possible to discover new hits and kick&#8208;off drug design using a benchtop NMR spectrometer at low micromolar concentrations of both protein and ligand. The approach presented performs at higher speed than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;field NMR approaches while exhibiting a limit of detection in the nanomolar range. Photoinduced hyperpolarization is known to be inexpensive and simple to be implemented, which aligns greatly with the philosophy of benchtop NMR spectrometers. These findings open the way for the use of benchtop NMR in near&#8208;physiological conditions for drug design and further life science applications.

         <title>Performance Descriptors for Catalysts Based on Molybdenum, Tungsten, or Rhenium Oxides for Metathesis of Ethylene with 2&#8208;Butenes to Propene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis revealed the fundamentals of in situ transformation of M(W, Mo or Re)Ox into M&#8208;carbenes in C2H4&#8722;2&#8208;C4H8 metathesis to C3H6. Their concentration and intrinsic activity follow the order Re&gt;Mo&#8811;W. The concentration but not the activity can be increased through the usage of metathesis&#8208;inactive ZrO2 cocatalyst. The enhancing effect depends on the ability of ZrO2 to activate CH bonds in 2&#8208;butenes.







Abstract
The metathesis of ethylene with 2&#8208;butenes to propene is an established large&#8208;scale process. However, the fundamentals behind in situ transformation of supported WOx, MoOx, or ReOx species into catalytically active metal&#8208;carbenes and the intrinsic activity of the latter as well as the role of metathesis&#8208;inactive cocatalysts are still unsolved. This is detrimental for catalyst development and process optimization. In this study, we provide the required essentials derived from steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis. For the first time, the steady&#8208;state concentration, the lifetime, and the intrinsic reactivity of metal carbenes were determined. The obtained results can be directly used for the design and the preparation of metathesis&#8208;active catalysts and cocatalysts, thereby opening up possibilities for optimizing propene productivity.

         <title>Toward Magneto&#8208;Optical Cryogenic Thermometers with High Sensitivity: A Magnetic Circular Dichroism Based Thermometric Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the application potential of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) techniques is showcased through the inaugural application of MCD&#8208;based magneto&#8208;optical thermometry. Leveraging the intrinsic temperature dependence of the MCD C&#8208;term, the presence of dual&#8208;signaled bands, and the amalgamation of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple regression, remarkable sensitivities of up to 95.3&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 are achieved with the [Ho(acac)3(phen)] complex. This achievement establishes a new benchmark for thermal sensitivity values within the cryogenic range.







Abstract
Remote temperature probing at the cryogenic range is of utmost importance for the advancement of future quantum technologies. Despite the notable achievements in luminescent thermometers, accurately measuring temperatures below 10&#8197;K remains a challenging endeavor. In this study, we propose a novel magneto&#8208;optical thermometric approach based on the magnetic&#8208;circular dichroism (MCD) technique, which offers unprecedented capabilities for meticulous temperature variation analysis at cryogenic temperatures. The inherent temperature sensitivity of the MCD C&#8208;term, in conjunction with both positive and negative signals, enables highly sensitive magneto&#8208;optical temperature probing. Additionally, a groundbreaking relative thermal sensitivity value of 95.3&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 2.54&#8197;K can be achieved using a mononuclear lanthanide complex, [[Ho(acac)3(phen)], in the presence of a 0.25&#8197;T applied magnetic field and using a combination of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple regression. These results unequivocally demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our methodology for cryogenic temperature sensing.

         <title>Carbene Formation or Reduction of the Diazo Functional Group? An Unexpected Solvent&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Cyclic Diazo Imides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;dependent light&#8208;assisted divergent reactivities of cyclic diazo imides and thiols have been disclosed. In dichloromethane, an indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidine is formed via triplet a carbene intermediate. By switching the solvent to acetonitrile, the aryl thiol acts as a reductant and leads to the reduction of the diazo functional group to a hydrazone.







Abstract
The control of the reactivity of diazo compounds is commonly achieved by the choice of a suitable catalyst, e.g. via stabilization of singlet carbenes or radical intermediates. Herein, we report on the light&#8208;promoted reactivity of cyclic diazo imides with thiols, where the choice of solvent results in two fundamentally different reaction pathways. In dichloromethane (DCM), a carbene is formed initially and engages in a cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/thiolation reaction to deliver indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidines in good to excellent yields. When switching to acetonitrile solvent, the carbene pathway is shut down and an unusual reduction of the diazo compound occurs under otherwise identical reaction conditions, where the aryl thiol acts as reductant. A combined set of experimental and computational studies was carried out to obtain mechanistic understanding and to support that indane formation proceeds via the insertion of a triplet carbene, while the reduction of diazo imides proceeds via an electron transfer process.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral QUINAP Derivatives by Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ketone&#8208;catalyzed reaction for the enantioselective oxidation of N atoms was developed and effectively applied to the atroposelective kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs and related compounds. Both highly enantioenriched QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide products could be readily converted into QUINAPs without loss of chiral integrity. QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide was also shown to act as a chiral Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
QUINAPs have emerged as a pivotal class of axially chiral compounds with remarkable features in the stereoinduction of diverse enantioselective transformations. However, the confined substrate range and extravagant price still pose challenges, limiting their broader utilization. Herein, we describe the first atroposelective oxidation of an N atom using a chiral ketone catalyst, allowing the kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs to give both the unreacted substrates and their corresponding N&#8208;oxides with excellent enantioselectivity. Importantly, the enantioenriched products can be readily converted into the QUINAP targets without any loss of stereochemical integrity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that a dioxirane, generated through the oxidation of the ketone with oxone, acts as the active catalytic species. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this catalytic system to the kinetic resolution of QUINOLs and the dynamic kinetic transformation of pyridine analogues of QUINAPO possessing a labile stereogenic axis. The practicality of the developed protocol is further demonstrated by the successful application of QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide as a Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.

Mechanistic investigations indicate that a dioxirane, generated through the oxidation of the ketone with oxone, acts as the active catalytic species. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this catalytic system to the kinetic resolution of QUINOLs and the dynamic kinetic transformation of pyridine analogues of QUINAPO possessing a labile stereogenic axis. The practicality of the developed protocol is further demonstrated by the successful application of QUINAPO &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide as a Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Raman Lasing from Metal&#8208;Linked Organic Dimer Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave Raman lasing is realized in a metal&#8208;linked organic dimer microcrystal. It has much enhanced Raman gain and notably improved stability. By virtue of the wide transparency window of the microcrystal, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering offers an alternative strategy to explore continuous&#8208;wave (c.w.) organic lasers, which, however, still suffers from the limitation of inadequate Raman gain in organic material systems. Here we propose a metal&#8208;linking approach to enhance the Raman gain of organic molecules. Self&#8208;assembled microcrystals of the metal linked organic dimers exhibit large Raman gain, therefore allowing for c.w. Raman lasing. Furthermore, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved in the organic dimer microcrystals by adjusting excitation wavelengths. This work advances the understanding of Raman gain in organic molecules, paving a way for the design of c.w. organic lasers.

         <title>MIDA&#8208; and TIDA&#8208;Boronates Stabilize &#945;&#8208;Radicals Through B&#8722;N Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work shows that alkyl MIDA&#8208; and TIDA&#8208;boronates have a notable stabilizing effect on &#945;&#8208;radicals that arises via B&#8722;N hyperconjugation. This is supported by DFT radical stabilization energy and spin density studies, development of a site&#8208;selective bromination reaction, and LED&#8197;NMR kinetic analysis of bromination rates for different alkyl boronic esters.







Abstract
Multifunctional organoboron compounds increasingly enable the simple generation of complex, Csp3&#8208;rich small molecules. The ability of boron&#8208;containing functional groups to modify the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;radicals has also enabled a myriad of chemical reactions. Boronic esters with vacant p&#8208;orbitals have a significant stabilizing effect on &#945;&#8208;radicals due to delocalization of spin density into the empty orbital. The effect of coordinatively saturated derivatives, such as N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates and counterparts, remains less clear. Herein, we demonstrate that coordinatively saturated MIDA and TIDA boronates stabilize secondary alkyl &#945;&#8208;radicals via &#963;B&#8208;N hyperconjugation in a manner that allows site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bromination. DFT calculated radical stabilization energies and spin density maps as well as LED&#8197;NMR kinetic analysis of photochemical bromination rates of different boronic esters further these findings. This work clarifies that the &#945;&#8208;radical stabilizing effect of boronic esters does not only proceed via delocalization of radical character into vacant boron p&#8208;orbitals, but that hyperconjugation of tetrahedral boron&#8208;containing functional groups and their ligand electron delocalizing ability also play a critical role. These findings establish boron ligands as a useful dial for tuning reactivity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon.

         <title>Direct Acylation of Unactivated Alkyl Halides with Aldehydes through N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldehydes underwent cross&#8208;coupling with unactivated alkyl halides in the presence of an NHC organocatalyst, thus enabling the rapid synthesis of various ketones from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. This method was also applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical derivatives. Mechanistic investigations suggest a closed&#8208;shell nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this organocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic acylation of organohalides with aldehydes is an ideal strategy for the direct synthesis of ketones. However, the utilization of unactivated alkyl halides in such a transformation remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we developed a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aldehydes with unactivated alkyl halides through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. With this protocol, various ketones could be rapidly synthesized from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. This organocatalytic system was successfully applied in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical derivatives. Mechanistic investigations suggest a closed&#8208;shell nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this reaction.

         <title>Regioselective and Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a general method for the regio&#8208; and enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes under mild conditions. The reaction tolerates a wild range of functional groups and applicable to different classes of alkenes. Alkynes are also compatible under this catalytic system with the cascade hydrogenation&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation process to alkyl amides.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of amide backbones in marketed pharmaceuticals and their ubiquity as critical binding units in natural peptides and proteins, it remains important to develop novel methods to construct amide bonds. We report here a general method for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes under mild conditions, using copper catalysis in combination with hydroxylamine electrophile reagents and poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS) as a cheap and environmentally friendly hydride source. The reaction tolerates a variety of functional groups and efficiently converts unactivated terminal alkenes, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, and cyclic alkenes to the corresponding amides with exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity (and high enantioselectivities/diastereoselectivities). Additionally, with minimal modification of the reaction conditions, alkynes can also undergo tandem hydrogenation&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation to alkyl amides.

         <title>Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; Catalytic Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalytic micelles are introduced to expand the collection of systems catalysts compatible with anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis with a rich topic of general importance. They are of interest to realize anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis, anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis and anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; autocatalysis in water. Classics in supramolecular chemistry are installed to control substrate binding and positioning within the confined micellar space for access to emergent properties.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis operates by stabilizing anionic transition states on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces. In anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis, &#960; stacks add polarizability to strengthen interactions. In search of synthetic methods to extend &#960; stacks beyond the limits of foldamers, the self&#8208;assembly of micelles from amphiphilic naphthalenediimides (NDIs) is introduced. To interface substrates and catalysts, charge&#8208;transfer complexes with dialkoxynaphthalenes (DANs), a classic in supramolecular chemistry, are installed. In &#960;&#8208;stacked micelles, the rates of bioinspired ether cyclizations exceed rates on monomers in organic solvents by far. This is particularly impressive considering that anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis in water has been elusive so far. Increasing rates with increasing &#960; acidity of the micelles evince operational anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis. At maximal &#960; acidity, autocatalytic behavior emerges. Dependence on position and order in confined micellar space promises access to emergent properties. Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalytic micelles in water thus expand supramolecular systems catalysis accessible with anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with an inspiring topic of general interest and great perspectives.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Metaphanine and Oxoepistephamiersine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two complex hasubanan alkaloids were synthesized from inexpensive cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal by a divergent route featuring a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization. Regioselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation followed by MeNH2&#8208;triggered skeletal reorganization formed the benzannulated aza[4.4.3]propellane, and late&#8208;stage regio&#8208; and diastereoselective oxidative annulation of a sp3 C&#8722;H bond formed the challenging tetrahydrofuran ring system.







Abstract
Herein, we report a concise and divergent synthesis of the complex hasubanan alkaloids metaphanine and oxoepistephamiersine from commercially available and inexpensive cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal. Our synthesis features a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization reaction to set the tricyclic carbon framework of the desired molecules, a regioselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation followed by a MeNH2 triggered skeletal reorganization cascade to construct the benzannulated aza[4.4.3]propellane, and a strategically late&#8208;stage regio&#8208;/diastereoselective oxidative annulation of sp3 C&#8722;H bond to form the challenging THF ring system and hemiketal moiety in a single step. In addition, a highly enantioselective alkylation of cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal paved the way for the asymmetric synthesis of target molecular.

         <title>Zeolite Synthesis in the Presence of Metallosiloxanes for the Quantitative Encapsulation of Metal Species for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of NOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot hydrothermal zeolite synthesis using metallosiloxane precursors enables a quantitative encapsulation of metal species into the zeolite. For Fe&#8208;MFI zeolite the approach facilities a homogeneous distribution of the Fe species throughout the zeolite framework and leading to improved catalytic activity with good tolerance to H2O/SO2 in the NH3&#8208;selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx across a wide temperature range.







Abstract
Metal encapsulation in zeolitic materials through one&#8208;pot hydrothermal synthesis (HTS) is an attractive technique to prepare zeolites with a high metal dispersion. Due to its simplicity and the excellent catalytic performance observed for several catalytic systems, this method has gained a great deal of attention over the last few years. While most studies apply synthetic methods involving different organic ligands to stabilize the metal under synthesis conditions, here we report the use of metallosiloxanes as an alternative metal precursor. Metallosiloxanes can be synthesized from simple and cost&#8208;affordable chemicals and, when used in combination with zeolite building blocks under standard synthesis conditions, lead to quantitative metal loading and high dispersion. Thanks to the structural analogy of siloxane with TEOS, the synthesis gel stabilizes by forming siloxane bridges that prevent metal precipitation and clustering. When focusing on Fe&#8208;encapsulation, we demonstrate that Fe&#8208;MFI zeolites obtained by this method exhibit high catalytic activity in the NH3&#8208;mediated selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx along with a good H2O/SO2 tolerance. This synthetic approach opens a new synthetic route for the encapsulation of transition metals within zeolite structures.

         <title>Isolable Tetragold(0) Clusters with Polarity&#8208;Tunable exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au Bond via Intramolecular &#963;&#8208;Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;enveloped tetragold(0) clusters have been successfully synthesized via a nucleophilic substitution reaction between a Au3 anionic cluster and PMe3AuCl. A novel stabilization mode, intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization has been discovered, in which the intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization has now been observed for the first time in homometallic clusters, and the polarity of the exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au bonds can be tuned via the strength of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity.

Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;aromatization is a trait of many organic compounds that enhances the stability of their structures and polarizes related C&#8722;C &#960; bonds. In contrast, rare study is focused on this phenomenon in metal clusters. Many existing homometallic clusters exhibit aromaticity, often characterized by nonpolar metal&#8208;metal bonds and a high degree of symmetry. However, synthesizing low&#8208;symmetric homometallic clusters with high&#8208;polar metal&#8208;metal bonds is challenging due to their limited thermodynamic stability. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of [Au(&#956;2&#8208;ER2)]3&#8722;AuPMe3 (E=Ge, Sn; R2=1,1,4,4&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) clusters and reveal a novel stabilization mode, intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization. Our electronic structure analyses show that these low&#8208;symmetric clusters possess a ten&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;aromatic system, which is achieved via intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization. Moreover, the strength of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity gives rise to a polarity&#8208;tunable exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au bond.

&lt;p&gt;Ligand-enveloped tetragold(0) clusters have been successfully synthesized via a nucleophilic substitution reaction between a Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; anionic cluster and PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AuCl.

         <title>Enzymatic Benzofuranoindoline Formation in the Biosynthesis of the Strained Bridgehead Bicyclic Dipeptide (+)&#8208;Azonazine A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of the strained dipeptide (+)&#8208;azonazine A from marine&#8208;derived Aspergillus insulicola, which features a rarely observed benzofuranoindoline ring system, was uncovered. Heterologous reconstitution of the fourth&#8208;enzyme pathway showed a P450 enyzme catalyzes an oxidative cyclization of cyclo&#8208;(l&#8208;Trp&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr) to form the hexacyclic ring system. Analogs of azonazine A were generated by supplementing the producing strain with different indole&#8208;substituted tryptophan analogs.







Abstract
We uncovered and reconstituted a concise biosynthetic pathway of the strained dipeptide (+)&#8208;azonazine A from marine&#8208;derived Aspergillus insulicola. Formation of the hexacyclic benzofuranoindoline ring system from cyclo&#8208;(l&#8208;Trp&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr) is catalyzed by a P450 enzyme through an oxidative cyclization. Supplementing the producing strain with various indole&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives resulted in the generation of a series of azonazine A analogs.

         <title>Few&#8208;Layer Fullerene Network for Photocatalytic Pure Water Splitting into H2 and H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A few&#8208;layer fullerene C60 network was successfully synthesized and explored for photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and H2O2 under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The mechanism for water splitting of the few&#8208;layer C60 catalyst was investigated.







Abstract
A few&#8208;layer fullerene network possesses several advantageous characteristics, including a large surface area, abundant active sites, high charge mobility, and an appropriate band gap and band edge for solar water splitting. Herein, we report for the first time that the few&#8208;layer fullerene network shows interesting photocatalytic performance in pure water splitting into H2 and H2O2 in the absence of any sacrificial reagents. Under optimal conditions, the H2 and H2O2 evolution rates can reach 91 and 116&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with good stability. This work demonstrates the novel application of the few&#8208;layer fullerene network in the field of energy conversion.

         <title>A Porphyrin Iron(III) &#960;&#8208;Dication Species and its Relevance in Catalyst Design for the Umpolung of Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoporphyrins have recently been identified as remarkable species capable of turning the nucleophile attached to the porphyrin ring into an electrophile, thereby providing umpolung of reactivity (Inorg. Chem.2022, 61, 8105&#8208;8111). They are generated by nucleophilic attack on an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication, a class of species that has received scant attention. Here, we explore the effect of the porphyrin meso&#8208;substituent and report a novel iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication bearing the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) ligand. We provide an extensive study of the species by UV&#8208;Vis absorption, 2H&#8208;NMR, EPR, applied field M&#246;ssbauer, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. We further explore the system&#8217;s highly dynamic and tunable properties and address the nature of the axial ligands as well as the conformation of the porphyrin ring. The insights presented are essential for the rational design of catalysts for the umpolung of nucleophiles. Such catalytic avenues could for example provide a novel method for electrophilic chlorinations. We show for the first time that such catalytic reactivity is possible, and that electronic tuning of the porphyrin by nature of the meso&#8208;substituent is a crucial factor in catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Decorating Channel Walls in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Crown Ethers for Efficient and Selective Separation of Radioactive Strontium(II)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear accidents and the improper disposal of nuclear wastes have&#160;led&#160;to serious environmental pollution. The rational design of adsorbents for the highly efficient separation of strontium(II) is essential in treating nuclear waste and recovering radioactive strontium resources. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential materials for the separation of aqueous metal ions owing to their designable structure and tunable functionality. Herein, a novel 3D MOF&#160;material&#160;MOF&#8208;18Cr6, in which 1D channels were formed using 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether&#8208;containing ligands as channel walls, was fabricated for strontium(II) separation. In contrast to traditional MOFs designed by grafting functional groups in the framework pores, MOF&#8208;18Cr6 possesses regular 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether cavities on the channel walls, which not only can transport and intake strontium(II)&#160;&#160;via the channels, but also prevent blockage of the channels after the binding of strontium(II). Consequently, the functional sites were fully utilized to achieve&#160;a&#160;high strontium(II) removal&#160;rate&#160;of 99.73% in simulated nuclear wastewater. This study fabricates a highly promising adsorbent for the separation of aqueous radioactive strontium(II), and more importantly, can provide a new strategy for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF adsorbents for separating target substances from complex aqueous environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesizing Interpenetrated Triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich porous materials. COFs typically show high thermal/chemical stability, and are promising for energy applications, but often require harsh synthesis conditions and suffer from low crystallinity. In this work, we propose an environmentally friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline COFs from CO2 molecules as a precursor. The mass ratio of CO2 conversion into COFs formula unit reaches 46.3%. The synthesis consists of two steps; preparation of 1,4&#8208;piperazinedicarboxaldehyde from CO2 and piperazine, and condensation of the dicarboxaldehyde and melamine to construct the framework. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of 2D layers determined by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and select&#8208;area electron diffraction. The structure shows a high Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface area of 945 m2 g&#8722;1 and high stability against strong acid (6M HCl), base (6M NaOH), and boiling water over 24 hours. Post&#8208;modification of the framework with oxone has been demonstrated to modulate hydrophilicity, and it exhibits proton conductivity of 2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 85 &#176;C, 95% of relative humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents Enabled Full&#8208;color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Achiral Luminophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, chiral deep eutectic solvents (DES) are prepared by lauric acid as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and chiral menthol as the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). When achiral fluorescent molecules are doped into the menthol&#8208;based chiral DES, they emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with handedness controlled by the molecular chirality (L or D) of menthol. Remarkably, the strategy is universal and a series of achiral fluorescent molecules can be endowed CPL activity, showing a full&#8208;color and white CPL upon appropriate mixing, which paves a convenient way to prepare white CPL materials. Interestingly, CPL appears only in a certain temperature range in DES. Variable&#8208;temperature spectra and other characterization method reveal that the H&#8208;bond network in the chiral DES plays an important role in inducing CPL. The work unveils how the interior structure as well as the hydrogen bond network of chiral DES transfer their chirality to the achiral luminophores for the first time and realizes a full&#8208;color and white CPL in DES.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective High&#8208;Throughput Assay Showcased for the Identification of (R)&#8208; as well as (S)&#8208;Selective Unspecific Peroxygenases for C&#8208;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying (bio)catalysts displaying high enantio/stereoselectivity is a fundamental prerequisite for the advancement of asymmetric catalysis. Here, a high&#8208;throughput, stereoselective screening assay is reported giving information on enantioselectivity, stereopreference and activity showcased for peroxygenase catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay is based on analyzing spectrophotometrically the simultaneous formation of NAD(P)H from the alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of the sec&#8208;alcohol product during the peroxygenase reaction. The assay was applied to investigate a library comprising 44 unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) containing 25 UPOs not reported yet. Thereby, previously non&#8208;described wild&#8208;type UPOs displaying (S)&#8208; as well as (R)&#8208;stereoselectivity for the hydroxylation of representative model substrates were identified reaching up to 98% ee for the (R)&#8208; and 94% ee for the (S)&#8208;enantiomer. Homology models with concomitant docking studies indicated the structural reason of the observed complementary stereopreference.</dc:description>

The assay is based on analyzing spectrophotometrically the simultaneous formation of NAD(P)H from the alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of the sec-alcohol product during the peroxygenase reaction. The assay was applied to investigate a library comprising 44 unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) containing 25 UPOs not reported yet. Thereby, previously non-described wild-type UPOs displaying (S)- as well as (R)-stereoselectivity for the hydroxylation of representative model substrates were identified reaching up to 98% ee for the (R)- and 94% ee for the (S)-enantiomer. Homology models with concomitant docking studies indicated the structural reason of the observed complementary stereopreference.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of In&#8208;Situ Hybrid Interface Construction and pH Buffering Enabled Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode at High Current Density and Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In aqueous electrolytes, the uncontrollable interfacial evolution caused by a series of factors such as pH variation and unregulated Zn2+ diffusion would usually result in the rapid failure of metallic Zn anode. Considering the high correlation among various triggers that induce the anode deterioration, a synergistic modulation strategy based on electrolyte modification is developed. Benefitting from the unique pH buffer mechanism of the electrolyte additive and its capability to in&#8208;situ construct a zincophilic solid interface, this synergistic effect can comprehensively manage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Zn anode by inhibiting the pH variation and parasitic side reactions, accelerating de&#8208;solvation of hydrated Zn2+, and regulating the diffusion behavior of Zn2+ to realize uniform Zn deposition. Thus, the modified Zn anode can achieve an impressive lifespan at ultra&#8208;high current density and areal capacity, operating stably for 609 and 209 hours at 20 mA cm&#8208;2, 20 mAh cm&#8208;2 and 40 mA cm&#8208;2, 20 mAh cm&#8208;2, respectively. Based on this exceptional performance, high loading Zn||NH4V4O10 batteries can achieve excellent cycle stability and rate performance. Compared with those previously reported single pH buffer strategies, the synergistic modulation concept is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Forcing Twisted 1,7&#8208;Dibromoperylene Diimides to Flatten in the Solid State: What a Difference an Atom Makes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene&#8208;diimides (PDI) are workhorses in the field of organic electronics, owing to their appealing n&#8208;semiconducting properties. Optimization of their performances is widely pursued by bay&#8208;atom substitution and diverse imide functionalization. Bulk solids and thin&#8208;films of these species crystallize in a variety of stacking configurations, depending on the geometry of the stable conformation of the polyaromatic core. We here demonstrate that 1,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;substituted perylene&#8208;diimides, PDI(H2Br2), possessing a heavily twisted conformation in the gas phase, in solution and in the solids, can be easily flattened in the solid state into centrosymmetric molecules if the polyaromatic cores form p&#8208;p stabilized chains. This is achieved by using axial residues with low stereochemical hindrance, as guaranteed by a single CH2/NH spacer directly linked to the imide function. Structural powder diffraction and DFT calculations on four newly designed species of the PDI(H2Br2) class coherently show that, thanks to the flexibility of the N&#8208;X&#8208;Ar link (X = CH2/NH), flat cores are indeed obtained by overcoming the interconversion barrier between twisted atropoisomers, of only 26.5 kJ mol&#8208;1. This strategy may then be useful to induce &#8220;anomalously flat&#8221; polyaromatic cores of different kinds (substituted acenes/rylenes) in the solid state, towards suitable crystal packing and orbital interactions for improved electronic performances.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have been prepared on Au (111) and their thermal stability, adsorption geometry, and molecular order were characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, polarized X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The strong &#963;&#8208;bond character of NHO anchoring to Au induced high geometrical flexibility that enabled a flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry via coordination to Au&#8208;adatom. The flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry was utilized to further increase the surface interaction of NHO monolayer by backbone functionalization with methyl groups that induced high thermal stability and a large impact on work function values, which outperformed that of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. STM measurements, supported by DFT modeling, identified that NHOs were self&#8208;assembled in dimers, trimers, and tetramers constructed of two, three, and four complexes of NHO&#8208;Au&#8208;adatom. This self&#8208;assembly pattern was correlated to strong NHO&#8208;Au interactions and steric hindrance between adsorbates, demonstrating the crucial influence of the carbon&#8208;metal &#963;&#8208;bond on monolayer properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Determination of Water in Organic Liquids by Ambient Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study uses a rapid tandem mass spectrometry method to determine water content in complex organic solutions. Emphasis is placed on trace water analysis by a fast and accurate alternative to the Karl&#8208;Fischer method. In this new method, water is captured by a charge&#8208;labeled molecular probe. Water binds strongly with high specificity to the strongly electrophilic aldehyde site in a charge labelled molecule (N&#8208;methylpyridinium); competitive binding by other analytes is effectively discriminated against in the mass measurement step. Quantitative determinations are made over a wide concentration range, 0.001% (10 ppm) to 99%, with better than 10% RSD, along with short (1 min) analysis times using small sample volumes (several &#181;L). Applications include water measurement in simple organic solvents, e.g. deuterated solvents, as well as in complex mixtures, e.g. organic reaction mixtures. Additionally, this method allows for water monitoring in levitated droplets. Mechanistic investigations into the impact of water on important chemical processes in organic synthesis and environmental science are reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Azopolyesters with Intrinsic Crystallinity and Photoswitchable Reversible Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Liquid Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce a variety of azopolyesters (azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters) with remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. The length of the soft alkyl side&#8208;chain inlaid with azobenzenes and stereoregularity of main&#8208;chain of azopolymers have tremendous effects on crystallization properties of the resulting polyesters with melting temperature (Tm) in the range of 51&#8208;251 &#176;C. Moreover, some of azopolyesters possess excellently photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition performance thanks to trans&#8208;cis photoisomerization of azobenzenes. Trans&#8208;azopolyesters are yellow solids with Tms or glass transition temperatures (Tg) above room temperature, whereas cis&#8208;polymers are red liquids with Tgs below &#8208;20 &#176;C. These azopolyesters could be applied as novel light&#8208;switchable adhesives for quartz/quartz, wood/wood and quartz/wood adhesion, with the strength in the range of 0.73&#8208;0.89 MPa for trans&#8208;polymers. Conversely, the adhesion strength of liquefied cis&#8208;azopolyesters generated from the irradiation of trans&#8208;polymers by UV light was about 0.1 MPa, which shows light enable to control the adhesion process with high spatiotemporal resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Chiral Fixation and Chiral Regulation Endowed by Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of chiral superstructures through self&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral polymers usually relies on the&#160;interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonds, which is significantly limited by the memory ability of induced chirality. Although the introduction of covalent crosslinking can undoubtedly enhance the stability of chiral superstructures, the concurrent strong constraining effect hinders the application of chirality&#8208;smart materials. To address this issue, we have made the first attempt at the reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers.&#160;After chiral induction, the reversible [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of cinnamate group in polymer chains can be further controlled by light to manipulate inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and decrosslinking.&#160;Based on this&#160;photo&#8208;programmable and dynamic chiral fixation strategy,&#160;a novel pattern&#8208;embedded storage mechanism of&#160;chiral polymeric materials was established for the first time</dc:description>

To address this issue, we have made the first attempt at the reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self-assembly of side-chain polymers.&#160;After chiral induction, the reversible [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of cinnamate group in polymer chains can be further controlled by light to manipulate inter-chain crosslinking and decrosslinking.&#160;Based on this&#160;photo-programmable and dynamic chiral fixation strategy,&#160;a novel pattern-embedded storage mechanism of&#160;chiral polymeric materials was established for the first time&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA Nanostructures: Self&#8208;adjuvant carriers for Highly Efficient Subunit Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subunit vaccines based on antigen proteins or epitopes of pathogens or tumors show advantages in immunological precision and high safety, but are often limited by their low immunogenicity. Adjuvants can boost immune responses by stimulating immune cells or promoting antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs), yet existing clinical adjuvants struggle in simultaneously achieving these dual functions. Additionally, the spatial organization of antigens might be crucial to their immunogenicity. Hence, superior adjuvants should potently stimulate the immune system, precisely arrange antigens, and effectively deliver antigens to APCs. Recently, precisely organizing and delivering antigens with the unique editability of DNA nanostructures have been proposed, presenting unique abilities in significantly improved the immunogenicity of antigens. In this minireview, we will discuss the principles behind using DNA nanostructures as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers and review the latest advancements in this field. The potential and challenges associated with self&#8208;adjuvant DNA nanostructures would also be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Stereocontrolled Degradable Polymer by Living Cascade Enyne Metathesis

Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereocontrolled degradable polymer was synthesized via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. Highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers were prepared using the Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkoxyallenes and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The resulting chiral polymer exhibited a narrow dispersity window. Block copolymers were prepared not only by sequentially adding nondegradable and degradable monomers but also by using enantiomerically different monomers to produce stereocontrolled blocks. Owing to the hydrolyzable N,O&#8208;acetal moiety in the backbone structure, the resulting polymer could degrade under acidic conditions generated using various acid concentrations to control the degradation. Additionally, the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction modified the polymer without losing the stereochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane and Propane over Copper&#8208;Containing Mordenite: Insights into Reaction Mechanism and Product Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite is capable of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to ethylene and propylene, respectively. The process requires lower temperature as compared to methane hydroxylation, which is associated with a different reaction mechanism. Produced olefins form highly stable complexes with copper(I) sites, realizing a product protection strategy and enabling high selectivity.







Abstract
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite (CuMOR) is capable of activation of C&#8722;H bonds in C1&#8208;C3 alkanes, albeit there are remarkable differences between the functionalization of ethane and propane compared to methane. The reaction of ethane and propane with CuMOR results in the formation of ethylene and propylene, while the reaction of methane predominantly yields methanol and dimethyl ether. By combining in situ FTIR and MAS NMR spectroscopies as well as time&#8208;resolved Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the reaction mechanism was derived, which differs significantly for each alkane. The formation of ethylene and propylene proceeds via oxidative dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes with selectivity above 95&#8201;% for ethane and above 85&#8201;% for propane. The formation of stable &#960;&#8208;complexes of olefins with CuI sites, formed upon reduction of CuII&#8208;oxo species, protects olefins from further oxidation and/or oligomerization. This is different from methane, the activation of which proceeds via oxidative hydroxylation leading to the formation of surface methoxy species bonded to the zeolite framework. Our findings constitute one of the major steps in the direct conversion of alkanes to important commodities and open a novel research direction aiming at the selective synthesis of olefins.

         <title>Synthesis and Prospects of Holey Two&#8208;dimensional Platinum&#8208;group Metals in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recently explored porous and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) with few&#8208;atomic thicknesses via various synthetic techniques. It also highlights their unique structural benefits, particularly for manipulating the intrinsic electronic structure in high&#8208;performance electrochemical water splitting, CO2 reduction, and fuel cell applications.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts can enable the widespread implementation of clean energy technologies. This paper reviews an emerging class of electrocatalytic materials comprising holey two&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;group metal (h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGM) nanosheets, which are categorically challenging to synthesize but inherently rich in all the qualities necessary to counter the kinetic and thermodynamic challenges of an electrochemical conversion process with high catalytic efficiency and stability. Although the 2D anisotropic growth of typical nonlayered metal crystals has succeeded and partly improved their atom&#8208;utilization efficiency, regularly distributed in&#8208;planar porosity can further optimize three critical factors that govern efficient electrocatalysis process: mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reactivity. However, producing such advanced morphological features within h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGMs is difficult unless they are specially engineered using approaches such as templating or kinetic ramification during 2D growth or controlled etching of preformed 2D&#8208;PGM solids. Therefore, this review highlighting the successful fabrication of various porous PGM nanosheets and their electrocatalytic benefits involving smart nanoscale features could inspire next&#8208;generation scientific and technological innovations toward securing a sustainable energy future.

Two dimeric acceptors, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S were synthesized by linking two Y6&#8208;derivative segments using different central linking bridges: selenophene and thiophene. Both adopt a favorable O&#8208;shape conformation as confirmed by simulations and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Paired with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer donor PM6, optimized solar cells employing DIBP3F&#8208;Se showcase remarkable performance with a power conversion efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%, as demonstrated by Donghong Yu, Thomas&#8197;D.

         <title>Construction of Negative Electrostatic Pore Environments in a Scalable, Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8208;organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;303) are generated. The material gives benchmark one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary mixtures, combining the unique and overall advantages of excellent separation performance, stability, low cost, green and easily scalable bulk synthesis.







Abstract
One&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (MOF&#8208;303) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation. This material exhibits not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes, but also top&#8208;tier C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities at ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that multiple N/O sites on pore channels can build a negative electro&#8208;environment to provide stronger interactions with C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for ternary mixtures, affording one of the highest C2H4 productivity of 1.35&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. This material is highly stable and can be easily synthesized at kilogram&#8208;scale from cheap raw materials using a water&#8208;based green synthesis. The benchmark combination of excellent separation properties with high stability and low cost in scalable MOF&#8208;303 has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.

&lt;p&gt;Negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low-cost metal-organic framework (MOF-303) are generated. The material gives benchmark one-step separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from ternary mixtures, combining the unique and overall advantages of excellent separation performance, stability, low cost, green and easily scalable bulk synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-step separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from ternary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low-cost, and easily scaled-up aluminum MOF (MOF-303) for efficient one-step C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation. This material exhibits not only record high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes, but also top-tier C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivities at ambient conditions.

         <title>Shape Control of Carbon Nanoparticles via a Simple Anion&#8208;Directed Strategy for Precise Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;directed strategy was developed to control the shapes of carbon nanoparticles (CNs) from spheres to rods with various aspect ratios (ARs). This shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions induced self&#8208;assembly followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods.







Abstract
Herein, small&#8208;sized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNs) with tunable shapes ranging from spheres to various rods with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.00, 1.51, 1.89, and 2.85 are prepared using a simple anion&#8208;directed strategy for the first time. Based on comprehensive morphological and structural characteristics of CNs, along with theoretical calculations of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, their shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson's correlation coefficient up to 0.90. This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle&#8208;targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.

         <title>Cover Picture: Deciphering the Role of the Ser&#8208;Phosphorylation Pattern on the DNA&#8208;Binding Activity of Max Transcription Factor Using Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of synthetic full&#8208;length Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared to investigate the impact of Ser phosphorylation, as reported by Ariel Afek, Muhammad Jbara et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310913). Comprehensive DNA binding analysis and high&#8208;throughput screening revealed that the phosphorylation pattern plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but does not affect sequence specificity. The insights gained into the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation shed light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation to Formate over Edge&#8208;Sulfur Vacancies of Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 hydrogenation to formate is an attractive route for the utilization of this greenhouse gas. In their Research Article (e202307086), Dehui Deng, Liang Yu, and co&#8208;workers report edge&#8208;rich molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as a low&#8208;cost catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate with superior activity, selectivity, and high stability. Comprehensive mechanism studies reveal that selective production of formate is enabled at MoS2 edge sulfur vacancies via a new water&#8208;mediated hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>An Unlocked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Zn&#8208;MOF on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst based on a tubular photosensitive carbon nitride (CN) and a conductive zinc&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)) catalytic unit is fabricated for H2O2 photosynthesis. The annealing&#8208;induced shrinkage of the Zn&#8208;O4 moiety in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) unlocks its capability for O2 reduction to H2O2, and meanwhile, the strong interaction between these two components facilitates the photoelectron injection from CN to the activated Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalytic sites for O2 reduction to H2O2, while ensuring the fast injection of energetic electrons into these sites, is crucial for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis but remains challenging. Herein, we report a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two&#8208;dimensional conductive Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in &#176;C), in which the catalytic capability of Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing&#8208;induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn&#8208;O4) in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron&#8208;rich state due to the annealing&#8208;induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key *OOH intermediate of 2e&#8722; O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) catalytic unit. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 production activity and excellent stability under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient property and electron&#8208;rich property of monomers based on three covalent organic frameworks. And, the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1 exhibited excellent activities for CO2 photoreduction, higher than VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the electron&#8208;deficient unit, electron&#8208;rich unit, and efficient charge transfer channel.







Abstract
The high local electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO2 photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure&#8208;functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient (ED) and electron&#8208;rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational&#8208;designed vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion (283.41&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high selectivity of 97.1&#8201;%, much higher than the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;electronic metal clusters (Cu3(PyCA)3) (PyCA=pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo&#8208;induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron&#8208;density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters&#8208;based COFs to effective CO2 conversion.

         <title>Photocatalytic Terminal C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction Inside Water Soluble Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for light&#8208;activated Glaser coupling in water is reported that uses visible light to trigger host&#8208;guest photoredox chemistry. Cage&#8208;confined neutral radicals drive the C&#8722;C coupling step through substrate preorganization.







Abstract
Developing methods that activate C&#8722;H bonds directly with high selectivity for C&#8722;C bond formation in complex organic synthesis has been a major chemistry challenge. Recently it has been shown that photoactivation of weakly polarized C&#8722;H bonds can be carried out inside a cationic water&#8208;soluble nanocage with visible light&#8208;mediated host&#8208;guest charge transfer (CT) chemistry. Using this novel photoredox activation paradigm, here we demonstrate C&#8722;C bond formation to photo&#8208;generate 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature in water from terminal aromatic alkynes for the first time. The formation of cavity&#8208;confined alkyne radical cation and the proton&#8208;removed neutral radical species highlight the unique C&#8722;C coupling step driven by supramolecular preorganization.

         <title>Cover Picture: Photoluminescence of Mn2+ in the Borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4]:Mn2+ &#8208; A Tool to Detect Weak Coordination Behavior of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#160;is a so&#8208;far still rather underestimated visible emitter that is more abundant than the currently dominantly used emitter Eu2+. This could be a possible alternative for future LED phosphors. The cover picture shows octahedrally coordinated Mn2+&#160;ions embedded in the borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4]. Borosulfates are weakly coordinating ligands, which is directly reflected in the photoluminescence properties of the Mn2+ ions: They show orange narrow emission, which is indicative for a weak octahedral ligand field, as explained by J&#246;rn Bruns, Markus Suta et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309212).

         <title>Inside Cover: Design of Hollow Nanoreactors for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Selective Catalytic Semihydrogenation Driven by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow nanoreactors with a hollow multishelled structure and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles are reported by Jian Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307096). The hollow nanoreactors exhibit size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties for small aliphatic and large aromatic substrates in catalytic semihydrogenation reactions. Calculations provide insights into the nanoreactors with distinct behaviors due to the differences in the energy barrier of substrate adsorption and steric hindrance.

         <title>A Coformer Approach for Supramolecular Polymerization at High Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insolubility of functional molecules caused by polymorphism sometimes poses limitations for their solution&#8208;based processing. Such a situation can also occur in the preparation processes of supramolecular polymers formed in a solution. An effective strategy to address this issue is to prepare amorphous solid states by introducing a &#8220;coformer&#8221; molecule capable of inhibiting the formation of an insoluble polymorph through co&#8208;aggregation. Herein, inspired by the coformer approach, we demonstrated a solubility enhancement of a barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound that can supramolecularly polymerize through six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosettes. Our newly synthesized supramolecular coformer molecule features a sterically demanding methyl group in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated unit of the parent molecule. Although the parent molecule exhibits low solubility in nonpolar solvents due to the formation of a crystalline polymorph comprising a tape&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded array prior to the supramolecular polymerization, mixing with the coformer compound enhanced the solubility by inhibiting mesoscopic organization of the tapes. The two monomers were then co&#8208;polymerized into desired helicoidal supramolecular polymers through the formation of heteromeric rosettes.</dc:description>

Our newly synthesized supramolecular coformer molecule features a sterically demanding methyl group in the &#960;-conjugated unit of the parent molecule. Although the parent molecule exhibits low solubility in nonpolar solvents due to the formation of a crystalline polymorph comprising a tape-like hydrogen-bonded array prior to the supramolecular polymerization, mixing with the coformer compound enhanced the solubility by inhibiting mesoscopic organization of the tapes. The two monomers were then co-polymerized into desired helicoidal supramolecular polymers through the formation of heteromeric rosettes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Biocatalysts from Specialized Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Enzymes are increasingly recognized as valuable (bio)catalysts that complement existing synthetic methods. However, the range of biotransformations used in the laboratory is limited. Here we give an overview on the biosynthesis&#8208;inspired discovery of novel biocatalysts that address various synthetic challenges. Prominent examples from this dynamic field highlight remarkable enzymes for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free amide formation and modification, control of pericyclic reactions, achieve stereoselective hetero&#8208; and polycyclizations, enable atroposelective aryl couplings, facilitate site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H activations, introduce ring strain, and promote N&#8208;N bond formations. We also explore unusual functions of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, radical SAM&#8208;dependent enzymes, flavoproteins, and enzymes recruited from primary metabolism, which offer opportunities for synthetic biology, enzyme engineering, directed evolution, and catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Conception and evaluation of a library of cleavable mass tags for digital polymers sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of phosphoramidite macromonomers containing a main&#8208;chain cleavable alkoxyamine and a side&#8208;chain substituent of variable molar mass (i.e. mass tag) was prepared in this work. These monomers can be used in automated solid&#8208;phase phosphoramidite chemistry and therefore incorporated periodically inside digitally&#8208;encoded poly(phosphodiester) chains. Consequently, the formed polymers contain tagged cleavable sites that guide their fragmentation in mass spectrometry sequencing and enhance their digital readability. The macromonomers were all prepared via a seven steps synthetic procedure. They were afterwards tested for the synthesis and sequencing of model digital polymers. Uniform digitally&#8208;encoded polymers were obtained as major species in all cases, even though some minor defects were sometimes detected. Furthermore, the polymers were decoded in pseudo&#8208;MS3 conditions, thus confirming the reliability and versatility of the macromonomers library.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylenes endowed with low densities of in&#8208;chain hydrolyzable and photocleavable groups can improve their circularity and potentially reduce their environmental persistency. We show with model polymers derived from acyclic diene metathesis polymerization that the simultaneous presence of both groups has no adverse effect on the polyethylene crystal structure and thermal properties. Post&#8208;polymerization Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of keto&#8208;polyethylenes from non&#8208;alternating catalytic ethylene&#8208;CO chain growth copolymerization yield high molecular weight in&#8208;chain keto&#8208;ester polyethylenes (Mn ~50.000 g mol&#8208;1). Oxidation can proceed without chain scission and consequently the desirable materials properties of HDPE are retained. At the same time we demonstrate the suitability of the in&#8208;chain ester groups for chemical recycling by methanolysis, and show that photolytic degradation by extended exposure to simulated sunlight occurs via the keto groups.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We disclose &#960;&#8208;expanded pyracylenes and their cationic species comprising 7&#8208;membered rings. The compounds were synthesized by stepwise oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to monitor the effect of successive cyclization on the structural and optoelectronic properties. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallography the complete cyclization leads to a boat&#8208;shaped scaffold featuring negative curvature provided by the 7&#8208;membered ring. The embedded tropone unit enabled the convenient generation of a stabilized tropylium cation, showing bathochromically shifted absorption bands reaching into the near&#8208;infrared region beyond 1000 nm. The altered structural features supported by theoretical calculations point towards aromatic character of the positively charged 7&#8208;membered ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclization in Eunicellane Derived Diterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpene cyclization, one of the most complex chemical reactions in nature, is generally catalyzed by two classes of terpene cyclases (TCs). Cytochrome P450s that act as unexpected TC&#8208;like enzymes are known but are very rare. Here, we genome&#8208;mined a cryptic bacterial terpenoid gene cluster, named ari, from the thermophilic actinomycete strain Amycolatopsis arida. By employing a heterologous production system, we isolated and characterized three highly oxidized eunicellane derived diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8211;C (1&#8211;3), that possess a&#160;6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold. In vivo and in vitro experiments systematically established a non&#8208;canonical two&#8208;step biosynthetic pathway for diterpene skeleton formation. First, a class I TC (AriE) cyclizes geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into a 6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic cis&#8208;eunicellane skeleton. Next, a cytochrome P450 (AriF) catalyzes cyclization of the eunicellane skeleton into the 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold via C2&#8208;C6 bond formation. Based on the results of quantum chemical computations, hydrogen abstraction followed by electron transfer coupled to barrierless carbocation ring&#8208;closure is shown to be a viable mechanism for AriF&#8208;mediated cyclization. The biosynthetic logic of skeleton construction in the aridacins is unprecedented, expanding the catalytic capacity and diversity of P450s and setting the stage to investigate the inherent principles of carbocation generation by P450s in the biosynthesis of terpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Free Radical&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as crucial players in catalysis research, prompting extensive investigation and application. The precise control of metal atom nucleation and growth has garnered significant attention. In this study, we present a straightforward approach for preparing SACs utilizing a photocatalytic radical control strategy. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that radicals generated during the photochemical process effectively hinder the aggregation of individual atoms. By leveraging the cooperative anchoring of nitrogen atoms and crystal lattice oxygen on the support, we successfully stabilize the single atom. Our Pd1/TiO2 catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which was 43 times higher than Pd/C. Furthermore, we successfully depose Pd atoms onto various substrates, including TiO2, CeO2, and WO3. The photocatalytic radical control strategy can be extended to other single&#8208;atom catalysts, such as Ir, Pt, Rh, and Ru, underscoring its broad applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Depolymerization of Waste Polyesters Enabled by Transesterification/Hydrogenation Relay Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient depolymerization of polyesters under mild conditions remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a highly efficient strategy for the degradation of a diverse array of waste polyesters as low to 80 &#176;C, 1 bar H2. The key to the success of&#160;this transformation relied on the initial transesterification of macromolecular polyester&#160;into more degradable oligomeric fragments in the presence of CH3OH and the subsequent hydrogenation by the use of the rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based Ru complex. Controlled experiments and preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the quinaldine&#8208;based catalysts could be hydrogenated to the eventually active species, which has been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and directly used as a catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of polyester. The strong viability and high activity of this new species in protic solvent were explained in detail.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The efficient depolymerization of polyesters under mild conditions remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a highly efficient strategy for the degradation of a diverse array of waste polyesters as low to 80 &#176;C, 1 bar H2. The key to the success of&#160;this transformation relied on the initial transesterification of macromolecular polyester&#160;into more degradable oligomeric fragments in the presence of CH3OH and the subsequent hydrogenation by the use of the rationally designed quinaldine-based Ru complex. Controlled experiments and preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the quinaldine-based catalysts could be hydrogenated to the eventually active species, which has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis and directly used as a catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of polyester. The strong viability and high activity of this new species in protic solvent were explained in detail. Besides, the crucial role of CH3OH in promoting reaction efficiency during the whole process was also elucidated. The synthetic utility of this method was further illustrated by preparing 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electron Buffer Layer on ZnOx&#8208;Fe5C2&#8208;Fe3O4 Boosts Ethanol Synthesis from CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of CO2 into ethanol with renewable H2 has attracted tremendous attention due to its integrated functions of carbon elimination and chemical synthesis, but still being challenging. The electronic property of catalyst is essential to determine the adsorption strength and configuration of the key intermediates, therefore altering the reaction network for targeted synthesis. Here, a carbon buffer layer is employed to tailor the electronic property of the ternary ZnOx&#8208;Fe5C2&#8208;Fe3O4, in which the electron transfer pathway (ZnOx &#8594; Fe species or carbon layer) ensures the appropriate adsorption strength of &#8208;CO* on catalytic interface, facilitating the C&#8208;C coupling between &#8208;CHx* and &#8208;CO* for ethanol synthesis. Benefiting from this unique electron transfer buffering effect, extremely high ethanol yield of 366.6 gEtOH kgcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (with CO of 10 vol% co&#8208;feeding) is achieved from CO2 hydrogenation. This work provides a powerful electronic modulation strategy for catalyst design in terms of highly oriented synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylenes: Facile Synthesis via Radical&#8208;Mediated Coupling Reactions and their Distinctive Electronic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a one&#8208;dimensional (1D), ribbon&#8208;like structure have the potential to serve as both model compounds for corresponding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and as materials for optoelectronics applications. However, synthesizing molecules of this type with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation presents a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthetic method for a series of bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules, wherein the peri&#8208;positions of perylene, quaterrylene, and hexarylene are fused with naphtho&#8208;units. These molecules were efficiently synthesized primarily through intramolecular or intermolecular radical coupling of in situ generated organic radical species. Their structures were confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which also revealed a slightly bent geometry due to the incorporation of a cyclopentadiene ring at the bay regions of the rylene backbones. Bond lengh analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that their electronic structures resemble pyrenacenes more than quinoidal rylenes. That is, the aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the long axis of the skeletones. As the chain length increases, these molecules exhibit enhanced electronic absorption with a bathochromic shift, and multiple amphoteric redox waves. This study introduces a novel synthetic approach for generating 1D extended PAHs and GNRs, along with their structure&#8208;dependent electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Cascade Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Production with Biomass Photoreforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass photoreforming is a promising method to provide both a clean energy resource in the form of hydrogen (H2) and valuable chemicals as the results of water reduction and biomass oxidation. To overcome the poor contact between heterogeneous photocatalysts and biomass substrates, we fabricated a new photoredox cascade catalyst by combining a homogeneous catalyst, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;dye sensitized photocatalyst (DDSP) composed of two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridine photosensitizers (RuP6 and RuCP6) and Pt&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanoparticles. During blue&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; = 460 &#177; 15 nm; 80 mW), the DDSP photocatalytically reduced aqueous protons to form H2 and simultaneously oxidized TEMPO&#183; radicals to generate catalytically active TEMPO+. It oxidized biomass substrates (water&#8208;soluble glycerol and insoluble cellulose) to regenerate TEMPO&#183;. In the presence of N&#8208;methyl imidazole as a proton transfer mediator, the photocatalytic H2 production activities for glycerol and cellulose reforming reached 2670 and 1590 &#181;mol H2 (gTiO2)&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively, which were comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding   the Role of Fluorine Groups  in Passivating Defects  for Perovskite Solar Cells &#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing fluorine (F) groups into a passivator plays an important role in enhancing the defect passivation effect for the perovskite film, which is usually attributed to the direct interaction of F and defect states. However, the interaction between electronegative F and electron&#8208;rich passivation groups in the same molecule, which may influence the passivation effect, is ignored. We herein report that such interactions can vary the electron cloud distribution around the passivation groups and thus changing their coordination with defect sites. By comparing two fluorinated molecules, heptafluorobutylamine (HFBM) and heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), we find that the F/&#8211;NH2 interaction in HFBM is stronger than the F/&#8211;COOH one in HFBA, inducing weaker passivation ability of HFBM than HFBA. Accordingly, HFBA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) provide an efficiency of 24.70% with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the efficiency of a large&#8208;area perovskite module (14.0 cm2) based on HFBA reaches 21.13%. Our work offers an insight into understanding an unaware role of the F group in impacting the passivation effect for the perovskite film.

         <title>Building Block&#8208;inspired Hybrid Perovskite Derivatives for Ferroelectric Channel Layers with Gate&#8208;Tunable Memory Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric photovoltaics driven by spontaneous polarization (Ps) holds a promise for creating the next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, spintronics and non&#8208;volatile memories. However, photoactive ferroelectrics are quite scarce in single homogeneous phase, owing to the severe Ps fatigue caused by leakage current of photoexcited carriers. Here, through combining inorganic and organic components as building blocks, we constructed a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites, (HA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (n = 1&#8208;5; HA = hexylamine and MA = methylamine). It is intriguing that their Curie temperatures are greatly enhanced by reducing the thickness of inorganic frameworks from MAPbBr3 (n = &#8734;, Tc = 239 K) to n = 2 (Tc = 310 K, &#916;T = 71 K). Especially, on account of the coupling of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity (Ps~1.5 &#956;C/cm2) and photoconductivity, n=3 crystal wafer was integrated as channel field effect transistor that shows excellent a large short&#8208;circuit photocurrent ~19.74 &#956;A/cm2. Such giant photocurrents can be modulated through manipulating gate voltage in a wide range (&#177; 60V), exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors of three current states (&#8220;&#8208;1/0/1&#8221; states). We believe that this work sheds light on further exploration of ferroelectric materials toward new non&#8208;volatile memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly from Crystals to Helices of Protic Acyclic Carbene AuI&#8208;Enantiomers with Chirality Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing chiral supramolecular assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are of great significance in promoting the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, we report a solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from single&#8208;crystals to helical nanofibers based on the first protic acyclic (methoxy)(amino)carbenes (pAMACs) AuI&#8208;enantiomers driven by a synergetic aurophilic interactions and H&#8208;bonds.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Constructing chiral supramolecular assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are of great significance in promoting the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)-active materials. Herein, we report a solvation-mediated self-assembly from single-crystals to helical nanofibers based on the first protic acyclic (methoxy)(amino)carbenes (pAMACs) AuI-enantiomers driven by a synergetic aurophilic interactions and H-bonds. Their aggregation-dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties with high quantum yields (&#934;FL) up to 95% were proved to be attributed to packing modes of Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au dimers with &#960;-stacking or one-dimensional extended Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au chains. Via drop-casting method, supramolecular P- or M-helices were prepared. Detailed studies on the helices demonstrate that formations of extended helical Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au molecular chains amplify supramolecular chirality, leading to strong CPL with high dissymmetry factor (|glum| = 0.030, &#934;FL = 67%) and high CPL brightness (BCPL) of 4.87&#215;10-3.

         <title>Supramolecular Barrel&#8208;Rosette Ion Channel Based on 3,5&#8208;Diaminobenzoic Acid for Cation&#8208;Anion Symport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural tropology and functions of natural cation&#8208;anion symporting channels have been continuously investigated due to their crucial role in regulating various physiological functions. To understand the physiological functions of the natural symporter channels, it is vital to develop small molecule&#8208;based biomimicking systems that can provide mechanistic insights into the ion&#8208;binding sites and the ion&#8208;translocation pathways. Herein, we report a series of bis((R)&#8208;(&#8210;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled ion channels with distinctive ion transport ability. Ion transport experiment across the lipid bilayer membrane revealed that compound 1b exhibits the highest transport activity among the series, and it has interesting selective co&#8208;transporting functions, i.e., facilitates K+/ClO4&#8210; symport. Electrophysiology experiments confirmed the formation of supramolecular ion channels with an average diameter of 6.2 &#177; 1 &#197; and single channel conductance of 57.3 &#177; 1.9 pS. Selectivity studies of channel 1b in BLM demonstrated the permeability ratio of PCl&#8210;/PK+ = 0.053 &#177;0.02, PClO4&#8210;/PCl&#8210; = 2.1 &#177; 0.5, and PK+/PNa+ = 1.5 &#177; 1, respectively, indicating the higher selectivity of the channel towards KClO4 over KCl salt. A hexameric assembly of a trimeric rosette of 1b was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations with different salts to understand the supramolecular channel formation and ion selectivity pattern.</dc:description>

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Enhanced Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Polymer Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers have important applications for biological imaging, oxygen sensing, data encryption, and photodynamic therapy. Despite the many advantages polymeric materials offer such as great control over gas permeability and processing flexibility, disorder is traditionally considered as an intrinsic negative impact on the efficiency for embedded RTP luminophores, as various allowed thermal motions could quench the emitting states. However, we propose that such disorder&#8208;enabled freedoms of microscopic motions can be beneficial for charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated RTP, which is facilitated by molecular conformational changes among different electronic transition states. Using the &#8220;classic&#8221; pyrene&#8208;aniline excimer as an example, we demonstrate the mutual enhancement of red/near&#8208;infrared and green RTP emissions from the pyrene and aniline moieties, respectively, upon doping of the aniline polymer with trace pyrene derivatives. In comparison, a pyrene&#8208;doped crystal formed with the same aniline structure exhibits only charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence with no red or green RTP observed, suggesting that order suppresses the RTP channels. The proposed polymerization strategy may be used as a unified method to generate multi&#8208;emissive polymeric RTP materials from a vast pool of known and unknown exciplexes and charge&#8208;transfer complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming of Furfurylidenes by Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Catalysts. Preparation and Functionalization of Optically Active 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (Trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes represent bioisostereres of tert&#8208;butyl groups of improved metabolic stability; they are on high demand in medicinal chemistry but difficult to make in optically active form. A new approach, which engages a bench&#8208;stable carbene source in asymmetric cyclopropanation catalyzed by a [BiRh] paddlewheel complex, opens ready access to compounds of this type.







Abstract
Although 2&#8208;furyl&#8208;carbenes (furfurylidenes) are prone to instantaneous electrocyclic ring opening, chiral [BiRh]&#8208;paddlewheel complexes empowered by London dispersion allow (trifluoromethyl)furfurylidene metal complexes to be generated from a bench&#8208;stable triftosylhydrazone precursor. These reactive intermediates engage in asymmetric [2+1] cycloadditions and hence open entry into valuable trifluoromethylated cyclopropane or &#8208;cyclopropene derivatives in optically active form, which are important building blocks for medicinal chemistry but difficult to make otherwise.

         <title>Ferric Single&#8208;Site Catalyst Confined in a Zeolite Framework for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site catalyst comprised of ferric iron confined in an MFI&#8208;type zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal method involving rapid mixing at high temperature. The isolated Fe species in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane. The catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and resistant to coking.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a highly efficient approach for industrial preparation of propene that is commonly catalyzed by noble Pt or toxic Cr catalysts and suffers from coking. In this work, ferric catalyst confined in a zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal procedure. The isolated Fe in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane and reached over 95&#8201;% propene selectivity and over 99&#8201;% total olefins selectivity. This catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and coke free, with a deactivation constant of 0.01&#8197;h&#8722;1. This study provided guidance for the synthesis of structural heteroatomic zeolite and efficient propane non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation over early transition metals.

         <title>A Deeper Understanding of Metal Nucleation and Growth in Rechargeable Metal Batteries Through Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium and sodium metal batteries continue to occupy the forefront of battery research. Their exceptionally high energy density and nominal voltages are highly attractive for cutting&#8208;edge energy storage applications. Anode&#8208;free metal batteries are also coming into the research spotlight offering improved safety and even higher energy densities than conventional metal batteries. However, uneven metal nucleation and growth which leads to dendrites continues to limit the commercialisation of conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries alike. This review connects models and theories from well&#8208;established fields in metallurgy and electrodeposition to both conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries. These highly applicable models and theories explain the driving forces of uneven metal growth and can inform future experiment design. Finally, the models and theories that are most relevant to each anode&#8208;related cell component are identified. Keeping these specific models and theories in mind will assist with rational design for these components.</dc:description>

We investigated the excited&#8208;state behavior of two Ni(II) complexes, which are isostructural with two luminescent Pt(II) complexes. The initially excited singlet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) excited states in the Ni(II) complexes decay to metal&#8208;centered (3MC) excited states within less than 1 picosecond, followed by non&#8208;radiative relaxation of the 3MC states to the electronic ground state within 9 &#8208; 21 ps. This contrasts with the population of an emissive triplet ligand&#8208;centered (3LC) excited state upon excitation of the Pt(II) analogues. Structural distortions of the Ni(II) complexes are responsible for this discrepant behavior and lead to dark 3MC states far lower in energy than the luminescent 3LC states of Pt(II) compounds. Our findings suggest that if these structural distortions could be restricted by more rigid coordination environments and stronger ligand fields, the excited&#8208;state relaxation in four&#8208;coordinate Ni(II) complexes could be decelerated such that luminescent 3LC or 3MLCT excited states become accessible. These insights are relevant to make Ni(II) fit for photophysical and photochemical applications that relied on Pt(II) until now.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Modifications Produce Two&#8208;Step Magnetic Switching in a Cobalt(dioxolene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mononuclear monodioxolene valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complexes typically exist in their low spin (l.s.) CoIII(cat2&#8210;) and high spin (h.s.) CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;) forms (cat2&#8210; = catecholato, and sq&#8226;&#8210; = seminquinonato forms of 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tBu&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolene), which reversibly interconvert via temperature&#8208;dependent intramolecular electron transfer. Typically, the remaining four coordination sites on cobalt are supported by a tetradentate ligand whose properties influence the temperature at which VT occurs. We report that replacing one chelating pyridyl arm of tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (tpa) with a weaker field ortho&#8208;anisole moiety facilitates access to a third magnetic state, and examine a series of related complexes. Variable temperature crystallographic, magnetic, calorimetric, and spectroscopic studies support that this third state is consistent with l.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;). Thus, our ligand modifications not only provide access to the VT transition from l.s. CoIII(cat2&#8210;) to l.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;), but at higher temperatures, the complex undergoes spin crossover from l.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;) to h.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;), representing the first example of two&#8208;step magnetic switching in a mononuclear monodioxolene cobalt complex. We hypothesize that ligand dynamicity may facilitate access to the rarely observed l.s. CoII(sq&#8226;&#8210;) intermediate state, suggesting a new design criterion in the development of stimulus&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;state molecular switches.</dc:description>

         <title>Gallium Sulfide Quantum Dots with Zinc Sulfide and Alumina Shells Showing Efficient Deep Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed quantum dot (QD) based blue emitters are of paramount importance in the field of optoelectronics. Despite large research efforts, examples of efficient deep blue/near UV&#8208;emitting QDs remain rare due to lack of luminescent wide bandgap materials and high defect densities in the existing ones. Here, we introduce a novel type of QDs based on heavy metal free gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) nanocrystals and their core/shell heterostructures Ga2S3/ZnS as well as Ga2S3&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Al2O3. The PL properties of core Ga2S3 QDs exhibit various decay pathways due to intrinsic defects, resulting in a broad overall PL spectrum. We show that the overgrowth of the Ga2S3 core QDs with a ZnS shell results in the suppression of the intrinsic defect mediated states leading to efficient narrow deep blue emission at 400 nm. Passivation of the core/shell structure with amorphous alumina yields a further enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield approaching 50% and leads to an excellent optical and colloidal stability. Finally, we develop a strategy for the aqueous phase transfer of the obtained QDs retainining 80% of the initial fluorescence intensity.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Detection of Large&#8208;Scale Reorientations of Transmembrane Helices During Influenza A M2 Channel Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid&#8208;supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH&#8208;activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large&#8208;scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;&#8208;helices in situ during pH&#8208;activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#8208;informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large&#8208;scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic C&#8208;H Functionalization of Simple Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds offers vast potential for chemical synthesis and therefore receives intense attention. At present, most successes come from strategies using metal catalysts/reagents or photo/electrochemical processes. The use of organocatalysis for this purpose remains very limited or even unexplored especially when dealing with challenging C&#8208;H bonds such as those from simple alkanes. Here we disclose the first organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of completely unfunctionalized alkanes. Our approach involves N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst&#8208;mediated carbonyl radical intermediate generation and coupling with simple alkanes (through the corresponding alkyl radical intermediates generated via a hydrogen atom transfer process). Unreactive C&#8208;H bonds are widely present in fossil fuel feedstocks, commercially important organic polymers, and complex molecules such as natural products. Our present study shall inspire a new avenue for quick functionalization of these molecules under the light&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapidly Synthesized Single&#8208;Ion Conductive Hydrogel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;ion conductive electrolytes can largely eliminate electrode polarization, reduce the proportion of anion migration and inhibit side reactions in batteries. However, they usually suffer from insufficient ion conductivity due to the strong interaction between cations and cationic receptors. Here we report an ultrafast light&#8208;responsive covalent organic frameworks (COF) with sulfonic acid groups modification as the acrylamide polymerization initiator. Benefiting from the reduced electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and sulfonic acid groups through solvation effects, the as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte (TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel) receives an ion conductivity of up to 27.2 mS/cm and Zn2+ transference number of up to 0.89. In addition, sufficient hydrogen bonds endow the single&#8208;ion conductive TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to have good water retention and superb mechanical properties. The assembled Zn||TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel||MnO2 full zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits high discharge capacity (248 mAh/g at 1 C), excellent rate capability (90 mAh/g at 10 C) and superior cycling performance.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-ion conductive electrolytes can largely eliminate electrode polarization, reduce the proportion of anion migration and inhibit side reactions in batteries. However, they usually suffer from insufficient ion conductivity due to the strong interaction between cations and cationic receptors. Here we report an ultrafast light-responsive covalent organic frameworks (COF) with sulfonic acid groups modification as the acrylamide polymerization initiator. Benefiting from the reduced electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and sulfonic acid groups through solvation effects, the as-prepared COF-based hydrogel electrolyte (TCOF-S-Gel) receives an ion conductivity of up to 27.2 mS/cm and Zn2+ transference number of up to 0.89. In addition, sufficient hydrogen bonds endow the single-ion conductive TCOF-S-Gel electrolyte to have good water retention and superb mechanical properties. The assembled Zn||TCOF-S-Gel||MnO2 full zinc-ion battery exhibits high discharge capacity (248 mAh/g at 1 C), excellent rate capability (90 mAh/g at 10 C) and superior cycling performance. These enviable results enlist the instantaneously photocured TCOF-S-Gel electrolyte to be qualified to large-scaled flexible high-performance quasi-solid-state zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Pyridine Oximes using in Situ Generated NH2OH from NO species on Nanofiber Membranes Derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine oximes producing from aldehyde or ketone with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) have been widely applied in pharmaceutics, enzymatic and sterilization. However, the important raw material NH2OH, exhibits corrosive and unstable properties, leading to substantial energy consumption during storage and transportation. Herein, this work presents a novel method for directly synthesizing highly valuable pyridine oximes using in situ generated NH2OH from electrocatalytic NO reduction with well&#8208;design nanofiber membranes (Al&#8208;NFM) derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al). Particularly, 2&#8208;pyridinealdoxime, the precursor of antidote pralidoxime (2&#8208;PAM) for nerve agents suffering from scarcity and high cost, was achieved with a Faraday efficiency up to 49.8 % and a yield of 92.1%, attributing to the high selectivity of NH2OH production on Al&#8208;NFM, further easily reacted with iodomethane to produce 2&#8208;PAM. This study proposes a creative approach, having wide universality for synthesizing pyridine and other oximes with a range of functional groups, which not only facilitates the conversion of exhaust gas (NO) and waste water (NO2&#8208;) into valuable chemicals especially NH2OH production and in&#8208;situ utilization through electrochemistry, but also holds significant potential for synthesis of neuro detoxifying drugs to humanity security.</dc:description>

Herein, this work presents a novel method for directly synthesizing highly valuable pyridine oximes using in situ generated NH2OH from electrocatalytic NO reduction with well-design nanofiber membranes (Al-NFM) derived from NH2-MIL-53(Al). Particularly, 2-pyridinealdoxime, the precursor of antidote pralidoxime (2-PAM) for nerve agents suffering from scarcity and high cost, was achieved with a Faraday efficiency up to 49.8 % and a yield of 92.1%, attributing to the high selectivity of NH2OH production on Al-NFM, further easily reacted with iodomethane to produce 2-PAM. This study proposes a creative approach, having wide universality for synthesizing pyridine and other oximes with a range of functional groups, which not only facilitates the conversion of exhaust gas (NO) and waste water (NO2-) into valuable chemicals especially NH2OH production and in-situ utilization through electrochemistry, but also holds significant potential for synthesis of neuro detoxifying drugs to humanity security.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
