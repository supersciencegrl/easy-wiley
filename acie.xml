      <title>Scalable and recyclable all&#8208;organic colloidal cascade catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of core&#8208;shell microparticles (CSMs) with an acid catalyst in the core and a base catalyst in the shell by surfactant&#8208;free emulsion polymerization (SFEP). The organocatalytic monomers were separately copolymerized in three synthetic steps allowing the spatial separation of incompatible acid and base catalysts within the CSMs. Importantly, a protected and thermo&#8208;decomposable sulfonate monomer was used as acid source to circumvent the neutralization of the base catalyst during shell formation, which was key to obtain stable, catalytically active CSMs. The catalysts showed excellent performance in an established one&#8208;pot model cascade reaction in various solvents (also water) that involves an acid&#8208;catalyzed deacetalization followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation. The CSMs are easily recycled, modified, and their synthesis is scalable, which makes them promising candidates for organocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Next Generation of Zinc Bisguanidine Polymerization Catalysts towards Highly Crystalline, Biodegradable Polyesters</title>
      <dc:description>Polylactide and polycaprolactone are both biodegradable polymers produced from cyclic monomers through metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization. For a truly sustainable lifecycle of these polymers it is essential to replace the industrially used cytotoxic catalyst tin(II) bis(2&#8208;ethylhexanoate) [Sn(Oct)  2&#8216;  ] with non&#8208;toxic alternatives, while exhibiting the same or even better activity in the polymerization reaction. Here, we report the fastest known robust catalyst in the polymerization of lactide and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone. This zinc guanidine catalyst can polymerize non&#8208;purified technical  rac  &#8208;lactide and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone in the melt at different [M]/[I] ratios with fast rate constants, high molar masses around 150&#8202;000 g mol  &#8208;1  and high yields in a short time leading to colorless, transparent polymer. Moreover, we report that by zinc&#8208;guanidine complexes produced polylactide and polycaprolactone have favorably high crystallinities. In fact, the obtained polylactide shows a more robust degradation profile than its Sn(Oct)  2  &#8208;catalysed equivalent due to a higher degree of crystallinity, ideal for long&#8208;exposure biological applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Cross&#8208;Coupling of Racemic Alkyl Bromides with Azole C(sp2)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>The development of enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling of racemic alkyl halides directly with heteroarene C(  sp  2  )&#8211;H bonds has been impeded by the commonly necessary use of base at elevated temperature that leads to racemization.

Thus, the coupling with azole C(  sp  2  )&#8211;H bonds has been achieved in high enantioselectivity, affording a number of potentially useful &#945;&#8208;chiral alkylated azoles, such as 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles, oxazoles, and benzo[  d  ]oxazoles as well as 1,3,4&#8208;triazoles, for drug discovery. Mechanistic experiments indicated facile deprotonation of an azole C(  sp  2  )&#8211;H bond and the involvement of alkyl radical species under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Double&#8208;layered supramolecular prisms self&#8208;assembled by geometrically non&#8208;equivalent tetratopic subunits</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular cages/vesicles in biology display sophisticated structures and functions by utilizing few types of protein subunits quasi&#8208;equivalently serving on distinct geometrical locations.

      <title>The Formosalides: Structure Determination by Total Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Total synthesis allowed the question to be answered which of eight possible stereoisomeric compounds represents the cytotoxic marine macrolides of the formosalide family. The underlying blueprint was inherently modular to ensure that each conceivable isomer could be reached. This flexibility derived from the use of strictly catalyst&#8208;controlled transformations to set the stereocenters, except for the anomeric position that is under thermodynamic control; as an extra safety measure, all chiral centers were set prior to ring closure to preclude any interference of the conformation adopted by the macrolactone rings of the different diastereomers, which vary from case to case. Late stage macrocyclization by ring closing alkyne metathesis was followed by a platinum&#8208;catalyzed transannular 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydroalkoxylation/ketalization to craft the polycyclic frame. The side chain featuring a very labile unsaturation pattern was finally attached to the core via Stille coupling. In the end, it proved unnecessary to make the entire panel of isomers; rather, formation of a single target together with two model compounds allowed the constitution of the formosalides to be confirmed and their previously unknown stereostructure to be assigned with confidence.</dc:description>

      <title>Transcription Factor Based Small&#8208;Molecule Sensing with a Rapid Cell Phone Enabled Fluorescent Bead Assay</title>
      <dc:description>
The allosteric transcription factor TetR acts as a sensor and actuator in this quantum dot enabled fluorescent bead assay for the small molecule anhydrotetracycline. This rapid, antibody&#8208;free biosensor produces a visible change in fluorescent color, which can be detected by eye or with an inexpensive digital camera, based on dose&#8208;dependent analyte&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;DNA binding. The adaptable sensor uses easily accessible biomolecular components.







Abstract
Recently, allosteric transcription factors (TFs) were identified as a novel class of biorecognition elements for in vitro sensing, whereby an indicator of the differential binding affinity between a TF and its cognate DNA exhibits dose&#8208;dependent responsivity to an analyte. Described is a modular bead&#8208;based biosensor design that can be applied to such TF&#8208;DNA&#8208;analyte systems. DNA&#8208;functionalized beads enable efficient mixing and spatial separation, while TF&#8208;labeled semiconductor quantum dots serve as bright fluorescent indicators of the TF&#8208;DNA bound (on bead) and unbound states. The prototype sensor for derivatives of the antibiotic tetracycline exhibits nanomolar sensitivity with visual detection of bead fluorescence. Facile changes to the sensor enable sensor response tuning without necessitating changes to the biomolecular affinities. Assay components self&#8208;assemble, and readout by eye or digital camera is possible within 5&#8197;minutes of analyte addition, making sensor use facile, rapid, and instrument&#8208;free.

      <title>A New Class of NIR&#8208;II Gold Nanoclusters Based Protein Biolabels for In Vivo Tumor&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>

Moreover, the CD&#8208;Au NCs&#8208;labelled proteins/antibodies enable highly efficient  in vivo  tracking during blood circulation, without disturbing their biodistribution and tumor targeting ability, thus leading to a sensitive tumor&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II visualization. In addition, CD&#8208;Au NCs are stable in the harsh biological environment, and show good biocompatibility and high renal clearance efficiency.

      <title>Mediating Reaction Orthogonality in Polymer and Materials Science</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective regulation of multiple reaction pathways in complex chemical systems is crucial for modern syntheses. This Review presents strategies for activating such reactions in polymer and materials science, with an emphasis on systems activated via photochemical stimuli.







Abstract
Selective control of chemical reactions is critical for the proper regulation of processes ranging from intricate biological systems to large scale industrial manufacturing. The progression of synthetic chemistry toward the complexity seen in Nature requires increased control over many concurrent chemical reactions in a non&#8208;interfering (orthogonal) fashion. Fortunately, the practically endless pool of synthetic chemical reactions developed to date can often be combined in an orthogonal manner to provide elegant solutions to complex chemical problems. In this review, we first highlight some of the many photochemical reactions that have been applied in orthogonal reaction protocols; the highly selective nature of photochemical reactions makes them well&#8208;suited for independent activation in the presence of other reaction components. The application of these orthogonal reactions, especially photochemical reactions, for the synthesis and modification of polymers and polymeric materials is also summarized. Importantly, the use of orthogonal chemical reactions can provide additional opportunities for synthesizing advanced and functional polymeric materials compared to traditional synthetic procedures.

      <title>Fortified Coiled Coils: Enhancing Mechanical Stability with Lactam or Metal Staples</title>
      <dc:description>Coiled coils (CCs) are powerful supramolecular building blocks for biomimetic materials, increasingly used for their mechanical properties. Here, we introduce helix&#8208;inducing macrocyclic constraints, so&#8208;called staples, to tune thermodynamic and mechanical stability of CCs. We show that thermodynamic stabilization of CCs against helix uncoiling primarily depends on the number of staples, whereas staple positioning controls CC mechanical stability. Inserting a covalent lactam staple at one key force application point significantly increases the barrier to force&#8208;induced CC dissociation and reduces structural deformity. A reversible His&#8208;Ni  2+  &#8208;His metal staple also increases CC stability, but ruptures upon mechanical loading to allow helix uncoiling. Staple type, position and number are key design parameters in using helical macrocyclic templates for fine&#8208;tuning CC properties in emerging biomaterials.</dc:description>

      <title>Bandgap Engineering of Hydroxyl&#8208;Functionalized Borophene for Superior Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting boron nanosheets (few&#8208;layer borophene) have been theoretically predicted, but their bandgap tunability has not been experimentally confirmed. In this study, hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized borophene (borophene&#8208;OH) with tunable bandgap was fabricated by liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation using 2&#8208;butanol solvent. Surface energy matching between boron and 2&#8208;butanol produced smooth borophene, and the exposed unsaturated B sites generated by B&#8208;B bond breaking during exfoliation coordinated with OH groups to form semiconducting borophene&#8208;OH, enabling a tunable bandgap of 0.65&#8211;2.10 eV by varying its thickness. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements demonstrated that the use of borophene&#8208;OH to fabricate working electrodes for PEC&#8208;type photodetectors significantly enhanced the photocurrent density (5.0 &#956;A/cm2) and photoresponsivity (58.5 &#956;A/W) compared with other 2D monoelemental materials. Thus, borophene&#8208;OH is a promising semiconductor with great optoelectronic potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Targeting RNA G&#8208;quadruplex in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2: A Promising Therapeutic Target for COVID&#8208;19?</title>
      <dc:description>COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has become a global threat. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing innovative treatments are extremely urgent. G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are important non&#8208;canonical nucleic acids structures with distinct biofunctions. Here, we studied four putative G4&#8208;forming sequences (PQSs) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. One of them (namely RG&#8208;1), which locates in the coding sequence (CDS) region of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), has been verified to form stable RNA G4 structure in live cells. G4&#8208;specific compounds, such as PDP, can stabilize RG&#8208;1 G4 and significantly reduce the protein levels of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N by inhibiting its translation bothin vitro andin vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that PQSs in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 can form G4 structures in live cells, and their biofunctions can be regulated by G4&#8208;specific stabilizer. We expect this finding will provide new insights into developing novel antiviral drugs against COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface Interrogation of Electrodeposited MnOx and CaMnO3 Perovskites by Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy: Probing Active Sites and Kinetics for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI&#8208;SECM) of two electrodeposited manganese&#8208;based electrocatalysts, amorphous MnOx and perovskite CaMnO3, to investigate the manganese oxidation state relating to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under neutral conditions. The results indicate the amounts of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) species in MnOx and CaMnO3 depend on potential. A Mn(V) species was identified in both structures during the OER. Time&#8208;delay titration of Mn(V) further revealed that MnOx produced two types of active sites with different OER reactions rates, k&#8217;fast(MnOx) = 1.21 s&#8208;1 and k&#8217;slow(MnOx) = 0.24 s&#8208;1. In contrast, CaMnO3 perovskites in which the Mn(V) species formed at a less positive potential than that in MnOx, displayed only one kinetic behavior with a faster reaction rate of 1.72 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating single&#8208;atom Pd sites with Cu for enhanced ambient ammonia electrosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of N  2  to NH  3  is emerging as a promising alternative for sustainable and distributed production of NH  3  . However, the development has been impeded by difficulties in N  2  adsorption, protonation of *NN and inhibition of competing hydrogen evolution. To address the issues, we design a catalyst with diatomic Pd&#8208;Cu sites on N&#8208;doped carbon by modulation of single&#8208;atom Pd sites with Cu. The introduction of Cu not only shifts the partial density states of Pd toward the Fermi level but also promote the d&#8208;2&#960;* coupling between Pd and adsorbed N  2  , leading to enhanced N  2  chemisorption, activated protonation and suppressed hydrogen evolution. As a result, the catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 24.8 &#177; 0.8% and a desirable NH  3  yield rate of 69.2 &#177; 2.5 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  cat.  &#8208;  1  , far outperforming the individual single&#8208;atom Pd catalyst.

      <title>Zwitterionic Polydopamine Engineered Interface for In Vivo Sensing with High Biocompatibility</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical sensing performance is often compromised by electrode biofouling (e.g., protein nonspecific binding) in complex biological fluids; however, the design and construction of a robust biointerface with superior antifouling ability and high tolerance of free radicals and excellent electrochemical performance remains a great challenge. Herein, inspired by nature, we demonstrate a robust polydopamine&#8208;engineered biointerfacing, to tailing zwitterionic molecules (i.e., sulfobetaine methacrylate, SBMA) through Michael Addition. The SBMA&#8208;PDA biointerface can resist nonspecific binding of proteins in complex biological fluids while enhancing interfacial electron transfer and electrochemical stability of the electrode. In addition, this sensing interface can be integrated with tissue&#8208;implantable microelectrode for  in vivo  analysis, preserving more than 92.0% of the initial sensitivity after 2 h of implantation in brain tissue and showing low acute neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, this implantable microsensor demonstrates good stability both in normal and in Parkinson's disease (PD) rat brain tissue. This PDA&#8208;engineered zwitterionic biointerface is believed to be used to construct universal interface enabling wide analytical application  in vivo  with improved sensing performance.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Current plasmonic photocatalysts are mainly based on noble metal nanoparticles and rarely work in the infrared (IR) light range. Here, cost&#8208;effective Bi  2  O  3&#8208;  x  with oxygen vacancies was formed  in situ  on commercial bismuth powder by calcination at 453.15 K in atmosphere. Interestingly, defects introduced into Bi  2  O  3&#8208;  x  simultaneously induced a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the wavelength range of 600&#8208;1400 nm and enhanced the adsorption for CO  2  molecules, which enabled efficient photocatalysis of CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO (~100% selectivity) even under low&#8208;intensity near&#8208;IR light irradiation. Significantly, the apparent quantum yield for CO evolution at 940 nm reached 0.113%, which is approximately 4.0 times that found at 450 nm. We also showed that the unique LSPR allows for the realization of a nearly linear dependence of photocatalytic CO production rate on light intensity and operating temperature.

      <title>Clathrate XI K58Zn122Sb207: A new branch on the clathrate family tree</title>
      <dc:description>The compositional screening of K&#8208;Zn&#8208;Sb ternary system aided by machine learning, rapid exploratory synthesis using KH salt&#8208;like precursor and  in&#8208;situ  powder X&#8208;ray diffraction yielded a novel clathrate type XI K  58  Zn  122  Sb  207  . This clathrate consists of a 3D Zn&#8208;Sb framework hosting K  +  ions inside polyhedral cages, some of which are reminiscent of known clathrate types while others are unique to this structure type. The complex non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure in the tetragonal space group  I&#8208;4  2  m  was solved by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as a 6&#8208;component twin due to pseudocubic symmetry and further confirmed by high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The electron&#8208;precise composition of this clathrate yields narrow&#8208;gap  p  &#8208;type semiconductor with extraordinarily low thermal conductivity due to displacement or &#8220;rattling&#8221; of K cations inside oversized cages and as well as to twinning, staking faults and antiphase boundary defects.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The compositional screening of K&#8208;Zn&#8208;Sb ternary system aided by machine learning, rapid exploratory synthesis using KH salt&#8208;like precursor and  in&#8208;situ  powder X&#8208;ray diffraction yielded a novel clathrate type XI K  58  Zn  122  Sb  207  . This clathrate consists of a 3D Zn&#8208;Sb framework hosting K  +  ions inside polyhedral cages, some of which are reminiscent of known clathrate types while others are unique to this structure type. The complex non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure in the tetragonal space group  I&#8208;4  2  m  was solved by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as a 6&#8208;component twin due to pseudocubic symmetry and further confirmed by high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The electron&#8208;precise composition of this clathrate yields narrow&#8208;gap  p  &#8208;type semiconductor with extraordinarily low thermal conductivity due to displacement or &#8220;rattling&#8221; of K cations inside oversized cages and as well as to twinning, staking faults and antiphase boundary defects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Photoresponsive Molecular Amphiphiles in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>Amphiphilic molecules, comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and the intrinsic propensity to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous environment, sustain a fascinating spectrum of structures and functions ranging from biological membranes to ordinary soap. Facing the challenge to design responsive, adaptive, and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in water, the incorporation of photoresponsive motifs in amphiphilic molecular structures offers ample opportunity to design supramolecular systems that enables functional responses in water in a non&#8208;invasive way using light. Here, we discuss the design of photoresponsive molecular amphiphiles, their self&#8208;assembled structures in aqueous media and at air&#8208;water interfaces, and various approaches to arrive at adaptive and dynamic functions in isotropic and anisotropic systems, including motion at the air&#8208;water interface, foam formation, reversible nanoscale assembly, and artificial muscle function. Controlling the delicate interplay of structural design, self&#8208;assembling conditions and external stimuli, these responsive amphiphiles open several avenues towards application such as soft adaptive materials, controlled delivery or soft actuators, bridging a gap between artificial and natural dynamic systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Super&#8208;resolution spatial proximity detection with proximity&#8208;PAINT</title>
      <dc:description>Visualizing the functional interactions of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids is key to understanding cellular life on the molecular scale. Spatial proximity is often used as a proxy for the direct interaction of biomolecules. However, current techniques to visualize spatial proximity are either limited by spatial resolution, dynamic range, or lack of single&#8208;molecule sensitivity. Here, we introduce Proximity&#8208;PAINT (pPAINT), a variation of the super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique DNA&#8208;PAINT. pPAINT uses a split&#8208;docking&#8208;site configuration to detect spatial proximity with high sensitivity, low false&#8208;positive rates, and tunable detection distances. We benchmark and optimize pPAINT using designer DNA nanostructures and demonstrate its cellular applicability by visualizing the spatial proximity of alpha&#8208; and beta&#8208;tubulin in microtubules using super&#8208;resolution detection.</dc:description>

      <title>Liquid&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn batteries and encapsulation&#8208;free flexible batteries enabled by in&#8208;situ constructed polymer electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>Zn batteries are usually considered as safe aqueous system promising for flexible batteries. On the other hand, any liquids, including water, being encapsulated in a deformable battery may result in potential troubles. Developing completely liquid&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn batteries needs high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs).  Here, we demonstrate the  in&#8208;situ  polymerized amorphous solid poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) electrolytes, which  shows high Zn ion conductivity of  19.6 mS  &#215;cm  &#8208;1  at room temperature, low interfacial impedance, highly reversible Zn plating/stripping over 1800 h cycles, uniform &amp; dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, and non&#8208;dry properties.  The  in&#8208;plane  interdigital&#8208;structure device with electrolyte completely exposed to open atmosphere can be stably operated for over 30 days almost without weight loss and electrochemical performance decay. Furthermore, the sandwich&#8208;structure device can normally operate over 40 min under fire condition. Meanwhile, the interfacial impedance and the capacity using  in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed  SPEs retain almost unchanged after various bending tests, a key criterion for flexible/wearable devices.

      <title>Turning on Zn 4s Electrons in a N2&#8208;Zn&#8208;B2 Configuration to Stimulate Remarkable ORR Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Zn based single atom catalyst has been recently explored with distinguished stability, of which the fully occupied Zn  2+  3d  10  4s  2  electronic configuration is Fenton reaction inactive, but the catalytic activity is thus inferior. Herein, we report a new approach to manipulate the s&#8208;band by constructing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art B, N co&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8208;B/N&#8208;C catalyst. We confirm both experimentally and theoretically that the unique N2&#8208;Zn&#8208;B2 configuration is crucial, in which Zn  +  (3d  10  4s  1  ) can hold enough delocalized electrons to generate suitable binding strength for key reaction intermediates and promote the charge transfer between catalytic surface and ORR reactants. This exclusive effect is not found in the other transition metal counterparts such as M&#8208;B/N&#8208;C (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu). &#160;Consequently, the as obtained catalyst demonstrate impressive ORR activity, along with remarkable long&#8208;term stability in both alkaline and acid media.

      <title>Generation of Glycosyl Radicals from Glycosyl Sulfoxides and Its Use in the Synthesis of C&#8208;linked Glycoconjugates</title>
      <dc:description>We here report glycosyl sulfoxides appended with an aryl iodide moiety as readily available, air and moisture stable precursors to glycosyl radicals. These glycosyl sulfoxides could be converted to glycosyl radicals by way of a rapid and efficient intramolecular radical substitution event. The use of this type of precursors enabled the synthesis of various complex&#160;  C  &#8208;linked glycoconjugates under mild conditions. This reaction could be performed in aqueous media and is amenable to the synthesis of glycopeptidomimetics and carbohydrate&#8208;DNA conjugates.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Aldol Reaction: Post&#8208;Aldol Stereochemistry Control and Formation of Quaternary Stereogenic Centers</title>
      <dc:description>The dominated approaches for asymmetric aldol reactions have primarily focused on the aldol carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming events. Here we postulate and develop a new catalytic strategy that seeks to modulate the reaction thermodynamics and control the product enantioselectivities via post&#8208;aldol processes. Specifically, a NHC catalyst is used to activate a masked enolate substrate (vinyl carbonate) to promote the aldol reaction in a non&#8208;enantioselective manner. This aldol event is subsequently followed by a dynamic kinetic resolution process that is mediated by the same (chiral) NHC catalyst without introducing any additional substance. This post&#8208;aldol process takes care of the enantioselectivity issues and drives the otherwise reversible aldol reaction toward a complete conversion. The acylated aldol products bearing quaternary/tetrasubstituted carbon stereogenic centers are formed in good yields and high optical purities.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantitative Protein Corona Composition and Dynamics on Carbon Nanotubes in Biological Environments</title>
      <dc:description>When nanoparticles enter biological environments, proteins adsorb to form the &#8220;protein corona&#8221; which causes significant changes in biodistribution and toxicity. Herein, we measure protein corona formation on DNA&#8208;functionalized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (ssDNA&#8208;SWCNTs), a nanoparticle ideal for sensing and delivery, in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. We characterize corona composition by mass spectrometry, revealing high&#8208;abundance corona proteins involved in lipid binding, complement activation, and coagulation. We investigate roles of electrostatic and entropic interactions driving selective corona formation. Lastly, we study real&#8208;time protein binding on ssDNA&#8208;SWCNTs, obtaining agreement between enriched proteins binding strongly and depleted proteins binding marginally, while highlighting cooperative adsorption mechanisms. Knowledge of protein corona composition, formation mechanisms, and dynamics informs nanoparticle translation from  in vitro  design to  in vivo  application.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;voltage Rechargeable Alkali&#8208;acid Zn&#8208;PbO2 Hybrid Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous rechargeable batteries have attracted tremendous research attentions owning to their advantages of safety, low cost and sustainability, while the limited electrochemical stability window (1.23 V) of water leads to their failure in competition with organic based lithium ion batteries. In this work, we report an alkali&#8208;acid Zn&#8208;PbO  2  hybrid battery by coupling alkaline Zn anode with acidic PbO  2  cathode, which show capability to deliver an impressively high open&#8208;circuit voltage (  V  oc  ) of 3.09 V and an operate voltage of 2.95 V at 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  , thanks to the contribution from expanding the voltage window and electrochemical neutralization energy from the alkali&#8208;acid asymmetric&#8208;electrolyte hybrid cell. Attractively, the hybrid battery can potentially deliver a large area capacity over 2 mAh cm  &#8208;2  or a high energy density of 252.39 Wh kg  &#8208;1  and shows almost no fading in area capacity over 250 charge&#8208;discharge cycles.

      <title>Molecular Machine Learning: The Future of Synthetic Chemistry?</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular machine learning is a research topic that has great potential to fundamentally change the way synthetic chemists operate. This Viewpoint provides an overview of possible chances for the entire field of chemistry, highlights problems/challenges and associated undesirable trends, and suggests sustainable developments and opportunities.







Abstract
During the last decade, modern machine learning has found its way into synthetic chemistry. Some long&#8208;standing challenges, such as computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP), have been successfully addressed, while other issues have barely been touched. This Viewpoint poses the question of whether current trends can persist in the long term and identifies factors that may lead to an (un)productive development. Thereby, specific risks of molecular machine learning (MML) are discussed. Furthermore, possible sustainable developments are suggested, such as explainable artificial intelligence (exAI) for synthetic chemistry. This Viewpoint will illuminate chances for possible newcomers and aims to guide the community into a discussion about current as well as future trends.

      <title>Facile Dinitrogen and Dioxygen Cleavage by a Uranium(III) Complex: Cooperativity Between the Non&#8208;innocent Ligand and the Uranium Center</title>
      <dc:description>Activation of dinitrogen (N2  , 78%) and dioxygen (O2  , 21%) has fascinated chemists and biochemists for decades. The industrial conversion of N  2  to ammonia requires extremely high temperatures and pressure. Here we report the first example of N2  and O2  cleavage by a uranium complex, [N(CH2CH2NPiPr2)3U]2(TMEDA), under ambient conditions without an external reducing agent. The N2  triple bond breaking implies a U(III)&#8208;P(III) six&#8208;electron reduction. The hydrolysis of the N2  reduction product allows the formation of ammonia or nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compound. The interaction between U(III) and P(III) in this molecule allows an eight&#8208;electron reduction of two O2  molecules. This study establishes that the combination of uranium and a low&#8208;valent nonmetal is a promising strategy to achieve a full N2  and O2  cleavage under ambient conditions, which may aid the design of new system for small molecules activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Expedient Synthetic Identification of a Novel P&#8208;stereogenic Ligand Motif for the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of Isotactic Polar Polypropylenes</title>
      <dc:description>The  iso  &#8208;specific statistical copolymerization of unprotected polar monomers with propylene still stands a as grand challenge in the field of polymer chemistry. Current research in the field is hampered as to date only a single natural product derived dimenthylphosphine&#8208;motif is known to allow for the preparation of moderately isotactic polypropylene copolymers. To overcome this structural limitation, we developed time&#8208;efficient synthetic protocols that minimize the tediousness associated with P&#8208;donor ligand development.

This work has led to identification of a novel structural lead candidate for the  iso  &#8208;specific propylene polymerization.

      <title>Structural evidence for a [4Fe&#8208;5S] intermediate in the non&#8208;redox desulfuration of thiouracil</title>
      <dc:description>We recently discovered a [Fe&#8208;S]&#8208;containing protein with  in vivo  thiouracil  desulfidase activity called TudS. We report here the crystal structure of TudS, refined at 1.5 &#197; resolution, which harbors a [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster, bound by three cysteines only. Incubation of TudS crystals with 4&#8208;thiouracil trapped the cluster with a hydrosulfide ligand bound to the fourth non&#8208;protein&#8208;bonded iron, as established by the sulfur anomalous signal. This indicates that a [4Fe&#8208;5S] state of the cluster is a catalytic intermediate in the desulfuration reaction. Structural data and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis indicate that a water molecule is located next to the hydrosulfide ligand and to two catalytically important residues, Ser101 and Glu45. This information together with modeling studies allow us to propose a mechanism for the unprecedented nonredox enzymatic desulfuration of thiouracil, in which a [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster binds and activates the sulfur atom of the substrate.</dc:description>

The resulting rhodium(III) bis(alkynyl) product can be trapped out by reaction with carbon monoxide or intercepted through irreversible reaction with dihydrogen, resulting in selective hydrogenolysis of the C&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bond.</dc:description>

      <title>Oligosilanes as Silyl Radical Precursors through Oxidative Si&#8722;Si Bond Cleavage using Redox Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Oligosilanes are of great interest in the fields of organic photonics and electronics. In this communication, a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes through cleavage of a trimethylsilyl&#8208;polysilanyl Si&#8722;Si bond is explored. These reactions smoothly occur on readily available organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes and other oligosilanes in the presence of an Ir  III  &#8208;based photo&#8208;redox catalyst under visible light irradiation. Silyl radicals are generated through single electron oxidation of the oligosilane assisted by the solvent. The introduced method exhibits broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance with respect to the organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silane and alkene components, enabling the construction of functionalized trisilanes. In addition, this catalytic system can be also applied to highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes as silyl radical acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling between Hydrazine and Aryl Halides with Hydroxide Base at Low Loadings of Palladium by Rate&#8208;Determining Deprotonation of Bound Hydrazine</title>
      <dc:description>We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N coupling of hydrazine with (hetero)aryl chlorides and bromides to form aryl hydrazines with catalyst loadings as low as 100 ppm of Pd and KOH. Mechanistic studies revealed two catalyst resting states: an arylpalladium(II) hydroxide and arylpalladium(II) chloride. These compounds are present in two interconnected catalytic cycles and react with hydrazine and base or hydrazine alone to give the product. The selectivity of the hydroxide complex with hydrazine to form aryl over diaryl hydrazine was lower than that of the chloride complex, as well as the catalytic reaction. In contrast, the selectivity of the chloride complex closely matches that of the catalytic reaction, indicating that the aryl hydrazine is derived from this complex. Kinetic studies show that the coupling process occurs by rate&#8208;limiting deprotonation of a hydrazine&#8208;bound arylpalladium(II) chloride complex to give an arylpalladium(II) hydrazido complex.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Reactivity of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrazole: Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Click Reaction and Denitrogenative Annulation</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: A general catalytic method using Mn&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based catalytic system is discovered that enables two different reactions (click reaction and denitrogenative annulation) affording two different classes of nitrogen heterocycles, such as 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles (with a pyridyl motif) and 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;pyridines. Mechanistic investigations suggest that while click reaction likely proceeds through an ionic mechanism, which is different from the traditional click reaction, denitrogenative annulation undergoes likely via an electrophilic metallonitrene intermediate rather than the metalloradical intermediate. Collectively, the discovered method is highly efficient that offer obvious advantages over other methods, as it excludes multi&#8208;step synthesis of these classes of N&#8208;heterocyclic molecules and produces only environmentally benign N2 gas by&#8208;product.</dc:description>

The targeted design of flexible MOFs demands control over macroscopic thermodynamics as determined by microscopic chemical interactions and remains an open challenge.

      <dc:description>Previously, we and other laboratories have reported an unusual and strong Raman optical activity (ROA) induced in solvents by chiral dyes. Various theories of the phenomenon appeared, but they were not capable of explaining fully the observed ROA band signs and intensities. In this work, an analysis based both on the light scattering theory and dedicated experiments provides a more complete understanding. For example, double&#8208;cell magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic ROA experiments with copper&#8208;porphyrin complexes show that the induced chirality is observed without any contact of the solvents with the complex. The results thus indicate that a combination of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) with the polarized Raman scattering is responsible for the effect. The degree of circularity of solvent vibrational bands is a principal molecular property participating in the event.

      <title>Strong &#963;&#8208;hole activation on icosahedral carborane derivatives for a directional halide recognition</title>
      <dc:description>Crystal engineering based on  &#963;  &#8208;hole interactions is an emerging approach for realization of new materials with higher complexity. Neutral inorganic clusters derived from 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;  closo  &#8208;dodecaborane, substituted with &#8211;SeMe, &#8211;TeMe, and &#8211;I moieties on both skeletal carbon vertices are experimentally demonstrated here as outstanding chalcogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bond donors. In particular, these new molecules strongly interact with halide anions in the solid&#8208;state. The halide ions are coordinated by one or two donor groups (  &#956;  1  &#8208; and  &#956;  2  &#8208;coordinations), to stabilize a discrete monomer or dimer motifs to 1D supramolecular zig&#8208;zag chains. Crucially, the observed chalcogen bond and halogen bond interactions feature remarkably short distances and strong directionality. Electrostatic potential calculations further demonstrate the efficiency of the carborane derivatives, with V  s,max  being similar or even superior to that of reference organic halogen bond donors such as iodopentafluorobenzene.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Crystal engineering based on  &#963;  &#8208;hole interactions is an emerging approach for realization of new materials with higher complexity. Neutral inorganic clusters derived from 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;  closo  &#8208;dodecaborane, substituted with &#8211;SeMe, &#8211;TeMe, and &#8211;I moieties on both skeletal carbon vertices are experimentally demonstrated here as outstanding chalcogen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;bond donors. In particular, these new molecules strongly interact with halide anions in the solid&#8208;state. The halide ions are coordinated by one or two donor groups (  &#956;  1  &#8208; and  &#956;  2  &#8208;coordinations), to stabilize a discrete monomer or dimer motifs to 1D supramolecular zig&#8208;zag chains. Crucially, the observed chalcogen bond and halogen bond interactions feature remarkably short distances and strong directionality. Electrostatic potential calculations further demonstrate the efficiency of the carborane derivatives, with V  s,max  being similar or even superior to that of reference organic halogen bond donors such as iodopentafluorobenzene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CH4 by in situ Generated Cu2O Single&#8208;Type Sites on Conductive MOF: Stabilizing Key Intermediates with Hydrogen Bond</title>
      <dc:description>It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of CH  4  in CO  2  electroreduction reactions (CO  2  RR) because of the similar reduction potentials of possible products and the sluggish kinetics for CO  2  activation. Stabilizing the key reaction intermediates by single type  of  active sites supported on porous conductive material is crucial to achieve high selectivity for single product such as CH  4  . Here, Cu  2  O(111) quantum dots with an average size of 3.5 nm are  in situ  synthesized on a porous conductive copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CuHHTP), exhibiting high selectivity of 73% towards CH  4  with partial current density of 10.8 mA cm  &#8208;2  at &#8208;1.4 V vs. RHE in CO  2  RR. Operando infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the key intermediates (e.g. *CH  2  O and *OCH  3  ) involved in the formation CH  4  pathway are stabilized by the single active Cu  2  O(111) and hydrogen bonding, thus generating CH  4  instead of CO.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water oxidation for hydrogen peroxide production</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ), as a green fuel and oxidant, has drawn increasing attention in the energy and environment field recently. Compared with the traditional anthraquinone process, electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) synthesis of H  2  O  2  , are cost&#8208;effective and environmental&#8208;friendly. In order to construct membrane&#8208;less EC/PEC devices for full H  2  O  2  synthesis, anodic H  2  O  2  production by water oxidation which is less developed compared with cathodic H  2  O  2  generation is highly desirable. Here, we reviewed recent developments for the EC/PEC H  2  O  2  production from water oxidation, including fundamental aspect, benchmarking  activity evaluation, material/catalyst selection, and strategies for increasing selectivity, efficiency, and accumulation. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges and outlook of water oxidation for H  2  O  2  production, especially device&#8208;level development, accumulation and stability, and industrial applications. Our review is supposed to stimulate increasing extensive studies further improving the development of EC/PEC H  2  O  2  production.</dc:description>
