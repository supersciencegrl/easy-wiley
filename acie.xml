      <dc:description>We report a new high electron affinity acceptor end group for organic semiconductors, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT). An n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and TCNBT end groups was synthesized by a six&#8208;fold nucleophilic substitution with cyanides on a fluorinated precursor, itself prepared by a direct arylation approach.

The highly electron&#8208;deficient end group TCNBT dramatically decreased the energy of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) compared to the fluorinated analogue and improved the molecular orientation when utilized in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs).

      <title>Topological Distortion Driven Amorphous Spherical MOFs for High Quality Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as appealing platforms to construct microlasers owing to their compelling characters combining excellent stability of inorganic materials and processable characters of organic materials. However, MOFs microstructures developed thus far are generally composed of multiple edge boundaries due to their crystalline nature, which consequently raises significant scattering losses that are detrimental to lasing performance. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically&#8208;shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOFs microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as ~10  4  and can provide sufficient feedback for high quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Self&#8208;resistance genes are employed by many microbial producers of bioactive natural products to avoid self&#8208;harm. Here, we describe a unique strategy for self&#8208;resistance toward a macrolide antibiotic, A26771B (  1  ), identified by elucidating its biosynthetic pathway in the fungus  Penicillium egyptiacum  . A highly reducing polyketide synthase and a  trans  &#8208;acting thioesterase generate the macrolide backbone, and a P450 and an acyltransferase respectively catalyze hydroxylation and succinylation to form the prodrug berkeleylactone E (  2  ). Then, extracellular oxidative activation by a secreted flavin&#8208;dependent oxidase forms  1  , while intracellular reductive inactivation by a short&#8208;chain reductase reforms  2  , forming a redox cycle. Our work illustrates a unique redox&#8208;mediated resistance mechanism for fungal antibiotics and contributes to the understanding of antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance.</dc:description>

      <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Instability of the Superionic Halide Solid Electrolytes and the Implications for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Due to high ionic conductivity and good oxidation stability, halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes regain interest for application in solid&#8208;state batteries. While stability at the cathode interface seems to be given, the stability against the lithium metal anode has not been explored yet. Here, the formation of a reaction layer between Li  3  InCl  6  (Li  3  YCl  6  ) and lithium is studied by sputter deposition of lithium metal and subsequent  in situ  X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as by impedance spectroscopy. The interface is thermodynamically unstable and results in a continuously growing interphase resistance. Additionally, the interface between Li  3  InCl  6  and Li  6  PS  5  Cl is characterized by impedance spectroscopy to discern whether a combined use as cathodic electrolyte and separator, respectively, might enable long&#8208;term stable and low impedance operation. In fact, oxidation stable halide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors cannot be used against Li, but may be promising candidates as catholytes.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomically Dispersed Reactive Centers   for  Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction and Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Developing electrocatalytic energy conversion technologies for replacing the traditional energy source is highly expected to resolve the fossil fuel exhaustion and related environmental problems. Exploring stable and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts is of vital importance for the promotion of these technologies. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), with atomically distributed active sites on supports, perform as emerging materials in catalysis and present promising prospects for a wide range of applications. The rationally designed near&#8208;range coordination environment, long&#8208;range electronic interaction and microenvironment of the coordination sphere cast huge influence on the reaction mechanism and related catalytic performance of SACs.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing electrocatalytic energy conversion technologies for replacing the traditional energy source is highly expected to resolve the fossil fuel exhaustion and related environmental problems. Exploring stable and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts is of vital importance for the promotion of these technologies. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), with atomically distributed active sites on supports, perform as emerging materials in catalysis and present promising prospects for a wide range of applications. The rationally designed near&#8208;range coordination environment, long&#8208;range electronic interaction and microenvironment of the coordination sphere cast huge influence on the reaction mechanism and related catalytic performance of SACs. In the current Review, some recent developments of atomically dispersed reactive centers for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction and water splitting are well summarized. The catalytic mechanism and the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship are elaborated based on the recent progresses of various operando investigations. Finally, by highlighting the challenges and prospects for the development of single&#8208;atom catalysis, we hope to shed some light on the future research of SACs for the electrocatalytic energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Iodine Reduction Reaction Enabled by Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery with Improved Power and Energy Densities</title>
      <dc:description>
A Prussian blue analogue host with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality, facilitates maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and frees up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. The Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power density (305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Proposed are Prussian blue analogue hosts with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality with open Co and Fe species, which facilitate maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and free up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6] exhibits a low energy barrier (0.47&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and low Tafel slope (76.74&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Accordingly, the Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The battery delivers both high energy density and high&#8208;power density of 305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, higher than I2//Zn batteries reported to date. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state flexible batteries were constructed. A 100&#8197;mAh high capacity solid&#8208;state I2//Zn battery is demonstrated with excellent cycling performance of 81.2&#8201;% capacity retained after 400 cycles.

Abstract
In their Correspondence, Sergey&#8197;V. Krivovichev and Luca Bindi argue that the novel excellent nonlinear optical material antimony pyrophosphate, K2Sb(P2O7)F, reported in our Research Article published in this journal belongs to the fresnoite Ba2[TiO(Si2O7)] group and its structure is not novel in terms of either topology or local coordination geometry around Sb3+ cations. We clarify that the statements regarding structural features of our original paper are valid in context.

      <title>Dimerization of Linear Butenes and Pentenes in an Acidic Zeolite (H&#8208;MFI)</title>
      <dc:description>
Dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites yield, rather than branched alkenes, alkanes featuring a cyclohexane ring. The absence of any C=C double bond in the latter explains not only the observed change of the IR spectra, but also the observation that oligomerization stops at the dimer.







Abstract
Quantum chemical evidence is produced to show that dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted sites in H&#8208;MFI yields alkanes featuring cyclohexane rings rather than branched alkenes. The absence of any C=C double bond in the formed cyclic alkane explains the observations that oligomerization stops at the dimer. The calculated reaction enthalpies for the dimerization of 2&#8208;pentene in the gas phase are &#8722;84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for branched alkenes, but &#8722;153 and &#8722;154&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for alkyl&#8208;cyclopentane and &#8208;hexane, respectively. Together with calculated adsorption enthalpies of the dimers, &#8722;111 and &#8722;127&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, this implies surface dimer formation enthalpies of &#8722;264 and &#8722;281&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, in close agreement with the experimental value of &#8722;285&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In contrast, the predicted enthalpy for formation of branched alkoxides, &#8722;198&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, deviates by 87&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 from experiment. Calculated IR spectra for the Br&#248;nsted OH group show the observed conversion of the band at approximately 3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (hydrogen bond with alkene) to a less intense band at approximately 3450&#8211;3500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (interaction with alkane).

      <title>Glycoengineering of NK Cells with Glycan Ligands of CD22 and Selectins for B&#8208;Cell Lymphoma Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
We report the use of a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to create CD22&#8208;specific ligands and sialyl Lewis X on NK cells (NK&#8208;92MI or CIK cells) to target and eradicate B&#8208;lymphoma efficiently.







Abstract
CD22, a member of Siglec family of sialic acid binding proteins, has restricted expression on B cells. Antibody&#8208;based agents targeting CD22 or CD20 on B lymphoma and leukemia cells exhibit clinical efficacy for treating these malignancies, but also attack normal B cells leading to immune deficiency. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to introduce high&#8208;affinity and specific CD22 ligands onto NK&#8208;92MI and cytokine&#8208;induced natural killer cells to achieve tumor&#8208;specific CD22 targeting. These CD22&#8208;ligand modified cells exhibited significantly enhanced tumor cell binding and killing in&#8197;vitro without harming healthy B cells. For effective lymphoma cell killing in&#8197;vivo, we further functionalized CD22 ligand&#8208;modified NK&#8208;92MI cells with the E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X to promote trafficking to bone marrow. The dual&#8208;functionalized cells resulted in the efficient suppression of B lymphoma in a xenograft model. Our results suggest that nature killer cells modified with glycan ligands to CD22 and selectins promote both targeted killing of B lymphoma cells and improved trafficking to sites where the cancer cells reside, respectively.

      <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Aluminum Organic Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AABs) are regarded as a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage device, and the current reported cathodes for AABs mainly focused on inorganic materials which usually implement a typical Al  3+  ions (de)insertion mechanism. However, the strong electrostatic forces between Al  3+  and the host materials usually lead to sluggish kinetics, poor reversibility and inferior cycling stability. Herein, we employ an organic compound with redox&#8208;active moieties, phenazine (PZ), as the cathode material in AABs. Different from conventional inorganic materials confined by limited lattice spacing and rigid structure, the flexible organic molecules allow a large&#8208;size Al&#8208;complex co&#8208;intercalation via reversible redox active centers (&#8211;C=N&#8211;) of PZ. This co&#8208;intercalation behavior can effectively reduce desolvation penalty, and substantially lower the Coulombic repulsion during the ion (de)insertion process. Consequently, this organic cathode exhibits a high capacity and excellent cyclability, which exceeds those of most reported electrode materials for AABs. This work highlights the anion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry of redox&#8208;active organic materials, which is expected to boost the development of high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion battery systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing transient DNA conformation changes with an intercalative fluorescent excimer</title>
      <dc:description>Variation of DNA conformation plays important roles in regulating gene expression and mediating drug&#8208;DNA interactions. However, direct probing transient DNA conformation changes remains challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of this process. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free fluorescence method to monitor transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various lengths and shapes using a DNA intercalator, K21. We find that K21 can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA and the ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer strongly correlate to DNA transient conformation stability in a variety of DNA structures, including i&#8208;motifs, G&#8208;quadruplex structures, and single nucleotides mutation at random positions. We further analyze the conformation dynamics of a single plasmid before and after enzyme digestion with confocal fluorescence microscopy. This method provides a label&#8208;free fluorescence strategy to probe the transient conformation changes of DNA structures, and holds great potential in uncovering transient genomic processes in living cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;Carbohydrate Glycomimetics as Inhibitors of Calcium(II)&#8208;binding Lectins</title>
      <dc:description>Because of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, lectins are considered novel drug targets. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes LecA and LecB in the infection process. Inhibition of both lectins with carbohydrate&#8208;derived molecules can reduce biofilm formation to restore antimicrobial susceptibility. Here, we focused on non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitors for LecA to explore new avenues for lectin inhibition. From a screening cascade we obtained one experimentally confirmed hit, a catechol, belonging to the well&#8208;known PAINS compounds. Rigorous analyses validated electron&#8208;deficient catechols as millimolar LecA inhibitors. The first co&#8208;crystal structure of a non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitor in complex with a bacterial lectin clearly demonstrates the catechol mimicking the binding of natural glycosides with LecA. Importantly, catechol 3 is the first non&#8208;carbohydrate lectin ligand that binds bacterial and mammalian calcium(II)&#8208;binding lectins, giving rise to this fundamentally new class of glycomimetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Lithium ion Solvation Regulated by Bisfluoroacetamide for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The structure and components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are extremely important to influence the performance of full cells, which is determined by the formulation of electrolyte used. However, it is still challenging to control the formation of high&#8208;quality SEI from structure to components. Herein, we designed bisfluoroacetamide (BFA) as the electrolyte additive for the construction of a gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure that consists of a lithophilic surface with C&#8208;F bonds to uniformly capture Li ions and a LiF&#8208;rich bottom layer to guide the rapid transportation of Li ions, endowing the homogeneous deposition of Li ions. Moreover, the BFA molecule changes the Li  +  solvation structure by reducing free solvents in electrolyte to improve the antioxidant properties of electrolyte and prevent the extensive degradation of electrolyte on the cathode surface, which can make sure superior cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with high&#8208;content LiF. In addition, the Li||LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  (NCM622) full cells show excellent cycling stability (a high capacity of 149 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 200 cycles at 0.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and good rate capability (a capacity of 117 mA h g  &#8208;1  at a high current density of 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) when NCM622 was used as the cathode.

      <title>Synthesis of Polycarboxylate Rh(II)&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra and their use as Building Blocks for Highly&#8208;Connected Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Use of preformed metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supermolecular building blocks (SBBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored due to lack of robust functionalized MOPs. Herein we report the use of polycarboxylate cuboctahedral Rh(II)&#8208;MOPs for constructing highly&#8208;connected MOFs.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Use of preformed metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supermolecular building blocks (SBBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored due to lack of robust functionalized MOPs.

      <title>Artificial Heterointerfaces Achieve Delicate Reaction Kinetics towards Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrazine Oxidation Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting for H2 production is limited by the sluggish&#160;anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus using hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has received great attention. Here we report the hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N&#8208;Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam with superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR activity, realizing working potentials of &#8208;43 and &#8208;88 mV for 10 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, and achieving an industry&#8208;level 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 at 200 mV for HzOR. The two&#8208;electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer requires the cell voltages of 0.071 and 0.76 V for 10 and 400 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. The H2 production powered by direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) and a commercial solar cell are investigated to inspire future practical applications. DFT calculations decipher that heterointerfaces simultaneously optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#8710;GH*) and promote the hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics.

      <title>Modifying Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann Stereoselectivity under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has recently been shown to change the rate and chemoselectivity of ground state chemical reactions via the formation of light&#8208;matter hybrid polaritonic states. However, the observation that vibrational mode symmetry has a large influence on charge transfer reactions under VSC suggests that symmetry considerations could be used to control other types of chemical selectivity through VSC. Here, we show that VSC influences the stereoselectivity of the thermal electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening of a cyclobutene derivative, a reaction which follows the Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann rules. The direction of the change in stereoselectivity depends on the vibrational mode that is coupled, as do changes in rate and reaction thermodynamics.

      <dc:description>Tumor fibrotic stroma forms complex barriers for therapeutic nanomedicine. Although nanoparticle vehicles are promising in overcoming biological barriers for drug delivery, fibrosis causes hypoxia, immunosuppression and limited immunocytes infiltration, and thus reduces antitumor efficacy of nanosystems.

Doxorubicin (DOX) and immunotherapeutic enhancer (Fe ions) are immobilized on the surface of CDs, whereas tumor microenvironment modifier (losartan, LOS) is encapsulated within the mesopores. The drugs&#8208;loaded nanoassemblies disassociate into individual CDs to release LOS to mitigate stroma and hypoxia in response to CAFs. The individual CDs carrying DOX and Fe ion efficiently penetrate deep into tumor to trigger intensified immune responses.

SPNP comprises a semiconducting polymer (SP) conjugated with a granzyme B cleavable and dye&#8208;labeled peptide as the side chain, both of which emit NIRF and PA signals. After systemic administration, SPNP passively targets the tumor and in&#8208;situ reacts with granzyme B to release the dye&#8208;labeled peptide, leading to decreased NIRF and PA signals from the dye but unchanged signals from the polymer. Such ratiometric NIRF and PA signals of SPNP correlate well with the expression level of granzyme B and intratumoral population of CTLs.

      <title>A Systematic Study of Unsaturation in Lipid Nanoparticles Leads to Improved mRNA Transfection In Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent the leading concept for mRNA delivery. Unsaturated lipids play important roles in nature with potential for mRNA therapeutics but are difficult to access through chemical synthesis. To systematically study the role of unsaturation, modular reactions were utilized to access a library of 91 amino lipids, enabled by the synthesis of unsaturated thiols. An ionizable lipid series (4A3) emerged from  in vitro  and  in vivo  screening, where the 4A3 core with a citronellol&#8208;based (Cit) periphery emerged as best. We studied the interaction between LNPs and a model endosomal membrane where 4A3&#8208;Cit demonstrated superior lipid fusion over saturated lipids, suggesting its unsaturated tail promotes endosomal escape. Furthermore, 4A3&#8208;Cit significantly improved mRNA delivery efficacy  in vivo  via Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), resulting in 18&#8208;fold increased protein expression over parent LNPs. These findings provide insight into how lipid unsaturation promotes mRNA delivery and demonstrate how lipid mixing can enhance efficacy.</dc:description>

      <title>Robust Supramolecular Nano&#8208;tunnels Built from Molecular Bricks</title>
      <dc:description>Chemists are always seeking new methods to construct porous lattice frameworks from simple motifs. To date, the most common tectons of reported porous frameworks are predesigned multi&#8208;armed scaffolds with  C3,  C4  or  C6  symmetry. Linear two&#8208;armed tectons with  C2  symmetry are easier to synthesize but cannot form porous architectures by themself, unless combined with tectons of different symmetry. Herein we report a linear ionic molecule that assembles into a supramolecular nano&#8208;tunnel structure through synergy of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The nano&#8208;tunnel crystal exhibits anisotropic guest adsorption behavior. The material shows good thermal stability and undergoes multi&#8208;stage single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transformations to a nonporous structure on heating. The material exhibits remarkable chemical stability in both acidic and basic conditions, which is rarely observed in supramolecular organic frameworks and is often related to structures with designed hydrogen bonding interactions. Because of the high polarity of the tunnels, this molecular crystal also shows a large CO2  adsorption capacity while excluding other gases at ambient temperature, leading to high CO2  /CH4  selectivity. The aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature of the molecules gives the bulk crystals vapochromic behavior.</dc:description>

      <title>NIR&#8208;II pH Sensor with FRET Adjustable Transition Point for In Situ Dynamic Tumor Microenvironment Visualization</title>
      <dc:description>pH monitoring in tumor lesions provide abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pHt). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity in wider response region, we herein design a serial of pHt adjustable sensors (pTAS) through simply regulating the component ratio of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission aza&#8208;BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine&#8208;based pre&#8208;acceptor (NRh) in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11&#8208;7.22) is obtained compared to the pHt settled sensor (6.38&#8208;6.94). With pHt adjustable feature, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease process could be dynamically visualized through dual&#8208;channel ratiometric bioimaging in NIR&#8208;II window with coefficient of variation under 1% compared to the standard pH meter.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Large Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films on Copper Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A controllable electrochemical synthesis method of MOF films is developed, and opens the door to the fabrication of large&#8208;scale 2D MOF films. Industrial&#8208;scale continuous production of large&#8208;scale MOF films may be realized via this technology, which can promote their application in the field of microelectronic devices.







Abstract
Owing to their excellent physical and electrical properties, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with well&#8208;defined supramolecular structures have received extensive research attention. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOF films is still a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a novel electrochemical (EC) synthesis method for the preparation of large&#8208;area Cu3(HHTP)2 MOF film on single&#8208;crystal Cu (100) anode. The surface reaction was achieved via charge&#8208;induced molecular assembly. The synthesized MOF film exhibited a high crystalline quality with an electrical conductivity of approximately 0.087&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which was around 1000 times larger than the previously reported values for the same material prepared by the interface method. In addition, Cu2(MTCP), Cu3(BTPA)2, and Cu3(TPTC)2 MOF films were synthesized on Cu foil with the same strategy, which confirmed the universality of the proposed method. This controllable EC method can be effectively applied to the industrial&#8208;scale production of 2D MOF films on Cu foil.

      <title>Tunable eg orbital occupancy in Heusler compounds for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Heusler compounds have great potential in electrocatalysis due to their mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions. This study reports the first application of Co  2  YZ  type Heusler compounds as electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A range of Co  2  YZ  crystals was synthesized through the arc&#8208;melting method and the  e  g  orbital filling of Co was precisely regulated by varying  Y  and  Z  sites of the compound. A strong correlation between the  e  g  orbital filling of reactive Co sites and OER activity was found on Co  2  Mn  Z  compounds (  Z  = Ti, Al, V, and Ga) whereby higher catalytic current was achieved with  e  g  orbital filling approaching to unity. A similar trend of  e  g  orbital filling on the reactivity of cobalt sites was also observed for other set of Heusler compounds (Co  2  V  Z  ,  Z  = Sn and Ga). This work demonstrates proof of concept of application of Heusler compounds as a new class of OER electrocatalyst and the influence of the manipulation of the spin orbitals on their catalytic performances.</dc:description>

      <title>A Functional Chemiluminescent Probe for in vivo Imaging of Natural Killer Cell Activity against Tumours</title>
      <dc:description>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that can directly kill certain types of cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of NK cells represents a novel and promising immunotherapy for malignant tumours; however, there is a lack of methods to validate anti&#8208;tumour activity of NK cells reaching target sites  in vivo. Herein we report a new chemiluminescent probe to image  in situ  the granzyme B&#8208;mediated killing activity of NK cells against cancer cells. We have optimised a granzyme B&#8208;specific construct using an activatable phenoxydioxetane reporter so that enzymatic cleavage of the probe results in bright chemiluminescence in the visible range. The probe shows high selectivity for active granzyme B over other proteases and higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios than commercial fluorophores. Finally, we demonstrate that the probe can detect activity of NK cells in preclinical mouse models, being the first chemiluminescent probe for  in vivo  imaging of NK cell activity in live tumours.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique that overcomes the diffraction limit by analyzing intensity fluctuations of statistically independent emitters in a time series of images. The final images are background&#8208;free and show confocality and enhanced spatial resolution (super&#8208;resolution). Fluorophore photobleaching, however, is a key limitation for recording long time&#8208;series of images that will allow for the calculation of higher order SOFI results with correspondingly increased resolution. Here, we demonstrate that photobleaching can be circumvented by using fluorophore labels that reversibly and transiently bind to a target, and which are being replenished from a buffer which serves as a reservoir. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled short DNA oligonucleotides, we labeled cellular structures with target&#8208;specific antibodies that contain complementary DNA sequences and record the fluctuation events caused by transient emitter binding. We show that this concept bypasses extensive photobleaching and facilitates two&#8208;color imaging of cellular structures with SOFI.</dc:description>

      <title>Precise Molecular&#8208;level Modification of Nafion with Bismuth Oxide Clusters for High&#8208;performance Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>Fabricating proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with high ionic conductivity and ideal mechanical robustness through regulation of the membrane microstructures achieved by molecular&#8208;level hybridization remains essential but challenging for the further development of high&#8208;performance PEM fuel cells.

      <title>Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight photoswitchable hydrogelators</title>
      <dc:description>Two photoswitchable arylazopyrozoles form hydrogels at a concentration of 1.2% (w/v). With a molecular weight of 258.28 g/mol, these are the lowest known molecular weight hydrogelators that respond reversibly to light. Photoswitching of the  E  &#8208; to the  Z  &#8208;form by 365 nm light results in a macrocopic gel&#8594;sol transition; nearly an order of magnitude reduction in the measured elastic and loss moduli. In the case of the  meta  &#8208;arylazopyrozole, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy suggests that the 29&#177;7 nm wide sheets in the  E  &#8208;gel state narrow to 13&#177;2 nm upon photoswitching to the predominantly  Z  &#8208;solution state. Photoswitching for  meta  &#8208;arylazopyrozole is reversible through cycles of 365 nm and 520 nm excitation with little fatigue. The release of a Rhodamine B dye encapsulated in gels formed by the arylazopyrozoles is accelerated more than 20&#8208;fold upon photoswitching with 365 nm light, demonstrating these materials are suitable for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.</dc:description>

      <title>Universal Electrochemical Synthesis of Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductors: Mesoporous CdSe and CdTe Thin Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted electrochemical deposition of mesoporous semiconductors (CdSe and CdTe). The resulting mesoporous films are stoichiometrically equivalent and contain mesopores homogeneously distributed over the entire surface. To demonstrate the versatility of the method, two block copolymers with different molecular weights were used, yielding films with pores of either 9 or 18 nm diameter. As a proof of concept, the mesoporous CdSe film based photodetectors show a high sensitivity of 204 mW  &#8208;1  cm  2  at 680 nm wavelength, which is at least two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the bulk counterpart. This work pioneers a new synthesis route for nanostructured semiconductors with optical band gaps active in the visible spectrum.</dc:description>

      <title>Light&#8208;triggered transformable ferrous ion delivery system for photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has been recognized as an emerging and alternative tumor therapeutic modality, which mainly involved the catalytic generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) through metal ions&#8208;mediated Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Among metal ions, ferrous ion (Fe  2+  ) is a classical catalyst ion, however, it suffers easy oxidation and systemic side effects. Therefore, the development of controllable Fe  2+  delivery system is a big challenge to maintain its valence state, reduce toxicity and improve therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered transformable Fe  2+  delivery agent (denoted as LET&#8208;6) for fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modality imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The LET&#8208;6 was composed of cyanine analogue (tPy&#8208;Cy&#8208;Fe) and distearoylphosphoethanolamine&#8208;polyethylene glycol (DSPE&#8208;PEG). The   tPy&#8208;Cy&#8208;Fe  contains a cyanine structure for FL/PA imaging and a chelating ligand, 4'&#8208;(amino&#8208; methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2':6',2"&#8208;terpyridine (tPy), for  Fe  2+  binding  . Thermal expansion caused by 808 nm laser irradiation triggered the transformation of LET&#8208;6 to expose Fe  2+  from its hydrophobic layer, which primed the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H  2  O  2  in tumor microenvironment, thus generating abundant of &#8226;OH for enhanced CDT. The LET&#8208;6 showed remarkable therapeutic effects under laser irradiation  ,  both in vitro and in vivo, achieving 100% tumor elimination after just once treatment. This high&#8208;performance Fe  2+  delivery system provides a sound basis for future metal&#8208;ions&#8208;mediated cancer synergistic therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Enantioselectivity in 3D Porous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but the confinement effect of frameworks on molecular catalysts has yet to be explored. Here we demonstrate the utilization of 3D COFs with well&#8208;defined porous channels capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective in catalyzing organic transformations, sharply different from the typical methods for tailoring enantioselectivities by varying steric and electronic properties of molecular catalysts. By condensations of a tetrahedral tetraamine and two linear dialdehydes derived from enantiopure 1,1'&#8208;binaphthol (BINOL), two chiral 3D COFs with a 9&#8208;fold or 11&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid framework are prepared. Obviously enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity was observed for the chiral BINOL units that are uniformly distributed within the tubular channels compared to the non&#8208;immobilized acids. This facilitates the Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis of cyclocondensation of aldehydes and anthranilamides to produce 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones. While homogeneous BINOL controls display no enantioselectivity and/or low activity, constraint of their conformations in CCOFs leads to up to 91% isolated yield with 97% ee. DFT calculations show COF catalyst provide preferential secondary interactions between the substrate and framework to induce enantioselectivities that are not achievable in homogeneous systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis, Crystal Structures and Light&#8208;Controlled Molecular Encapsulation and Release</title>
      <dc:description>Azobenzene (azo)&#8208;based macrocycles are highly fascinating in supramolecular chemistry because of their light&#8208;responsiveness. In this work, a series of azo&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes  1  ,  2  ,  3  and  4  distinguished by the substituted positions of azo groups are rationally designed and synthesized via a fragment cyclization method. From the crystal and computed structures of  1  ,  2  and  3  , we observe that the cavity size of these azo&#8208;macrocycles decreases gradually upon  E  &#8594;  Z  photoisomerization. Moreover, light&#8208;controlled host&#8211;guest complexations between azo&#8208;macrocycle  1  and guest molecules (7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane, terephthalonitrile) are successfully achieved. This work provides a simple and effective method to prepare azo&#8208;macrocycles, and the light&#8208;responsive molecular encapsulation systems in this work may further advance the design and applications of novel photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems.</dc:description>

Moreover, light&#8208;controlled host&#8211;guest complexations between azo&#8208;macrocycle  1  and guest molecules (7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane, terephthalonitrile) are successfully achieved. This work provides a simple and effective method to prepare azo&#8208;macrocycles, and the light&#8208;responsive molecular encapsulation systems in this work may further advance the design and applications of novel photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Single Pt Atom Doping to Silver Clusters Enables Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Photon Upconversion</title>
      <dc:description>Photon upconversion (UC) from near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to visible has been realized using&#160;singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet absorption of sensitizers, which are currently&#160;limited to osmium complexes and semiconductor nanocrystals.&#160;Motivated by the atomically precise tunability of electronic structure and photophysical properties of noble metal clusters, which often possess absorption bands that extend into the NIR region, we investigated MAg  24  (SR)  18  &#160;(M = Ag, Pt; SR = 2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzenethiolate) clusters as a new NIR&#8208;absorbing sensitizer for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation UC. Combined with a blue light emitter, the NIR excitation&#160;(  &#955;  ex  &#160;= 785 nm) of Ag  25  (SR)  18  results in no UC emission, while PtAg  24  (SR)  18  &#160;exhibits strong UC emission. This enhancement is primarily due to a significant increase in the intersystem crossing quantum yield of the cluster associated with the spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhancement in the M@Ag  12  core.</dc:description>

      <title>Accurate Determination of the Quantity and Spatial Distribution of Counterions around a Spherical Macroion</title>
      <dc:description>The distribution of counterions around a macroion is an important feature for macroionic systems. Here we report the determination of the accurate number and the spatial distribution of countercations (Sr  2+  , Rb  +  ) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo  132  }  42&#8208;  ,  using anomalous small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (ASAXS). The results show that both Rb  +  and Sr  2+  ions have shorter diffuse lengths than theoretical prediction. In addition, most of Rb  +  ions are closely associated with {Mo  132  } by staying near the skeleton of {Mo  132  } or in the Stern layer, whereas Sr  2+  ions preferred to loosely associate with {Mo  132  } in the diffuse layer. The results also explain the observations that monovalent Rb  +  ions have a stronger affinity towards {Mo  132  } in comparison to divalent Sr  2+  ions, as well as the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of {Mo  132  } in the presence of Rb  +  ions compared to Sr  2+  ions.   The anomalous CCC behavior of {Mo  132  } can be attributed to most of the negative charges being located on the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8208;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction and, hence, making the enthalpy change due to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8208;{Mo  132  } interaction. Macroions with charges distributed on their external surfaces, e.g., {U  60  }, do not show such abnormal behavior.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous dual&#8208;gene diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 based on CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated lateral flow assay</title>
      <dc:description>Accurate and large&#8208;scale screening of infected individuals has proven to be an effective means to control the spread of COVID&#8208;19. Currently, many assays have been developed to meet the huge testing requirements and the availability of diverse detection settings. However, few methods emphasize the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT&#8208;qPCR method. Herein, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay (TL&#8208;LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual&#8208;gene detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes from cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards,&#160;showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 &#956;L). Furthermore, dual&#8208;gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples showed 100% negative predictive agreement (NPA) and 97.14% positive predictive agreement (PPA). Expectantly, this developed platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID&#8208;19 or other infectious diseases in low&#8208;resource regions.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbodicarbene Bismaalkene Cations: Unravelling the Complexities of Carbene versus Carbone in Heavy Pnictogen Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>While pnictaalkenes are well&#8208;established for the light group 15 elements, they become more reactive and exceptionally rare as the group is descended. Herein, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the first examples of carbodicarbene (CDC)&#8208;stabilized bismuth complexes, which feature low&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth centers with C=Bi multiple bond character. Monocations [(CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl][SbF6] (8) and&#160;&#160;[(CDC)BiBr2(THF)2][SbF6] (11), dications [(CDC)Bi(Ph)][SbF6]2&#160;(9) and [(CDC)BiBr(THF)3][NTf2]2&#160;(12), and trication [(CDC)2Bi][NTf2]3&#160;(13) have been synthesized via sequential halide abstractions from (CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl2&#160;(7) and (CDC)BiBr3&#160;(10). Notably, the dications and trication exhibit C&#8649;Bi double dative bonds, and thus represent unprecedented bismaalkene cations.

      <title>Cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery using glycosylated dynamic covalent polymers self&#8208;assembled in situ by RNA&#8208;templating</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamic covalent libraries enable exploring complex chemical systems from which bioactive assemblies can adaptively emerge through template effects. In this work, we studied dynamic covalent libraries made of complementary bifunctional cationic peptides, yielding a diversity of species from macrocycles to polymers. Although polymers are typically expressed only at high concentration, we found that siRNA act as a template in the formation of dynamic covalent polymers at low concentration in a process guided by electrostatic binding. Using a glycosylated building block, we were able to show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake, and even cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Paired copper monomers in zeolite omega: the active site for methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion</title>
      <dc:description>The direct conversion of methane to methanol using oxygen is a challenging but potentially rewarding pathway towards utilizing methane. By using a stepwise chemical looping approach, copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites can convert methane to methanol, but productivity is still too low for viable implementation. However, if the nature of the active site could be elucidated, that information could be used to design more effective catalysts.

      <title>Site Sensitivity of Interfacial Charge Transfer and Photocatalytic Efficiency in Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding structural effects and reaction mechanisms of photocatalysts is of great interest and importance. Herein we report a comprehensive study of photocatalytic oxidation of methanol on various anatase TiO2 nanocrystals by means of combined in situ and time&#8208;resolved characterizations and density functional theory calculations. Surface site and resulting surface adsorbates were observed to strongly affect the surface band bending/bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface charge migration processes and the interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes. TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets expose a high density of reactive fourfold&#8208;coordinated Ti sites (Ti4c) at which CH3OH molecules dissociate to form the CH3O adsorbate (CH3O(a)Ti4c). CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the localized density of states almost at the valence band maximum of TiO2 surface, which facilitates the interfacial hole transfer process; meanwhile, CH3O(a)Ti4c with a high coverage greatly promotes the upward surface band bending, which facilitates the bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface hole migration process. Consequently, among all the observed surface adsorbates, CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the highest photocatalytic oxidation rate constant. Consequently, TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets are most active in photocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction. These results unambiguously exemplify the surface structure effect in photocatalysis and elucidate the underlying mechanism.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Two novel 18&#8208;electron titanium germylene complexes, Cp  2  Ti(L)=Ge[Si  3  (SiMe  t  Bu  2  )  4  ]  3b  (L = Me  3  P) and  3c  (L = XylNC), were synthesized, isolated, and structurally characterized. The length of the titanium&#8208;germanium bonds of 2.5387(3) &#197; and 2.5276(3) &#197; (in  3b  and  3c  , respectively) well match those expected for the double bond, which was further supported by the DFT study. Based on their structural characteristics, as well as their atomic charges calculations which revealed Ti(  &#948;  +)=Ge(  &#948;  &#8211;) bond polarization, both  3b  and  3c  are classified as the Schrock&#8208;type titanium germylidenes, as the germanium analogues of the widely known titanium alkylidenes. By contrast, germylene complexes of the group 6 metals  8a  (M = Mo) and  8b  (M = W) are better described as Fischer&#8208;type germylene complexes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This contribution describes the synthesis of colloidal di&#8208;patch particles functionalized with DNA on the patches and their assembly into colloidal superstructures via cooperative depletion and DNA&#8208;mediated interactions. The assembly into flower&#8208;like Kagome, brick&#8208;wall like monolayer, orthogonal packed single or double layers, wrinkled monolayer, and colloidal honeycomb superstructures can be controlled by tuning the particles&#8217; patch sizes and assembly conditions. Based on these experimental results, we generate an empirical phase diagram. The principles revealed by the phase diagram provide guidance in the design of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with desired superstructures.

      <title>A General Organocatalytic System for Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Additions to Enals</title>
      <dc:description>Herein,  we report a general iminium ion&#8208;based catalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals. The process uses an organic photoredox catalyst, which absorbs blue light to generate radicals from stable precursors, in combination with a chiral amine catalyst, which secures a consistently high level of stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalytic platform is demonstrated by the stereoselective interception of a wide variety of radicals, including non&#8208;stabilized primary ones which are generally difficult to engage in asymmetric processes. The system also served to develop organocatalytic cascade processes that combine an iminium&#8208;ion&#8208;based radical trap with an enamine&#8208;mediated step, affording stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.</dc:description>

      <title>Formic Acid&#8208;Assisted Selective Hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Dimethylfuran over Bifunctional Pd Nanoparticles Supported on N&#8208;doped Mesoporous Carbon</title>
      <dc:description>Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is regarded as one of the most promising platform chemicals to produce 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran (DMF) as a potential liquid transportation fuel. Pd nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;containing and N&#8208;free mesoporous carbon materials were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF under mild reaction conditions. Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid (FA) and H  2  over Pd/NMC within 2 h. The reaction mechanism, especially the multiple roles of FA, was explored through a detailed comparative study by varying hydrogen source, additive, and substrate as well as by applying  in situ  ATR&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The major role of FA is to shift the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via the protonation by FA at the C&#8722;OH group, lowering the activation barrier of the C&#8722;O bond cleavage and thus significantly enhancing the reaction rate. XPS results and DFT calculations revealed that Pd  2+  species interacting with pyridine&#8208;like N atoms significantly enhance the selective hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;OH bond in the presence of FA due to their high ability for the activation of FA and the stabilization of H  &#8208;  .</dc:description>
