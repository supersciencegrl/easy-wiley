         <title>A Deprotection&#8208;free Method for High&#8208;yield Synthesis of Graphdiyne Powder with in&#8208;situ Formed CuO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With a direct bandgap, superior charge carrier mobility, and uniformly distributed pores, graphdiyne (GDY) has stimulated tremendous interest from the scientific community. However, its broad application is greatly limited by the complicated multistep synthesis process including complex deprotection of hexakis&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB&#8208;TMS) and peeling of GDY from the substrates. Here, we describe a deprotection&#8208;free strategy to prepare GDY powder by directly using HEB&#8208;TMS as the monomer. When CuCl was used as the catalysts in DMF solvent, the yield of GDY powder reached ~100%. More interesting, uniformly dispersed CuO nanoparticles with an average diameter of ~2.9 nm were in&#8208;situ formed on GDY after the reaction. The prepared CuO/GDY demonstrated an excellent co&#8208;catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt co&#8208;catalyst. The deprotection&#8208;free approach will widen the use of GDY and facilitate its scaling up to industrial level.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming and Dynamic Control of the Circular Polarization of Luminescence from an Achiral Fluorescent Dye in a Liquid Crystal Host by Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circular polarized light is utilized in communication and display technologies and a major challenge is to develop systems that can be switched between left and right circular polarized luminescence with high degrees of polarization and enable multiple addressable stable states. Luminescent dyes in Liquid Crystal (LC) cholesteric phases are attractive systems in order to generate, amplify and modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In the present study, we employ light&#8208;driven molecular motors as photo&#8208;controlled chiral dopants in liquid crystals (LCs) to switch the handedness of the LC and the circular polarization of luminescence from an achiral dye embedded in the mesogenic material. Tuning of the color of the CPL and the retention time of the photoprogrammed helicity is demonstrated making use of a variety of motors and dyes. The flexibility offered by the design based on inherently chiral unidirectional rotary motors provides full control over CPL non&#8208;invasively by light, opening possibilities for pixilated displays with externally addressable polarization.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand into Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of AgBF4  and [Rh(COD)Cl]2  (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in presence of [NEt4][C5(CF3)5] afforded the fluorocarbon soluble complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] by salt metathesis. This complex represents the first example for a successful coordination of the weakly basic [C5(CF3)5]&#8722;  ligand, since its first synthesis in 1980. In addition to [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] also the byproduct [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)4H] was isolated and fully characterized. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the interaction energy of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722;  ligand towards the 12&#8208;electron fragment [Rh(COD)]+  is &#8776; 70 kcal/mol lower in comparison to [C5(CH3)5]&#8722;  due to reduced electrostatic interactions and weaker &#960;&#8208;donor properties of the ligand. The quantitative but reversible substitution of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722;  ligand by toluene, converting it into a weakly&#8208;coordinating anion, experimentally proved the extraordinary weak bonding interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Immunosuppressive Cyclophilin Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophilins are enzymes that accelerate the rotation of the peptide bond in front of a proline residue. As a consequence of their involvement in pathophysiological processes, they are associated with various diseases. Thus, the inhibition of cyclophilins appears to be a worthwhile goal, whose pursuit has led to various promising drug candidates&#8212;particularly for the treatment of viral infections&#8212;without contraproductive immunosuppression.







Abstract
Cyclophilins, enzymes with peptidyl&#8208;prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity, are relevant to a large variety of biological processes. The most abundant member of this enzyme family, cyclophilin A, is the cellular receptor of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA). As a consequence of the pathophysiological role of cyclophilins, particularly in viral infections, there is a broad interest in cyclophilin inhibition devoid of immunosuppressive activity. This Review first gives an introduction into the physiological and pathophysiological roles of cyclophilins. The presentation of non&#8208;immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors will commence with drugs based on chemical modifications of CsA. The naturally occurring macrocyclic sanglifehrins have become other lead structures for cyclophilin&#8208;inhibiting drugs. Finally, de&#8197;novo designed compounds, whose structures are not derived from or inspired by natural products, will be presented. Relevant synthetic concepts will be discussed, but the focus will also be on biochemical studies, structure&#8211;activity relationships, and clinical studies.

         <title>Manipulating Reaction Intermediates to Aqueous&#8208;Phase ZnSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters and Quantum Dots at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the prenucleation stage of aqueous&#8208;phase ZnSe quantum dots (QDs), an optically&#8208;transparent intermediate forms, which can transform to absorbing magic&#8208;size clusters (MSC&#8208;299). The MSC precursor compond (PC&#8208;299) fragments passively when a room&#8208;temperature reaction proceeds beyond nucleation, while aggressively at elevated temperatures. High reaction concentrations favor the PC&#8208;299 formation more.







Abstract
It is not resolved which model describes better the aqueous&#8208;phase nucleation and growth of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), the classical one&#8208;step one or the nonclassical multi&#8208;step one. Here, we design a room&#8208;temperature reaction to trap reaction intermediates in the prenucleation stage of ZnSe QDs (as a model system). We show that the trapped intermediate can transform to magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) via intra&#8208;molecular reorganization and can fragment to enable the growth of QDs. The MSCs exhibit a sharp optical absorption peaking at 299&#8197;nm, labelled MSC&#8208;299. The intermediate, the precursor compound (PC&#8208;299) of MSC&#8208;299, is optically transparent at 299&#8197;nm and to longer wavelengths. This intermediate forms in various Zn and Se reaction systems. The present study provides unambiguous evidence that the nonclassical and classical pathways are both necessary to explain the nucleation and growth of aqueous&#8208;phase QDs, with the former pathway favored more by high reaction concentrations.

The heterosynthon from the toolkit of the crystal engineer enables medicinal and pharmaceutical chemists to identify in the early stages of the design cycle those molecules whose solid forms are less likely to pose bioavailability issues.







Abstract
Starting from a molecular pharmacophore, which is a marker of drug action in medicinal molecules, we propose that the heterosynthon, a supramolecular synthon between unlike functional groups, plays an analogous role in the design and discovery of high bioavailability drugs. The heterosynthon could provide a more efficient and economical route to novel drugs.

         <title>Less is More: A Shortcut for Anionocages Design Based on (RPO32&#8208;)&#8208;Monourea Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionocages have been developed as a unique family of hydrogen bonded cages. However, strategies for constructing anionocages are mainly limited to that based on (PO  4  3&#8208;  )&#8208;bisurea coordination, neither the ligands nor the anions lack the simplicity and diversity of the maturely developed analogues based on metal &#160;coordination (i.e. metallocage). We report herein a more simple strategy for anionocages design based on (RPO  3  2&#8208;  )&#8208;monourea coordination, utilizing monourea rather than bisurea as the hydrogen binding donor, and RPO  3  2&#8208;  rather than PO  4  3&#8208;  as the acceptor. Two fluorescent, quadruple helicate anionocages were constructed by a bis(monourea) ligand, and dianions PhOPO  3  2&#8208;  (  H  1  ) or HOPO  3  2&#8208;  (  H  1A  ), respectively, which were capable of encapsulating a series of cation guests. As revealed by molecular modeling,  H  1  features remarkable guest&#8208;adaptive cavity breathing without change of the quadruple helicate topology, which allowed the encapsulation of different sized guests in an &#8220;induced fit&#8221; manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Transfer Pathways in Nitrogenase with and without Dissociated S2B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possible proton transfer pathways in the active&#8208;site FeMo cluster of nitrogenase from the S5A, S4A or S3B sulfide ions to the substrate were studied through combined quantum and molecular mechanical calculations. The results show that the barriers are prohibitively high if the S2B sulfide ion has dissociated from the cluster, but are reasonable with S2B bound.







Abstract
Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can convert N2 to NH3. Crystallographic structures have indicated that one of the sulfide ligands of the active&#8208;site FeMo cluster, S2B, can be replaced by an inhibitor, like CO and OH&#8722;, and it has been suggested that it may be displaced also during the normal reaction. We have investigated possible proton transfer pathways within the FeMo cluster during the conversion of N2H2 to two molecules of NH3, assuming that the protons enter the cluster at the S3B, S4B or S5A sulfide ions and are then transferred to the substrate. We use combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations with the TPSS and B3LYP functionals. The calculations indicate that the barriers for these reactions are reasonable if the S2B ligand remains bound to the cluster, but they become prohibitively high if S2B has dissociated. This suggests that it is unlikely that S2B reversibly dissociates during the normal reaction cycle.

         <title>Enhanced Aromaticity and Open&#8208;Shell Diradical Character in the Dianions of 9&#8208;Fluorenylidene&#8208;Substituted Expanded Radialenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 9&#8208;fluorenylidene&#8208;substituted expanded radialenes with a diacetylene spacer were synthesized. The neutral compounds are cross&#8208;conjugated but their dianions are stabilized by the aromaticity of the central cores and fluorenyl anion substituents. The larger sized macrocyclic dianions exhibited unique open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
Radialenes and expanded radialenes are cross&#8208;conjugated macrocycles displaying poor aromatic character. In this work, three 9&#8208;fluorenylidene substituted expanded [n]radialenes (ER&#8208;n, n=3&#8211;5) with a diacetylene spacer were synthesized and their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and NMR spectroscopy. They all can be easily reduced into relatively stable dianions. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that their dianions (ER&#8208;n2&#8722;, n=3&#8211;5) are stabilized by both the aromatic fluorenyl anion substituents and the central aromatic rings with formally [4n+2] delocalized &#960; electrons. In addition, the dianions of the extended radialenes (ER&#8208;42&#8722; and ER&#8208;52&#8722;) show unique open&#8208;shell diradical character with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. For comparison, their linear counterparts (L&#8208;3 and L&#8208;4) were also synthesized; their dianions exhibit very different redox and optical properties from their respective macrocycles.

         <title>A Conjugated Covalent Template Strategy for All&#8208;Benzene Catenane Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;free catenanes are synthetically non&#8208;trivial targets, and especially those composed of highly strained oligoparaphenylene&#8208;derived nanohoops. Herein, a novel conjugated covalent template strategy employing an azo group is established for an efficient synthesis of an all&#8208;benzene catenane. It features azobenzene&#8208;directed dual intramolecular macrocyclizations and traceless removal of the azo template.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules based on oligoparaphenylene&#8208;derived nanohoops, particularly those without heteroatoms, are synthetically challenging and topologically intriguing targets. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent template strategy based on azo group has been developed, which features dual intramolecular macrocyclizations directed by a tetra&#8208;substituted azobenzene core, followed by traceless removal of the azo linker. Employing this strategy, the efficient synthesis of a novel all&#8208;benzene [2]catenane consisting of meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes has been accomplished.

We report &#945;&#8208;thianthrenium carbonyl species as &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocation equivalents, generated in situ by radical conjugate addition of trifluoromethyl radical to Michael acceptors. The method can obtain C&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted amino acids in 90&#8197;seconds.







Abstract
Here we report an &#945;&#8208;thianthrenium carbonyl species, as the equivalent of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocation, which is generated by the radical conjugate addition of a trifluoromethyl thianthrenium salt to Michael acceptors. The reactivity allows for the synthesis of C&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acid analogues via a Ritter reaction by addition of acetonitrile. Addition of hydroxide, methoxide, and even fluoride can afford &#945;&#8208;heteroatom substituted &#945;&#8208;phenylpropanoates.

Addition of hydroxide, methoxide, and even fluoride can afford &#945;-heteroatom substituted &#945;-phenylpropanoates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylsulfenylation with a Disulfide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disulfide&#8208;based alkylthio transfer reagent was developed for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylsulfenylation of ketones and aldehydes, showing good activity and stereoselectivity when combined with primary amine organocatalysis.







Abstract
The use of alkylthio electrophiles in synthesis has remained elusive because of the lack of a suitable reagent that is practical and of excellent enantioselectivity and appropriate reactivity. In this work we introduce a novel alkylthio reagent based on the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MMTD) fragment for direct alkylsulfenylation of ketones and aldehydes. It can be readily prepared by the oxidative coupling between thiadiazole and other alkylthio reagents and be combined with chiral primary aminocatalysis. This protocol provides facile access to diverse &#945;&#8208;alkylthio quaternary carbon centers with good stereoselectivities.

         <title>Kinetic&#8208;Sieving of Carbon Dioxide from Acetylene through a Novel Sulfonic Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fine&#8208;tuning of the pore structure without changing the topology is possible through post&#8208;synthetic heat treatment and gives the novel sulfonic anion&#8208;pillared hybrid ultramicroporous material ZU&#8208;610a. It achieves the kinetic sieving of C2H2 and CO2 which have the same kinetic diameter. It produces C2H2 with purity higher than 99.5&#8201;% in only one adsorption process.







Abstract
The engineering and tailoring of porous materials to realize the precise discrimination of CO2 and C2H2, with almost identical kinetic diameters, is a challenging task. We herein report the first example of the kinetic&#8208;sieving of relatively larger molecule of C2H2 from CO2 by a novel sulfonic anion&#8208;pillared hybrid ultramicroporous materials of ZU&#8208;610a. Specifically, ZU&#8208;610 constructed from copper(II), isonicotinic acid and 1,2&#8208;ethanedisulfonic acid is synthesized and shows the preferential affinity for C2H2 over CO2. After the post&#8208;synthetic heat treatment of ZU&#8208;610, ZU&#8208;610a with a contracted aperture is obtained. Interestingly, the C2H2&#8208;selctive ZU&#8208;610 was reversed to the CO2&#8208;selective ZU&#8208;610a. High purity C2H2 (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) could be directly obtained from the dynamic breakthrough experiments on an equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixture at 298&#8197;K. This study provides guidance for the design of adsorbents aimed at separation systems with similar kinetic diameter.

         <title>Stereoretentive Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Allylation of Isoxazolinones by a Planar Chiral Palladacycle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric allylic substitutions usually display a pronounced preference for the formation of allylic substitution products with (E)&#8208;configured C=C double bonds as a result of &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd intermediates. A planar chiral palladacycle is shown to permit a catalytic asymmmetric allylation reaction maintaining the C=C double bond geometry of the allylic substrates in highly enantioenriched products.







Abstract
The catalytic allylic substitution is one of the most important tools in asymmetric synthesis to form C&#8722;C bonds in an enantioselective way. While high efficiency was previously accomplished in terms of enantio&#8208; and regiocontrol using different catalyst types, a strong general limitation is a very pronounced preference for the formation of allylic substitution products with (E)&#8208;configured C=C double bonds. Herein, we report that with a planar chiral palladacycle catalyst a diastereospecific reaction outcome is achieved using isoxazolinones and allylic imidates as substrates, thus maintaining the C=C double bond geometry of the allylic substrates in the highly enantioenriched products. DFT calculations show that the reactions proceed via an SN2 mechanism and not via &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd complexes. Crucial for the high control is the stabilization of the allylic fragment in the SN2 transition state by &#960;&#8208;interactions with the phenyl substituents of the pentaphenylferrocenyl catalyst core.

         <title>Ring&#8208;to&#8208;Thread Chirality Transfer in [2]Rotaxanes for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The base&#8208;promoted cyclization of N&#8208;(arylmethyl)fumaramide threads present in orientational mechanostereoisomers, which contain a single stereogenic center in the ring, allows the generation of enantioenriched lactams of different ring sizes as well as amino acids. The chiral information is effectively transmitted across the mechanical bond from the encircling ring to the new interlocked functionality.







Abstract
The synthesis of chiral mechanically interlocked molecules has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years, with applications in different fields, such as asymmetric catalysis or sensing. Herein we describe the synthesis of orientational mechanostereoisomers, which include a benzylic amide macrocycle with a stereogenic center, and nonsymmetric N&#8208;(arylmethyl)fumaramides as the axis. The base&#8208;promoted cyclization of the initial fumaramide thread allows enantioenriched value&#8208;added compounds, such as lactams of different ring sizes and amino acids, to be obtained. The chiral information is effectively transmitted across the mechanical bond from the encircling ring to the interlocked lactam. High levels of enantioselectivity and full control of the regioselectivity of the final cyclic compounds are attained.

         <title>Diastereoselective, Catalytic Access to Cross&#8208;Aldol Products Directly from Esters and Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique, catalytic method has been developed to directly access aldol&#8208;type products from esters and lactones. Using borane catalysis and transborylation as the turnover mechanism, syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;aldol&#8208;type products were selectively obtained in excellent yield and stereoselectivity across a range of functionalised substrates, including bioactive natural and unnatural products.







Abstract
High oxidation&#8208;state carbonyl coupling partners including esters and lactones were reacted with enones to give aldol&#8208;type products directly using two&#8208;fold organoborane catalysis. This new retrosynthetic disconnection to aldol&#8208;type products is compatible with enolisable coupling partners, without self&#8208;condensation, and couples the high reactivity of secondary dialkylboranes with the stability of pinacolboronic esters. Excellent chemoselectivity, substrate scope (including those containing reducible functionalities and free alcohols) and diastereocontrol were achieved to access both the syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;aldol&#8208;type products. Mechanistic studies confirmed the two&#8208;fold catalytic role of the single secondary borane catalyst for boron enolate formation and formation of an aldehyde surrogate from the ester or lactone coupling partner.

Mechanistic studies confirmed the two-fold catalytic role of the single secondary borane catalyst for boron enolate formation and formation of an aldehyde surrogate from the ester or lactone coupling partner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Bisbenzannulated Spiroketals and Spiroaminals by Ir/Ag/Acid Ternary Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cycloisomerization/asymmetric allylation/spiroketalization cascade reaction of o&#8208;alkynylacetophenones and (1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols enabled by Ir/Ag/acid ternary catalysis was developed, affording structurally diverse bisbenzannulated [6,6]&#8208;spiroketals in high efficiency with mostly high diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
We reported herein an iridium/silver/acid ternary catalytic system to access bisbenzannulated [6,6]&#8208;spiroketals in high efficiency with generally high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). In this procedure, readily available o&#8208;alkynylacetophenones undergo cycloisomerization to generate isochromenes in situ that participate in stereoselective allylation/spiroketalization sequence with 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols. Meanwhile, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines were also compatible in this cascade reaction, furnishing structurally novel bisbenzannulated [6,6]&#8208;spiroaminals with good diastereoselectivities (8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;12&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (98&#8201;%&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, experimental studies and theoretical calculations were performed to illustrate the reaction mechanism and stereochemistry.

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters in Non&#8208;Doped Electroluminescent Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
Thanks to aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect with restriction of intramolecular rotations principle, J&#8208;aggregate nature and large center&#8208;to&#8208;center distance in crystalline states, high external quantum efficiency of 9.44&#8201;% with emission peak at 711&#8197;nm were actualized in non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on 6&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;8&#8208;(4&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl(phenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;6H&#8208;indolo [2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile (T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD).







Abstract
Constructing organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials to confront the formidable barrier of &#8220;energy gap law&#8221; remains challenging. Herein, two NIR thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules named T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD and TIQD were developed by connecting N,N&#8208;diphenylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;amine and triphenylamine with a novel electron withdrawing unit 6&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6H&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile. It is confirmed NIR&#8208;TADF emitters concurrent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect, J&#8208;aggregate with intra&#8208; and intermolecular CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and large center&#8208;to&#8208;center distance in solid states can boost the emissive efficiencies both in thin films and non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Consequently, the T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD&#8208;based non&#8208;doped NIR&#8208;OLED achieved the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.44&#8201;% with emission peak at 711&#8197;nm, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for non&#8208;doped NIR&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Designing Quinone&#8208;Based Anodes with Rapid Kinetics for Rechargeable Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetramethylquinone (TMBQ) anode in acidic electrolyte exhibits high&#8208;rate capability (releases/stores 50&#8201;% theoretical capacity in 16&#8197;seconds) and fast kinetics, benefiting from continuous H+ migration channel, high proton diffusion coefficient (10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and low proton migration barrier of 0.26&#8197;eV. When coupling with MnO2 cathode, the aqueous proton battery shows high power density of 20&#8201;000&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and long cycle life of 4000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Quinone compounds, which are capable of accommodating proton (H+), are emerging electrodes in aqueous batteries. However, the storage mechanism of proton in quinone compounds is less known and the energy/power density of quinone&#8208;based proton battery is still limited. Here we design a series of quinone anodes and study their electrochemical properties in acidic electrolyte, in which tetramethylquinone (TMBQ) delivers a high capacity of 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with an extremely low polarization of 20&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;C, and maintains over 50&#8201;% theoretical capacity in less than 16&#8197;seconds. The fast kinetics of TMBQ is attributed to the continuous H+ migration channel, high H+ diffusion coefficient (10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1), and low H+ migration energy barrier (0.26&#8197;eV). When coupling with MnO2 cathode, the battery shows a long lifespan of 4000&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 77&#8201;% at 5&#8197;C. This study reveals the proton transport in quinone&#8208;electrodes and offers new insights to design advanced aqueous batteries.

         <title>Microenvironment Engineering for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the impact of the microenvironment, including the catalyst surface, substrate, co&#8208;reactants, electrolyte, membrane, and reactor, on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Different microenvironmental factors are discussed in the context of industrial applications, including coupling of CO2RR to carbon capture and conversion.







Abstract
Rather than just focusing on the catalyst itself in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), as previously reviewed elsewhere, we herein extend the discussion to the special topic of the microenvironment around the electrocatalytic center and present a comprehensive overview of recent research progress. We categorize the microenvironment based on the components relevant to electrocatalytic active sites, i.e., the catalyst surface, substrate, co&#8208;reactants, electrolyte, membrane, and reactor. Supported by most of the reported articles, the relevant factors affecting the catalytic performance of eCO2RR are then discussed in detail, and existing challenges and potential solutions are mentioned. Perspectives for the future research on eCO2RR, including the integration of different microenvironment factors, the extension to industrial application by coupling with carbon capture and conversion, and separation of products, are also discussed.

         <title>Semiconducting Copolymers with Naphthalene Imide/Amide &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Units: Synthesis, Crystallography, and Systematic Structure&#8208;Property&#8208;Mobility Correlations</title>

The effects of electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl (C=O) group deletion on the naphthaleneimide unit from 4C=O in NDI to 3C=O in NBL to 2C=O in NBA on charge transport and structure&#8208;property correlations are systematically investigated.







Abstract
In a series of n&#8208;type semiconducting naphthalene tetracarboxydiimide (NDI)&#8208;dithiophene (T2) copolymers, structural and electronic properties trends are systematically evaluated as the number of NDI carbonyl groups is reduced from 4 in NDI to 3 in NBL (1&#8208;amino&#8208;4,5&#8208;8&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;tricarboxylic acid&#8208;1,8&#8208;lactam&#8208;4,5&#8208;imide) to 2 in NBA (naphthalene&#8208;bis(4,8&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,5&#8208;dicarboxyl)&#8208;amide). As the NDI&#8208;T2 backbone torsional angle falls the LUMO energy rises. However, the thienyl attachment regiochemistry also plays an important role in less symmetric NBL and NBA. Electron mobility is greatest for N2200 (0.17&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) followed by PNBL&#8208;3,8&#8208;T2 and PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 (0.11&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in PNBL&#8208;4,8&#8208;T2, and negligible in PNBA&#8208;3,7&#8208;T2. Charge transport reflects a delicate balance between electronic backbone communication (optimum for N2200 and PNBL&#8208;4,8&#8208;T2), backbone planarity (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 and PNBL&#8208;3,8&#8208;T2), LUMO energy (optimum for N2200), &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2), and film crystallinity (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 and N2200). These results offer generalizable insight into semiconducting copolymer design.

         <title>Structure of a Promiscuous Thioesterase Domain Responsible for Branching Acylation in Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The OocS branching thioesterase (TEB) catalyzes promiscuous O&#8208;acylation of polyketides. Structural analysis of the TEB domain facilitated engineering to modulate reactivity and acyl&#8208;group acceptance.







Abstract
Thioesterases (TEs) are fundamentally important enzymes present in all bacteria and eukaryotes, where they have conserved functions in fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary metabolism. This work provides the first structural insights into a functionally distinct group of TEs that perform diverse acylations in polyketide and peptide biosynthesis (TEBs). Structural analysis of the oocydin (OocS) TEB domain facilitated identification and engineering of the active site to modulate acyl&#8208;group acceptance. In this way, we achieved higher reactivity using a structure&#8208;based approach, building a foundation for biocatalytic development of TEB&#8208;mediated O&#8208;acylation, a modification known to improve the bioactivity of oocydin&#8208;type polyketides. Lastly, the promiscuity of the OocS TEB motivated us to investigate, and ultimately provide evidence for, the production of longer chain branched oocydins in the native host Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13. This work frames the OocS TEB and homologs as invaluable synthetic biology tools for polyketide drug development.

         <title>Discovery of the First Selective Nanomolar Inhibitors of ERAP2 by Kinetic Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis and optimisation led to the first nanomolar ERAP2 inhibitors with outstanding selectivity. The binding modes of the most potent inhibitors were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Our frontrunners engage target in cells and display good in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties.







Abstract
Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) is a key enzyme involved in the trimming of antigenic peptides presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I. It is a target of growing interest for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and in cancer immunotherapy. However, the discovery of potent and selective ERAP2 inhibitors is highly challenging. Herein, we have used kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) to identify such inhibitors. Co&#8208;crystallization experiments revealed the binding mode of three different inhibitors with increasing potency and selectivity over related enzymes. Selected analogues engage ERAP2 in cells and inhibit antigen presentation in a cellular context. 4&#8201;d (BDM88951) displays favorable in vitro ADME properties and in vivo exposure. In summary, KTGS allowed the discovery of the first nanomolar and selective highly promising ERAP2 inhibitors that pave the way of the exploration of the biological roles of this enzyme and provide lead compounds for drug discovery efforts.

         <title>Repetitive Thiazolidine Deprotection Using a Thioester&#8208;Compatible Aldehyde Scavenger for One&#8208;Pot Multiple Peptide Ligation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;pot sequential peptide ligation strategy using N&#8208;terminal thiazolidine peptides and a newly designed 2&#8208;aminobenzamide&#8208;based aldehyde scavenger is reported. The scavenger efficiently deprotected the thiazolidine group at pH&#8197;4.0 but not at pH&#8197;7.5 of the ligation condition, and showed sufficient compatibility with the thioester. The pH&#8208;controlled one&#8208;pot assembly of four peptide segments allowed us to accomplish the total chemical synthesis of Arabidopsis monoubiquitinated histone H2A.Z (209 amino acids, 23&#8197;kD).







Abstract
Strategies for one&#8208;pot peptide ligation enable chemists to access synthetic proteins at a high yield in a short time. Herein, we report a novel one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;segments ligation strategy using N&#8208;terminal thiazolidine (Thz) peptide and a newly designed formaldehyde scavenger. Among the designed 2&#8208;aminobenzamide&#8208;based aldehyde scavengers, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylbenzohydrazide (AMDBH) can remarkably convert Thz into unprotected cysteine at pH&#8197;4.0. Furthermore, AMDBH degrades Thz at a considerably low rate at pH&#8197;7.5, and thioester degradation caused by this scavenger is negligible. As a result, we have developed an efficient one&#8208;pot peptide ligation strategy by simply repetitively changing the pH with AMDBH. Finally, we synthesize mono&#8208;ubiquitinated histone H2A.Z (209 amino acids) via AMDBH&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot four&#8208;segment peptide ligation in good yield.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Barium Hydride Mediates Dinitrogen Fixation and Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free barium hydride has been demonstrated to mediate nitrogen fixation and ammonia synthesis via a chemical looping route. The creation of hydrogen vacancies plays a crucial role in the activation and hydrogenation of N2 to NH3.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated dinitrogen fixation has been intensively investigated. The employment of main group elements for this vital reaction has recently sparked interest because of new dinitrogen reaction chemistry. We report ammonia synthesis via a chemical looping process mediated by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free barium hydride (BaH2). Experimental and computational studies reveal that the introduction of hydrogen vacancies is essential for creating multiple coordinatively unsaturated Ba sites for N2 activation. The adjacent lattice hydridic hydrogen (H&#8722;) then undergoes both reductive elimination and reductive protonation to convert N2 to NHx. The ammonia production rate supports this hydride&#8208;vacancy mechanism via a chemical looping route that far exceeds that of a catalytic process. The BaH2&#8208;mediated chemical looping process has prospects in future technologies for ammonia synthesis using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials.

         <title>Momomycin, an Antiproliferative Cryptic Metabolite from the Oxytetracycline Producer Streptomyces rimosus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial producers of pharmaceuticals still code for dozens of yet&#8208;to&#8208;be identified natural products. Herein, three groups of cryptic metabolites were uncovered from Streptomyces rimosus, the industrial producer of oxytetracycline, using high&#8208;throughput elicitor screening, notably momomycin, a novel cyclic peptide with antiproliferative properties.







Abstract
Natural products provide an important source of pharmaceuticals and chemical tools. Traditionally, assessment of unexplored microbial phyla has led to new natural products. However, with every new microbe, the number of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) grows. As such, the more difficult proposition is finding new molecules from well&#8208;studied strains. Herein, we targeted Streptomyces rimosus, the widely&#8208;used oxytetracycline producer, for the discovery of new natural products. Using MALDI&#8208;MS&#8208;guided high&#8208;throughput elicitor screening (HiTES), we mapped the global secondary metabolome of S.&#8197;rimosus and structurally characterized products of three cryptic BGCs, including momomycin, an unusual cyclic peptide natural product with backbone modifications and several non&#8208;canonical amino acids. We elucidated important aspects of its biosynthesis and evaluated its bioactivity. Our studies showcase HiTES as an effective approach for unearthing new chemical matter from &#8220;drained&#8221; strains.

         <title>Identifying and Differentiating Topological G&#8208;Quadruplex Structures with DNA&#8208;Encoded Plasmonic Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures are resolved with a DNA&#8208;encoded nanoparticle growth strategy. In this method, through monitoring the UV/Vis extinction of plasmonic gold nanoparticles grown in the presence of G4s, both topological structures and nucleotide residues within G4 DNA, are identified and differentiated.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified as critical elements in modulating genomic functions and many other biological processes. Their functions are highly dependent on the primary nucleotides and secondary folding structures. Therefore, to understand their functions, methods to identify and differentiate structures of G4 with speed and accuracy are required but limited. In this report, we have applied a synthetic G4 DNA&#8208;encoded nanoparticle approach to identify and differentiate G4 DNA molecules with different topologies and nucleotide residues. We found that the resulting plasmonic properties of the gold nanoparticles, monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy, are quite sensitive to different G4 structures, including stacking layers, loop sequences, capping bases on G4s, and topological structures. Through these systematic investigations, we demonstrate that this G4&#8208;encoded gold nanoparticle approach can be used to profile the G4 structures and distinguish G4s from human telomeres. Such a method may have wide applications in G4 research.

         <title>Encoding Supramolecular Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly with Photo&#8208;Controlled Circularly Polarized Luminescence by Overcrowded Alkene&#8208;Based Bis&#8208;PBI Modulators</title>

         <dc:description>
Two chiral overcrowded alkene&#8208;based modulators were designed, which self&#8208;assembled into &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking nanofibers, inducing opposite circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) through the amplification of intrinsically molecular chirality. Upon UV light irradiation, a transformation from nanofibers to nanospheres resulted in a gradual decrease in CPL signal, providing a photo&#8208;controllable CPL system.







Abstract
Developing photoresponsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials is an essential step for biosensing and biomedical applications. However, fabricating CPL assemblies rooted in the chirality amplification and transmission of the molecular building blocks, which simultaneously show photo&#8208;controllable CPL signals, remains challenging. Herein, a molecular building block containing an overcrowded&#8208;alkene core and bis&#8208;PBI (MPBI) was designed. Importantly, the enantiopure MPBI can self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;organized nanofibers via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions and enable the transmission of the intrinsic chirality, providing opposite CPL signals. The photoisomerization of MPBI induced a transformation from nanofibers to discrete nanospheres, accompanied by a gradually decreased CPL signal. The results demonstrated the development of photo&#8208;controllable CPL materials from the assembly of chiral MPBI, which provides an alternatively facile strategy to fabricate CPL&#8208;active materials and would offer opportunities for future biosensing and biomedical applications.

         <title>Calcination&#8208;regulated Microstructures of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymers towards Enhanced and Stable Photocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous nanorod&#8208;like donor&#8208;acceptor polymer with efficient and stable photocatalytic activity of H2O2 production in pure water is synthesized via a simple strategy of supramolecular chemistry combined with subsequent calcination treatment. The excellent performance could be attributed to the achievement of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction and two&#8208;electron water oxidation and the improvement of exciton splitting, O2 adsorption and activation.







Abstract
Regulating molecular structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymer is a promising strategy to improve photoactivity. Herein, a porous nanorod&#8208;like D&#8208;A polymer is synthesized via a strategy of supramolecular chemistry combined with subsequent calcination treatment. This polymer consists of benzene rings (D) and triazine (A) that are linked by amido bond (&#8722;CONH&#8722;). &#8722;CONH&#8722; further partially cracks into cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) (A) under calcination. The ratio of benzene to triazine could be tuned to adjust the &#8722;C&#8801;N content by varying the calcination atmosphere. Such regulation of molecular structure could modulate the band structure of D&#8208;A polymer and endow it with unique porous nanorod&#8208;like morphology, leading to the achievement of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction and two&#8208;electron water oxidation and the improvement of exciton splitting, O2 adsorption and activation. These merits synergistically ensure a highly efficient and stable photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water.

         <title>Enantioselective oxa&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Sequences of Dendralenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of target&#8208;relevant oxabicyclic systems is reported. The synthesis involves a sequence of two formal oxa&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions between a wide variety of achiral dendralenes and a carbonyl dienophile, proceeding with the generation of two new rings, four new covalent bonds and up to four new stereocenters.







Abstract
Diene&#8208;transmissive hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder sequences involving carbonyl dienophiles are reported for the first time. High enantioselectivities are achieved in the reaction of phenylglyoxal with a broad range of dendralene structures, through the optimization of a Pd2+ catalyst system. The initial catalyst&#8208;controlled enantioselective oxa&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (ODA) cycloaddition to a [3]dendralene generates a dihydropyran carrying a semicyclic diene. This participates in a subsequent catalyst or substrate&#8208;controlled Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to generate sp3&#8208;rich fused polycyclic systems containing both heterocycles and carbocycles. Computational investigations reveal a concerted asynchronous mechanism. &#960;&#8208;Complexation of a diene C=C bond to Pd2+ occurs in both the pre&#8208;transition state (TS) complex and in cycloaddition TSs, controlling stereoselectivity. A formal enantioselective [4+2]cycloaddition of a CO2 dienophile is demonstrated.

         <title>The N&#949;&#8208;Rule for Serine, but Not Cysteine Catalytic Triads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic triads, made from a serine or cysteine nucleophile, a histidine and a third triad residue (typically Asp/Glu/Asn), are common in enzyme active sites and catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions. Two types of triads can be distinguished: we refer to them as N&#948;&#8208; or N&#949;&#8208;configured, depending on whether the histidine imidazole N&#948; or N&#949; is close to the nucleophile O&#947;/S&#947;. In this work, we have analyzed triad configuration. In structural triads, the more stable N&#948;&#8208;configuration predominates. For catalytic triads, configuration depends on the nucleophile. When it is a cysteine, both configuration types occur, depending on the family. However, when the nucleophile is a serine, the less stable N&#949;&#8209;configuration is almost exclusively found. We posit that the energetically less favored conformation is selected in serine triads for facilitating the otherwise difficult proton transfer from the nucleophile to the histidine.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Chemistry Induced Long&#8208;Cycle Air Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air self&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries usually suffer from capacity loss after self&#8208;charging cycles due to the formation of  basic salts  on cathodes in the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. Here, air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries based on proton chemistry are developed in acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of H  +  uptake/removal endows the battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. Owing to the high standard electrode potential of oxygen in acid electrolyte, the discharged cathodes are spontaneously oxidized by oxygen in air along with H  +  extraction and thus achieve self&#8208;charging without external power supply. Notably, the air self&#8208;charging mechanism involved H  +  &#8208;based redox can effectively avoid the generation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrodes and thus guarantee long&#8208;term self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging cycles of Pb/PTO batteries. This work provides a promising strategy for designing long&#8208;cycle air self&#8208;charging systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Overlooked Photochemical Decomposition of Atmospheric Surface Nitrates Triggered by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitrogen oxides (NOx) formed by photochemical process of surface nitrates raise significant concerns. However, little is known about the effect of visible light (&gt; 380 nm) on nitrate decomposition and the reaction mechanism. Here, the decomposition of surface nitrates is investigated under visible light. The results indicate that visible light photocatalysis contributes significantly to nitrate decomposition. Monodentate nitrate (m&#8208;NO  3  &#8208;  ) can be decomposed into NOx by photogenerated electrons starting from the weakly coordinated N&#8208;O bond. Water vapor promotes NOx generation because more stable bidentate nitrate (b&#8208;NO  3  &#8208;  ) will be converted to m&#8208;NO  3  &#8208;  by surface hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonding interaction. Alternatively, b&#8208;NO  3  &#8208;  can be directly decomposed to NO  2  &#8208;  by NO attack, but this process is subject to photocatalytic oxidation. This work brings a new consideration to the atmospheric NOx sources and provides a more nuanced understanding of nitrates decomposition processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pas de Deux of an NO Couple: Synchronous Photoswitching from a Double&#8208;Linear to a Double&#8208;Bent Ru(NO)2 Core under Nitrosyl Charge Conservation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The {Ru(NO)  2  }  10  dinitrosylruthenium complex [Ru(NO)  2  (PPh  3  )  2  ] (  1  ) shows photo&#8208;induced linkage isomerism (PLI) of a special kind: the two NO ligands switch, on photo&#8208;excitation, synchronously from the ground state (GS) with two almost linear RuNO functions to a metastable state (MS) which persists up to 230 K and can be populated to &#8776; 50%. The MS was experimentally characterised by photo&#8208;crystallography, IR spectroscopy and DS&#8208;calorimetry as a double&#8208;bent variant of the double&#8208;linear GS. The experimental results are confirmed by computation which unravels the GS/MS transition as a disrotatory synchronous 50&#176; turn of the two nitrosyl ligands. Although  1  shows the usual redshift of the N&#8211;O stretch on bending the MNO unit, there is no increased charge transfer from Ru to NO along the GS&#8208;to&#8208;MS path. In terms of the effective&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state (EOS) method, both isomers of  1  and the transition state are Ru  &#8722;II  (NO  +  )  2  species.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks photocatalysts with   different building units&#160;, TPB&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF and TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF, for photo&#8208;induced energy transfer reversible complexation&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (PET&#8208;RCMP) were developed and investigated,  producing ideal polymers with accura  te molecular weight an  d  moderate  dispersity under visible light irradiation.  The chain extension  and spatiotemporal control experiments reve  aled the  high chain&#8208;end fidelity  of polymers and the compatibility of RCMP processes in both bulk and aqueous system.

         <title>Scaling Catalytic Contributions of Small Self&#8208;Cleaving Ribozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleolytic ribozymes utilize general acid&#8208;base catalysis to perform phosphodiester cleavage. In most ribozyme classes, a conserved active site guanosine is positioned to act as general base, thereby activating the 2'&#8208;OH group to attack the scissile phosphate (&#947;&#8208;catalysis). Here, we present an atomic mutagenesis study for the pistol ribozyme class. Strikingly, "general base knockout" by replacement of the guanine N1 atom by carbon results in only 2.7&#8208;fold decreased rate. Therefore, the common view that &#947;&#8208;catalysis critically depends on the N1 moiety becomes challenged. For pistol ribozymes we found that &#947;&#8208;catalysis is subordinate in overall catalysis, made up by two other catalytic factors (&#945; and &#948;). Our approach allows scaling of the different catalytic contributions (&#945;, &#223;, &#947;, &#948;) with unprecedented precision and paves the way for a thorough mechanistic understanding of nucleolytic ribozymes with active site guanines.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Directed Reversal of 13C NMR Chemical Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deshielding or downfield  13  C NMR chemical shift of amide carbonyl carbon upon H&#8208;bonding is a widely observed phenomenon. This downfield shift is commonly used as a spectroscopic ruler for H&#8208;bonding. However, the very first observation of the upfield  13  C NMR of thiocarbonyl carbon in thioamides upon H&#8208;bonding encouraged us to explore the physical origin of the reversal of  13  C NMR chemical shielding. Careful NMR analysis shows that sulfur and selenium&#8208;centered H&#8208;bonds (S/SeCHBs) induce the shielding effect on the  13  C  C=S(Se)  while changing from amides to thioamides or selenoamides. In addition, the natural chemical shielding (NCS) analysis shows that the &#963;  11  and &#963;  22  components of the isotropic shielding tensor (&#963;) have the dominant role for this unusual upfield shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization of Protein&#8208;Specific Glycation in Living Cells via Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the lack of suitable chemical tools, probing the   protein  &#8208;specific glycation is highly challenging. Herein, we present a strategy based on  glycation chemical reporter  and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation in living cells. We first developed a bioorthogonal glucose analogue, 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (  6AzGlc  ), as a novel glycation chemical reporter. Two types of DNA probes, glycation conversion probe and protein targeting probe, were designed to attach to glycation adducts and target proteins, respectively. After the protein was glycated by  6AzGlc  , two DNA probes were sequentially applied to the target protein, triggering proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout. This strategy was successfully used to  visualize glucose glycation  of several proteins, including PD&#8208;L1 and integrin.  More importantly, this strategy allowed us to  analyze corresponding biological functions of glycated protein in the native environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for Concise Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Salinosporamide Family of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our first strategy for rapidly accessing pyrrolidinone cores of salinosporamides involved combined use of memory of chirality and dynamic kinetic resolution principles in aldol reactions of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone substrate, which was ultimately unsuccessful with respect to enantioselectivity. This failure led us to the revised strategy. The influence of the stereocenter in 5&#8208;oxazolidinone enabled selective installation of the C&#8208;2 stereocenter. The intramolecular aldol reaction of the C&#8208;2 stereodefined aldol substrate was successful. An unexpected hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was observed in hydrolyses of the bicyclic aldol products. This unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was utilized in preparing the pyrrolidinone core with excellent efficiency. Through this strategy, the concise total syntheses of salinosporamides A and B as well as cinnabaramides A, E, and F were achieved with high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidentate Chelation Heals Structural Imperfections for Minimized Recombination Loss in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8208;PSCs) have emerged as the promising environmentally viable photovoltaic technologies, but still suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative recombination loss due to the presence of abundant deep&#8208;level defects in perovskite film and under&#8208;optimized carrier dynamics throughout the device. Herein, we healed the structural imperfections of Sn perovskites in an &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; manner by incorporating a new class of biocompatible chelating agent with multidentate claws, namely, 2&#8208;Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), which synergistically passivated a variety of deep&#8208;level Sn&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects, cooperatively reinforced the passivation efficacy, released the lattice strain, improved the structural toughness, and promoted the carrier transport of Sn perovskites. Encouragingly, a champion efficiency of 13.7% with a small voltage deficit of ~0.47 V has been achieved for the GAA&#8208;modified Sn&#8208;PSCs. GAA modification also extended the lifespan of Sn&#8208;PSCs over 1200 hours.</dc:description>

At high temperatures, the "latent" inimer is converted to a "real" inimer after releasing maleimide (MI) via a retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (r&#8208;DA) reaction and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylate by self&#8208;condensing vinyl copolymerization. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the r&#8208;DA reaction, the release of naked MI and the subsequent copolymerization can be regulated by the temperature or stereochemistry of Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) adducts. Thus, the &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of HBPs with various degrees of branching was achieved. By further implementation of a programmable temperature change, some valuable hyperbranched topologies such as star&#8208;shaped and long&#8208;chain hyperbranched polymers can be constructed avoiding sophisticated synthetic routes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Diverse Multicomponent Hierarchical Nanostructures from Mixed&#8208;Graft Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent nanostructured materials assembled from molecular building blocks received wide attention due to their precisely integrated multifunctionalities. However, discovery of these materials with desirable composition and morphology was limited by their low synthetic scalability and narrow structural tuning window with given building blocks. Here, we report a scalable and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach to hierarchically structured nanomaterials based on a few readily accessible building blocks. Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were prepared through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of three or four types of macromonomers. Intramolecularly defined interfaces promoted the formation of ordered hierarchical structures with lattice sizes tunable across multiple length scales. The same set of macromonomers were arranged and combined in different ways, providing access to diverse morphologies in the resultant structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenation of Ammonia Borane by Platinum&#8208;&#8208;Nickel Dimers: Regulation of the Heteroatom Interspace Boosts Bifunctional Synergetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of the atom&#8208;atom interspaces of dual&#8208;atom catalysts is essential to optimize the dual&#8208;atom synergy to achieve high activity but remains challenging. Herein, we report an effective strategy to regulate the Pt  1  &#8208;Ni  1  interspace to achieve Pt  1  Ni  1  dimers and Pt  1  +Ni  1  heteronuclear dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (HDSACs) by tailoring steric hindrance between metal precursors during synthesis. Spectroscopic characterization reveals obvious electron transfers in Pt  1  Ni  1  oxo dimers but not in Pt  1  +Ni  1  HDSAC. In the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB), the H  2  formation rates show an inverse proportion to the Pt  1  &#8208;Ni  1  interspace. The rate of Pt  1  Ni  1  dimers is ~13 and 2 times higher than those of Pt  1  and Pt  1  +Ni  1  HDSAC, manifesting the interspace&#8208;dependent synergy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the bridging OH group in Pt  1  Ni  1  dimers promotes water dissociation, while Pt  1  facilitates the cleavage of B&#8208;H bonds in AB, which boosts a bifunctional synergy to accelerate H  2  production cooperatively</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delay Fluorescence Materials Based on Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole with an Efficient Narrowband Pure&#8208;Green Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (VTCzBN and TCz&#8208;VTCzBN) based on indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit and boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons, whose emissions peaking at 496 and 521 nm with full width at half maximum of 34 and 29 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, fast rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing of above 106  s&#8208;1  are obtained due to small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and large spin&#8208;orbital coupling values. Notably, planar molecular structures along the transition dipole moment direction endow them with high horizontal emitting dipole ratios of up to 94%. Consequently, the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show the maximum external quantum efficiencies of 31.7% and 32.2%, respectively. Particularly, OLED with TCz&#8208;VTCzBN display ultra&#8208;pure green emission with Commission Internationale de l&#180;Eclairage coordinates of (0.22, 0.71), consistent with the green display standard of the National Television System Committee.</dc:description>

         <title>Fano Resonance in Single&#8208;molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Fano resonance in single&#8208;molecule junctions could be created by interaction with discrete and continuous molecular orbitals and enables effective electron transport modulation between constructive and destructive interference within a small energy range. However, direct observation of Fano resonance remains unexplored because of the disappearance of discrete orbitals by molecule&#8208;electrode coupling. We demonstrated the room&#8208;temperature observation of Fano resonance from electrochemical gated single&#8208;molecule conductance and current&#8208;voltage measurements of a  para  &#8208;carbazole anion junction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the negative charge on the nitrogen atom induces a localized HOMO on the molecular center, creating Fano resonance by interfering with the delocalized LUMO on the molecular backbone. Our findings demonstrate that the Fano resonance in electron transport through single&#8208;molecule junctions opens pathways for designs of interference&#8208;based electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Aza&#8208;Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of apoptosis inhibition proteins renders the cancer cells resistant to apoptosis, severely compromising the antitumor efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Here, an intelligent anticancer nanoplatform based on an Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dye (denoted as Aza&#8208;BDY) is elaborately established for ferroptosis augmented SDT through cysteine (Cys) starvation. After endocytosis by tumor cells, Aza&#8208;BDY serves as both a ferroptosis inducing agent and a sonosensitizer for tumor treatment. The specific Cys response facilitates the disruption of redox homeostasis and initiation of cellular ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the released sonosensitizer causes efficient SDT and augments ferroptosis under ultrasound irradiation. Detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cys depletion and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation significantly induces cancer&#8208;cell death and suppresses tumor proliferation with a high inhibition rate of 97.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed Aromatic Tubes&#160;&#8208;&#160;Capsularenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we describe a synthetic method for incorporating arenes into closed tubes that we name&#160;capsularenes. First, we prepared vase&#8208;shaped molecular baskets&#160;4&#8208;7.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we describe a synthetic method for incorporating arenes into closed tubes that we name&#160;capsularenes. First, we prepared vase-shaped molecular baskets&#160;4-7. The baskets comprise&#160;a benzene base fused to three bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane rings&#160;that extend into phthalimide (4), naphthalimide (6), and anthraceneimide sides (7), each carrying a dimethoxyethane acetal group. In the presence of catalytic trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the acetals at top of&#160;4,&#160;6and&#160;7&#160;change into aliphatic aldehydes followed by their intramolecular cyclization into 1,3,5-trioxane (1H NMR spectroscopy). Such ring closure is nearly a quantitative process that furnishes differently sized&#160;capsularenes&#160;1&#160;(0.7 x 0.9 nm),&#160;8&#160;(0.7 x 1.1 nm;) and&#160;9&#160;(0.7 x 1.4 nm;) characterized by X-Ray crystallography, microcrystal electron diffraction, UV-Vis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, and thermogravimetry.

         <title>Elucidating CO2 Hydrogenation over In2O3 Nanoparticles using Operando UV/Vis and Impedance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 activation over In2O3 nanoparticle catalysts is consistent with redox processes, including oxidation by CO2 as the rate&#8208;determining step, whereby hydrogen&#8208;containing surface species are shown to exhibit a promoting effect. Besides surface processes, subsurface/bulk dynamics are shown to be essential for the activity in reverse water gas&#8208;shift reaction, as revealed by operando UV/Vis and impedance spectroscopies.







Abstract
In2O3 has emerged as a promising catalyst for CO2 activation, but a fundamental understanding of its mode of operation in CO2 hydrogenation is still missing, as the application of operando vibrational spectroscopy is challenging due to absorption effects. In this mechanistic study, we systematically address the redox processes related to the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction (rWGSR) over In2O3 nanoparticles, both at the surface and in the bulk. Based on temperature&#8208;dependent operando UV/Vis spectra and a novel operando impedance approach for thermal powder catalysts, we propose oxidation by CO2 as the rate&#8208;determining step for the rWGSR. The results are consistent with redox processes, whereby hydrogen&#8208;containing surface species are shown to exhibit a promoting effect. Our findings demonstrate that oxygen/hydrogen dynamics, in addition to surface processes, are important for the activity, which is expected to be of relevance not only for In2O3 but also for other reducible oxide catalysts.

         <title>Thermally Stable D2h Symmetric Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Donor Porphyrins as Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New D2h symmetric porphyrin hole&#8208;transporting materials were synthesized for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. The best device based on MDA4 with two diphenylamino group directly attached to the porphyrin core exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 22.67&#8201;% (certified value of 22.19&#8201;%) with exceptional thermal stability. The novel strategy paves the way for efficient and stable PSCs with porphyrin HTMs.







Abstract
A series of new D2h symmetric porphyrins (MDA4, MTA4, and MDA8) with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor structures have been synthesized as the hole&#8208;transporting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The novel porphyrin molecules feature a D2h symmetrically substituted ZnII porphyrin core and two kinds of donor systems (diarylamine (DAA) and triarylamine (TAA)), which can regulate energy level, increase thermal stability, solubility, and hydrophobicity via long alkoxyl chains. PSC devices based on MDA4 as the HTM showed impressive power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.67&#8201;% under AM1.5G solar illumination. Notably, the device was sent for certification, and a PCE of 22.19&#8201;% was reported, representing the highest PCE from porphyrin&#8208;based HTMs. Furthermore, the MDA4&#8208;based PSCs showed excellent thermal stability under 60&#8201;&#176;C and RH 60&#8201;% and preserved 88&#8201;% of initial performance after 360&#8197;hours. The strategy opens a new avenue for developing efficient and stable porphyrin HTMs for PSCs.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Construction of Vicinal All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters via Iridium/Europium Bimetallic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Ir/Eu dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction has been developed by makig use of challenging trisubstituted allylic esters and nucleophilic C3&#8208;substituted oxindole derivatives. A variety of allylated products bearing vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters could be obtained in good yields with high to excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective construction of vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters is a formidable task. We here report a synergistic bimetallic catalysis via a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;europium (Eu) complex and a phosphoramidite&#8208;iridium (Ir) catalyst for the asymmetric allylation of oxindole derivatives by using challenging trisubstituted allylic esters. The allylated products bearing vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters were obtained with good diastereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Control experiments showed that the complementary diastereomers of the products were not accessible by the change of the stereochemistry of the chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide ligand.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Cyapho(dicyano)methanide Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the synthesis of the cyapho(dicyano)methanide ion, [C(CN)2(CP)]&#8722;, by reaction of sodium phosphanide with (EtO)2C=C(CN)2. This species can be readily protonated at the methanide carbon atom to afford the parent acid, HC(CN)2(CP), which readily decomposes at room temperature. The reactivity of the cyaphide moiety was also probed by reaction with nucleophiles and in cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of a cyapho(dicyano)methanide salt, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][C(CN)2(CP)], from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH2] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6=1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with 1,1&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;dicyanoethylene (EtO)2C=C(CN)2. The reaction proceeds through a Michael addition&#8208;elimination pathway to afford [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][HP{C(OEt)=C(CN)2}]. Addition of a strong, non&#8208;nucleophilic base (KHMDS) to this intermediate results in the formation of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][C(CN)2(CP)]. Subsequent reactivity studies reveal that the cyapho(dicyano)methanide ion is susceptible to protonation with strong acids to afford the parent acid HC(CN)2(CP). The reactivity of the cyaphide moiety in [C(CN)2(CP)]&#8722; was explored through coordination to metal centers and in cycloaddition reactions with azides.

         <title>Photoinduced Persistent Polarization Change in a Spin Transition Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced persistent polarization change was achieved in an ionic FeII spin&#8208;crossover complex by combining the light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping effect (LIESST) and macroscopic polarization. The pyroelectric current is detected at a crystal level when the light&#8208;induced metastable state returns to the ground state. This study provides a platform for the development of optoelectric materials.







Abstract
Using light as a local heat source to induce a temporary pyroelectric current is widely recognized as an effective way to control the polarization of crystalline materials. In contrast, harnessing light directly to modulate the polarization of a crystal via excitation of the electronic bands remains less explored. In this study, we report an FeII spin crossover crystal that exhibits photoinduced macroscopic polarization change upon excitation by green light. When the excited crystal relaxes to the ground state, the corresponding pyroelectric current can be detected. An analysis of the structures, magnetic properties and the M&#246;ssbauer and infrared spectra of the complex, supported by calculations, revealed that the polarization change is dictated by the directional relative movement of ions during the spin transition process. The spin transition and polarization change occur simultaneously in response to light stimulus, which demonstrates the enormous potential of polar spin crossover systems in the field of optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Encoding Morphogenesis of Quasi&#8208;Triangular Gold Nanoprisms with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, thiol&#8208;DNA (HS&#8208;DNA) is employed to protect transient quasi&#8208;nanoprisms, so as to improve their stability in different microenvironments and facilitate the study of their plasmonic properties. These quasi&#8208;nanoprisms&#8208;DNA complexes can not only form the user&#8208;defined programmable self&#8208;assembly structures but act as microplatforms to encode and decode barcode&#8208;like orthogonal information, which extends their applications in nanophotonics.







Abstract
Properties of gold nanoparticles vary with their morphologies. Typically, the research on the properties and applications of the nonequilibrium intermediates generated by the morphological evolution of triangular gold nanoprisms is still incomplete. Herein, we employ thiol&#8208;DNA (HS&#8208;DNA) to protect the low&#8208;stability quasi&#8208;nanoprisms with different truncation degrees (R values). The presence of HS&#8208;DNA not only increases the stability of the quasi&#8208;nanoprisms in different microenvironments, but also facilitates us to investigate their intrinsic plasmonic properties related to morphology. Additionally, we serve quasi&#8208;nanoprisms loaded with HS&#8208;DNA as assembly modules and nanoplatforms for programmable self&#8208;assembly higher&#8208;order hybrid structures, as well as carriers for encoding and decoding of orthogonal barcode&#8208;like information, which opens new opportunities for developing novel building blocks for light manipulation at nanoscale.

         <title>Chirality Induction on a Coordination Capsule for Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimeric structures composed of acetic acid and tartaric acid derivatives inside a molecular capsule have been realized. Substituents on the tartaric acid derivatives allowed conveyance of chirality to the capsule, resulting in the enrichment of one of the diastereomers. The chirality&#8208;enriched capsule biased the dynamic axial chirality of a guest carrying benzothiadiazole arms, allowing it to emit circularly polarized luminescence in the near infrared region.







Abstract
By utilizing a confined space inside a coordination capsule consisting of achiral components, we achieve trimeric structures composed of acetic acid and 2,3&#8208;disubstituted tartaric acid derivatives. Steric and electronic interactions between the substituents on the tartaric acid and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl arms of the capsule permit the transfer of the chirality of the tartaric acid to the capsule, resulting in diastereoenrichment of the host&#8208;guest complexes of up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;de. The chiral templates can be washed away with diethyl ether, leaving an enantiomerically enriched capsule. The resulting capsule biases the dynamic axial chirality of a 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl guest carrying benzothiadiazole units, demonstrating guest&#8208;to&#8208;capsule and capsule&#8208;to&#8208;guest chirality transfer. The induced chirality on the bound guest enables it to emit circularly polarized luminescence in the NIR region, demonstrating the application of induced chirality for confined spaces for the generation of chiroptical properties.

         <title>Halogen Atom Participation in Guiding the Stereochemical Outcomes of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>Acetal substitution reactions of &#945;&#8208;halogenated five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings can be highly stereoselective. Erosion of stereoselectivity occurs as nucleophilicity increases, which is consistent with additions to a halogen&#8208;stabilized oxocarbenium ion, not a three&#8208;membered&#8208;ring halonium ion. Computational investigations confirmed that the open&#8208;form oxocarbenium ions are the reactive intermediates involved. Kinetic studies suggest that hyperconjugative effects and through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions can both contribute to the stabilization of halogen&#8208;substituted oxocarbenium ions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have experienced great success in assembling narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of MR&#8208;emitters (103&#8208;105 s&#8208;1) that will lead to severe device efficiency roll&#8208;off has received extensive attention and remains a challenging issue. Herein, we put forward a "space&#8208;confined donor&#8208;acceptor (SCDA)" strategy to accelerate RISC process. The introduction of SCDA units onto the MR&#8208;skeleton induces intermediate triplet states, which leads to a multichannel RISC process and thus increases kRISC. As illustrated examples, efficient MR&#8208;emitters have been developed with a sub&#8208;microsecond delayed lifetime and a high kRISC of 2.13 &#215; 106 s&#8208;1, which enables to assemble high&#8208;performance OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) as high as 32.5% and an alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 22.9%).</dc:description>

         <title>Missing&#8208;linker Defects in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ordered channels and free organic groups hold great promise in molecular separations owing to the synergy of physical and chemical microenvironments. Herein, we develop a defect engineering strategy to fabricate COF membranes for efficient CO  2  separation. Abundant amino groups are  in situ  generated on the COF nanosheets arising from the missing&#8208;linker defects during the reactive assembly of amine monomer and mixed aldehyde monomers. The COF nanosheets are assembled to fabricate COF membranes. Amino groups, as the CO  2  facilitated transport carriers, along with ordered channels endow COF membrane with high CO  2  permeances of exceeding 300 GPU and excellent separation selectivity of 80 for CO  2  /N  2  , and 54 for CO  2  /CH  4  mixed gas under humidified state. Our defect engineering strategy offers a facile approach to generating free organic functional groups in COF membranes and other organic framework membranes for diverse chemical separations.</dc:description>

Abundant amino groups are  in situ  generated on the COF nanosheets arising from the missing-linker defects during the reactive assembly of amine monomer and mixed aldehyde monomers. The COF nanosheets are assembled to fabricate COF membranes. Amino groups, as the CO  2  facilitated transport carriers, along with ordered channels endow COF membrane with high CO  2  permeances of exceeding 300 GPU and excellent separation selectivity of 80 for CO  2  /N  2  , and 54 for CO  2  /CH  4  mixed gas under humidified state. Our defect engineering strategy offers a facile approach to generating free organic functional groups in COF membranes and other organic framework membranes for diverse chemical separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Achieving wide&#8208;range tunable emission colors, especially in the solid state of single&#8208;fluorophore materials, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a molecular design strategy that affords wide&#8208;range excitation&#8208;dependent emissions spanning over ~230 nm in crystalline states. Under the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor configuration, we judiciously choose a rotatable acceptor fragment,  o  &#8208;carborane, to enrich conformational diversities in the crystalline state and generate conformation&#8208;dependent multicolor emissions. We further show that this molecular platform is generalizable in creating crystalline materials with multicolor emissions. Based on these materials, a high&#8208;capacity information storage device and a finite&#8208;state machine were fabricated to showcase multicolor displays and information storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Salt for Ultrarapid Adsorption/Desorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting by Dual Hydrogen Bond System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the porous sorbent&#8208;assisted atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) method has emerged as an effective approach for solving water crises without geographical restrictions. However, there is a limited array of porous adsorbent materials that can be used for AWH, which are inadequate to meet the needs under different climatic conditions. In light of this, herein, we synthesize a new crystalline porous organic salt (CPOS; denoted as CPOS&#8208;6) possessing a dual hydrogen bond system and verify its applicability toward AWH for the first time. Unlike other reported CPOSs, CPOS&#8208;6 displays an S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherm owing to the presence of the dual hydrogen bond system. Under simulated drought conditions in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, CPOS&#8208;6 exhibits long&#8208;term water adsorption&#8211;desorption cycling stability, low water desorption temperature, and ultrarapid adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics. The results confirm that CPOS&#8208;6 is an effective sorbent material for AWH.</dc:description>

         <title>Blending the Optical and Redox Properties of Oligoynes and Boron Difluoride Formazanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active boron difluoride formazanate end&#8208;caps are used to stabilize symmetric and asymmetric families of oligoynes containing between 2 and 10 alkyne units. These oligoyne&#8208;dye conjugates exhibit multiple redox waves and panchromatic absorption profiles.







Abstract
Oligoynes and polyynes are 1D chains of conjugated sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms consisting of alternating single and triple bonds. Their stability rapidly decreases with increasing chain length beyond only a few repeating units. Design strategies, such as the use of bulky end&#8208;capping groups, allow for their characterization and isolation while not contributing significantly to their physical properties. In this study, we incorporate redox&#8208;active BF2 formazanate dyes (BF2) as end&#8208;caps to prepare symmetric (BF2&#8722;[C&#8801;C]n&#8722;BF2) and asymmetric (BF2&#8722;[C&#8801;C]n&#8722;Si(iPr)3) families of oligoynes containing up to 10 alkyne units. In doing so, we introduce stable oligoynes that possess a blend of optical and redox properties that cannot be achieved by either oligoynes or BF2 formazanates individually (e.g., panchromatic absorption, multiple and tunable reversible redox waves). This approach is transferable to other functional end&#8208;caps to facilitate the preparation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials with utility in the organic electronics arena.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Circulating Vector for Aptamers Based upon Polyphosphodiester&#8208;Backboned Molecular Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers face challenges for use outside the ideal conditions in which they are developed. These difficulties are most palpable in vivo due to nuclease activities, rapid clearance, and off&#8208;target binding. Herein, we demonstrate that a polyphosphodiester&#8208;backboned molecular brush can suppress enzymatic digestion, reduce non&#8208;specific cell uptake, enable long blood circulation, and rescue the bioactivity of a conjugated aptamer in vivo. The backbone along with the aptamer is assembled via solid&#8208;phase synthesis, followed by installation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains using a two&#8208;step process with near&#8208;quantitative efficiency. The synthesis allows for precise control over polymer size and architecture. Consisting entirely of building blocks that are generally recognized as safe for therapeutics, this novel molecular brush is expected to provide a highly translatable route for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Photoactivation of cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway and Pyroptosis by Pt(II)&#8208;Triphenylamine Complexes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway is a potent anticancer immunotherapeutic strategy, and the induction of pyroptosis is a feasible way to stimulate the anticancer immune responses. Herein, two Pt(II) complexes (Pt1  and  Pt2) were designed as photoactivators of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In response to light irradiation,  Pt1  and  Pt2  could damage mitochondrial/nuclear DNA and the nuclear envelope to activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and concurrently induce pyroptosis in cancer cells, which evoked an intense anticancer immune response  in vitro  and  in vivo. Overall, we present the first photoactivator of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, which may provide an innovative design strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of Methyl Esters and CO in Lignin Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin is an abundant renewable carbon source. Due to its complex structure, utilization of lignin is very challenging. Herein, we describe an efficient strategy for the simultaneous utilization of lignin, in which the methoxy groups in lignin react with carboxylic acids to generate methyl carboxylates and the other alkyl and phenyl carbons react with oxygen to predominantly form CO that can be used directly in carbonylation reactions. The method was applied to the methylation of various functionalized aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids, including natural compounds, to produce valuable chemicals including pharmaceuticals. No solid or liquid residues remain after the reaction. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that a well&#8208;ordered C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bond activation sequence takes place to realize total transformation of lignin. This work opens a way for transformation of the entire lignin polymer into valuable products, exemplified by the synthesis of the pharmaceutical, Ramipril, on gram scale.</dc:description>

The method was applied to the methylation of various functionalized aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids, including natural compounds, to produce valuable chemicals including pharmaceuticals. No solid or liquid residues remain after the reaction. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that a well-ordered C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bond activation sequence takes place to realize total transformation of lignin. This work opens a way for transformation of the entire lignin polymer into valuable products, exemplified by the synthesis of the pharmaceutical, Ramipril, on gram scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Ester Electrolyte with Boosted Stability Against Li for High&#8208;Performance Li metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In traditional non&#8208;flammable electrolytes a trade&#8208;off always exists between non&#8208;flammability and battery performance. Previous research focused on reducing free solvents and forming anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. However, the contribution of solvated anions in boosting the stability of electrolyte has been overlooked. Here, we resolve this via introducing anions into Li+ solvation sheaths using anions with similar Gutmann donor number (DN) to that of solvent. Taking trimethyl phosphate fire&#8208;retardant (DN = 23.0 kcal mol&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (DN = 22.2 kcal mol&#8722;1) as an example, NO3&#8722; is readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath and reduces the polarity of solvent. This results in boosted stability of electrolyte against Li. The developed non&#8208;flammable electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The reversibility of Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49% and the lifespan of practical LMBs was extended by &gt; 100%.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Binding Sites in a Chemically Stable Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing porous materials to overcome the trade&#8208;off between&#160;adsorption capacity and selectivity&#160;for C2H2/CO2separation remains a challenge. Herein,&#160;we report a stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a), featuring large cages decorated with high density of supramolecular binding sites to achieve both high C2H2&#160;storage and selectivity. ZJU&#8208;50a exhibits&#160;one of the highest C2H2&#160;storage capacity (192 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and concurrently high C2H2/CO2&#160;selectivity (12) at 298 K and 1 bar. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on gas&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;50a crystal unveil that the incorporated supramolecular binding sites can selectively take up C2H2&#160;molecule but not CO2&#160;to result in both&#160;high C2H2&#160;storage and selectivity. Breakthrough experiments validated its separation performance for C2H2/CO2&#160;mixtures, providing a high C2H2&#160;recovery capacity&#160;of&#160;84.2 L kg&#8722;1&#160;with 99.5% purity.&#160;This&#160;study suggests a novel strategy of engineering&#160;supramolecular binding sites&#160;into MOFs to overcome the trade&#8208;off for this separation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;membered cyclic structures are widely existing in natural products and serve as enabling intermediates in organic synthesis. However, the efficient and straightforward access to such structures with diversity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes synthesis using free XH  2  (X = C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented. This metal&#8208;free protocol features the direct aziridination and cyclopropanation with unprotected XH  2  . Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and methylene with acidic protons, are good precursors, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Copolypeptide&#8208;Stabilized Microbubbles with Maleimide&#8208;Decorated Surfaces as Long&#8208;Term Ultrasound Contrast Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) have been clinically used as ultrasound (US) contrast agents for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, it remains a great challenge to resolve the dilemma of stability and contrast enhancement of MBs. Herein, amphiphilic copolypeptides bearing fluorinated blocks are synthesized to stabilize perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;filled MBs, exhibiting unique stability under both long&#8208;term storage and US imaging conditions. The fluorinated inner layer reduces the internal Laplace pressure and greatly improves the stability of MBs, which can be further reinforced by crosslinking of the dipropargyl&#8208;containing middle blocks. To overcome the suppressed nonlinear oscillation of polymer shells, maleimide groups are introduced onto the surface of MBs, enabling in situ reaction with plasma proteins to enhance second harmonic signals without compromising the stability of MBs, conferring better US imaging performance than that of SonoVue  TM  MBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The dominant hole transport material (HTM) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, which needs to be doped using hydrophilic dopants to improve its hole mobility and conductivity, resulting in inferior device stability. Here, we propose an effective molecular design strategy to construct dopant&#8208;free polymer HTMs by selecting four structurally related polymers and investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship. It is found that the donor and acceptor units with longitudinal conjugate extension, such as BDT&#8208;T and BDD, could not only enhance the planarity of the conjugated polymer backbone and tune the energy levels but also promote the face&#8208;on orientation, resulting in superior charge extraction and transport. The optimized device utilizing dopant&#8208;free polymer HTM shows a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19 V and a champion efficiency of 24.04% with greatly improved operational stability, making it among the best performance PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocarboxylation of Aryl Epoxides with CO2 for the Facile and Selective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method for the electroreductive carboxylation of aryl epoxides with CO2 has been developed to provide &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids. The method exhibited broad substrate scope, could be extended to cyclic ethers with larger rings, and proved to be a powerful approach to the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product derivatives and drug molecules.







Abstract
Herein, an efficient and facile approach to valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives from readily available aryl epoxides and CO2 with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild and sustainable electrochemical conditions is described. This approach showed broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group compatibility. In addition to aryl epoxides, four&#8208; to six&#8208;membered aryl cyclic ethers could all be tolerated in the reaction to provide synthetically useful hydroxy acids with high efficiency. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylation of complex molecules and drug derivatives demonstrated its potential application in the pharmaceutical industry. Mechanistic studies disclosed possible reaction pathways.

         <title>An Intelligent Nanomachine Guided by DNAzyme Logic System for Precise Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent nanomachine guided by a DNAzyme logic system was constructed for precise Chemodynamic Therapy (CDT). The nanomachine could accurately identify cell types by an in&#8208;built DNAzyme logic system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported cell&#8208;specific CDT by the guidance of DNAzyme logic gate.







Abstract
The intelligent nanomachine usually has a control center to carry out self&#8208;regulation. Unfortunately, most of the nanomaterials for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) do not have such a control center to sense and process the chemical or biological signals, which greatly weakens the selectivity and efficiency of CDT. To address this problem, here an intelligent nanomachine was constructed with a DNAzyme logic gate as the control center, and metal organic framework as the actuator. The well&#8208;designed nanomachine showed an enhanced killing effect on cancer cells but posed no harm to normal cells, acquiring better selectivity than clinical chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin and cisplatin). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported cell&#8208;specific CDT by the guidance of DNAzyme logic gate. Our work highlights the great potential of DNAzymes in intelligent response networks, and extends the implementation of nanomachines in precision medicine.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis of the Spiroindimicin Family of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the spiroindimicin family of natural products with both [5,5] and [5,6] spiro&#8208;ring skeletons was achieved via a biomimetic &#8220;dimerize&#8208;and&#8208;divert&#8221; strategy. A biocatalytic process for the oxidative dimerization of L&#8208;tryptophan was developed for the preparation of a bis&#8208;indole intermediate, which was converted to spiroindimicins via regioselective oxidative C3&#8242;&#8722;C2&#8242;&#8242; and C3&#8242;&#8722;C4&#8242;&#8242; couplings.







Abstract
A unified strategy for the biomimetic total synthesis of the spiroindimicin family of natural products was reported. Key transformations include a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxidative dimerization of L&#8208;tryptophan/5&#8208;chloro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan to afford the bis&#8208;indole precursors chromopyrrolic acid/5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dichloro&#8208;chromopyrrolic acid, and regioselective C3&#8242;&#8722;C2&#8242;&#8242; and C3&#8242;&#8722;C4&#8242;&#8242; bond formation converting a common bis&#8208;indole skeleton to two skeletally different natural products, including (&#177;)&#8208;spiroindimicins&#8197;D and G with a [5,5] spiro&#8208;ring skeleton, and (&#177;)&#8208;spiroindimicins&#8197;A and H with a [5,6] spiro&#8208;ring skeleton, respectively.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a Rhamnose&#8208;Functionalized Bispecific Nanobody as a Bispecific Antibody Mimic for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhamnosylation of a bispecific nanobody (bsNb&#8208;Rha), as a mimic of the full&#8208;length bispecific antibody, was developed for cancer immunotherapy. The bsNb&#8208;Rha conjugate simultaneously targeted EGFR and HER2 antigens expressed on tumor cells, followed by the engagement of endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies to trigger an efficient Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated immune response, leading to enhanced activity in vitro and in vivo against the dual&#8208;positive cancer cells.







Abstract
Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are next&#8208;generation therapeutics for complex cancer treatment. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;targeting non&#8208;IgG format of bsAbs by using a bispecific nanobody (bsNb) that can simultaneously target EGFR and HER2 on tumor cells. Site&#8208;specific modification of the anti&#8208;EGFR&#8208;HER2 bsNb was conducted using the rhamnose (Rha) hapten via sortase A&#8208;mediated ligation to reconstitute the missing crystallizable fragment (Fc) effector biological functions. Functionally similar to bsAbs, bsNb&#8208;Rha conjugates retained dual&#8208;targeting activity and exerted potent anticancer effects via the Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated engagement of endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies. Further, an optimized bsNb&#8208;Rha conjugate exhibited markedly improved pharmacokinetics and efficient inhibitory effects against xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Our strategy provides a general and cost&#8208;effective platform to generate a new bsAb format for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Radical Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical radical allylation reaction was developed in high yields with excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 93&#8201;% ee). The single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;based enantioselective electrocatalytic routes would be applied as an alternative approach for the development of a wide range of useful stereocontrolled reactions.







Abstract
A simplified and appealing strategy via a chiral catalyst to facilitate the electrochemical process and provide asymmetric induction of radical reactions is particularly desirable and would have potential applications in electrosynthesis, organic chemistry, and drug discovery. Here, we introduced a novel electrolytic system that diverts the standard ionic reactivity to new catalytic functions, enabling mechanistically distinct single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;based enantioselective routes to exhibit a brand&#8208;new pattern of reactivity&#8212;electricity&#8208;driven asymmetric catalysis as a privileged chiral platform for enantioselective radical allylation. The nickel&#8208;catalyzed activation of nucleophiles triggered a single&#8208;electron transfer process to provide a chiral catalyst&#8208;bound radical cation intermediate, which could be applied as an alternative strategy for the development of stereocontrolled radical reactions.

         <title>In vivo Realization of Dual Photodynamic and Photothermal Therapy for Melanoma by Mitochondria Targeting Dinuclear Ruthenium Complexes under Civil Infrared Low&#8208;power Laser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear ruthenium complexes with high two&#8208;photon absorption in the IR region and photothermal conversion efficiency have been developed to target mitochondria without penetrating the nucleus for tumor therapy. They show suppressed melanoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo with dual two&#8208;photon photodynamic and photothermal therapy.







Abstract
A series of dinuclear RuII complexes with extremely high TPA cross sections in the range of 800&#8211;900&#8197;nm have been designed. The amphiphilic complex Ru3 containing tert&#8208;butyl groups has balanced performance in singlet oxygen generation and photothermal conversion and becomes the ideal drug candidate of the series. Ru3 targets mitochondria without penetrating the nucleus, which substantially increases its photodynamic therapy activity and reduces its dark cytotoxicity. Ru3 successfully suppresses melanoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo with combined photodynamic and photothermal therapy under low light dose irradiation of an 808&#8197;nm low&#8208;power laser, avoiding the known PDT resistance in melanoma. The excellent therapeutic effect of Ru3 facilitates its applications in further human trials for larger or deeper buried tumors, thereby becoming a prospective candidate for a new generation of low&#8208;power IR&#8208;driven dual PDT/PTT drugs.

         <title>Luminescence and Length Control in Nonchelated d8&#8208;Metallosupramolecular Polymers through Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular polymerization of a PtII complex with a monodentate ligand design based on self&#8208;complementary H&#8208;bonding initially affords a non&#8208;luminescent supramolecular polymer (SP). Pathway control then enables a consecutive transformation to an SP exhibiting close Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt contacts with long&#8208;lived 3MMLCT emission. Apart from luminescence, the Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt&#8208;interactions also enable control over the size of the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) of d8 transition metal complexes have received considerable attention by virtue of their rich photophysical properties arising from metal&#8208;metal interactions. However, thus far, the molecular design is restricted to complexes with chelating ligands due to their advantageous preorganization and strong ligand fields. Herein, we demonstrate unique pathway&#8208;controllable metal&#8208;metal&#8208;interactions and remarkable 3MMLCT luminescence in SPs of a non&#8208;chelated PtII complex. Under kinetic control, self&#8208;complementary bisamide H&#8208;bonding motifs induce a rapid self&#8208;assembly into non&#8208;emissive H&#8208;type aggregates (1A). However, under thermodynamic conditions, a more efficient ligand coplanarization leads to superiorly stabilized SP 1B with extended Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interactions and remarkably long 3MMLCT luminescence (&#964;77&#8201;K=0.26&#8197;ms). The metal&#8208;metal interactions could be subsequently exploited to control the length of the emissive SPs using the seeded&#8208;growth approach.

         <title>Nanographene Metallaprisms: Structure, Stimulated Transformation, and Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triangular metalloprism was constructed by supramolecular assembly of diazananographene and was transformed into a square tetramer by stimulation with C60/C70. A pair of C60/C70 molecules can be encapsulated in the square tetramer. A remarkable emission enhancement of the trapped C60 was observed, which was attributed to the formation of a confined dimer and efficient intermolecular energy transfer.







Abstract
Nanographenes are inclined to assemble into stacked columnar structures that are stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, whereas other supramolecular structures of nanographenes, such as prisms and cages, are rarely investigated. Herein, a diazananographene was synthesized, and then assembled with a coordination unit, thereby producing a triangular metallaprism. After adding C60 or C70, the triangular metallaprism was transformed into a square tetramer, which encapsulated a pair of C60 or C70 molecules. The formed host&#8208;guest complex demonstrated efficient energy transfer from the diazananographene shell to the C60 cores. The emission intensity of the capsulated C60 was enhanced remarkably, compared with free C60, due to an increased quantum yield and optical absorption coefficient. This work demonstrates the versatility of nanographene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures beyond columnar stacking and their ability to enhance the emission of otherwise non&#8208;emissive fullerene.

         <title>Cucurbituril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbituril has shown great potential as an important building block of various functional polymers because of its strong, but dynamic, interactions with guest molecules. This Minireview summarizes the most recent examples of cucurbituril&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (CSPs) for biomedical applications. The design principles of CSPs and their unique advantages for biomedical applications, as well as the developmental trends and future perspectives of this cross&#8208;disciplinary area are discussed.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) have attracted broad interest because of their intriguing features and functions. Host&#8211;guest interactions often impart tunable physicochemical properties, reversible hierarchical organization, and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to SPs for diverse biomedical applications. Characterized by strong but dynamic interactions with guest molecules, cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) has shown great potential as an important building block of various functional polymers for biomedical applications. In this Minireview, we summarize the most recent examples regarding the design, fabrication, and biomedical applications of CB[n]&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (CSPs), which are categorized as noncovalent and covalent CSPs according to the interactions between the CB[n] and polymer backbones. The design principles of CSPs and their unique advantages for biomedical applications, as well as the developmental trends and future perspectives of this cross&#8208;disciplinary area are also discussed.

         <title>Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydrogenative C&#8722;H Alkoxylation and Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented enantioselective dehydrogenative C&#8722;H alkoxylation and amination is reported. The use of cheap and readily available cobalt(II) salts as catalysts and Saloxs as chiral ligands provides an efficient method to access P&#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The past decade has witnessed a rapid progress in asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, the enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation and amination with alcohols and free amines remains elusive. Herein, we disclose the first enantioselective dehydrogenative C&#8722;H alkoxylation and amination enabled by a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis. The use of cheap and readily available cobalt(II) salts as catalysts and Saloxs as chiral ligands provides an efficient method to access P&#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The practicality of this protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale preparation and further derivatizations of the resulting P&#8208;stereogenic phosphinamides, which offering a flexible asymmetric alternative to access P&#8208;stereogenic mono&#8208; and diphosphine chiral ligands. Preliminary mechanistic studies on the enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation reaction suggest that a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle might be involved.

         <title>An Optically Anisotropic Crystal with Large Birefringence Arising from Cooperative &#960; Orbitals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anisotropic crystal CsH2C6N9&#8901;H2O consists of (H2C6N9)&#8722; anion units in which the &#960; orbitals of the constituent (C3N3) ring and linear &#8722;(N&#8722;C&#8801;N)&#8722; moieties are cooperative. As a result, the crystal exhibits very large birefringence of up to 0.55@550&#8197;nm. This attribute enables it to efficiently divide an incident ray into different polarized rays (o ray and e ray).







Abstract
Birefringent materials are highly demanded for high&#8208;performance polarized optics. As compared with artificial anisotropic metamaterials, anisotropic crystals have advantages of low optical losses and easy processing, but their birefringence is still limited. Herein, based on first&#8208;principles studies, we identified a new type of functional anion units, (HxC6N9)(3&#8722;x)&#8722; (x=0, 1, 2), and then successfully synthesized a new anisotropic crystal, namely, CsH2C6N9&#8901;H2O (I), whose crystal structure consists of (H2C6N9)&#8722; anions. Remarkably, I is ultraviolet transparent and exhibits very large birefringence of about 0.55@550&#8197;nm, which is much larger than those of commercial birefringent crystals. These results make I a candidate for highly efficient manipulation of optics and light in optical modulation devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that large birefringence mainly arises from the cooperative &#960; orbitals in (H2C6N9)&#8722; anions. This work provides a new insight on the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships of anisotropic crystals.

&lt;p&gt;The anisotropic crystal CsH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O consists of (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion units in which the &#960; orbitals of the constituent (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ring and linear &#8722;(N&#8722;C&#8801;N)&#8722; moieties are cooperative. As a result, the crystal exhibits very large birefringence of up to 0.55@550&#8197;nm. This attribute enables it to efficiently divide an incident ray into different polarized rays (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; ray and &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; ray).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birefringent materials are highly demanded for high-performance polarized optics. As compared with artificial anisotropic metamaterials, anisotropic crystals have advantages of low optical losses and easy processing, but their birefringence is still limited. Herein, based on first-principles studies, we identified a new type of functional anion units, (H&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;(3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=0, 1, 2), and then successfully synthesized a new anisotropic crystal, namely, CsH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;), whose crystal structure consists of (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. Remarkably, &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; is ultraviolet transparent and exhibits very large birefringence of about 0.55@550&#8197;nm, which is much larger than those of commercial birefringent crystals. These results make &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; a candidate for highly efficient manipulation of optics and light in optical modulation devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that large birefringence mainly arises from the cooperative &#960; orbitals in (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. This work provides a new insight on the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships of anisotropic crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges of high energy consumption and safety hazards of conventional thermocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation with an excess of H2 were solved by developing a light&#8208;field assisted route in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor, without H2, at room temperature. In comparison with the commercial catalyst, it shows superior catalytic performance in respect to activity, selectivity and stability, combined with high industrial applicability.







Abstract
Sustainable processes for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes/alkadienes impurities in alkenes feedstocks are in great demand in industry as the utilization of excessive hydrogen, high temperature and unsatisfactory alkenes selectivity of the current thermo&#8208;catalytic route, however, their development is still challenging. Herein, we innovate a light&#8208;assisted semi&#8208;hydrogenation process in gas&#8208;feed fixed bed reactor, with water as hydrogen atom source by in situ photocatalysis. Using Pd/TiO2 as model catalyst, this process shows an excellent catalytic performance for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, with 100&#8201;% of butenes selectivity at &#8776;99&#8201;% of conversion over 180&#8197;h of reaction at ambient temperature driven by 66&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of irradiation intensity. This light&#8208;driven, H2&#8208;free, ambient temperature semi&#8208;hydrogenation process, with superior performance to that of thermocatalytic route, shows attractive to bring an evolution in industrial hydrogenation technology to an economical and safe way.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [2+1] and [4+1] Annulations of Diynes with Ketones via Carbonyl Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl ylides have proven to be powerful synthons for the efficient construction of various valuable O&#8208;heterocycles, and the formation of carbonyl ylides by the reaction of metal carbenes with carbonyls has attracted increasing attention over the past decades. However, a catalyst&#8208;controlled highly enantioselective reaction of carbonyl ylides from metal carbenes is extremely challenging. Herein, we report a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal [2+1] and [4+1] annulations of diynes with ketones via carbonyl ylides. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first example of successful asymmetric epoxidation via carbonyl ylides, but also constitutes the first reaction of vinyl cations with carbonyl compounds. This method leads to the divergent, practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of chiral oxiranes and dihydrofurans in moderate to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities via remote&#8208;stereocontrol strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Nonpolar Pore Surfaces for the One&#8208;step Acquisition of C2H4 from a C2H4 and C2H6 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because C  2  H  4  plays an essential role in the chemical industry, economical and energy&#8208;efficient separation of ethylene (C  2  H  4  ) from ethane (C  2  H  6  ) is extremely important. With the exception of energy&#8208;extensive cryogenic distillation, there are few one&#8208;step methods to obtain polymer&#8208;grade (&#8805; 99.95% pure) C  2  H  4  from C  2  H  4  /C  2  H  6  mixtures. Here we report a highly stable metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) (FJI&#8208;H = Hong's group in Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter), which features one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal nonpolar pore surfaces constructed by aromatic rings and alkyl groups. This FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) adsorbs C  2  H  6  rather than C  2  H  4  between 273 and 303 K. Practical breakthrough experiments with C  2  H  4  containing 1% C  2  H  6  have shown that FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) can realize the acquisition in one&#8208;step of polymer&#8208;grade, 99.95% pure C  2  H  4  under various conditions including different gas flow rates, temperatures and relative humidities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Antimony&#8208;Rich Polyoxometalate with Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antitumor Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) {Sb  21  Tb  7  W  56  } is reported, which contains the largest number of Sb atoms in a POM so far. The Sb&#8208;rich POM has many interesting structural features and shows a rare soluble and water&#8208;stable giant POM. Biomedical studies indicate that the Sb&#8208;rich POM exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor activities against various cancer cell lines by reactivating the P53&#8208;dependent apoptotic processes and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, this Sb&#8208;rich POM is capable of suppressing the growth and metastasis of the breast cancer in vivo. This work demonstrates that Sb&#8208;rich POMs are promising candidates for developing new anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Fe6C Core in All Nitrogenase Cofactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biological process of dinitrogen reduction to ammonium occurs at the cofactors of nitrogenases, the only enzymes that catalyze this challenging chemical reaction. Three types of nitrogenases have been described, named according to the heterometal in their cofactor: molybdenum, vanadium or iron nitrogenases. Spectroscopic and structural characterization allowed the unambiguous identification of the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases and revealed a central &#181;  6  &#8208;carbide in both of them. Although genetic studies suggested that the cofactor of the iron nitrogenase contains a similar Fe  6  C core, this has not been experimentally demonstrated. Here we report Valence&#8208;to&#8208;Core X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy providing experimental evidence that this cofactor contains a carbide, thereby making the Fe  6  C core a feature of all nitrogenase cofactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Fleeting Ni(III) Bisphenoxyl Diradical Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450s and Galactose Oxidases exploit redox active ligands to form reactive high valent intermediates for oxidation reactions. This strategy works well for the late 3d metals where accessing high valent states is rather challenging. Herein, we report the oxidation of NiII(salen) (salen = N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;(1R,2R)&#8208;diamine) with mCPBA (meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid) to form a fleeting Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species, in CH3CN and CH2Cl2 at &#8208;40 &#176;C. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses using UV&#8208;Vis, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies revealed oxidation events both on the ligand and the metal centre to yield a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species. DFT calculations found the electronic structure of the ligand and the d&#8208;configuration of the metal center to be consistent with a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species. This three electron oxidized species can perform hydrogen atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Analysis of Anionic Coordination Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic coordination polymerizations proceed via highly reactive intermediates, whose in&#8208;situ analysis has remained difficult. Here, we show that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is a promising method to obtain detailed information on the polymerization process. Focusing on polymerization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes initiated by CoCl2/RLi (R = Me,  nBu,  tBu, Ph), we directly observe the growing polymer chains and characterize the active anionic cobalt centers by gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments. On the basis of these results, we suggest a plausible mechanism for the polymerization reaction. Moreover, the ESI mass spectra permit the determination of molecular weight distributions, which are in good agreement with those derived from NMR&#8208;spectroscopic as well as MALDI mass&#8208;spectrometric measurements, and afford a wealth of kinetic data.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Polyester Bottlebrush Amphiphiles toward Eco&#8208;Friendly Photonic Pigments via Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyester&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) bottlebrush block copolymers with varied side chain lengths are utilized for the fabrication of biodegradable photonic microspheres. The eco&#8208;friendly photonic pigments with highly saturated structural colors can be the ideal substitutes to nondegradable microbeads and toxic pigments, providing a new strategy to reduce the micro&#8208;polluting items and toxic chemicals in our ecosystem.







Abstract
Biodegradable photonic microspheres with structural colors are promising substitutes to polluting microbeads and toxic dyes. Here, amphiphilic polyester&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) with polylactic acid or poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) as the hydrophobic block are synthesized and used to fabricate eco&#8208;friendly photonic pigments. Molecular parameters of BBCPs, including rigidity and symmetry, are precisely tailored by variation of side chain lengths, which enables effective manipulation of interfacial tension (&#947;). Organized spontaneous emulsion mechanism is enabled only when &#947; falls in a suitable range (10.6&#8211;14.3&#8197;mN&#8201;m&#8722;1), producing ordered water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water multiple emulsions and ordered porous structures. Consequently, highly saturated and tunable structural colors are observed due to coherent light scattering from the porous structures. Such photonic materials are nontoxic as confirmed by careful safety tests using aquatic model organisms.

         <title>2D MOF with Compact Catalytic Sites for the One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 2,5&#8208;Dimethylfuran from Saccharides via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;acid functionalized 2D MOF (Pd/NUS&#8208;SO3H), as an ultrathin nanosheet containing compact active sites (Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites, and metal sites) is prepared for the first time. It can give substantial yields of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran from different saccharides (fructose, glucose, cellobiose, sucrose, and inulins) in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.







Abstract
One pot synthesis of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran (2,5&#8208;DMF) from saccharides under mild conditions is of importance for the production of biofuel and fine chemicals. However, the synthesis requires a multitude of active sites and suffers from slow kinetics due to poor diffusion in most composite catalysts. Herein, a metal&#8208;acid functionalized 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF; Pd/NUS&#8208;SO3H), as an ultrathin nanosheet of 3&#8211;4&#8197;nm with Lewis acid, Br&#248;nsted acid, and metal active sites, was prepared based on the diazo method for acid modification and subsequent metal loading. This new composite catalyst gives substantially higher yields of DMF than all reported catalysts for different saccharides (fructose, glucose, cellobiose, sucrose, and inulins). Characterization suggests that a cascade of reactions including polysaccharide hydrolysis, isomerization, dehydration, and hydrodeoxygenation takes place with rapid molecular interactions.

         <title>Directing the Morphology, Packing, and Properties of Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Cation Exchange
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative exchange of metal cations has resulted in a variety of crystals having different optical and magnetic properties but with retention of the crystal shape. Crystals isolated during the exchange exhibited higher concentrations of the incoming metal cations at the hexagonal basal faces, which suggests that the nanochannels are mediating the process.







Abstract
We show that metal&#8211;organic frameworks, based on tetrahedral pyridyl ligands, can be used as a morphological and structural template to form a series of isostructural crystals having different metal ions and properties. An iterative crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal conversion has been demonstrated by consecutive cation exchanges. The primary manganese&#8208;based crystals are characterized by an uncommon space group (P622). The packing includes chiral channels that can mediate the cation exchange, as indicated by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy on microtome&#8208;sectioned crystals. The observed cation exchange is in excellent agreement with the Irving&#8211;Williams series (Mn&lt;Fe&lt;Co&lt;Ni&lt;&#8201;Cu&gt;Zn) associated with the relative stability of the resulting coordination nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the metal cation controls the optical and magnetic properties. The crystals maintain their morphology, allowing a quantitative comparison of their properties at both the ensemble and single&#8208;crystal level.

         <title>Dinitrogen Binding at a Trititanium Chloride Complex and Its Conversion to Ammonia under Ambient Conditions</title>

The reduction of [TiCp*Cl3] with magnesium leads to a mixed&#8208;valence titanium species capable of reacting with dinitrogen to form a stable trinuclear complex with a &#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2 ligand. This dinitrogen complex further reacts cleanly with HCl to produce NH4Cl with regeneration of the titanium precursor. Thus, a cyclic ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions can be envisaged.







Abstract
Reaction of [TiCp*Cl3] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) with one equivalent of magnesium in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature affords the paramagnetic trinuclear complex [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)], which reacts with dinitrogen under ambient conditions to give the diamagnetic derivative [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] and the titanium(III) dimer [{TiCp*Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}2]. The structure of the trinuclear mixed&#8208;valence complexes has been studied by experimental and theoretical methods and the latter compound represents the first well&#8208;defined example of the &#956;3&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2 coordination mode of the dinitrogen molecule. The reaction of [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] with excess HCl in tetrahydrofuran results in clean NH4Cl formation with regeneration of the starting material [TiCp*Cl3]. Therefore, a cyclic ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions can be envisioned by alternating N2/HCl atmospheres in a [TiCp*Cl3]/Mg(excess) reaction mixture in tetrahydrofuran.

         <title>A PEGylated Tin Porphyrin Complex for Electrocatalytic Proton Reduction: Mechanistic Insights into Main&#8208;Group&#8208;Element Catalysis</title>

A tin porphyrin complex promotes efficient hydrogen evolution (HER) with a Faradaic efficiency of 94&#8201;%. The maximum turnover frequency (TOFmax) for H2 production was obtained as 1099&#8197;s&#8722;1. Spectroelectrochemical analysis, in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations, suggest that proton reduction occurs via an electron&#8208;chemical&#8208;electron&#8208;chemical pathway.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic proton reduction to form dihydrogen (H2) is an effective way to store energy in the form of chemical bonds. In this study, we validate the applicability of a main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;based tin porphyrin complex as an effective molecular electrocatalyst for proton reduction. A PEGylated Sn porphyrin complex (SnPEGP) displayed high activity (&#8722;4.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.7&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+) and high selectivity (H2 Faradaic efficiency of 94&#8201;% at &#8722;1.7&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+) in acetonitrile (MeCN) with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the proton source. The maximum turnover frequency (TOFmax) for H2 production was obtained as 1099&#8197;s&#8722;1. Spectroelectrochemical analysis, in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations, suggest that proton reduction occurs via an electron&#8208;chemical&#8208;electron&#8208;chemical (ECEC) pathway. This study reveals that the tin porphyrin catalyst serves as a novel platform for investigating molecular electrocatalytic reactions and provides new mechanistic insights into proton reduction.

         <title>Supported Anionic Gold Nanoparticle Catalysts Modified Using Highly Negatively Charged Multivacant Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is reported for the design of supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts modified using highly negatively charged multivacant lacunary polyoxometalates. Enhanced catalytic activity and stability of supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts was accessed in the aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of piperidone derivatives to the corresponding enaminones.







Abstract
Although supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts have been theoretically investigated for their efficacy in activating O2 in aerobic oxidation reactions, limited studies have been reported due to the difficulty of designing these catalysts. Herein, we developed a feasible method for preparing supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts using multivacant lacunary polyoxometalates with high negative charges. We confirmed the strong and robust electronic interaction between gold nanoparticles and multivacant lacunary polyoxometalates, and the electronic states of the supported gold nanoparticle catalysts can be sequentially modulated. Particularly, the catalyst prepared using [SiW9O34]10&#8722; acted as an efficient reusable heterogeneous catalyst, showing superior catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of piperidone derivatives to the corresponding enaminones and remarkably higher stability than supported gold nanoparticle catalysts without this modification.

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of C&#8722;Si Bonds for Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Cross Brook&#8211;Benzoin Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective Brook&#8211;Benzoin reaction is disclosed. This reaction proceeds via silyl acyl anion intermediates and enables the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;silyloxy ketones bearing a wide range of functional groups in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The first carbene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric chemoselective cross silyl benzoin (Brook&#8211;Benzoin) reaction has been developed. Key steps of this reaction involve activation of the carbon&#8211;silicon bond of an acylsilane by a chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst to form a silyl acyl anion intermediate. These acyl anions then undergo an addition reaction with indole aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner to afford &#945;&#8208;silyloxy ketones with excellent optical purities. The reaction mechanism of this cross Brook&#8211;Benzoin reaction was investigated through both experimental and computational methods. The chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone derivatives obtained by this approach show promising, agrochemically interesting activity against harmful plant bacteria.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Multivalent Porphyrin&#8211;Peptide Conjugates by Direct Porphyrin Construction on Resin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical integrated solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol is reported for the direct construction of porphyrin moieties on resin&#8208;bound peptides from simple aldehyde and dipyrromethane building blocks. Monovalent, cis/trans&#8208;divalent, and trivalent porphyrin&#8211;(long) peptide conjugate products can be formed by this method in a highly efficient and controllable manner.

Multifunctional porphyrin&#8211;peptide conjugates with different propensities for self&#8208;assembly into various supramolecular nanoarchitectures play important roles in advanced materials and biomedical research. However, preparing prefunctionalized core porphyrins by traditional low&#8208;yielding statistical synthesis and purifying them after peptide ligation through many rounds of HPLC purification is tedious and unsustainable. Herein, we report a novel integrated solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for the construction of porphyrin moieties from simple aldehydes and dipyrromethanes on resin&#8208;bound peptides directly to form mono&#8208;, cis/trans&#8208;di&#8208;, and trivalent porphyrin&#8211;peptide conjugates in a highly efficient and controllable manner; moreover, only single final&#8208;stage HPLC purification of the products is needed. This efficient strategy enables the rapid, greener, and substrate&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of multivalent porphyrin&#8211;(long) peptide conjugate libraries for multifarious biological and materials applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon&#8208;Induced Post&#8208;Ionization to Boost Ion Yields in MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging

A new efficient post&#8208;ionization strategy for MALDI&#8208;MS imaging is presented: Simple RF&#8208;Kr lamps were pulsed and synchronized with a MALDI laser using custom&#8208;made electronics. Initial photoionization of dopant vapor in the fine&#8208;vacuum ion&#8208;funnel source yielded &gt;100&#215; signal boosts of numerous lipid classes from mammal tissue sections. Deuterated components indicated complex gas&#8208;phase ionization pathways generating fragment&#8208;less [M+H]+/[M&#8722;H]&#8722; species.







Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI&#8208;MSI) is a rapidly growing method in the life sciences. However, for many analyte classes, its sensitivity is limited due to poor ionization efficiencies. To mitigate this problem, we here introduce a novel post&#8208;ionization scheme based on single&#8208;photon induced chemical ionization using pulsed RF&#8208;Kr lamps. The fine&#8208;vacuum conditions of a dual ion&#8208;funnel ion source effectively thermalize the evolving MALDI plume and enable ample gas&#8208;phase reactions. Injected chemical dopants crucially support fragment&#8208;less ionization to [M+H]+/[M&#8722;H]&#8722; species. Based on this interplay, numerous glycerophospho&#8208;, sphingo&#8208;, and further lipids, registered from mammalian tissue sections, were boosted by up to three orders of magnitude, similar to results obtained with laser&#8208;based post&#8208;ionization (MALDI&#8208;2). Experiments with deuterated matrix and dopant, however, indicated complex chemical ionization pathways different from MALDI&#8208;2.

         <title>Deconvoluting the Optical Response of Biocompatible Photonic Pigments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse photonic glass microparticles, with colors across the visible spectrum, were prepared from a biocompatible bottlebrush block copolymer. The structure&#8211;optic relationship was investigated by i)&#8197;a 3D phase&#8208;field foam structural model and FDTD optical simulation, and ii)&#8197;an analytical model of an assembly of Mie scatterers. From this, a strategy to improve the color purity was proposed and realized.







Abstract
To unlock the widespread use of block copolymers as photonic pigments, there is an urgent need to consider their environmental impact (cf. microplastic pollution). Here we show how an inverse photonic glass architecture can enable the use of biocompatible bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs), which otherwise lack the refractive index contrast needed for a strong photonic response. A library of photonic pigments is produced from poly(norbornene&#8208;graft&#8208;polycaprolactone)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(norbornene&#8208;graft&#8208;polyethylene glycol), with the color tuned via either the BBCP molecular weight or the processing temperature upon microparticle fabrication. The structure&#8211;optic relationship between the 3D porous morphology of the microparticles and their complex optical response is revealed by both an analytical scattering model and 3D finite&#8208;difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. Combined, this allows for strategies to enhance the color purity to be proposed and realized with our biocompatible BBCP system.

         <title>Graphdiyne Nanospheres as a Wettability and Electron Modifier for Enhanced Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne nanospheres confined in mesoporous channels of Pd/mSiO2 can be used as a wettability and electron modifier to enhance the hydrogenation reaction rate. The hydrogenation of benzaldehyde proceeds under ambient H2 pressure in water, with a 4.3&#8208;fold enhancement compared to the unmodified Pd/mSiO2 catalyst.







Abstract
Owing to unique alkyne&#8208;rich structure, graphdiyne (GDY) has been proven to be a superb support for anchoring metal catalysts. Herein we demonstrate a new role of GDY as the wettability modifier for enhanced hydrogenation catalysis. After loading a certain amount GDY nanospheres, the silica mesoporous channels become superaerophilic, which allows gaseous H2 to be directly stored inside, thus significantly increasing the H2 concentration around the palladium nanoparticles (NPs). At the same time, GDY nanospheres also alter the electronic structure of the Pd NPs via a strong d&#8208;&#960; interaction. Combining these two roles of GDY, allows the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to proceed under ambient H2 pressure in water, with an impressive 4.3&#8208;fold enhancement compared to the unmodified Pd/mSiO2 catalyst. This study demonstrates a new role of GDY in constructing wettability matched catalysts for gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid tri&#8208;phase reactions.

         <title>Probing Neuropeptide Volume Transmission In Vivo by Simultaneous Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Release and Optical Sensing

         <dc:description>
An integrated optical approach was developed by combining plasmonic nanovesicles (Au&#8208;nV&#8208;SST) and a cell&#8208;based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporter (CNiFER) for neuropeptide release and detection. This approach allows spatiotemporal mapping of neuropeptide volume transmission and signaling in the mouse cortex.







Abstract
Neuropeptides are abundant signaling molecules in the central nervous system. Yet remarkably little is known about their spatiotemporal spread and biological activity. Here, we developed an integrated optical approach using Plasmonic nAnovesicles and cell&#8208;based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporter (CNiFER), or PACE, to probe neuropeptide signaling in the mouse neocortex. Small volumes (fL to pL) of exogenously supplied somatostatin&#8208;14 (SST) can be rapidly released under near&#8208;infrared light stimulation from nanovesicles implanted in the brain and detected by SST2 CNiFERs with nM sensitivity. Our measurements reveal reduced but synchronized SST transmission within 130&#8197;&#956;m, and markedly smaller and delayed transmission at longer distances. These measurements enabled a quantitative estimation of the SST loss rate due to peptide degradation and binding. PACE offers a new tool for determining the spatiotemporal scales of neuropeptide volume transmission and signaling in the brain.

         <title>Correlating Electrochemical Kinetic Parameters of Single LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 Particles with the Performance of Corresponding Porous Electrodes</title>

A physics&#8208;based model was developed to extract the solid&#8208;phase diffusion coefficient (Ds) and exchange current density (i0) from a single particle electrochemical impedance spectrum and then correlate these intrinsic parameters with the performance of porous electrodes.







Abstract
Characterizing microscale single particles directly is requested for dissecting the performance&#8208;limiting factors at the electrode scale. In this work, we build a single&#8208;particle electrochemical setup and develop a physics&#8208;based model for extracting the solid&#8208;phase diffusion coefficient (Ds) and exchange current density (i0) from electrochemical impedance measurements. We find that the carbon coating on the LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 surface enhances i0. In addition, Ds and i0 decay irreversibly by &#8776;25&#8201;% and &#8776;10&#8201;%, respectively, when the cutoff charge voltage increases from 4.3&#8197;V to 4.4&#8197;V. Moreover, we correlate intrinsic parameters of single particles with the performance of porous electrodes. Porous electrodes assembled with active particles with higher i0 values deliver a greater capacity and faster capacity fade. The methods developed in this combined experimental and theoretical work can be useful in correlating the single&#8208;particle scale and porous&#8208;electrode scale for other similar systems.

         <title>Crucial Roles of a Pendant Imidazole Ligand of a Cobalt Porphyrin Complex in the Stoichiometric and Catalytic Reduction of Dioxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>

A cobalt porphyrin complex with a pendant imidazole base ([(L1)CoII]) acts as a more efficient catalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to a cobalt porphyrin without the pendant imidazole base ([(L2)CoII]).







Abstract
A cobalt porphyrin complex with a pendant imidazole base ([(L1)CoII]) is an efficient catalyst for the homogeneous catalytic two&#8208;electron reduction of dioxygen by 1,1&#8242;&#8208;dimethylferrocene (Me2Fc) in the presence of triflic acid (HOTf), as compared with a cobalt porphyrin complex without a pendant imidazole base ([(L2)CoII]). The pendant imidazole ligand plays a crucial role not only to provide an imidazolinium proton for proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) from [(L1)CoII] to O2 in the presence of HOTf but also to facilitate electron transfer (ET) from [(L1)CoII] to O2 in the absence of HOTf. The kinetics analysis and the detection of intermediates in the stoichiometric and catalytic reduction of O2 have provided clues to clarify the crucial roles of the pendant imidazole ligand of [(L1)CoII] for the first time.

         <title>In situ Synthesis of Supramolecular Polymers: Finding the Right Conditions when Combining Covalent and Non&#8208;Covalent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent synthesis steps is promising to construct synthetic supramolecular systems. Yet, the fundamental principles that guide such an approach are barely understood. Here, the reaction behavior of in situ formed supramolecular polymers is studied, in which covalent reactions are intertwined with a non&#8208;covalent reaction network leading to an unexpected phase&#8208;separation behavior that determines the system composition.







Abstract
The combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent synthesis is omnipresent in nature and potentially enables access to new materials. Yet, the fundamental principles that govern such a synthesis are barely understood. Here, we demonstrate how even simple reaction mixtures behave surprisingly complex when covalent reactions are coupled to self&#8208;assembly processes. Specifically, we study the reaction behavior of a system in which the in situ formation of discotic benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomers is linked to an intertwined non&#8208;covalent reaction network including self&#8208;assembly into helical BTA polymers. This system shows an unexpected phase&#8208;separation behavior in which an interplay of reactant/product concentrations, side&#8208;products and solvent purity determines the system composition. We envision that these insights can bring us one step closer to how to design the synthesis of systems in a combined covalent/non&#8208;covalent fashion.

         <title>Spontaneous Resolution of Helical Building Blocks through the Formation of Homochiral Helices in Two Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetylalanine was made into a folded N&#8208;amidothiorea derivative containing a &#946;&#8208;turn and further modified with a halogen substituent (I, Br, Cl). Intermolecular halogen and hydrogen bonding, both across the turn structure, independently lead to supramolecular helices of homochirality orthogonal in two dimensions and thereby spontaneous resolution. Derivatives containing no halogen atom or a fluorine atom crystallize as racemic compounds.







Abstract
Spontaneous resolution leading to conglomerate crystals remains a significant challenge. Here we propose the formation of orthogonal homochiral supramolecular helices in at least two dimensions to allow spontaneous resolution. We suggest the design rationale that the chiral species is made into helical building blocks to allow the helix formation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, acetylalanine was made into a helical short azapeptide, its N&#8208;amidothiourea derivative containing a &#946;&#8208;turn structure, to which a halogen atom was further introduced at the phenylthiourea aromatic ring. The resultant folded species undergoes both intermolecular hydrogen and halogen bonding across the turn structure to form orthogonal intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded and halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular helices in two dimensions, and undergoes chiral resolution upon crystallization. Meanwhile, counterparts containing either an F&#8208;substituent with weak halogen bonding or no halogen atom crystallize as racemic compounds.

         <title>Protozeolite&#8208;Seeded Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Hierarchical Zeolites with Facet&#8208;Shaped Mesopores and Their Catalytic Application in Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Propylene Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protozeolite&#8208;seeded synthetic strategy was developed to construct single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with hexagonal&#8208;shaped mesopores faceted with a complete zeolite microporous framework. The as&#8208;prepared ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibit excellent hydrothermal stability and remarkably improved catalytic performance in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction compared to traditional hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 and other related zeolites.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites integrating intrinsic micropores with secondary meso&#8208; and/or macropores afford superior catalytic properties for enhanced mass transportation and more accessible active sites. The mesopores generated by using mesoporogens or framework etching are usually irregular with abundant defective sites and low hydrothermal stability. Here, using protozeolite nanoparticles as seeds, we succeeded in the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with hexagonal mesopores faceted by complete microporous frameworks. The protozeolites played a key role in the formation of faceted mesopores achieved via intraparticle ripening process. Thanks to the unique texture properties and more accessible acid sites at the open location, the as&#8208;prepared zeolites exhibited remarkedly long lifetime (18&#8197;h) and high propylene selectivity (52.7&#8201;%) with propylene/ethylene ratio of 3.64 in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction (WHSV=12.5&#8197;h&#8722;1) compared to the counterparts.

     alt="Protozeolite-Seeded Synthesis of Single-Crystalline Hierarchical Zeolites with Facet-Shaped Mesopores and Their Catalytic Application in Methanol-to-Propylene Conversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A protozeolite-seeded synthetic strategy was developed to construct single-crystalline hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with hexagonal-shaped mesopores faceted with a complete zeolite microporous framework. The as-prepared ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit excellent hydrothermal stability and remarkably improved catalytic performance in the methanol-to-propylene reaction compared to traditional hierarchical ZSM-5 and other related zeolites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical zeolites integrating intrinsic micropores with secondary meso- and/or macropores afford superior catalytic properties for enhanced mass transportation and more accessible active sites. The mesopores generated by using mesoporogens or framework etching are usually irregular with abundant defective sites and low hydrothermal stability. Here, using protozeolite nanoparticles as seeds, we succeeded in the synthesis of single-crystalline hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with hexagonal mesopores faceted by complete microporous frameworks. The protozeolites played a key role in the formation of faceted mesopores achieved via intraparticle ripening process. Thanks to the unique texture properties and more accessible acid sites at the open location, the as-prepared zeolites exhibited remarkedly long lifetime (18&#8197;h) and high propylene selectivity (52.7&#8201;%) with propylene/ethylene ratio of 3.64 in the methanol-to-propylene reaction (WHSV=12.5&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to the counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directional Laser from Solution&#8208;Grown Grating&#8208;Patterned Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal Microdisks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and facile solution&#8208;processed method was employed to fabricate grating&#8208;patterned MAPbBr3 perovskite single&#8208;crystal microdisks. The resulting whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode lasers showed excellent lasing performance and directional emission. Overall, the confined space single&#8208;crystal growth process provides a novel solution to fabricate surface&#8208;patterned microdisks.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed, high&#8208;gain, and wavelength&#8208;tunable perovskite single&#8208;crystal microdisk (PVKsc&#8208;MD) lasers have emerged as prospective coherent light sources in advanced nanophotonic designs. However, the inevitable multi&#8208;directional emission from a highly symmetrical cavity leads to low light collection efficiency which greatly hinders its application in integrated optical circuits. Here, we report on surface&#8208;patterned MAPbBr3 PVKsc&#8208;MDs synthesized by a cost&#8208;efficient bottom&#8208;up solution process employing spin&#8208;coating and confined&#8208;growth nanoimprinting. The patterned microdisks have high crystal quality with regular shape and sharp edges and nano&#8208;grating structure on the upper surface. This straightforward process yields surface&#8208;patterned PVKsc&#8208;MD lasers with a low lasing threshold and high quality (Q) factor. In addition, the grating structure patterned on the PVKsc&#8208;MDs reduces the original symmetry of the laser cavity, which improves the emission directionality four times.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of All&#8208;Carbon Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rhodium/diphosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon aromatic rings, anthracenes and naphthalenes, was reported, affording the axially chiral biaryl compounds by desymmetrization or kinetic resolution. Meanwhile, central&#8208;chiral cyclic compounds were also obtained by asymmetric hydrogenation of phenanthrenes. In addition, after simple conversion of the products, the axially chiral monophosphine ligands could be obtained.







Abstract
Compared with heteroarenes, homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon aromatic rings is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis due to the strong aromaticity and difficult enantioselective control. Herein, we report the rhodium/diphosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon aromatic rings, affording a series of axially chiral cyclic compounds with high enantioselectivity through desymmetrization or kinetic resolution. In addition, the central&#8208;chiral cyclic compounds were also obtained by asymmetric hydrogenation of phenanthrenes bearing a directing group. The key to success is the introduction of chiral diphosphine ligands with steric hindrance and strong electron&#8208;donating properties. The axially chiral monophosphine ligands could be obtained by simple conversion of the hydrogenation products bearing the phosphine atom.

A highly enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of simple unprotected indoles, pyrroles, and their common analogues such as furans, thiophenes, and benzofurans by arylvinylcarbene insertion to access unique heteroarene&#8208;containing chiral diarylmethine derivatives has been developed for the first time.

Abstract
A rhodium(I)&#8208;diene catalyzed highly enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of simple unprotected indoles, pyrroles, and their common analogues such as furans, thiophenes, and benzofurans with arylvinyldiazoesters has been developed for the first time. This transformation features unusual site&#8208;selectivity exclusively at the vinyl terminus of arylvinylcarbene and enables a reliable and rapid synthetic protocol to access a distinctive class of diarylmethine&#8208;bearing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters containing a one or two heteroarene&#8208;attached tertiary carbon stereocenter in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that, compared to the aniline substrate, the more electron&#8208;rich indole substrate lowers the C&#8722;C addition barrier and alters the rate&#8208;determining step to the reductive elimination, leading to different isotope effect.

         <title>Probe Synthesis Reveals Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor&#8197;1 Alpha&#8197;1 as the Anti&#8208;Pancreatic Cancer Target of BE&#8208;43547A2</title>

         <dc:description>
A probe based on SARs of BE&#8208;43547A2 was synthesized and used to investigate the targets of BE&#8208;43547A2. BE&#8208;43547A2 exerted its anticancer effects by specifically and covalently binding the cysteine234 of eukaryotic translation elongation factor&#8197;1 alpha&#8197;1 (eEF1A1). EEF1A1 plays an important role in regulating pancreatic cancer cell stemness. EEF1A1 expressions are closely correlated with clinicopathological grade and patient survival.







Abstract
The natural product, BE&#8208;43547A2, decreases pancreatic cancer cell stemness. However, its anticancer molecular mechanisms have not been fully established. Based on structure&#8211;activity relationships of BE&#8208;43547A2, we synthesized a probe and investigated its potential targets using an in situ click reaction. We found that BE&#8208;43547A2 exerts its anticancer effects by covalently binding the cysteine234 (C234) residue of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1). This binding mode was confirmed by a series of experiments including a xenograft mouse model. We also determined that eEF1A1 plays an important role in regulating pancreatic cancer cell stemness. Analyses of 99 clinical pancreatic cancer samples revealed that eEF1A1 expressions are closely correlated with clinicopathological grade and patient survival. In conclusion, eEF1A1 is involved in pancreatic cancer progression and is therefore, a promising novel covalent target for pancreatic cancer treatment.

         <title>Modulating Ti t2g Orbital Occupancy in a Cu/TiO2 Composite for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/TiO2 composite with excellent electronic structure of t2g orbital&#8208;occupied Ti was realized by adjusting the combination extent using a photo&#8208;deposition method. This electronic structure of t2g orbital&#8208;occupied Ti originating from the electronic synergistic effect of copper favors charge transport. The optimized Cu/TiO2 composite exhibits a productivity of 15.27&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high selectivity of 95.9&#8201;% for CO.







Abstract
The electronic structure of composites plays a critical role in photocatalytic conversion, whereas it is challenging to modulate the orbital for an efficient catalyst. Herein, we regulated the t2g orbital occupancy state of Ti to realize efficient CO2 conversion by adjusting the amount of photo&#8208;deposited Cu in the Cu/TiO2 composite. For the optimal sample, considerable electrons transfer from the Cu d orbital to the Ti t2g orbital, as proven by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The Raman spectra results also corroborate the electron enrichment on the Ti t2g orbital. Further theoretical calculations suggested that the orbital energy of the Ti 3d orbital in TiO2 is declined, contributing to accepting Cu 3d electrons. As a result, the Cu/TiO2 composite exhibited an extremely high selectivity of 95.9&#8201;% for CO, and the productivity was 15.27&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is almost 6&#8197;times that of the original TiO2. Our work provides a strategy for designing efficient photocatalysis as a function of orbital regulation.

         <title>Diversification of Aryl Sulfonyl Compounds through Ligand&#8208;Controlled meta&#8208; and para&#8208;C&#8722;H Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable meta&#8208; or para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of aryl sulfonyl compounds was enabled by the use of computationally designed ligands and iridium catalysis. The possibility to borylate these previously hardly accessible positions of aryl sulfones and aryl sulfonamides enriches the synthetic toolbox for remote C&#8722;H functionalization. Further diversifications of the introduced Bpin as well as the original sulfonyl groups were also demonstrated.







Abstract
Aryl sulfones and aryl sulfonamides are of great importance in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Although ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl sulfonyl compounds has been extensively explored, the functionalization of remote meta&#8208; and para&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds is very rare. Herein, we report a tunable meta&#8208; and para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of aryl sulfonyl compounds enabled by computationally designed ligands and iridium catalyst. This method is capable of accommodating a broad range of substrates under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale preparation can be achieved with iridium catalyst loading as low as 0.1&#8197;mol%. As the introduced boronate group can be easily converted into many other groups, our method provides a general solution to installing functional groups at either meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of aryl sulfones and aryl sulfonamides with good to excellent selectivity.

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Oxy Halides Enabled by Thermal Catalysis, Photocatalysis, Electrocatalysis, or Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of methods to access alcohol derivatives is one of the main concerns of considerable research. Herein, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxy halides is reported with a series of C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp)&#8208;electrophiles, including aryl halides, vinyl bromides, alkynyl bromides, and acyl chlorides with the use of a metal reductant, photocatalysis, electrochemistry, and mechanochemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we report a reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxy halides, simply generated from aldehydes, with a series of C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp)&#8208;electrophiles. A wide range of aryl and heteroatom aryl halides, vinyl bromides, alkynyl bromides, and acyl chlorides react with unhindered and hindered aldehyde&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;oxy halides by providing protected alcohols as well as &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. Noteworthy, the reductive couplings are achieved not only through thermal catalysis with the use of metal reductants but also by photocatalysis, electrochemistry, and mechanochemistry. The unrestricted interchange of the four strategies indicates their underlying mechanistic similarities. The generation of NiI intermediate is proposed to be the key point for ketyl radical formation via a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) event, which was rationalized by an array of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Membrane Transport in Polymeric Cell&#8208;Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric cell&#8208;mimics have been developed that exhibit light&#8208;driven adaptive behavior. Spiropyran&#8208;based modulators integrated into giant polymersomes controlled the permeability of the cell&#8208;mimics to external molecular signals. The photoactivated polymersomes were used to create biomimetic reactors and systems that mimic the adaptive formation of biological condensates in natural cells.







Abstract
Giant polymersomes are versatile and stable biomimetic compartments that are ideal for building cell&#8208;like systems. However, the transport of hydrophilic molecules across the membrane, which controls the function of cell&#8208;like systems, is limited by the low permeability of polymeric bilayers. Therefore, mechanisms to control the permeability of polymersomes are necessary to create functional cell&#8208;like systems. Here, we describe the design of giant polymersomes equipped with spiropyran&#8208;based permeability modulators. Photo&#8208;isomerization of the modulators leads to perturbation of the polymer membrane, resulting in increased permeability. The photoactivated polymersomes were used to construct two cell&#8208;like systems controlled by light&#8208;activated transport of hydrophilic molecules. First, we designed an enzymatic micro&#8208;reactor activated by light irradiation. Second, we constructed a hybrid coacervate&#8208;in&#8208;polymersome system that mimics the adaptive formation of biological condensates in cells.

         <title>Hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;Based Deep Blue&#8208;Emissive Metallacages as Donors for Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB)&#8208;based metallacages showing intense deep blue emission both in solution and the solid state were prepared via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly. They can serve as donors for light&#8208;harvesting systems using a naphthalimide derivative (NAP) as the acceptor, thus offering bright emission for NAP in the solid state.







Abstract
We herein report the preparation of a series of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB)&#8208;based deep blue&#8208;emissive metallacages via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These metallacages feature prismatic structures with HPB derivatives as the faces and tetracarboxylic ligands as the pillars, as evidenced by NMR, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed by employing the metallacages as the donor and a naphthalimide derivative (NAP) as the acceptor, owing to their good spectral overlap. The judiciously chosen metallacage serves as the antenna, providing the suitable energy to excite the non&#8208;emissive NAP, and thus resulting in bright emission for NAP in the solid state. This study provides a type of HPB&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacage and explores their applications as energy donors to light up non&#8208;emissive fluorophores in the solid state, which will advance the development of emissive metallacages as useful luminescent materials.

     alt="Hexaphenylbenzene-Based Deep Blue-Emissive Metallacages as Donors for Light-Harvesting Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB)-based metallacages showing intense deep blue emission both in solution and the solid state were prepared via multicomponent self-assembly. They can serve as donors for light-harvesting systems using a naphthalimide derivative (NAP) as the acceptor, thus offering bright emission for NAP in the solid state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We herein report the preparation of a series of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB)-based deep blue-emissive metallacages via multicomponent coordination-driven self-assembly. These metallacages feature prismatic structures with HPB derivatives as the faces and tetracarboxylic ligands as the pillars, as evidenced by NMR, mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction analysis. Light-harvesting systems were further constructed by employing the metallacages as the donor and a naphthalimide derivative (NAP) as the acceptor, owing to their good spectral overlap. The judiciously chosen metallacage serves as the antenna, providing the suitable energy to excite the non-emissive NAP, and thus resulting in bright emission for NAP in the solid state. This study provides a type of HPB-based multicomponent emissive metallacage and explores their applications as energy donors to light up non-emissive fluorophores in the solid state, which will advance the development of emissive metallacages as useful luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Crystalline Coordination Catalyst for Hybrid Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of electrons from electron&#8208;rich metal clusters (oxidation active sites) to electron&#8208;deficient metalloporphyrins (reduction active sites) leads to stronger oxidizability of Ni8 clusters and stronger reducibility of metalloporphyrin. The enhanced oxidizability of Ni8 and reducibility of metalloporphyrin, therefore, result in improved methanol electrooxidation and CO2 electroreduction with the bifunctional crystalline coordination catalyst.







Abstract
Hybrid CO2 electroreduction (HCER) is recognized as an important strategy to improve the total value of redox products and energy conversion efficiency. In this work, a coordination catalyst model system (Ni8&#8208;TET with active oxidation sites, Ni&#8208;TPP with active reduction sites and PCN&#8208;601 with redox&#8208;active sites) for HCER was established for the first time. Especially, PCN&#8208;601 can complete both anodic methanol oxidation and cathodic CO2 reduction with FEHCOOH and FECO over 90&#8201;%. The performance can be further improved with light irradiation (FE nearly 100&#8201;%). DFT calculations reveal that the transfer of electrons from NiII8 clusters to metalloporphyrins under electric fields results in the raised oxidizability of Ni8 clusters and the raised reducibility of metalloporphyrin, which then improves the electrocatalytic performance. This work serves as a well&#8208;defined model system and puts forward a new design idea for establishing efficient catalysts for hybrid CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Orthogonal Access to &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;Branched/Linear Aliphatic Amines by Catalyst&#8208;Tuned Regiodivergent Hydroalkylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified protocol for Ni/Co&#8208;catalyzed remote and regiodivergent hydroalkylations of alkenyl amines has been established, providing orthogonal access to &#945;&#8208;branched, &#946;&#8208;branched, and linear aliphatic amines. This catalytic protocol features the reliable prediction and control of the coupling position of alkylation to provide orthogonal access to aliphatic amines with diverse scaffolds from identical starting materials.







Abstract
Linear, &#945;&#8208;branched, and &#946;&#8208;branched aliphatic amines are widespread in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fine chemicals. Thus, the development of direct and efficient methods to these structures in a tunable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Herein, a catalyst&#8208;controlled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched, &#946;&#8208;branched and linear aliphatic amines from Ni/Co&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective hydroalkylations of alkenyl amines with alkyl halides is developed. This catalytic protocol features the reliable prediction and control of the coupling position of alkylation to provide orthogonal access to &#945;&#8208;branched, &#946;&#8208;branched and linear alkyl amines from identical starting materials. This platform unlocks orthogonal reactivity and selectivity of nickel hydride and cobalt hydride chemistry to catalytically repurpose three types of alkyl amines under mild conditions.

         <title>Intramolecular Tricarbonyl&#8208;Ene Reactions and &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Diketone Rearrangements Inspired by the Biosynthesis of Polycyclic Polyprenylated Acylphloroglucinols</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical speculation on the biosynthesis of some complex meroterpenoids led to the discovery of intricate cascades that feature spontaneous intramolecular carbonyl&#8208;ene reactions, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketone rearrangements, and intramolecular aldol reactions. The combination of these transformations allowed divergent access to four distinct natural product scaffolds from a common intermediate, mimicking their proposed biosynthetic pathways.







Abstract
Structurally unique natural products pose biosynthetic puzzles whose solution can inspire new chemical reactions. Herein, we propose a unified biosynthetic pathway towards some complex meroterpenoids&#8212;the hyperireflexolides, biyoulactones, hybeanones and hypermonones. This hypothesis led to the discovery of uncatalyzed, intramolecular carbonyl&#8208;ene reactions that are spontaneous at room temperature. We also developed an anionic cascade reaction featuring an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketone rearrangement and an intramolecular aldol reaction to access four distinct natural product scaffolds from a common intermediate.

         <title>PlyAB Nanopores Detect Single Amino Acid Differences in Folded Haemoglobin from Blood
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamics of single haemoglobin molecules trapped in the biological nanopore PlyAB are studied with single&#8208;channel recording experiments and computational modelling. This approach enabled the differentiation of several haemoglobin variants, including haemoglobin from healthy adults (HbA) and sickle cell anaemia haemoglobin (HbS), with near 100&#8201;% accuracy and allowed for the quantification of haemoglobin directly from blood.







Abstract
The real&#8208;time identification of protein biomarkers is crucial for the development of point&#8208;of&#8208;care and portable devices. Here, we use a PlyAB biological nanopore to detect haemoglobin (Hb) variants. Adult haemoglobin (HbA) and sickle cell anaemia haemoglobin (HbS), which differ by just one amino acid, were distinguished in a mixture with more than 97&#8201;% accuracy based on individual blockades. Foetal Hb, which shows a larger sequence variation, was distinguished with near 100&#8201;% accuracy. Continuum and Brownian dynamics simulations revealed that Hb occupies two energy minima, one near the inner constriction and one at the trans entry of the nanopore. Thermal fluctuations, the charge of the protein, and the external bias influence the dynamics of Hb within the nanopore, which in turn generates the unique ionic current signal in the Hb variants. Finally, Hb was counted from blood samples, demonstrating that direct discrimination and quantification of Hb from blood using nanopores, is feasible.

         <title>Explaining Regiodivergent Vinylations with Vinylbenziodoxolones
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first mechanistic investigation of vinylbenziodoxolone (VBX) vinylations is reported, using NMR studies, deuterium labelling and computations. Monodent nucleophiles react with VBX through a ligand coupling pathway to give internal alkenes, whereas terminal alkenes form with ambident nucleophiles through a Michael&#8208;type addition mechanism. The findings can be used to predict the regioselectivity in VBX vinylations of other nucleophiles.







Abstract
Vinylbenziodoxolones have recently been identified as efficient hypervalent iodine(III) reagents for electrophilic vinylations under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Their unique reactivity allows synthesis of either internal or terminal alkenes, depending on the nucleophile class. This paper constitutes the first mechanistic investigation of VBX vinylations, and makes use of NMR studies, deuterium labelling and computations to rationalize the observed regio&#8208; and stereochemical outcome. Internal alkene formation in S&#8208;vinylation was found to proceed through the ligand coupling mechanism typical of diaryliodonium salts, whereas terminal alkene formation in P&#8208;vinylations took place via a phosphinous acid&#8208;coordinated VBX complex, which underwent concerted deprotonation and Michael&#8208;type addition. Subsequent base&#8208;assisted protonation and E2 elimination delivered the terminal alkene. The findings can be used to predict the regioselectivity in vinylations of other nucleophile classes.

         <title>Radiotherapy&#8208;Induced Cleavage of Quaternary Ammonium Groups Activates Prodrugs in Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water radiolysis can generate many reactive particles, such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrated electrons (e&#8722;aq). A radiation&#8208;induced e&#8722;aq&#8208;mediated cleavage reaction based on a quaternary ammonium structure, which can precisely release a prodrug in vitro and in vivo, has been developed as a chemical tool for the future application of radiochemotherapy.







Abstract
Cleavage chemistry offers a new chance to activate chemotherapeutic prodrugs in a tumor&#8208;selective manner, yet developing spatiotemporally controllable cleavage chemistry with deep tissue penetration is still a great challenge. Herein, we present a novel radiotherapy&#8208;triggered cleavage chemistry that enables controlled drug release in tumors. Quaternary ammonium groups are identified as masking groups that can be efficiently removed by hydrated electrons (e&#8722;aq) from water radiolysis. The subsequently released tertiary amines can be anti&#8208;cancer toxins or readily release functional molecules via 1,6&#8208;elimination. This radiotherapy&#8208;induced cleavage works successfully in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, showing remarkable treatment efficacy when the mice are given carfilzomib prodrug and radiotherapy. This strategy provides a new perspective for combinational radiochemotherapy, which is the first&#8208;line treatment for over 50&#8201;% of cancer patients.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed MoOx on Rhodium Metallene Boosts Electrocatalyzed Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of atomically dispersed MoOx species anchored on Rh metallene using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method is reported. The resulting structures expose the oxide&#8208;metal interfaces to the maximum extent. This leads to a MoOx&#8208;Rh catalyst with ultrahigh alkaline activity in the electrocatalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Accelerating slow water dissociation kinetics is key to boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. We report the synthesis of atomically dispersed MoOx species anchored on Rh metallene using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method. The resulting structures expose the oxide&#8208;metal interfaces to the maximum extent. This leads to a MoOx&#8208;Rh catalyst with ultrahigh alkaline HER activity. We obtained a mass activity of 2.32&#8197;A&#8201;mgRh&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 50&#8197;mV, which is 11.8&#8197;times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and surpasses the previously reported Rh&#8208;based electrocatalysts. First&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate that the interface between MoOx and Rh is the active center for alkaline HER. The MoOx sites preferentially adsorb and dissociate water molecules, and adjacent Rh sites adsorb the generated atomic hydrogen for efficient H2 evolution. Our findings illustrate the potential of atomic interface engineering strategies in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Polymer&#8211;Cluster Interactions Enable Dramatic Thermal Stiffening Hydrogels for Mechanoadaptive Smart Fabrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropy&#8208;mediated polymer&#8211;cluster interactions are explored to fabricate thermal stiffening mineral hydrogels with a dramatic stiffening response. Owing to the occurrence of solid&#8211;liquid phase separation, the hydrogel demonstrates an unprecedented modulus enhancement of 13000&#8197;times upon heating. The stiffening response can be further utilized by mineral hydrogel&#8208;based smart fabrics, which freely adjust their stiffness at different temperatures.







Abstract
Thermal stiffening materials that are naturally soft but adaptively self&#8208;strengthen upon heat are intriguing for load&#8208;bearing and self&#8208;protection applications at elevated temperatures. However, to simultaneously achieve high modulus change amplitude and high mechanical strength at the stiffened state remains challenging. Herein, entropy&#8208;mediated polymer&#8211;mineral cluster interactions are exploited to afford thermal stiffening hydrogels with a record&#8208;high storage modulus enhancement of 13&#8201;000&#8197;times covering a super wide regime from 1.3&#8197;kPa to 17&#8197;MPa. Such a dramatic thermal stiffening effect is ascribed to the transition from liquid&#8208;liquid to solid&#8211;liquid phase separations, and at the molecular level, driven by enhanced polymer&#8211;cluster interactions. The hydrogel is further processed into sheath&#8211;core fibers and smart fabrics, which demonstrate self&#8208;strengthening and self&#8208;powered sensing properties by co&#8208;weaving another liquid metal fiber as both the joule heater and triboelectric layer.

         <title>Highly Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue &#960;&#8208;Stacked Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Multi&#8208;Stimulus Response Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter has been developed that possesses a rigid &#960;&#8208;stacked configuration with intramolecular through&#8208;space interactions. This emitter exhibits solvatochromism, piezochromism, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) under different external stimuli.







Abstract
Organic materials with multi&#8208;stimulus response (MSR) properties have demonstrated many potential and practical applications. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;stacked thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material with multi&#8208;stimulus response (MSR) properties, named SDMAC, was designed and synthesized using distorted 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine as a donor. SDMAC possesses a rigid &#960;&#8208;stacked configuration with intramolecular through&#8208;space interactions and exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE), solvatochromic, piezochromic, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) under different external stimuli. The rigid molecular structure and efficient TADF properties of SDMAC can be used in displays and lighting. Using SDMAC as an emitter, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is as high as 28.4&#8201;%, which make them the most efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs based on the through&#8208;space charge transfer strategy. The CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) exhibit circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals.

         <title>Spatially Controlled CO2 Conversion Kinetics in Natural Leaves for Motion Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural CO2 conversion is triggered with high spatial control by shining light on precision&#8208;tailored pristine leaves. The site&#8208;selective evolution of oxygen under irradiation is used to generate motion of all&#8208;natural macro&#8208; and microswimmers.







Abstract
Living systems that can spontaneously exhibit directional motion belong to diverse classes such as bacteria, sperm and plankton. They have fascinated scientists in recent years to design completely artificial or biohybrid mobile objects. Natural ingredients, like parts of plants, have been used to elaborate miniaturized dynamic objects, which can move when they are combined with other, non&#8208;natural, building blocks. Herein, we report that the precise structural tailoring of natural plant leaves allows generating a spatially predefined and confined release of oxygen gas, due to the conversion of carbon dioxide. This constitutes the driving force for generating motion, which is solely due to the respiration of leaves by photosynthesis. The rate of gas evolution can be fine&#8208;tuned by changing the light intensity and the leaf size, allowing ultimately to control the motility of objects with dimensions ranging from the millimeter to the micrometer scale.

         <title>A Resonating B, N Covalent Bond and Coordination Bond in Aromatic Compounds and Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compound with a resonance hybrid of B, N single and coordination bonds is reported. The organoboron compound is very stable and shows a narrow band gap. The effect of a resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N moiety on opto&#8208;electronic properties and the molecular packing behavior of the compound is disclosed.







Abstract
We herein report an organoboron compound (SBN&#8208;1) based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N units with a balanced resonance hybrid of B, N single bond (B&#8722;N) and B, N coordination bond (B&#8592;N). Despite the different chemical environments of the two nitrogen atoms in the N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, the single&#8208;crystal structure reveals that the two B, N bonds have similar bond lengths of ca. 1.55&#8197;&#197; and are almost equivalent. The resonance nature of the two B, N bonds contributes to the excellent chemical stability and photostability of SBN&#8208;1. The N&#8722;B&#8592;N units in SBN&#8208;1 show a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing capability and large dipole, resulting in a red&#8208;shifted absorption spectrum, downshifted LUMO/HOMO energy levels, and drastically altered molecular packing behaviors in solid state. SBN&#8208;1 can be used as a building block to construct small band gap conjugated polymers. The resonance of B, N bonds discovered in this work provides new insight into the design of stable organoboron small molecules and polymers for practical applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Divergent Syntheses of Oxindoles and &#945;&#8208;Arylacylamides via Controllable Construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N Bonds by Copper and Piezoelectric Materials</title>

A mechanoredox strategy merging piezoelectric materials and copper catalysis via ball milling is disclosed, enabling the divergent syntheses of oxindoles and &#945;&#8208;arylacylamides with high efficiency and regioselectivity. Experimental results and DFT calculations rationalized the radical pathway of the mechanoredox reaction that was initiated by the highly polarized piezoelectric particles under mechanical agitation.







Abstract
Herein, we present the divergent syntheses of &#945;&#8208;arylacylamides and oxindoles via mechanoredox chemistry by using easily accessible &#945;&#8208;bromo N&#8208;sulfonyl amides as starting materials. Our system consists of a catalytic amount of CuII precatalyst and piezoelectric materials. The highly polarized BaTiO3 or PbTiO3 under mechanical agitation can act as an electron donor to realize the recycling of CuII and CuI. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations have been performed to support the proposed mechanistic rationale for the cascade reactions.

         <title>Achieving over 18&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cell Enabled by a ZnO&#8208;Based Hybrid Electron Transport Layer with an Operational Lifetime up to 5&#8197;Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hybrid electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) ZnO/NMA was developed, when combined with D18&#8201;:&#8201;N3, the highest power conversion efficiency (18.20&#8201;%) among inverted single&#8208;junction organic solar cells was achieved with an operational lifetime of 5&#8197;years. The hybrid ETL approach represents an important forward step for the commercial application of OSCs.







Abstract
Although organic solar cells (OSCs) have delivered an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19&#8201;%, most of them demonstrated rather limited stability. So far, there are hardly any effective and universal strategies to improve stability of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs. Herein, we developed a hybrid electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) in inverted OSCs using ZnO and a new modifying agent (NMA), and significantly improved the stability and PCEs for all the tested devices. In particular, when applied in the D18&#8201;:&#8201;N3 system, its inverted OSC exhibits so far the highest PCE (18.20&#8201;%) among inverted single&#8208;junction OSCs, demonstrating an extrapolated T80 lifetime of 7572&#8197;h (equivalent to 5&#8197;years under outdoor exposure). This is the first report with T80 over 5000&#8197;h among OSCs with over 18&#8201;% PCE. Furthermore, a high PCE of 16.12&#8201;% can be realized even in a large&#8208;area device (1&#8197;cm2). This hybrid ETL strategy provides a strong stimulus for highly prospective commercialization of OSCs.

         <title>DNA Tile Self&#8208;Assembly Guided by Base Excision Repair Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of DNA polymeric tubular structures guided by the activity of two base excision repair (BER) enzymes: uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) is demonstrated. Orthogonal DNA tiles were designed that can be specifically activated by each enzyme and assembled into DNA co&#8208;polymers with highly predictable tile distribution.







Abstract
We demonstrate here the use of DNA repair enzymes to control the assembly of DNA&#8208;based structures. To do so, we employed uracil&#8208;DNA glycosylase (UDG) and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), two enzymes involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We designed two responsive nucleic acid modules containing mutated bases (deoxyuridine or 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroguanine recognized by UDG and Fpg, respectively) that, upon the enzyme repair activity, release a nucleic acid strand that induces the self&#8208;assembly of DNA tiles into tubular structures. The approach is programmable, specific and orthogonal and the two responsive modules can be used in the same solution without crosstalk. This allows to assemble structures formed by two different tiles in which the tile distribution can be accurately predicted as a function of the relative activity of each enzyme. Finally, we show that BER&#8208;enzyme inhibitors can also be used to control DNA&#8208;tile assembly in a specific and concentration&#8208;dependent manner.

The approach is programmable, specific and orthogonal and the two responsive modules can be used in the same solution without crosstalk. This allows to assemble structures formed by two different tiles in which the tile distribution can be accurately predicted as a function of the relative activity of each enzyme. Finally, we show that BER-enzyme inhibitors can also be used to control DNA-tile assembly in a specific and concentration-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast A&#8208;Site Cation Cross&#8208;Exchange at Room Temperature: Single&#8208;to Double&#8208; and Triple&#8208;Cation Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The A&#8208;cation cross&#8208;exchange between perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) is found to be as fast as the halide exchange in the presence of excess A&#8208;oleate complexes in the colloidal solution. The synthesis of a wide range of mixed (double and triple)&#8208;cation and mixed halide perovskite NCs is demonstrated. The mixed A&#8208;cations were found to be uniformly distributed across the crystal lattice and they do not segregate under intense light illumination.







Abstract
We report here fast A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange between APbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) made of different A&#8208;cations (Cs (cesium), FA (formamidinium), and MA (methylammonium)) at room temperature. Surprisingly, the A&#8208;cation cross&#8208;exchange proceeds as fast as the halide (X=Cl, Br, or I) exchange with the help of free A&#8208;oleate complexes present in the freshly prepared colloidal perovskite NC solutions. This enabled the preparation of double (MACs, MAFA, CsFA)&#8208; and triple (MACsFA)&#8208;cation perovskite NCs with an optical band gap that is finely tunable by their A&#8208;site composition. The optical spectroscopy together with structural analysis using XRD and atomically resolved high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) STEM indicates the homogeneous distribution of different cations in the mixed perovskite NC lattice. Unlike halide ions, the A&#8208;cations do not phase&#8208;segregate under light illumination.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters has been accomplished, which is selective for the most sterically hindered boronic ester. High regioselectivities were achieved through a facile radical 1,2&#8208;boron shift process, wherein the initially generated primary &#946;&#8208;boryl radical is rapidly converted to the thermodynamically more stable secondary radical before nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;deboronative cross&#8208;couplings of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters are valuable methods for the synthesis of functionalized organoboron compounds. However, such cross&#8208;couplings are limited to reaction of the sterically less hindered primary boronic ester. Herein, we report a nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;deboronative arylation of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters that is selective for coupling of the more sterically hindered secondary/tertiary position. This is achieved by taking advantage of a 1,2&#8208;boron shift of primary &#946;&#8208;boryl radicals to the thermodynamically favored secondary/tertiary radicals, which are subsequently intercepted by the nickel catalyst to enable arylation. The mild conditions are amenable to a broad range of aryl halides to give &#946;&#8208;aryl boronic ester products in good yields and with high regioselectivity. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters to give trans&#8208;substituted products.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts with Integrated Oxidation and Reduction Atomic Active Centers for Improved CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn and Co bimetallic hetero&#8208;single&#8208;atoms were introduced in carbon nitride photocatalysts as redox&#8208;active sites for CO2 conversion. The construction of a bimetallic single atom as a redox site greatly promotes the separation and transfer of charges, thereby exhibiting an excellent CO2 conversion performance.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom active&#8208;site catalysts have attracted significant attention in the field of photocatalytic CO2 conversion. However, designing active sites for CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation simultaneously on a photocatalyst and combining the corresponding half&#8208;reaction in a photocatalytic system is still difficult. Here, we synthesized a bimetallic single&#8208;atom active&#8208;site photocatalyst with two compatible active centers of Mn and Co on carbon nitride (Mn1Co1/CN). Our experimental results and density functional theory calculations showed that the active center of Mn promotes H2O oxidation by accumulating photogenerated holes. In addition, the active center of Co promotes CO2 activation by increasing the bond length and bond angle of CO2 molecules. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the atomic active centers, the synthesized Mn1Co1/CN exhibited a CO production rate of 47&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than that of the corresponding single&#8208;metal active&#8208;site photocatalyst.

         <title>The Direct Mechanocatalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Reaction of Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing polymer milling vessels and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding, direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki coupling was conducted successfully without abrading the palladium catalyst. Various target molecules were synthesized in good yields within 1&#8197;h. In situ XRD and parameter studies provided deep insight into the mechanism of direct mechanocatalysis.







Abstract
The molecular Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction was conducted mechanochemically, without solvents, ligands, or catalyst powders. Utilizing one catalytically active palladium milling ball, products could be formed in quantitative yield in as little as 30&#8197;min. In contrast to previous reports, the adjustment of milling parameters led to the complete elimination of abrasion from the catalyst ball, thus enabling the first reported systematic catalyst analysis. XPS, in situ XRD, and reference experiments provided evidence that the milling ball surface was the location of the catalysis, allowing a mechanism to be proposed. The versatility of the approach was demonstrated by extending the substrate scope to deactivated and even sterically hindered aryl iodides and bromides.

The fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation&#8208;related ligase FadD and thiolases FadA/FadI in E. coli can utilise phenylpropionic acid derivatives as starting substrates for the biosynthesis of styrylpyrones through iterative non&#8208;decarboxylative Claisen condensation steps. Targeted feeding experiments led to the detection of styrylpyrones in other species, suggesting that the ubiquitous &#946;&#8208;oxidation pathway enables the synthesis of such molecules in bacteria.







Abstract
Naturally occurring &#945;&#8208;pyrones with biological activities are mostly synthesised by polyketide synthases (PKSs) via iterative decarboxylative Claisen condensation steps. Remarkably, we found that some enzymes related to the fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation pathway in Escherichia coli, namely the CoA ligase FadD and the thiolases FadA and FadI, can synthesise styrylpyrones with phenylpropionic acids in vivo. The two thiolases directly utilise acetyl&#8208;CoA as an extender unit for carbon&#8208;chain elongation through a non&#8208;decarboxylative Claisen condensation, thus making the overall reaction more efficient in terms of carbon and energy consumption. Moreover, using a cell&#8208;free approach, different styrylpyrones were synthesised in vitro. Finally, targeted feeding experiments led to the detection of styrylpyrones in other species, demonstrating that the intrinsic ability of the &#946;&#8208;oxidation pathway allows for the synthesis of such molecules in bacteria, revealing an important biological feature hitherto neglected.

         <title>Umpolung of an Aliphatic Ketone to a Magnesium Ketone&#8208;1,2&#8208;diide Complex with Vicinal Dianionic Charge</title>

The magnesium(I) complex of a new &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand formed with 2&#8208;adamantanone a magnesium ketone&#8208;1,2&#8208;diide complex with vicinal dianionic charge. The reactivity of aliphatic ketone reductions is explained via ketone&#8208;1,2&#8208;diide intermediates including facile CH activations.







Abstract
The new &#946;&#8208;diketimine iPrDipnacnacH, HC(iPrCNDip)2H, Dip=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3, was converted to the magnesium(I) complex [{(iPrDipnacnac)Mg}2] and reaction with 2&#8208;adamantanone (OAd) afforded the ketone&#8208;1,2&#8208;diide complex [{(iPrDipnacnac)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OAd)]. The complex contains the first stable dianion of an aliphatic ketone with an electropositive metal and shows an OAd2&#8722; unit with long C&#8722;O bond and pyramidal carbon centre. DFT studies reveal an anionic charge on both neighbouring C and O atoms. Reductions of aliphatic ketones with magnesium(I) complexes show that these likely proceed via highly reactive dianions and afforded a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of an alkoxide and an enolate when an enolisable ketone was used, and rapid CH activations reactions, e.g., of stabilising ligand moieties, when non&#8208;enolisable ketones were employed.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulated Pathway&#8208;Dependent Chirality Control of Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface interactions allow control over the handedness in intrinsically chiral silver nanoclusters. The intracluster interaction affords the formation of nanoclusters with the thermodynamically preferred handedness, which could be kinetically prevented by the introduction of intercluster interactions leading to nanoclusters with the opposite handedness.







Abstract
Imparting chirality affords additive values, functions and responsiveness in molecular systems including nanoscale materials. Here, we report pathway&#8208;dependent chirality control in silver nanoclusters (NCs). The use of enantiomeric ligand, &#945;&#8208;dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), for the synthesis of Ag NCs leads to the preferential formation of one&#8208;handed chiral Ag29(DHLA)12 NCs with intrinsic chirality in the exterior shell composed of a silver&#8208;dithiolate framework. Small Lewis base molecules such as pyridine bind to silver atoms in the shell of NC as a guest. The guest binding reverses the relative stability between the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed NCs upon a steric interaction with the chiral ligand DHLA in the exterior shell in a kinetic manner, leading to unprecedented chirality inversion in the synthesis of NCs. This mechanism is further extended to the self&#8208;regulation or self&#8208;replication of chirality through interNC interactions dependent on the concentration in the synthesis of NCs.

Abstract
The development of a mild and general method for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of cyclic amines has been an ongoing challenge. In this work, we describe the copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkynylation of unactivated cyclic 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;benzamide under photo&#8208;irradiation by intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The employment of a new bisoxazoline diphenylamine ligand, in conjunction with 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol, which significantly improved the reduction potential of the copper complex, was the key to success of this chemistry. Mechanistic and computational studies supported that the new copper complex served the dual role as a photoredox and coupling catalyst, the reaction went through a radical process, and the intramolecular 1,5&#8208;HAT process was involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step. Apart from the broad substrate scope including unprecedented benzocyclic amines, this method also showed excellent diastereoselectivity in 2&#8208;monosubstituted cyclic amines via substrate control.

         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective coordination assembly of metal&#8208;phenolic capsules results in distinct cross&#8208;linking density and structures, which enables control over the physicochemical properties of the capsules, including thickness, permeability, size, and pH&#8208;dependent degradability. Our work provides a pathway for the design of structurally tunable coordination materials.







Abstract
Coordination states of metal&#8208;organic materials are known to dictate their physicochemical properties and applications in various fields. However, understanding and controlling coordination sites in metal&#8208;organic systems is challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of site&#8208;selective coordinated metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) using flavonoids as coordination modulators. The site&#8208;selective coordination was systematically investigated experimentally and computationally using ligands with one, two, and multiple different coordination sites. Tuning the multimodal Fe coordination with catechol, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups within the MPNs enabled the facile engineering of diverse physicochemical properties including size, selective permeability (20&#8211;2000&#8197;kDa), and pH&#8208;dependent degradability. This study expands our understanding of metal&#8208;phenolic chemistry and provides new routes for the rational design of structurally tailorable coordination&#8208;based materials.

         <title>The Influence of Strain on the Rotation of an Artificial Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of ring strain on the 360&#176; operation of a light&#8208;driven rotary molecular motor was investigated by constraining the motor unit in macrocyclic structures of various sizes. It was found that two of the four steps of a rotational cycle are significantly affected by chemical strain.







Abstract
In artificial small&#8208;molecule machines, molecular motors can be used to perform work on coupled systems by applying a mechanical load&#8212;such as strain&#8212;that allows for energy transduction. Here, we report how ring strain influences the rotation of a rotary molecular motor. Bridging the two halves of the motor with alkyl tethers of varying sizes yields macrocycles that constrain the motor's movement. Increasing the ring size by two methylene increments increases the mobility of the motor stepwise and allows for fine&#8208;tuning of strain in the system. Small macrocycles (8&#8211;14 methylene units) only undergo a photochemical E/Z isomerization. Larger macrocycles (16&#8211;22 methylene units) can perform a full rotational cycle, but thermal helix inversion is strongly dependent on the ring size. This study provides systematic and quantitative insight into the behavior of molecular motors under a mechanical load, paving the way for the development of complex coupled nanomachinery.

Tissue&#8208;transparent red light is used to release oleic acid, a signaling lipid, into cells, which induces Ca2+ oscillations accompanied by a turn&#8208;on fluorescence response. In their Communication (e202205855), Tom&#225;&#353; Slanina and co&#8208;workers show that &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY photocages substituted with sulfonate groups can selectively target inner or outer membranes and release carboxylic acid upon red&#8208;light illumination.

         <dc:description>
Supported gold nanoparticle catalysts have attracted growing interest in aerobic oxidation reactions. In their Research Article (e202205873), Kazuya Yamaguchi, Kosuke Suzuki et&#8197;al. describe a method for the design of supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts using negatively charged multivacant polyoxometalates. The electronic states of the catalysts can be sequentially modulated, and the catalyst prepared using [SiW9O34]10&#8722; acted as a reusable heterogeneous catalyst, showing superior catalytic activity and enhanced stability compared to conventional catalysts.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Directing the Morphology, Packing, and Properties of Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Cation Exchange (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Predicting crystal morphologies is challenging because of the many factors influencing their growth. Dan Oron, Michal Lahav, Milko E. van&#8197;der&#8197;Boom, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate in their Research Article (e202205238) how metal cation exchange in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) results in a series of chiral crystals having a similar morphology, packing, and a rare space group (P622). The fact that the crystals maintain their morphology facilitates a quantitative comparison of their optical and magnetic properties. The metal cation exchange is likely to be mediated by differently sized nanochannels.

Natural CO2 conversion can be triggered with high spatial control by shining light on precision&#8208;tailored pristine leaves, as reported by Alexander Kuhn et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202205298). The perfectly site&#8208;selective evolution of oxygen under irradiation, symbolized by the bubbles released at the extremity of a leaf positioned at the air/water interface of a mountain lake, is used to generate significant motion of such all&#8208;natural macro&#8208; and microswimmers.

         <title>Miniaturized Chemical Tags for Optical Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview covers some of the recent advances in the development of small chemical tags for optical bioimaging, from their chemical synthesis and characterization to their application in different biological systems, such as cells, tissues and whole organisms. It focuses on the design of fluorescent and Raman labels and features examples of metabolites, amino acids, nucleic acids as well as organelle and cell&#8208;targeting probes.







Abstract
Recent advances in optical bioimaging have prompted the need for minimal chemical reporters that can retain the molecular recognition properties and activity profiles of biomolecules. As a result, several methodologies to reduce the size of fluorescent and Raman labels to a few atoms (e.g., single aryl fluorophores, Raman&#8208;active triple bonds and isotopes) and embed them into building blocks (e.g., amino acids, nucleobases, sugars) to construct native&#8208;like supramolecular structures have been described. The integration of small optical reporters into biomolecules has also led to smart molecular entities that were previously inaccessible in an expedite manner. In this article, we review recent chemical approaches to synthesize miniaturized optical tags as well as some of their multiple applications in biological imaging.

Solid&#8208;state materials as functional electrolytes surpass liquid counterparts as next&#8208;generation energy sources. This Review summarizes recent advances in design strategies, synthesis approaches, conducting properties, and underlying mechanisms for ionic conducting metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ionic conductors are compelling alternatives to liquid electrolytes in clean energy&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;storage technologies. The development of novel ionic conducting materials is one of the most critical challenges for next&#8208;generation energy technologies. Several advancements in design strategies, synthetic approaches, conducting properties, and underlying mechanisms for ionic conducting metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been made over the past five years; however, despite the recent, considerable expansion of related research fields, there remains a lack of systematic overviews. Here, an extensive introduction to ionic conducting performance for MOFs with different design strategies is provided, focusing primarily on ion mobility with the aid of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or solvated ionic charge. Furthermore, current theories on ion conducting mechanisms in different regimes are comprehensively summarized to provide an understanding of the underlying working principles in complex, realistic systems. Finally, challenges and future research directions at the forefront of ionic conducting MOF technologies are outlined.

         <title>In Situ Real&#8208;Time Nanoscale Resolution of Structural Evolution and Dynamics of Fluorescent Self&#8208;Assemblies by Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
In situ real&#8208;time imaging of the dynamic process of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dyes at the nanoscale was performed and their internal structures were inspected with minimum 2.8&#8197;nm localization accuracy through single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging. This revealed the heterogeneity and dynamics of the three different assemblies in situ.







Abstract
The visualization of self&#8208;assembled structure and dynamics at the molecular level has become a powerful method to understand structure&#8211;function relationships of self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we in situ real&#8208;time imaged the dynamic process of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dyes at the nanoscale and inspected their internal structure with minimum 2.8&#8197;nm localization accuracy through single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging. We monitored the growth process of three different assemblies in situ, which possessed highly heterogeneous dynamics with different shapes and growth rates. Furthermore, diverse growth rates were also found at different sites in the same assembly. These results highlight the application of super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques for real&#8208;time visualization of internal assembled structure and dynamics in situ.

         <title>Alcohols as Alkylating Agents in the Cation&#8208;Induced Formation of Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of HFIP as a solvent enables the stereoselective preparation of substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines from an acyclic precursor. The process is triggered by a cation generated from an alcohol in situ and leads to the simultaneous generation of both a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;N bond. Note that either 2,3&#8208;trans&#8208; or 2,3&#8208;cis&#8208;substituted heterocycles can be obtained at will by using a nucleophilic amine bearing different substituents.







Abstract
A Ti(Oi&#8208;Pr)4 promoted 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclisation to make nitrogen heterocycles is presented. The utilisation of HFIP as a key solvent enables the stereoselective preparation of di&#8208; &amp; tri&#8208;substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines while forming a new C&#8722;C bond at the same time. The process is triggered by a cationic intermediate generated from an allylic or benzylic alcohol and leads to the simultaneous generation of both a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;N bond in a single step. Notably, either 2,3&#8208;trans&#8208; or 2,3&#8208;cis&#8208;substituted heterocycles can be obtained by using a nucleophilic amine bearing different substituents. Lastly, the stereoselective synthesis of enantiopure products was achieved by using readily available enantiopure acyclic starting materials.

The utilisation of HFIP as a key solvent enables the stereoselective preparation of di- &amp; tri-substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines while forming a new C&#8722;C bond at the same time. The process is triggered by a cationic intermediate generated from an allylic or benzylic alcohol and leads to the simultaneous generation of both a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;N bond in a single step. Notably, either 2,3-&lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt; or 2,3-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-substituted heterocycles can be obtained by using a nucleophilic amine bearing different substituents. Lastly, the stereoselective synthesis of enantiopure products was achieved by using readily available enantiopure acyclic starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isolation of an Arsenic Diradicaloid with a Cyclic C2As2&#8208;Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C2As2&#8208;cyclic diradicaloid 6 is isolated as a red crystalline solid via 2e&#8208;reduction of 5&#8201;a. Calculations suggest a singlet ground state for 6, which is 0.34&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher than the broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet solution. The HOMO of 6 is located at the arsenic atoms and is trans&#8208;annular antibonding, while the LUMO is trans&#8208;annular bonding and spans over the C2As2C2&#8208;framework. Reactivity studies of 6 are shown with (PhSe)2 and Fe2(CO)9.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity studies of the first cyclic C2As2&#8208;diradicaloid {(IPr)CAs}2 (6) (IPr = C{N(Dipp)CH}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Treatment of (IPr)CH2 (1) with AsCl3 affords the Lewis adduct {(IPr)CH2}AsCl3 (2). Compound 2 undergoes stepwise dehydrochlorination to yield {(IPr)CH}AsCl2 (3) and {(IPr)CAsCl}2 (5&#8201;a) or [{(IPr)CAs}2Cl]OTf (5&#8201;b). Reduction of 5&#8201;a (or 5&#8201;b) with magnesium turnings gives 6 as a red crystalline solid in 90% yield. Compound 6 featuring a planar C2As2 ring is diamagnetic and exhibits well resolved NMR signals. DFT calculations reveal a singlet ground state for 6 with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 8.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The diradical character of 6 amounts to 20% (CASSCF, complete active space self consistent field) and 28% (DFT). Treatments of 6 with (PhSe)2 and Fe2(CO)9 give rise to {(IPr)CAs(SePh)}2 (7) and {(IPr)CAs}2Fe(CO)4 (8), respectively.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence&#8208;Boosted Escape of DNAzyme from Endosomes for Enhanced Gene&#8208;Silencing Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An upconversion luminescence&#8208;controlled strategy is reported for efficient delivery of therapeutic DNAzyme via NIR light&#8208;boosted endosomal escape. The system enables enhanced gene&#8208;silencing efficacy and combinational therapeutic outcome, thus providing a robust approach to overcome current limitations of DNAzyme delivery.







Abstract
Despite the enormous potential of DNAzyme for gene therapy, its efficacy is hampered by the limited endosomal escape capability. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNAzyme delivery platform to achieve enhanced gene&#8208;silencing efficacy. The nanoplatform is composed of therapeutic DNAzyme, photosensitizers (PSs) and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that can convert NIR light to visible light. The system allows NIR light&#8208;activatable generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species due to the energy transfer from the UCNPs to PSs, which boosts the endosomal escape of DNAzyme for an improved gene&#8208;silencing efficacy. We demonstrate that the nanocomposites represent a promising platform to integrate DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy with NIR light&#8208;triggered photodynamic therapy for combinational tumor treatment. This work highlights a robust approach to combat the current limitations of DNAzyme delivery systems.

         <title>Circularly and Linearly Polarized Luminescence from AIE Luminogens Induced by Super&#8208;Aligned Assemblies of Sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different optical functions were achieved by regulating the structures of the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens)&#8211;sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowire (SNW) co&#8208;assemblies. The helical and parallel co&#8208;assembly of AIEgens and SNWs lead to circularly polarized luminescence and linearly polarized luminescence activity, respectively.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowires (SNWs) combine the properties of inorganic materials and polymers. They can be highly oriented through assembly, and can also be easily processed. Meanwhile, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) show high potential for optical applications, but they are usually hard to process. The combination of SNWs and AIEgens can enrich both of their applications. In this study, we report that the fluorescence emission intensity of the AIEgens&#8211;SNW dispersion is dramatically enhanced due to the flexibility of SNWs. Furthermore, we fabricate two kinds of functional films with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL) activities. The construction of CPL materials didn't require any chiral chemicals. The construction of LPL materials didn't require an additional stretching process. As a result, we endowed common achiral AIEgens with a high dissymmetry factor of 0.033 and a polarization ratio of 0.44, respectively.

         <title>The Close Interaction of a C&#8722;F Bond with an Amide Carbonyl: Crystallographic and Spectroscopic Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered system possessing an exceptionally tight C&#8722;F&#8208;amide interaction is presented, which allows spectroscopic, crystallographic, and kinetic details of a distinctive, biochemically relevant chemical system to be obtained for the first time. The Lewis acid coordination, C&#8722;F bond promotion of amide isomerization, enantiomerization, and ion protonation processes are explored.







Abstract
The putative interaction of a C&#8722;F bond with an amide carbonyl has been an intriguing topic of interest in this century for reasons spanning basic physical organic chemistry to biochemistry. However, to date, there exist no examples of a close, well&#8208;defined interaction in which its unique aspects can be identified and exploited. Herein, we finally present an engineered system possessing an exceptionally tight C&#8722;F&#8208;amide interaction, allowing us to obtain spectroscopic, crystallographic, and kinetic details of a distinctive, biochemically relevant chemical system for the first time. In turn, we also explore Lewis acid coordination, C&#8722;F bond promotion of amide isomerization, enantiomerization, and ion protonation processes.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Chemical Recycling of CO2&#8208;Based Alicyclic Polycarbonates via Catalytic Pyrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic pyrolysis of various CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates in bulk recovers epoxide monomers quantitatively using a simple CrIII&#8208;Salen catalyst. It even proceeds very efficiently for chemical recycling of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) from a plastic waste mixture and thus provides a closed&#8208;loop approach towards a circular plastic economy in applications of CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of polymers to their constituent monomers is the foremost challenge in building a sustainable circular plastics economy. Here, we report a strategy for highly efficient depolymerization of various CO2&#8208;based alicyclic polycarbonates to epoxide monomers in solvent&#8208;free conditions by a simple CrIII&#8208;Salen complex mediated catalytic pyrolysis process. The chemical recycling of the widely studied poly(cyclohexene carbonate) exhibits excellent reactivity (TOF up to 3000&#8197;h&#8722;1, 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading) and high epoxide monomer selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigation reveals that the process proceeds in a sequential fashion via a trans&#8208;carbonate intermediate.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule CRISPR Machines for Spatially Resolved Searching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule CRISPR machine is developed that can perform spatially resolved DNA cleavage via either free or localized searching modes. When triggered at a specific site on the DNA origami with nanoscale accuracy, the free searching mode leads to searching activity that gradually decays with the distance, whereas the localized mode generates spatially&#8208;confined searching activity.







Abstract
Repurposing the RNA&#8208;guided endonuclease Cas9 to develop artificial CRISPR molecular machines represents a new direction toward synthetic molecular information processing. The operation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9&#8208;based machines, nevertheless, relies on the molecular recognition of freely diffused sgRNA/Cas9, making it practically challenging to perform spatially regulated localized searching or navigation. Here, we develop a DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule CRISPR machine that can perform spatially resolved DNA cleavage via either free or localized searching modes. When triggered at a specific site on the DNA origami with nanoscale accuracy, the free searching mode leads to searching activity that gradually decays with the distance, whereas the localized mode generates spatially&#8208;confined searching activity. Our work expands the function of CRISPR molecular machines and lays foundations to develop integrated molecular circuits and high&#8208;throughput nucleic acid detection.

         <title>Allenamide&#8208;Initiated Cascade [2+2+2] Annulation Enabling the Divergent Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Deoxoapodine, (&#8722;)&#8208;Kopsifoline&#8197;D and (&#177;)&#8208;Melotenine&#8197;A</title>

         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective [2+2+2] annulation was developed for the construction of the core structure of aspidosperma alkaloids in up to 90&#8201;% yield with &gt;99/1 dr and &gt;99/1 Z/E selectivity. This indium(III)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of allenamide&#8208;functionalized indoles with dimethyl methylenemalonate provided efficient synthetic access to (&#8722;)&#8208;deoxoapodine, (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsifoline&#8197;D and (&#177;)&#8208;melotenine&#8197;A.







Abstract
A facile method for the construction of the aspidosperma core from indoles functionalized with a nonterminal N&#8208;allenamide and dimethyl methylenemalonate is described. Various polysubstituted tetracyclic spiroindolines (27 examples) were afforded in good yields (61&#8211;90&#8201;%) with &gt;99/1 dr and &gt;99/1 Z/E selectivity under mild conditions. The annulation reaction provides straightforward access to the tetracyclic spiroindoline skeleton with substituents at the C5 position occurring in many natural products. As an application of this reaction, the total synthesis of three important natural products, (&#8722;)&#8208;deoxoapodine, (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsifoline&#8197;D and (&#177;)&#8208;melotenine&#8197;A, was possible in short routes from tryptamine.

         <title>Red&#8208;Shifted Water&#8208;Soluble BODIPY Photocages for Visualisation and Controllable Cellular Delivery of Signaling Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY photocages are presented. They can selectively target inner or outer cell membranes and release signaling lipids upon red&#8208;light illumination, inducing Ca2+ signaling. The solvent&#8208;dependent uncaging mechanism and orthogonal uncaging in the presence of a coumarin&#8208;caged lipid is reported.







Abstract
In this work, we developed a water&#8208;soluble caging group based on a &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY scaffold able to release carboxylate&#8208;containing cargo upon red light illumination (&#955;irr=633&#8197;nm). We performed mechanistic studies showing new insights into the principles of the photoreactivity of these cages and demonstrated a significant influence of the structure of a carboxylate cargo on the rate and efficiency of the uncaging process and its side reactions. We used it for selective delivery, visualisation, and photorelease of a signaling lipid in cell plasma and internal membranes. With this approach, we successfully induced Ca2+ release in cells expressing the GPR40 receptor.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Bis&#8208;NHC Ligand and Coinage Metal Ions: Unprecedented Metal&#8208;Driven Chemistry between the Tri&#8208; and Tetranuclear Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (bis&#8208;HNC) ligands and AgI ions has been shown to lead to the formation of tri&#8208; and tetranuclear AgI&#8722;NHC complexes that are in equilibrium in solution. Importantly, this process is exclusive for AgI ions: slow exchange from the tetra&#8208; to the trinuclear species is detected with the analogous AuI complexes, whereas no such phenomena is observed for the corresponding CuI complexes.







Abstract
The discrete multinuclear AgI&#8722;NHC complexes [Agn(1)n)](X)n; (n=3 or 4, X=BF4, PF6), synthesized from a bis&#8208;NHC ligand 1 and AgI ions via multiligand self&#8208;assembly, were observed to be in equilibrium between two forms (tri&#8208; and tetranuclear) in solution on the NMR timescale, which is unprecedented in CNHC&#8208;donor based chemistry. The existence of both the species was confirmed by various studies such as NMR (1H, VT, 2D&#8208;DOSY) and ESI&#8208;MS analysis along with concentration studies. Importantly, replacing AgI with other coinage metals (AuI and CuI) was found to alter the phenomenon entirely: a slow exchange from the tetra&#8208; to trinuclear species was noticed for the AuI complexes (4&#8201;a,&#8201;b), whereas no such process was detected in case of the CuI complexes (5&#8201;a,&#8201;b).

&lt;/sub&gt;; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=3 or 4, X=BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), synthesized from a bis-NHC ligand &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ions via multiligand self-assembly, were observed to be in equilibrium between two forms (tri- and tetranuclear) in solution on the NMR timescale, which is unprecedented in C&lt;sub&gt;NHC&lt;/sub&gt;-donor based chemistry. The existence of both the species was confirmed by various studies such as NMR (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, VT, 2D-DOSY) and ESI-MS analysis along with concentration studies. Importantly, replacing Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; with other coinage metals (Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;) was found to alter the phenomenon entirely: a slow exchange from the tetra- to trinuclear species was noticed for the Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes (&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;), whereas no such process was detected in case of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Lactamization of Tosyl&#8208;Protected Aliphatic Amides Using a Practical Oxidant</title>

PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H lactamization of aliphatic amides is reported. This protocol features the use of practical and inexpensive oxidants and protecting groups, mild conditions, and reliable scalability. Further derivatization of &#946;&#8208;lactam products enables synthesis of a range of biologically important motifs such as &#946;&#8208;amino acid, &#947;&#8208;amino alcohol, and azetidine.







Abstract
The development of C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions that use common protecting groups and practical oxidants remains a significant challenge. Herein we report a monoprotected aminoethyl thioether (MPAThio) ligand&#8208;enabled &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H lactamization of tosyl&#8208;protected aliphatic amides using tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the sole oxidant. This protocol features exceedingly mild reaction conditions, reliable scalability, and the use of practical oxidants and protecting groups. Further derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;lactam products enables the synthesis of a range of biologically important motifs including &#946;&#8208;amino acids, &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols, and azetidines.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Tuned Rotation of Pyrazolyl Rings in a 2D Iron(II) Complex towards Synergetic Magnetic and Dielectric Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) polymer [FeII(dpa)][(pzTp)FeIII(CN)3]2 (1) was designed. It showed the synergetic switching of magnetism and dielectricity with high responsivity owing to enhanced cooperativity of FeII ions and coupled rotational movements of polar pyrazolyl groups.







Abstract
Materials showing synergy of magnetic and dielectric transitions are promising candidates for future molecular devices. The challenge is how to realize synergy between spin and dielectric transitions with responses to external stimuli. Herein, we design a 2D spin crossover (SCO) complex, [FeII(dpa)][(pzTp)FeIII(CN)3]2 (1) (dpa=1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethyne and pzTp=tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate). The local structural changes about the FeII ion were propagated to the whole crystal through the rigid bridging ligands (dpa), leading to elastic interactions to realize the abrupt SCO and rotational movements of polar apical pyrazolyl rings in the [(pzTp)FeIII(CN)3]&#8722; units. Dielectric measurements confirmed a substantial dielectric change (&#916;&#1013;&#8242;=2.3) upon the spin transition. This work provides a rational strategy to couple the spin transition and rotation of polar components, which is crucial for the synergetic switch of magnetism and dielectricity.

         <title>Efficient 1400&#8211;1600&#8197;nm Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Tuned Chiral Erbium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel chiral Er complexes of the iPrPyBox ligand, which have extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, show strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) between 1400 and 1600&#8197;nm. CPL activity in this region, despite being particularly rare, opens the way to potential applications in the domain of fiber&#8208;optic telecommunications, free&#8208;space long&#8208;distance optical communication and bioimaging.







Abstract
Novel chiral Er complexes based on both enantiomers of extended iPrPyBox (2,6&#8208;Bis[4&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)]pyridine) show strong near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) within the 1400 to 1600&#8197;nm spectral region under 450&#8197;nm irradiation. CPL activity in this region, despite being particularly rare, would open the way to potential applications in the domain, e.g., of fiber&#8208;optic telecommunications and free&#8208;space long&#8208;distance optical communications employing circularly polarized light. Moreover, the long wavelength excitation is advantageous for applications in the field of (circularly polarized) microscopy and bioimaging.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of 9&#8208;Phenanthrols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly enantioselective hydrogenation of 9&#8208;phenanthrols promoted by a base has been successfully realized using a chiral Ru(diamine) catalyst, affording a facile access to the optically active 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;ols with excellent results (up to 98&#8201;% yield, &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
The enantioselective hydrogenation of arenols to corresponding chiral cyclic alcohols remains a challenge because of their aromaticity and the difficulty in controlling the regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. In this work, the first highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation of 9&#8208;phenanthrols has been successfully realized under mild conditions via trapping the unstable keto tautomers. The method provides a facile access to a range of chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;ols with up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. The hydrogenation pathway includes base&#8208;promoted tautomerization of 9&#8208;phenanthrols and Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of the in situ generated unstable keto tautomers.

         <title>Unveiling Hetero&#8208;Enyne Reactivity of Aryliminoboranes: Dearomative Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented hetero&#8208;enyne reactivity of aryliminoboranes, which allows for facile dearomative Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;like reactions with aldehydes, is reported. This cycloaddition features mild conditions, is catalyst&#8208;free, and has a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Kinetic and computational studies reveal its second&#8208;order reaction and concerted cyclization mechanism.







Abstract
Being isoelectronic with alkynes, iminoboranes with a polar B&#8801;N triple bond have been exclusively investigated as a potent 1,2&#8208;dipole in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we disclose the unprecedented reactivity of aryliminoboranes via the BNCC &#960; conjugation, namely hetero&#8208;enyne behavior. This allows for facile dearomative Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;like reactions of aryliminoboranes with aldehydes. This cycloaddition features mild conditions, is catalyst&#8208;free, and has a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Kinetic and computational studies reveal its second&#8208;order reaction and concerted cyclization mechanism. This report unveils new synthetic application of iminoboranes beyond their classical reaction patterns.

         <title>Reversible Insulator&#8211;Metal Transition by Chemical Doping and Dedoping of a Mott Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical carrier doping of an x&#8208;LiPc molecular Mott insulator (Pc=phthalocyanine) induced an insulator&#8211;metal transition, and the obtained metallic x&#8208;LiPcI reverted to the pristine x&#8208;LiPc Mott insulator through dedoping iodine. The advent of the reversible insulator&#8211;metal transition by doping and dedoping of the molecular Mott insulator could lead to a new class of strongly correlated materials.







Abstract
The chemical carrier doping of molecular Mott insulators has been poorly investigated to date due to its difficulty. In this study, iodine doping of a molecular Mott insulator, lithium phthalocyanine crystallized in the x&#8208;form (x&#8208;LiPc), was performed to obtain metallic x&#8208;LiPcI. Crystal structure analysis revealed that iodine atoms penetrated channels of x&#8208;LiPc and formed one&#8208;dimensional chains. The Raman spectroscopy of x&#8208;LiPcI indicated the existence of linear I5&#8722;, demonstrating a transition from a half&#8208;filled band of the Mott insulating state to a 2/5&#8208;filled band of the metallic state. Electrical resistivity measurements confirmed the metallic nature of x&#8208;LiPcI, whereas a thermally activated behavior was observed for pristine x&#8208;LiPc. Furthermore, the x&#8208;LiPc Mott insulator was reproduced by dedoping iodine from x&#8208;LiPcI, suggesting that the electronic state can be reversibly tuned between the Mott insulating and metallic states by chemical doping and dedoping.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Array&#8208;Guided Protein Assembly Enhances Synthetic mRNA Switch Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Output signal noise, resulting from leaky protein expression, hampers the ability of synthetic mRNA switches to accurately manipulate cellular functions. Using an aptamer array as a scaffold to guide the formation of a functional protein assembly, a readout control module was designed that only allows output signal generation when the output protein is expressed in a sufficiently large amount to facilitate self&#8208;assembly on the aptamer array. Synthetic mRNA switches with this module exhibit low&#8208;to&#8208;no signal noise and better performance in cells.







Abstract
Synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) switches are powerful synthetic biological tools that can sense cellular molecules to manipulate cell fate. However, their performances are limited by high output signal noise due to leaky output protein expression. Here, we designed a readout control module that disables protein leakage from generating signal. Aptamer array on the switch guides the inactive output protein to self&#8208;assemble into functional assemblies that generate output signal. Leaky protein expression fails to saturate the array, thus produces marginal signal. In this study, we demonstrated that switches with this module exhibit substantially lower signal noise and, consequently, higher input sensitivity and wider output range. Such switches are applicable for different types of input molecules and output proteins. The work here demonstrates a new type of spatially guided protein self&#8208;assembly, affording novel synthetic mRNA switches that promise accurate cell manipulation for biomedical applications.

         <title>Injectable Granular Hydrogels as Colloidal Assembly Microreactors for Customized Structural Colored Objects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable granular hydrogel microreactor was constructed for colloidal assembly and further used for 3D printing of custom&#8208;designed structural colored objects. The granular hydrogels show excellent magnetochromic properties with additional shear&#8208;thinning, and self&#8208;healing behaviors, with the potential to build macroscopic optical materials and devices on&#8208;demand.







Abstract
While structural coloration has captured considerable interests across different areas in the past decades, the development of macroscopic objects with tailorable structural colors remains a challenge due to the difficulty of large&#8208;scale fabrication of finely ordered nanostructures and poor processability of their constituent materials. In this work, a type of photonic granular hydrogel is developed as a novel printable ink for constructing customized structural colored objects. The magnetochromatic ink exhibits dynamic properties such as shear thinning and self&#8208;healing, enabling direct writing of macroscopic structural colored patterns by extrusion 3D printing. Further, the modularity of the photonic ink allows additive color mixing, which obviates the need for arduous nano&#8208;synthesis and expands on the color abundance of structural colored materials in a simple yet efficient manner. These characteristics grant novel photonic inks with great applicability to a variety of fields including switchable color displays, sensors, etc.

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Raman Optical Activity in an Organic Molecular Lemniscate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman optical activity (ROA) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have been detected, in a single Raman experiment, for enantiomers of a lemniscular cycloparaphenylene&#8208;based molecule stabilized by a bicarbazole unit. The balance between the rigidity of the chiral bicarbazole core and the torsional flexibility of the oligophenylene loops is able to stimulate magnetically allowed transitions detectable by conventional spectroscopic devices.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and Raman optical activity (ROA) were observed in a single spectroscopic experiment for a purely organic molecule, an event that had so far been limited to lanthanide&#8208;based complexes. The present observation was achieved for [16]cycloparaphenylene lemniscate, a double macrocycle constrained by a rigid 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole subunit, which introduces a chirality source and allows the molecule to be resolved into two configurationally stable enantiomers. Distortion of oligophenylene loops in this lemniscular structure produces a large magnetic transition dipole moment while maintaining the &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;induced enhancement of the Raman signal, causing the appearance of the CPL/ROA couple. A two&#8208;photon mechanism is proposed to explain the population of the lowest&#8208;energy excited electronic state prior to the simultaneous emission&#8208;scattering event.

         <title>Anionic N18 Macrocycles and a Polynitrogen Double Helix in Novel Yttrium Polynitrides YN6 and Y2N11 at 100&#8197;GPa</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction between yttrium and molecular nitrogen at 100&#8197;GPa under laser heating at 3000&#8197;K yields two novel compounds, YN6 and Y2N11. Their crystal structures feature a unique organization of nitrogen atoms: an anionic N18 macrocycle and a polynitrogen double helix, respectively.







Abstract
Two novel yttrium nitrides, YN6 and Y2N11, were synthesized by direct reaction between yttrium and nitrogen at 100&#8197;GPa and 3000&#8197;K in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. High&#8208;pressure synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that the crystal structures of YN6 and Y2N11 feature a unique organization of nitrogen atoms&#8212;a previously unknown anionic N18 macrocycle and a polynitrogen double helix, respectively. Density functional theory calculations, confirming the dynamical stability of the YN6 and Y2N11 compounds, show an anion&#8208;driven metallicity, explaining the unusual bond orders in the polynitrogen units. As the charge state of the polynitrogen double helix in Y2N11 is different from that previously found in Hf2N11 and because N18 macrocycles have never been predicted or observed, their discovery significantly extends the chemistry of polynitrides.

         <title>Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Relaxation through Single&#8208;Atom Metal Modification for Enhanced Fluorescence Efficiency in Molybdenum Disulfide Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Au modification of molybdenum disulfide quantum dots (MoS2 QDs) will induce a new defect energy level of Au in the forbidden band that can trap excess electrons in n&#8208;type MoS2, which increases the radiative recombination probability of conduction band electrons with valence band holes of MoS2. Thus, 4&#8208;fold enhanced fluorescence efficiency of MoS2 QDs is achieved through single&#8208;atom Au modification.







Abstract
To enhance the fluorescence efficiency of semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs), strategies via enhancing photo&#8208;absorption and eliminating non&#8208;radiative relaxation have been proposed. In this study, we demonstrate that fluorescence efficiency of molybdenum disulfide quantum dots (MoS2 QDs) can be enhanced by single&#8208;atom metal (Au, Ag, Pt, Cu) modification. Four&#8208;fold enhancement of the fluorescence emission of MoS2 QDs is observed with single&#8208;atom Au modification. The underlying mechanism is ascribed to the passivation of non&#8208;radiative surface states owing to the new defect energy level of Au in the forbidden band that can trap excess electrons in n&#8208;type MoS2, increasing the recombination probability of conduction band electrons with valence band holes of MoS2. Our results open an avenue for enhancing the fluorescence efficiency of QDs via the modification of atomically dispersed metals, and extend their scopes and potentials in a fundamental way for economic efficiency and stability of single&#8208;atom metals.

         <title>A Field&#8208;Independent Method for the Rapid Generation of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Clean Water Solutions for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Para&#8208;hydrogen, molecular synthesis, pulse sequence design and effective purification practices merge into a rapid method to hyperpolarize magnetic resonance probes, such as [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate, in neat water solutions in portable systems.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization methods in magnetic resonance enhance the signals by several orders of magnitude, opening new windows for real&#8208;time investigations of dynamic processes in vitro and in vivo. Here, we propose a field&#8208;independent para&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;based pulsed method to produce rapidly hyperpolarized 13C&#8208;labeled substrates. We demonstrate the method by polarizing the carboxylic carbon of the pyruvate moiety in a purposely designed precursor to 24&#8201;% at &#8776;22&#8197;mT. Following a fast purification procedure, we measure 8&#8201;% polarization on free [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate in clean water solutions at physiological conditions at 7&#8197;T. The enhanced signals allow real&#8208;time monitoring of the pyruvate&#8208;lactate conversion in cancer cells, demonstrating the potential of the method for biomedical applications in combination with existing or developing magnetic resonance technologies.

         <title>Dynamics of Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation on Silicon Electrodes Revealed by Combinatorial Electrochemical Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 34, August 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) enables combinatorial electrochemical assessment of a broad experimental space for solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on Si electrodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries, which is correlated to the heterogeneous and dynamic SEI chemistry through co&#8208;located shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticles for enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS).







Abstract
Revealing how formation protocols influence the properties of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Si electrodes is key to developing the next generation of Li&#8208;ion batteries. SEI understanding is, however, limited by the low&#8208;throughput nature of conventional characterisation techniques. Herein, correlative scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticles for enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) are used for combinatorial screening of the SEI formation under a broad experimental space (20 sets of different conditions with several repeats). This novel approach reveals the heterogeneous nature and dynamics of the SEI electrochemical properties and chemical composition on Si electrodes, which evolve in a characteristic manner as a function of cycle number. Correlative SECCM/SHINERS has the potential to screen thousands of candidate experiments on a variety of battery materials to accelerate the optimization of SEI formation methods, a key bottleneck in battery manufacturing.

         <title>Characterization of a Proposed Terminal Iron(III) Nitride Intermediate of Nitrogen Fixation Stabilized by a Trisphosphine&#8208;Borane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terminal iron nitrides (Fe&#8801;N) have been proposed as in&#8208;termediates of Fe&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, and well&#8208;defined synthetic iron nitrides have been characterized in high oxidation states, including Fe(IV), Fe(V), and Fe(VI). This study reports the generation and low temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B = tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl)borane), which is a proposed intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation by the P3BFe&#8208;catalyst system. CW&#8208; and pulse EPR spectroscopy (HYSCORE and ENDOR), supported by DFT calculations, help to define a 2A ground state electronic structure of this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride species, placing the unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8208;Fe&#8208;N vector; this electronic structure is distinct for an iron nitride. The unusual d5&#8208;configuration is stabilized by significant delocalization (~50%) of the unpaired electron onto the axial boron and nitrogen ligands, with a majority of the spin residing on boron.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogenation of Electron&#8208;Poor Alkenes and Dienes Enabled by a Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydride Addition/Protonolysis Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes is a well&#8208;developed technology used on lab scale as well as on large scales in the chemical industry. Site&#8208; and chemoselective mono&#8208;hydrogenations of polarized conjugated dienes remain challenging. Instead, stoichiometric main&#8208;group hydrides are used rather than H  2  . As part of an effort to develop a scalable route to prepare geranylacetone, we discovered that Rh(CO)  2  acac/xantphos based catalysts enable the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes, enones, and other polyunsaturated substrates. D&#8208;labeling and DFT studies support a mechanism where a nucleophilic Rh(I)&#8208;hydride selectively adds to electron&#8208;poor alkenes and the resulting Rh&#8208;enolate undergoes subsequent inner&#8208;sphere protonation by alcohol solvent. The finding that (L  n  )Rh(H)(CO) type catalysts can enable selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes provides a valuable tool in the design of related chemoselective hydrogenation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Doping of Flexible Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite&#8208;Polymer Thick Membranes for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray detectors have broad applications in medicine and industry. Although flexible lead&#8208;free perovskite films are competitive because of their lightweight and low toxicity, they are less efficient due to low charge transport. Herein, we report low&#8208;toxicity, flexible X&#8208;ray detectors based on p&#8208;type doped MA3Bi2I9 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite&#8208;filled membranes (PFMs). Strong coordination between dopant 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ) and MA3Bi2I9 and the establishment of charge&#8208;transfer complex (CPX) improved the conductivity by four times. The flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieved a high sensitivity of 2065 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71 nGyair s&#8208;1, which is among the highest values in all environmentally friendly flexible X&#8208;ray detectors. Importantly, the PFMs retained excellent charge transport under mechanical stress. All of those make flexible MA3Bi2I9 membranes more competitive as next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;Coordinated Nickel N4Ni1O2 Site Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H2O2 electrosynthesis catalyst containing super&#8208;coordinated single nickel sites, that is, ones coordinated by four nitrogen and two O atoms (i.e., N4Ni1O2) on carboxyl functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes is developed. It gives a 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a cathodic energy efficiency of approximately 82&#8201;% and a H2O2 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of around 96&#8201;% at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from O2 on single&#8208;atom catalysts has attracted great attention, yet the quest for robust catalysts is driven by achieving &gt;90&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) under industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Herein we synthesize a catalyst that contains single nickel site coordinated by four nitrogen and two oxygen atoms (i.e., N4Ni1O2) via involving carboxyl functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes as a substrate to provide extra O coordination to the regular NiN4 site. It has a cathodic energy efficiency of approximately 82&#8201;% and a H2O2 FE of around 96&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density, outperforming the reported single&#8208;atom catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Heck Reaction of N&#8208;Heteroaryl Halides for the Concise Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Heteroaryl&#8208;substituted Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heck reaction between N&#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic olefins has been accomplished by adopting either a P, P=O&#8208;based ligand or (S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS, leading to the formation of a variety of nonchiral or chiral &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;substituted heterocycles.







Abstract
The Heck reaction between N&#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic alkenes provides a convenient approach to biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl functionalized heterocycles, yet reactions of this type have been challenging due to strong N&#8208;heteroaryl coordination to palladium metal, which causes catalyst poisoning. In this report, an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction between N&#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic olefins is established, leading to a variety of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl substituted heterocycles. The method features an unprecedented broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. The employment of a sterically bulky P, P=O ligand containing an anthryl moiety is crucial for this transformation due to the coordinative unsaturation facilitated by its steric bulkiness. The asymmetric variant of the Heck reaction is achieved with (S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS via a cationic palladium pathway, which has enabled an efficient asymmetric synthesis of (S)&#8208;nicotine and its analogues.

&lt;p&gt;The Heck reaction between &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic alkenes provides a convenient approach to biologically relevant &#945;-heteroaryl functionalized heterocycles, yet reactions of this type have been challenging due to strong &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heteroaryl coordination to palladium metal, which causes catalyst poisoning. In this report, an efficient palladium-catalyzed Heck reaction between &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic olefins is established, leading to a variety of &#945;-heteroaryl substituted heterocycles. The method features an unprecedented broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. The employment of a sterically bulky P, P=O ligand containing an anthryl moiety is crucial for this transformation due to the coordinative unsaturation facilitated by its steric bulkiness. The asymmetric variant of the Heck reaction is achieved with (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-DTBM-SEGPHOS via a cationic palladium pathway, which has enabled an efficient asymmetric synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-nicotine and its analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Na Anode through Additive&#8208;Induced Anion&#8208;Enriched Structure of Na+ Solvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the anion&#8208;enriched effect induced by 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;APD) additive, more PF6&#8722; could enter the inner Na+ solvation sheath to be decomposed into NaF on the Na anode surface, which could effectively repress the Na dendrite growth and boost the cycling performance of Na&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity sodium (Na) anodes suffer from dendrite growth due to the high reactivity, which can be overcome through inducing a stable NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we propose an additive strategy for realizing the anion&#8208;enriched structure of Na+ solvation to obtain a NaF&#8208;rich SEI. The electron&#8208;withdrawing acetyl group in 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;APD) increases the coordination number of PF6&#8722; in the Na+ solvation sheath to facilitate PF6&#8722; to decompose into NaF. Thus, the NaF&#8208;rich SEI with high mechanical stability and interfacial energy is formed to repress the growth of Na dendrites. With the 4&#8208;APD&#8208;contained electrolyte, the symmetric Na||Na cells show excellent cycling performance over 360&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, excellent stability is also achieved for Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F full cells with high Coulombic efficiency (97&#8201;%) and capacity retention (91&#8201;%) after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Carbonylative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Allylic Alcohols and Organoalanes with 1&#8197;atm CO Enabled by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct chemoselective carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of allylic alcohols and organoalanes with 1&#8197;atm CO via nickel catalysis has been developed to access the &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with broad scope. The use of organoalanes as both the coupling components and the activators for the alcohol functionalization was found to be both crucial and advantageous as the method does not require any external activators.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of allylic alcohols and organoalanes with CO at atmospheric pressure is reported, enabling the expedient formation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with broad scope. Particularly, the chemoselective allylic carbonylation of diols further highlights the practicability of this protocol. The leverage of organoalanes as both the coupling components and the activators for the alcohol functionalization is crucial for this method, thus no extraneous activators are required.

         <title>Tridecacyclene Tetraimide: An Easily Reduced Cyclooctatetraene Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tridecacyclene tetraimide, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make molecular saddle, will accept up to eight electrons when reduced by chemical or electrochemical means. Strong near&#8208;infrared absorptions are observed for the resulting anionic species. The ultimate octaanion is an exception: it absorbs only in the visible region and has an even larger energy gap than the neutral form.







Abstract
Tridecacyclene tetraimide, TCTI, an electron&#8208;deficient non&#8208;benzenoid nanocarbon with a C56N4 polycyclic framework was obtained in a concise synthesis. TCTI has a non&#8208;planar structure and forms &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers in the solid state. In solution, it undergoes eight single&#8208;electron reductions, yielding a range of negatively charged states up to an octaanion. Except for the latter species, which has a remarkably large electronic gap, the anions feature extended near&#8208;infrared absorptions, with a particularly strong band at 1692&#8197;nm observed for the dianion. A computational analysis of the TCTI anions shows that their stability originates from the combined effects of electron&#8208;deficient imide groups and the local aromaticity of reduced acenaphthylene units. The properties of TCTI make it potentially useful in electrochromic and charge storage applications.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Fused Acenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusion of azulene to acenes of various length led to unexpected properties such as aromaticity and photophysical properties, and they are more stable than the respective isoelectronic acenes. Their dications showed aromaticity shift and one of them exhibited open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) are expected to exhibit very different electronic properties from the all&#8208;benzenoid PHs. Herein, we report the synthesis and physical properties of three azulene&#8208;fused acene molecules (1, 2 and 3), which are isoelectronic to the pentacene, hexacene and heptacene, respectively. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, NMR spectra, and theoretical calculations reveal a localised aromatic backbone comprising all the six&#8208; and five&#8208;membered rings while the seven&#8208;membered ring remains non&#8208;aromatic. They display properties of both azulene and acenes and are much more stable than the respective acenes. The dications of 1, 2 and 3 were formed by chemical oxidation. Notably, 32+ exhibited an open&#8208;shell diradical character (y0=30.2&#8201;%) as confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR and ESR measurements, which can be explained by recovery of aromaticity of an 2,6&#8208;anthraquinodimethane unit annulated with two aromatic tropylium rings.

         <title>A 4&#8208;Arm Small Molecule Acceptor with High Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;arm small molecule acceptor (SMA) 4A&#8208;DFIC was serendipitously made. Power conversion efficiencies of 15.76&#8201;% and 18.60&#8201;% were achieved in 4A&#8208;DFIC&#8208;based binary and ternary organic solar cells, respectively, setting new records for multi&#8208;arm SMA&#8208;based solar cells.







Abstract
Manipulating the backbone of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) is of particular importance in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). The common design is constructing 2&#8208;arm SMAs with linear or curved backbones.

&lt;p&gt;A 4-arm small molecule acceptor (SMA) 4A-DFIC was serendipitously made. Power conversion efficiencies of 15.76&#8201;% and 18.60&#8201;% were achieved in 4A-DFIC-based binary and ternary organic solar cells, respectively, setting new records for multi-arm SMA-based solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating the backbone of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) is of particular importance in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). The common design is constructing 2-arm SMAs with linear or curved backbones. Herein, we report an acceptor 4A-DFIC with a 4-arm backbone unexpectedly generated in the reaction of an electron-rich aromatic diamine and hexaketocyclohexane. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates the rigid and twisted molecular plane and the effective molecular stacking of 4A-DFIC in solid state. 4A-DFIC shows a low band gap of 1.40&#8197;eV and excellent light-harvesting capability from visible to near-infrared region. Binary and ternary OSCs based on 4A-DFIC gave power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 15.76&#8201;% and 18.60&#8201;% (certified 18.1&#8201;%), respectively, which are the highest PCEs for multi-arm SMA-based OSCs to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Fused Tetracyclic Heterocycles from Diarylalkynes Enabled by the Selective Insertion of Isocyanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective synthesis of six different fused tetracyclic heterocycles from readily available diarylalkynes and isocyanides is disclosed. It has high step economy and good functional tolerance. An unprecedented intermolecular nucleopalladation of diarylalkynes occurs enabled by a sequential double isocyanide insertion.







Abstract
Herein, we present a direct and efficient synthesis of diverse polysubstituted fused tetracyclic heterocycles with good functional group tolerance from diarylalkynes under different palladium catalytic systems. In this chemistry, an unprecedented intermolecular nucleopalladation of diarylalkynes through the highly selective sequential double insertion of isocyanide was achieved for the first time. The practicality of this method was further demonstrated by the construction of various bioactive molecules and important structural motifs, with potential applications in materials science and biochemistry. In addition, density functional theory calculations (DFT) elucidated an interesting &#8220;Pd walk&#8221; during the cyclization process.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis and Investigation of the Non&#8208;Enzymatic Chemistry of Oxazinin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first biomimetic total synthesis of natural product oxazinin A is reported. A biosynthetic precursor was synthesized and reacted with anthranilic acid to give oxazinin A. Further investigation of the non&#8208;enzymatic formation of oxazinin A using 1H&#8208;15N HMBC NMR allowed us to monitor the reaction in real time. The synthetic route is amenable for the synthesis of diverse sets of analogs around the oxazinin scaffold to study the structure&#8211;activity relationship.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of an antimycobacterial natural product oxazinin A that takes advantage of a multi&#8208;component cascade reaction of anthranilic acid and a precursor polyketide containing an aldehyde. The route utilized for the synthesis of the pseudodimeric oxazinin A validates a previously proposed biosynthetic mechanism, invoking a non&#8208;enzymatic pathway to the complex molecule. We found a 76&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;9&#8201;:&#8201;5 ratio of oxazinin diastereomers from the synthetic cascade, which is an identical match to that found in the fermentation media from the fungus Eurotiomycetes 110162. Further investigation of the non&#8208;enzymatic formation of oxazinin A using 1H&#8208;15N HMBC NMR spectroscopy allowed for a plausible determination of the stepwise mechanism. The developed route is highly amenable for the synthesis of diverse sets of analogs around the oxazinin scaffold to study structure&#8211;activity relationships (SAR).

         <title>Phosphorus Tailors the d&#8208;Band Center of Copper Atomic Sites for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective phosphidation approach was employed to tailor the Cu 3d electron energy in phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride (PCN) supported single&#8208;Cu&#8208;atom catalyst by tuning its coordination environment from Cu1N3 to Cu1P3. Cu1N3@PCN with the d&#8208;band center near the Fermi level promoted CO2 photoreduction to CO, while Cu1P3@PCN with a downshifting Cu 3d electron energy favored H2 production via photocatalytic water splitting.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 into solar fuels has received great interest, but suffers from low catalytic efficiency and poor selectivity. Herein, two single&#8208;Cu&#8208;atom catalysts with unique Cu configurations in phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride (PCN), namely, Cu1N3@PCN and Cu1P3@PCN were fabricated via selective phosphidation, and tested in visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by H2O without sacrificial agents. Cu1N3@PCN was exclusively active for CO production with a rate of 49.8&#8197;&#956;molCO&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming most polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4) based catalysts, while Cu1P3@PCN preferably yielded H2. Experimental and theoretical analysis suggested that doping P in C3N4 by replacing a corner C atom upshifted the d&#8208;band center of Cu in Cu1N3@PCN close to the Fermi level, which boosted the adsorption and activation of CO2 on Cu1N3, making Cu1N3@PCN efficiently convert CO2 to CO. In contrast, Cu1P3@PCN with a much lower Cu 3d electron energy exhibited negligible CO2 adsorption, thereby preferring H2 formation via photocatalytic H2O splitting.

         <title>A Greener Route to Blue: Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, the first high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state synthesis of a phthalocyanine dye is shown. These organic dyes are broadly applicable, while the inherent low solubility has so far challenged the sustainability of their synthesis. The developed solid&#8208;state approach for the synthesis of tBu&#8208;phthalocyanine in catalytic amounts of dimethylaminoethanol, avoids bulk solvents and harsh temperatures, while achieving excellent yields.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are important organic dyes with a broad applicability in optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing and nanomedicine. Currently, phthalocyanines are synthetized in high boiling organic solvents, like dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), which is a flammable, corrosive, and bioactive substance, miscible with water and harmful to the environment. Here we show a new solid&#8208;state approach for the high&#8208;yielding synthesis of phthalocyanines, which reduces up to 100&#8208;fold the amount of DMAE. Through systematic screening of solid&#8208;state reaction parameters, carried out by ball&#8208;milling and aging, we reveal the influence of key variables&#8212;temperature, presence of a template, and the amount and role of DMAE in the conversion of tBu phthalonitrile to tetra&#8208;tBu phthalocyanine. These results set the foundations to synthesize these high&#8208;performance dyes through a greener approach, opening the field of solid&#8208;state synthesis to a wider family of phthalocyanines.

         <title>Evidence for C&#8722;F Bond Formation through Formal Reductive Elimination from Tellurium(VI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of both sp2 and sp3 C&#8722;F bond formation through formal reductive elimination from organotellurium(VI) compounds in superacidic media are provided and discussed herein. Additionally, density functional theory calculations shed light on the mechanisms of these unique reductive elimination processes and suggest that SbF5 plays an important role beyond fluoride abstraction.







Abstract
The fundamental challenge of C&#8722;F bond formation by reductive elimination has been met by compounds of select transition metals and fewer main group elements. The work detailed herein expands the list of main group elements known to be capable of reductively eliminating a C&#8722;F bond to include tellurium. Surprising and novel modes of both sp2 and sp3 C&#8722;F bond formation were observed alongside formation of TeIV cations during two separate attempts to synthesize/characterize fluorinated organotellurium(VI) cations in superacidic media (SbF5/SO2ClF). Following detailed low&#8208;temperature NMR experiments, the mechanisms of the two unique reductive elimination reactions were probed and investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Ultimately, we found that an &#8220;indirect&#8221; reductive elimination pathway is likely operative whereby Sb plays a key role in fluoride abstraction and C&#8722;F bond formation, as opposed to unimolecular reductive elimination from a discrete TeVI cation.

         <title>Bioinspired Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;Based Ionic Diode Membrane for High&#8208;Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic diode&#8208;type membranes with rectified current can avoid energy dissipation in the nanochannels during the osmotic energy conversion process. Herein, a bioinspired heterogeneous MXene membrane (BHMXM) is designed with extraordinary ionic rectification, when applied in osmotic energy conversion, the BHMXM&#8208;based power generator can yield a high power density of 8.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water.







Abstract
Bioinspired asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels with ionic diode behavior that can boost the osmotic energy (so&#8208;called blue energy) conversion are highly desirable, especially if they can be easily constructed and modified. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine hydrophilic surfaces and tunable surface charge properties, providing a shortcut to prepare asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels. Here, we report a mechanically robust, flexible, and scale&#8208;up&#8208;friendly asymmetric Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;based ionic diode membrane with a highly rectified current and demonstrate its potential use in reverse electrodialysis osmotic energy conversion. Under the salinity gradient of synthetic seawater and river water, our ionic diode membrane&#8208;based generator&#8216;s power density is 8.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 and up to 17.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The design of MXene&#8208;based ionic diode&#8208;type membrane provides a facile and general strategy in developing large&#8208;scale 2D nanofluidics and selective ion transport.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Heteroaryl Imines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of heteroaryl imines with C(sp3) electrophiles for the preparation of heterobenzylic amines is reported. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the imine substrate acting as a redox&#8208;active ligand upon coordination to a low&#8208;valent Ni center.







Abstract
The preparation of heterobenzylic amines by a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between heteroaryl imines and C(sp3) electrophiles is reported. This umpolung&#8208;type alkylation proceeds under mild conditions, avoids the pre&#8208;generation of organometallic reagents, and exhibits good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the imine substrate acting as a redox&#8208;active ligand upon coordination to a low&#8208;valent Ni center. The resulting bis(2&#8208;imino)heterocycle&#8901;Ni complexes can engage in alkylation reactions with a variety of C(sp3) electrophiles, giving heterobenzylic amine products in good yields.

         <title>Tetrazine Linkers as Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Tags for General Framework Functionalization and C60 Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The value of covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification in expanding the chemistry and pore versatility of reticular solids is well documented. Here we use mesoporous crystals of UiO&#8208;68&#8208;TZDC to demonstrate the value of tetrazine connectors for all&#8208;purpose inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder ligation chemistry. Our results suggest a positive effect of tetrazine reticulation over its reactivity for quantitative one&#8208;step functionalization with a broad scope of alkene or alkyne dienophiles into pyridazine and dihydropyridazine frameworks. This permits generating multiple pore environments with diverse chemical functionalities and the expected accessible porosities, that is also extended to the synthesis of crystalline fulleretic materials by covalent conjugation of fullerene molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanocatalytic therapy, based on the nanozyme&#8208;triggered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor microenvironment (TME), has demonstrated potential in tumor therapy, but nanozymes still face challenges of activity and specificity that compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we develop an innovative strategy using a single&#8208;atom nanozyme to initiate cascade enzymatic reactions in TME for tumor&#8208;specific treatment. The cobalt (Co)&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8208;  N  coordination on  N  &#8208;doped porous carbon (  Co&#8208;SAs@NC  ),  displays catalase&#8208;like activity that  decompose cellular endogenous H  2  O  2  to produce O  2  , and subsequent oxidase&#8208;like activity that converts O  2  into cytotoxic  superoxide radicals  to efficiently kill tumor cells. By incorporation with doxorubicin, the therapy achieves a significantly enhanced antitumor effect  in vivo  . Our findings show that cascade TME&#8208;specific catalytic therapy combining with chemotherapy is a promising strategy for efficient tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Low mass&#8208;transfer efficiency and reaction&#8208;driving force make it difficult to realize thorough purification in traditional low&#8208;concentration pollutant treatments. Herein, we propose an &#8220;adsorption/catalysis in situ&#8221; perylene based bifunctional micelle for efficient, accurate and rapid adsorption and catalytic degradation of low&#8208;concentration bisphenol A (BPA). They show super&#8208;fast (within 10 s), high capacity (448 mg g&#8722;1) and selectivity for BPA adsorption, due to &#960;&#8211;&#960;, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The BPA degradation efficiency improves by up to 8 times after forming micelles compared with simple perylene nanorods, which is primarily due to the superior mass&#8208;transfer from adsorption. Moreover, self&#8208;assembly can optimize the stacking of the perylene moieties and facilitate charge transfer in micelle, and the regular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of inside perylene units enhances the response to visible light, resulting in high catalytic capacity and good cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Aminocarbonylation of Arenes via Bifunctional Coordination to Chromium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amides are ubiquitous in physical and life sciences. Given the significant abundance of arenes, dearomative aminocarbonylation of arenes would lead to a large and underexplored chemical space for amide discovery. However, such reactions are challenging due to the high degree of resonance stabilization and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium, providing a modular platform for the construction of amides possessing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups and three&#8208;dimensional rings. Its versatility further enabled a switchable difluoromethylation or trifluoromethylation aminocarbonylation of arene C&#8210;H bonds. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments. Finally, the synthetic utility was well demonstrated by diverse applications in the total synthesis of CF3&#8208;functionalized amide&#8208;type drugs, including praziquantel, natelinide, maraviroc and alloyohimbane.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated and Robust Superhydrophobic Modification on Covalent Organic Framework for Crude&#8208;Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) having high specific surface area, tunable pore size and high crystallinity are mostly post modified following fluorine&#8208;based and complex synthetic approaches to achieve a bio&#8208;inspired liquid wettability, i.e. superhydrophobicity. Herein, a facile, non&#8208;fluorinated and robust chemical approach is introduced for tailoring of water wettability of a new COF&#8212;which was prepared through Schiff&#8208;base condensation reaction. A silane precursor was readily reacted with selected alkyl acrylates through 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction, prior to grafting on the prepared C4&#8208;COF for tailoring different water wettability&#8212;including robust superhydrophobicity. The superhydrophobic C4&#8208;COF (SH&#8208;C4&#8208;COF) that displayed significantly enhanced (&gt; 5 times; from 220 wt % to 1156 wt %) oil&#8208;absorption capacity, was extended to address very relevant challenges of &#8216;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8217; emulsion separation, rapidly (&lt;1 minutes) and repetitively (50 times) at diverse and harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Anharmonicity&#8208;Induced Low Thermal conductivity and High n&#8208;type Mobility in Topological Insulator Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (k&#8208;lat) while maintaining the high carrier mobility (&#956;) is of the utmost importance for thermoelectrics. Topological insulators (TI) can possess high &#956; due to the metallic surface states. Tls with heavy constituents and layered structure can give rise to high anharmonicity and are expected to show low k&#8208;lat. Here, we demonstrate that Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S (BSTS), which is a 3D bulk TI, exhibits ultra&#8208;low k&#8208;lat of 0.46 Wm&#8208;1K&#8208;1 along with high &#956; of ~401 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. Sound velocity measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that chemical bonding hierarchy and high anharmonicity play a crucial role behind such ultra&#8208;low k&#8208;lat. BSTS possess low energy optical phonons which strongly couple with the heat carrying acoustic phonons leading to ultra&#8208;low k&#8208;lat. Further, Cl has been doped at the S site of BSTS which increases the electron concentration and reduces the k&#8208;lat resulting in a promising n&#8208;type thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of ~ 0.6 at 573 K.</dc:description>

         <title>On Demand Flow Platform for the Generation of Anhydrous Dinitrogen Trioxide and Its Further Use in N&#8208;Nitrosative Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen trioxide (N  2  O  3  ) is a powerful and efficient nitrosating agent that comes with an unprecedented atom economy. However, the synthetic application of N  2  O  3  is still underdeveloped mostly due to its inherent instability and the lack of reliable protocols for its preparation. This paper presents an open&#8208;source setup and procedure for the on&#8208;demand generation of anhydrous N  2  O  3  solution (up to 1 M), which can be further used for reactions under batch and flow conditions. The accuracy and stability of N  2  O  3  concentration are guaranteed with the absence of head&#8208;space in the setup and with the synchronization of the gas flows. The reliability of this protocol is demonstrated by &gt;30 worked examples in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles &#8211; a library of structurally diverse benzotriazoles and sydnones. Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the  N  &#8208;nitrosative steps are also explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tetracyclic Pyridinium Alkaloid epi&#8208;Tetradehydrohalicyclamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of a tetracyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid hinged on recent advances in chemoselectivity management: While many classical methods failed to afford the perceptively simple pyridine&#8208;containing core of the target, nickel/iridium photoredox dual catalysis allowed the critical C&#8722;C&#8208;bond to be formed in good yield. Likewise, ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) worked well in the presence of the unhindered pyridine despite the innately Lewis acidic Mo(+6) center of the alkylidyne catalyst. Finally, an iridium catalyzed hydrosilylation was uniquely effective in reducing a tertiary amide without compromising an adjacent pyridine and the lateral double bonds; this transformation is largely without precedent. The second strained macrocycle enveloping the core was closed by intramolecular N&#8208;alkylation with formation of the pyridinium unit; the reaction proceeded site&#8208; and chemoselectively in the presence of an a priori more basic tertiary amine.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Dry Synthesis of Supported Bimetallic Catalysts: A Study on Comminution and Alloying of Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ball milling is growing increasingly important as an alternative synthetic tool to prepare catalytic materials. It was recently observed that supported metal catalysts could be directly obtained upon ball milling from the coarse powders of metal and oxide support. Moreover, when two compatible metal sources are simultaneously subjected to the mechanochemical treatment, bimetallic nanoparticles are obtained. A systematic investigation was extended to different metals and supports to understand better the mechanisms involved in the comminution and alloying of metal nanoparticles. Based on this, a model describing the role of metal&#8208;support interactions in the synthesis was developed. The findings will be helpful for the future rational design of supported metal catalysts via dry ball milling.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Initiated Synthesis of Methanesulfonic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct sulfonation of methane to methanesulfonic acid was achieved in an electrochemical reactor without adding peroxide initiators. The synthesis proceeds only from oleum and methane. This is possible due to in&#8208;situ formation of an initiating species from the electrolyte at a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode. Elevated pressure, moderate temperature and suitable current density are beneficial to reach high concentration at outstanding selectivity. The highest concentration of 3.7 M (approximately 62% yield) at 97% selectivity was reached with a stepped electric current program at 6.25 &#8211; 12.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  , 70 &#176;C and 90 bar methane pressure in 22 hours. We present a novel, electrochemical method to produce methanesulfonic acid, propose a reaction mechanism and show general dependencies between parameters and yields for methanesulfonic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Unshared Pair Electrons of Zincophilic Lewis Base Enable&#160;Long&#8208;life Zn Anodes under &#8220;Three High&#8221; Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen evolution and dendrite issues are the notorious culprits of the limited lifespan and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Zn anodes, particularly at harsh test conditions. Herein, considering the Lewis acidic feature of Zn  2+  , abundant unshared pair electrons of zincophilic Lewis bases are proposed as decent electrolyte additives to stabilize Zn anodes at &#8220;Three High&#8221; conditions (high depth of discharge, high areal capacity and high current). The unshared pair electrons can remove H  2  O from Zn  2+  solvated sheaths and confine the activity of H  2  O by breaking its hydrogen bonding network. The combination of these factors effectively restricts H  2  O&#8208;involved side reactions and enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, even at harsh conditions. The effectiveness of this strategy is fully proved by a series of Lewis base molecules. Noticeably, the Zn||Zn cell with an area of 20 cm  2  , using DMF&#8208;containing electrolyte can be stably cycled over 1000 h at 60% DOD, with a 100% CE.</dc:description>

         <title>Open&#8208;Bandgap Graphene&#8208;based Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Using Oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic interfacial compounds (OICs) are required as linkers for the highly stable and efficient immobilization of bioprobes in nanobiosensors using 2D nanomaterials such as graphene. Herein, we first demonstrated the fabrication of a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) via a microelectromechanical system process after covalent functionalization on large&#8208;scale graphene by introducing oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)amine (OPE). OPE was compared to various OICs by density functional theory simulations and was confirmed to have a higher binding energy with graphene and a lower band gap than other OICs. OPE can improve the immobilization efficiency of a bioprobe by forming a self&#8208;assembly monolayer via anion&#8208;based reaction. Using this technology, Magainin I&#8208;conjugated OGMFET (MOGMFET) showed a high sensitivity, high selectivity, with a limit of detection of 100 cfu/mL. These results indicate that the OPE OIC can be applied for stable and comfortable interfacing technology for biosensor fabrication.</dc:description>

         <title>P and Cu Dual Sites on Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbon Fuels with High C2H6 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products is especially meaningful, while the low efficiency of multi&#8208;electron transfer and sluggish C&#8722;C coupling greatly hinder its development. Herein, we report a photocatalyst comprising of P and Cu dual sites anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (P/Cu SAs@CN), which achieves a high C2H6 evolution rate of 616.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons. The detailed spectroscopic characterizations identify the formation of charge&#8208;enriched Cu sites, where the isolated P atoms serve as hole capture sites during photocatalysis. Theoretical simulations combined with in&#8208;situ FTIR measurement reveal a kinetically feasible for the formation of C&#8722;C coupling intermediate (*OC&#8722;COH) and confirm the favorable production of C2H6 on the P/Cu SAs@CN photocatalyst. This work offers new insights into the photocatalyst design with atomic precision toward highly efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion to high value&#8208;added carbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient electrosynthesis of nitric oxide for biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) constitutes one of the most versatile therapeutics for biomedical applications because of its manifold signaling functions. The efficient and on&#8208;demand generation of NO essentially dictates its concentration dependent therapeutic activity. Here, we report an electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (i.e., Fe SAC), for high&#8208;efficient and controlled NO generation. The Fe SAC shows superior catalytic ability in electrochemical reduction of nitrite, with maximal rate of NO generation achieving 2.1 &#956;M&#183;(min&#183;&#956;g)  &#8208;1  . DFT studies suggest the significant decrease of Gibbs&#8208;free energy of NO  2  &#8208;  adsorption on single&#8208;iron atom accounts for its high catalytic efficiency. Moreover, ample amount of NO can be controllably generated in a potential dependent manner. Using bacterial elimination as a representative application, the electrochemical generated NO overwhelmingly disrupts gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive strains. The effectiveness of NO generation system underscores a great promise to expedite NO research in both basic and applied sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Transfer Hydrogenation with a Carbon&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Photocatalyst and Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds receives increasing attention for sustainable organic synthesis, but water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen donor, has rarely been investigated due to the high barrier of splitting water molecules. Here, a carbon nitride supported palladium single&#8209;atom heterogeneous catalyst originates unparalleled performance in photocatalytic water&#8209;donating transfer hydrogenations compared to its nanoparticle counterparts. Isotopic&#8209;labeling experiments and operando nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirm the direct hydrogenation mechanism using in situ generated protons from water splitting under visible&#8209;light irradiation. Density functional theory calculations attribute the high activity to lower barriers for hydrogenation, facilitated desorption of ethylbenzene, and facile hydrogen replenishment from water on the atomic palladium sites.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable and Reversible Virus&#8208;Mimicking NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe for Monitoring the Progression of Viral Encephalitis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viral encephalitis is an inflammatory disease of the brain parenchyma and caused by various viral infections. In vivo monitoring of the progression of viral infections can aid accurate diagnosis of viral encephalitis and effective intervention. We developed an activatable and reversible virus&#8208;mimicking near&#8208;infrared II nanoprobe consisting of an Fe  2+  &#8208;coordinated, viral protein&#8208;decorated vesicle encapsulating PbS quantum dots with a 1300 nm fluorescence emission. The probe can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and monitor real&#8208;time changes in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations during viral infection by tuning the quenching level of quantum dots and regulating the fusion&#8211;fission behavior of vesicles via changes in Fe oxidation state. This switching strategy reduces background noise and improves detection sensitivity, making this nanoprobe a promising imaging agent for dynamic visualization of viral encephalitis and future clinical applications.</dc:description>
