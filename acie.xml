         <title>Unraveling the Electrical and Magnetic Properties of Layered Conductive Metal&#8722;Organic Framework With Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes structural elucidation of a layered conductive metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) material Cu  3  (C  6  O  6  )  2  by microcrystal electron diffraction with sub&#8208;angstrom precision. This insight enables the first identification of an unusual &#960;&#8208;stacking interaction in a layered MOF material characterized by an extremely short (2.70 &#197;) close packing of the ligand arising from pancake bonding. Band structure analysis suggests semiconductive properties of the MOF, which are likely related to the localized nature of pancake bonds and the formation of a singlet dimer of the ligand. The spin of Cu(II) within the Kagom&#233; arrangement dominates the paramagnetism of the MOF, leading to strong geometrical magnetic frustration.</dc:description>

         <title>Folding&#8208;induced Fluorescence Enhancement in a Series of Merocyanine Hetero&#8208;Folda&#8208;Trimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many dyes suffer from fast non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, thereby showing only short&#8208;lived excited states and weak photoluminescence. Here we show a pronounced fluorescence enhancement for a weakly fluorescent merocyanine (MC) dye by being stacked to other dyes in hetero&#8208;folda&#8208;trimer architectures. By means of fluorescence spectroscopy (lifetime, quantum yield) the fluorescence enhancement was explained by a decrease of the non&#8208;radiative decay rate due to the rigidifying foldamer architecture and a compared to homo&#8208;trimers increased radiative rate for the hetero&#8208;trimers due to a non&#8208;forbidden lowest exciton state. This folding&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (FIFE) for specific sequences of &#960;&#8208;stacked dyes points at a viable strategy toward improved fluorophores that relates to the approach used by nature in the green fluorescent protein (GFP).</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of sec&#8208;Phosphine Oxides by P&#8208;Benzylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both, tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1). The synthetic utilities are further demonstrated by the facile preparation of several P&#8208;chiral compounds, precursors of bidentate ligands, and transition metal complexes.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphines have wide applications in asymmetric catalysis, materials, and pharmaceutical chemistry, however, their practical synthesis still constitutes a significant challenge. Herein, a successful kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1). The appealing synthetic utilities are further demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable P&#8208;chiral compounds, precursors of bidentate ligands, as well as transition metal complexes.

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Glutarimides: Alternative Cereblon Binders for the Design of PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
IMiD&#8208;based PROTACs rapidly hydrolyze in commonly utilized cell media, which significantly affects their cell efficacy. We designed novel BET PROTACs based on phenyl glutarimide (PG) and showed that they retained affinity for CRBN and displayed improved chemical stability. To demonstrate the utility of PG&#8208;based PROTACs we developed SJ995973 (4&#8201;c), a uniquely potent degrader of BET proteins.







Abstract
Targeting cereblon (CRBN) is currently one of the most frequently reported proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) approaches, owing to favorable drug&#8208;like properties of CRBN ligands, immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs). However, IMiDs are known to be inherently unstable, readily undergoing hydrolysis in body fluids. Here we show that IMiDs and IMiD&#8208;based PROTACs rapidly hydrolyze in commonly utilized cell media, which significantly affects their cell efficacy. We designed novel CRBN binders, phenyl glutarimide (PG) analogues, and showed that they retained affinity for CRBN with high ligand efficiency (LE &gt;0.48) and displayed improved chemical stability. Our efforts led to the discovery of PG PROTAC 4&#8201;c (SJ995973), a uniquely potent degrader of bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal (BET) proteins that inhibited the viability of human acute myeloid leukemia MV4&#8208;11 cells at low picomolar concentrations (IC50=3&#8197;pM; BRD4 DC50=0.87&#8197;nM). These findings strongly support the utility of PG derivatives in the design of CRBN&#8208;directed PROTACs.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Base&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Umpolung Reactions of Cyclopentadienones and Tropone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Allylpalladium&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;carbodipoles were generated from the carbonate derivatives of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones and isomerized in situ to electronically neutral &#951;2&#8208;Pd0&#8208;cyclopentadienone complexes. These HOMO&#8208;raised cyclopentadienones participate, via &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation, in inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;type cycloadditions and cascade Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman&#8208; or Rauhut&#8211;Currier&#8208;type addition/allylic substitution reactions with diverse electrophiles.







Abstract
We disclose that the carbonates of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones can form &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;carbodipoles, which isomerize to interesting &#951;2&#8208;Pd0&#8208;cyclopentadienone complexes. Compared with the labile parent cyclopentadienone, the HOMO energy of the related &#951;2&#8208;complex was significantly raised via the back&#8208;bonding of Pd0 as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis base, rendering the uncoordinated C=C bond an electron&#8208;richer dienophile in inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;type reactions with diverse 1&#8208;azadienes. The vinylogous (aza)Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman or cross Rauhut&#8211;Currier addition to (imine)carbonyls or activated alkenes, respectively, was also realized to afford chiral [4+2] or [2+2] cycloadducts, respectively, after trapping the re&#8208;generated &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species. New C1&#8208;symmetric ligands from simple chiral sources were developed, exhibiting high stereoselectivity even with racemic substrates via an unusual dynamic kinetic resolution process. Besides, tropone could be similarly activated by a Pd0 complex.

The vinylogous (aza)Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman or cross Rauhut&#8211;Currier addition to (imine)carbonyls or activated alkenes, respectively, was also realized to afford chiral [4+2] or [2+2] cycloadducts, respectively, after trapping the re-generated &#960;-allylpalladium species. New C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric ligands from simple chiral sources were developed, exhibiting high stereoselectivity even with racemic substrates via an unusual dynamic kinetic resolution process. Besides, tropone could be similarly activated by a Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, versatile and atom&#8208;economic protocol to chiral allylic phosphine oxides is demonstrated via palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of allenes with phosphine oxides. A family of chiral allylic phosphine oxides with a diverse range of functional groups were obtained in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrophosphinylation of alkyl and aryl&#8208;oxyallenes with phosphine oxides has been developed for the efficient and rapid construction of a family of chiral allylic phosphine oxides with a diverse range of functional groups. This methodology was further applied in the facile construction of chiral 2H&#8208;chromene and later stage functionalization of cholesterol.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific 5&#8208;Formyl Cytosine Mediated DNA&#8208;Histone Cross&#8208;Links: Synthesis and Polymerase Bypass by Human DNA Polymerase &#951;</title>

         <dc:description>
DNA&#8211;histone cross&#8208;links (DPCs) have been synthesized efficiently via oxime ligation. These DPC lesions block DNA replication but the replication block can be removed via proteolytic processing.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;protein cross&#8208;links (DPCs) between DNA epigenetic mark 5&#8208;formylC and lysine residues of histone proteins spontaneously form in human cells. Such conjugates are likely to influence chromatin structure and mediate DNA replication, transcription, and repair, but are challenging to study due to their reversible nature. Here we report the construction of site specific, hydrolytically stable DPCs between 5fdC in DNA and K4 of histone H3 and an investigation of their effects on DNA replication. Our approach employs oxime ligation, allowing for site&#8208;specific conjugation of histones to DNA under physiological conditions. Primer extension experiments revealed that histone H3&#8208;DNA crosslinks blocked DNA synthesis by hPol &#951; polymerase, but were bypassed following proteolytic processing.

         <title>Insight into Carbocation&#8208;Induced Noncovalent Interactions in the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Multiple noncovalent interactions involving cyclopentenyl cations in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite were identified by using two&#8208;dimensional solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. It was found that the hydrocarbon pool reaction is modulated by carbocation&#8208;induced noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Carbocations such as cyclic carbenium ions are important intermediates in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction. The MTO reaction propagates through a complex hydrocarbon pool process. Understanding the carbocation&#8208;involved hydrocarbon pool reaction on a molecular level still remains challenging. Here we show that electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentenyl cations stabilized in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite are able to capture the alkanes, methanol, and olefins produced during MTO reaction via noncovalent interactions. Intermolecular spatial proximities/interactions are identified by using two&#8208;dimensional 13C&#8211;13C correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Combined NMR experiments and theoretical analysis suggests that in addition to the dispersion and CH/&#960; interactions, the multiple functional groups in the cyclopentenyl cations produce strong attractive force via cation&#8208;induced dipole, cation&#8211;dipole and cation&#8211;&#960; interactions. These carbocation&#8208;induced noncovalent interactions modulate the product selectivity of hydrocarbon pool reaction.

         <dc:description>Paspaline&#8208;derived indole diterpenes (IDTs) are structurally complex mycotoxins with unique tremorgenic activity. Reported are asymmetric total syntheses of three paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs paspalicine, paspalinine and paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene. Our synthesis features (1) green Achmatowicz rearrangement/bicycloketalization for efficient construction of FG rings (75% yield) and (2) cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis of dienyne for highly regioselective formation of CD rings (72% yield). Other highlights include four palladium&#8208;mediated reactions (Stille, aza&#8208;Wacker, Suzuki, and Heck) to forge the BE rings and the installation of two continuous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via reductive ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane and &#945;&#8208;methylation of conjugate ester. Our new synthetic strategy is expected to be applicable to the chemical synthesis of other paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs and will facilitate the bioactivity studies of these agriculturally and pharmacologically important IDTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxy Radical&#8208;Induced Formation of Dual&#8208;Layered Protection Film for High&#8208;Rate and Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spontaneous redox reaction between the phenoxy radical Spiro&#8208;O8 and Li metal forms a highly conductive and uniform artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to protect the Li metal. Phenoxy radicals aid the decomposition of the lithium salt, leading to the formation of LiF inorganic film on the top. The dual&#8208;layered protective film gives stable dendrite&#8208;free cycling at high current density and area capacity.







Abstract
The uncontrollable dendrite growth of Li metal anode leads to poor cycle stability and safety concerns, hindering its utilization in high energy density batteries. Herein, a phenoxy radical Spiro&#8208;O8 is proposed as an artificial protection film for Li metal anode owing to its excellent film&#8208;forming capability and remarkable ionic conductivity. A spontaneous redox reaction between the Spiro&#8208;O8 and Li metal results in the formation of a uniform and highly ionic conductive organic film in the bottom. Meanwhile, the phenoxy radicals on surface of Spiro&#8208;O8 facilitate the decomposition of Li salt upon exposed to the ether electrolyte and lead the formation of LiF film on the top. Arising from the synergistic effects of inner high ionic conductive film and outer rigid film, stable Li plating/stripping can be realized at a high current density (4000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a high areal capacity of 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 550&#8197;h with an ultrahigh Li utilization rate of 54.6&#8201;%. As a proof of concept, this work shows a facile strategy to rationally fabricate dual&#8208;layered interfaces for Li metal anodes.

         <title>Radical 1,4/5&#8208;Amino Shift Enables Access to Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Containing Primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;Aminoketones under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

A radical 1,4/5&#8208;amino migration from the oxygen centre of alkene&#8208;tethered diphenyl ketoxime ethers to the carbon centre to achieve valuable fluoroalkyl/functionality&#8208;containing primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;aminoketones has been developed. This migration is triggered by the fluoroalkyl/functional radical which is derived from the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex of its precursor with quinuclidine.







Abstract
A novel radical 1,4/5&#8208;amino shift from the oxygen center of alkene&#8208;tethered diphenyl ketoxime ethers to the carbon center to achieve high value&#8208;added fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones is reported. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration is triggered by the alkene addition of fluoroalkyl radical derived from the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex of Togni's reagent II or fluoroalkyl iodides and quinuclidine, and involves a unique 5(6)&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of the carbon&#8208;centered radical onto the N&#8208;atom of ketoxime ethers followed by a cascade sequence of N&#8722;O bond cleavage and dehydrogenation. Notably, besides Togni's reagent II and fluoroalkyl iodides, this protocol is also compatible with other radical precursors to provide various functionalized primary aminoketones.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Resistive Switching Behavior through Embedding a D&#8208;A System into 2D Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two D&#8208;A&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks have been designed and prepared following a novel strategy for the construction of endurable and reliable memory devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memristor&#8208;based COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT thin film showed typical rewritable resistive switching behavior, a high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105), good endurance of 319 cycles, and a long retention time of 3.3&#215;104&#8197;s.







Abstract
Developing new materials for the fabrication of resistive random&#8208;access memory is of great significance in this period of big data. Herein, we present a novel design strategy of embedding donor (D) and acceptor (A) fragments into imine&#8208;linked frameworks to construct resistive switching covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for high&#8208;performance memristors. Two D&#8208;A&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional COFs, COF&#8208;BT&#8208;TT and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT, were designed and synthesized using a conventional solvothermal approach, and high&#8208;quality thin films of these materials deposited on ITO substrate exhibited great potential as an active layer for memristors. Rewritable memristors based on 100&#8197;nm thick COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT films showed a high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105 and 104) and low driving voltage (1.30 and 1.60&#8197;V). The cycle period and retention time for COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT&#8208;based rewritable devices were as high as 319 cycles and 3.3&#215;104&#8197;s at a constant voltage of 0.1&#8197;V (160 cycles and 1.2&#215;104&#8197;s for the COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT memristor).

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Featured Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Trafficking of Protein Delivery and Neuroprotection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;featured M2L4&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) via host&#8211;guest chemistry generates fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) that can deliver protein into neural cells, a cell line that is hard to transfect by the conventional strategy.







Abstract
The delivery of protein into mammalian cells enables the dissection and manipulation of biological processes; however, this potency is challenged by the lack of an efficient protein delivery tool and a means to monitor its intracellular trafficking. Herein, we report that the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;featured metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine can generate fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) to deliver protein into neural cells, a cell line that is hard to transfect using conventional strategy. Further, the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of TPE enabled the fluorescent monitoring of cytosolic protein release. It is found that FSNPs can deliver and release protein into cytosol for subcellular targeting as fast as 18&#8197;h post&#8208;delivery. Moreover, the delivery of molecular chaperone DJ&#8208;1 using FSNPs activates MAPK/ERK signaling of neural cells to protect cells from oxidative stress.

         <title>An Iridium Catalytic System Compatible with Inorganic and Organic Nitrogen Sources for Dual Asymmetric Reductive Amination Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two successive asymmetric reductive aminations (ARAs) have been merged into one reaction system to generate enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amines. The iridium&#8208;phosphoramidite complex successfully manages the dual ARAs by using two distinctly different types of amine sources: an inorganic ammonium salt and an organic primary amine.







Abstract
Asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) is one of the most promising methods for the synthesis of chiral amines. Herein we report our efforts on merging two ARA reactions into a single&#8208;step transformation. Catalyzed by a complex formed from iridium and a steric hindered phosphoramidite, readily available and inexpensive aromatic ketones initially undergo the first ARA with ammonium acetate to afford primary amines, which serve as the amine sources for the second ARA, and finally provide the enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amine products. The developed process competently enables the successive coupling of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources with ketones in the same reaction system. The Br&#248;nsted acid additive plays multiple roles in this procedure: it accelerates the formation of imine intermediates, minimizes the inhibitory effect of N&#8208;containing species on the iridium catalyst, and reduces the primary amine side products.

         <title>Acceptorless Dehydrogenation of Methanol to Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen using Molecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous catalysts based on ruthenium and manganese enable the generation of gaseous CO and H2 (syngas) from conveniently storable and easily transportable methanol. Conversion/time profiles and kinetic isotope effects together with spectroscopically detected intermediates indicate rapid dehydrogenation followed by two possible catalytic pathways via formaldehyde or methyl formate for decarbonylation as mechanistic manifold.







Abstract
The acceptorless dehydrogenation of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen was investigated using homogeneous molecular complexes. Complexes of ruthenium and manganese comprising the MACHO ligand framework showed promising activities for this reaction. The molecular ruthenium complex [RuH(CO)(BH4)(HN(C2H4PPh2)2)] (Ru&#8208;MACHO&#8208;BH) achieved up to 3150 turnovers for carbon monoxide and 9230 turnovers for hydrogen formation at 150&#8201;&#176;C reaching pressures up to 12&#8197;bar when the decomposition was carried out in a closed vessel. Control experiments affirmed that the metal complex mediates the initial fast dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde and methyl formate followed by subsequent slow decarbonylation. Depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions, the CO/H2 ratio in the gas mixture thus varies over a broad range from almost pure hydrogen to the stoichiometric limit of 1:2.

&lt;p&gt;Homogeneous catalysts based on ruthenium and manganese enable the generation of gaseous CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (syngas) from conveniently storable and easily transportable methanol. Conversion/time profiles and kinetic isotope effects together with spectroscopically detected intermediates indicate rapid dehydrogenation followed by two possible catalytic pathways via formaldehyde or methyl formate for decarbonylation as mechanistic manifold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceptorless dehydrogenation of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen was investigated using homogeneous molecular complexes. Complexes of ruthenium and manganese comprising the MACHO ligand framework showed promising activities for this reaction. The molecular ruthenium complex [RuH(CO)(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(HN(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] (Ru-MACHO-BH) achieved up to 3150 turnovers for carbon monoxide and 9230 turnovers for hydrogen formation at 150&#8201;&#176;C reaching pressures up to 12&#8197;bar when the decomposition was carried out in a closed vessel. Control experiments affirmed that the metal complex mediates the initial fast dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde and methyl formate followed by subsequent slow decarbonylation. Depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions, the CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio in the gas mixture thus varies over a broad range from almost pure hydrogen to the stoichiometric limit of 1:2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvation Effect on the Improved Sodium Storage Performance of N&#8208;Heteropentacenequinone for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is studied as electrode material to investigate the solvation effect in different sodium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. By revealing the failure mechanism of TAPQ in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, we discuss how the solvation effect influences interfacial electrochemical characteristics and attributed the electrolyte compatibility to the stabilization effect of reaction intermediate via solvation effect.







Abstract
The performance of electrode material is correlated with the choice of electrolyte, however, how the solvation has significant impact on electrochemical behavior is underdeveloped. Herein, N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is investigated to reveal the solvation effect on the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries in different electrolyte environment. TAPQ cycled in diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior electrochemical performance, but experiences a rapid capacity fading in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. The function of solvation effect is mainly embodied in two aspects: one is the stabilization of anion intermediate via the compatibility of electrode and electrolyte, the other is the interfacial electrochemical characteristics influenced by solvation sheath structure. By revealing the failure mechanism, this work presents an avenue for better understanding electrochemical behavior and enhancing performance from the angle of solvation effect.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Layer Device for Light&#8208;Triggered Hydrogen Production from Alkaline Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;layer device reforms alkaline alcohol to hydrogen with unprecedented activities under light illumination of a standard Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nitride. Such remarkable activity is attributed to the efficient light harvest and mitigated particle aggregation due to the multi&#8208;layer structure in the light&#8208;triggered alkaline alcohol reaction.







Abstract
It usually requires high temperature and high pressure to reform methanol with water to hydrogen with high turnover frequency (TOF). Here we show that hydrogen can be produced from alkaline methanol on a light&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;layer system with a very high hydrogen evolution rate up to ca. 1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;s&#8722;1 under the illumination of a standard Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nitride. The system can achieve a remarkable TOF up to 1.8&#215;106&#8197;moles of hydrogen per mole of Pt per hour under mild conditions. The total turnover number (TTN) of 470&#8201;000 measured over 38&#8197;hours is among the highest reported. The system does not lead to any COx emissions, hence it could feed clean hydrogen to fuel cells. In contrast to a slurry system, the proposed multi&#8208;layer system avoids particle aggregation and effectively uses light and Pt active sites. The performance is also attributed to the light&#8208;triggered reforming of alkaline methanol. This notable performance is a promising step toward practical light&#8208;driven hydrogen generation.

         <title>DNA Tiling Enables Precise Acylation&#8208;Based Labeling and Control of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method that enables the site&#8208;localized acylation of mRNA at virtually any determined sites is described. The TRAIL method utilizes a novel DNA tiling strategy by hybridizing a pool of inexpensive &#8220;protector&#8221; DNAs to block mRNA and combining with an &#8220;inducer&#8221; DNA to extrude a reactive RNA loop for acylation. This approach can be employed for both mRNA labeling and control for multiple applications.







Abstract
Methods for the site&#8208;selective labeling of long, native RNAs are needed for studying mRNA biology and future therapies. Current approaches involve engineering RNA sequences, which may alter folding, or are limited to specific sequences or bases. Here, we describe a versatile strategy for mRNA conjugation via a novel DNA&#8208;tiling approach. The method, TRAIL, exploits a pool of &#8220;protector&#8221; oligodeoxynucleotides to hybridize and block the mRNA, combined with an &#8220;inducer&#8221; DNA that extrudes a reactive RNA loop for acylation at a predetermined site. Using TRAIL, an azido&#8208;acylimidazole reagent was employed for labeling and controlling RNA for multiple applications in&#8197;vitro and in cells, including analysis of RNA&#8208;binding proteins, imaging mRNA in cells, and analysis and control of translation. The TRAIL approach offers an efficient and accessible way to label and manipulate RNAs of virtually any length or origin without altering native sequence.

         <title>Direct 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylation of Alkenes towards 1,4&#8208;Diketones via Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct incorporation of two carbonyl groups into a double bond by diacylation is achieved for the first time via visible&#8208;light catalysis. Key to success is that N(n&#8208;Bu)4+ not only associates with the alkyl anion to avoid protonation, but also activates the &#945;&#8208;keto acid to undergo electrophilic addition. The metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;neutral and regioselective symmetric and unsymmetric 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes has the potential for many applications.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl compounds are intriguing motifs and versatile precursors in numerous pharmaceutical molecules and bioactive natural compounds. Direct incorporation of two carbonyl groups into a double bond at both ends is straightforward, but also challenging. Represented herein is the first example of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes by photocatalysis. Key to success is that N(n&#8208;Bu)4+ not only associates with the alkyl anion to avoid protonation, but also activates the &#945;&#8208;keto acid to undergo electrophilic addition. The &#945;&#8208;keto acid is employed both for acyl generation and electrophilic addition. By tuning the reductive and electrophilic ability of the acyl precursor, unsymmetric 1,4&#8208;dicarbonylation is achieved for the first time. This metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;neutral and regioselective 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes is executed by a photocatalyst for versatile substrates under extremely mild conditions and shows great potential in biomolecular and drug molecular derivatization.

         <title>In Situ Modulation of A&#8208;Site Vacancies in LaMnO3.15 Perovskite for Surface Lattice Oxygen Activation and Boosted Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LaMnO3.15 with abundant La vacancy displayed improved redox performance such as toluene oxidation and ORR, which promoted by the easier transferred electron from Mn to O and the activated surface lattice oxygen.







Abstract
Modulation of A&#8208;site defects is crucial to the redox reactions on ABO3 perovskites for both clean air application and electrochemical energy storage. Herein we report a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy for in situ regulation of La vacancies (VLa) in LaMnO3.15 by simply introducing urea in the traditional citrate process, and further reveal the fundamental relationship between VLa creation and surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) activation. The underlying mechanism is shortened Mn&#8722;O bonds, decreased orbital ordering, promoted MnO6 bending vibration and weakened Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, ultimately realizing enhanced Mn&#8208;3d and O&#8208;2p orbital hybridization. The LaMnO3.15 with optimized VLa exhibits order of magnitude increase in toluene oxidation and ca. 0.05&#8197;V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) increase of half&#8208;wave potential in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The reported strategy can benefit the development of novel defect&#8208;meditated perovskites in both heterocatalysis and electrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;The LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3.15&lt;/sub&gt; with abundant La vacancy displayed improved redox performance such as toluene oxidation and ORR, which promoted by the easier transferred electron from Mn to O and the activated surface lattice oxygen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modulation of A-site defects is crucial to the redox reactions on ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites for both clean air application and electrochemical energy storage. Herein we report a scalable one-pot strategy for in situ regulation of La vacancies (V&lt;sub&gt;La&lt;/sub&gt;) in LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3.15&lt;/sub&gt; by simply introducing urea in the traditional citrate process, and further reveal the fundamental relationship between V&lt;sub&gt;La&lt;/sub&gt; creation and surface lattice oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;latt&lt;/sub&gt;) activation. The underlying mechanism is shortened Mn&#8722;O bonds, decreased orbital ordering, promoted MnO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; bending vibration and weakened Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, ultimately realizing enhanced Mn-3d and O-2p orbital hybridization. The LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3.15&lt;/sub&gt; with optimized V&lt;sub&gt;La&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits order of magnitude increase in toluene oxidation and ca. 0.05&#8197;V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) increase of half-wave potential in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The reported strategy can benefit the development of novel defect-meditated perovskites in both heterocatalysis and electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of Inhibitors of Cholesterol Transport Proteins Through the Synthesis of a Diverse, Sterol&#8208;Inspired Compound Collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for the identification of selective cholesterol transport protein inhibitors through the synthesis of a diverse sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection is presented. Fusion of a primary sterol scaffold to diverse secondary natural product&#8208;derived scaffolds afforded hits against all of the Aster family of cholesterol transport proteins and selective inhibitors of Aster&#8208;C.







Abstract
Cholesterol transport proteins regulate a vast array of cellular processes including lipid metabolism, vesicular and non&#8208;vesicular trafficking, organelle contact sites, and autophagy. Despite their undoubted importance, the identification of selective modulators of this class of proteins has been challenging due to the structural similarities in the cholesterol&#8208;binding site. Herein we report a general strategy for the identification of selective inhibitors of cholesterol transport proteins via the synthesis of a diverse sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection. Fusion of a primary sterol fragment to an array of secondary privileged scaffolds led to the identification of potent and selective inhibitors of the cholesterol transport protein Aster&#8208;C, which displayed a surprising preference for the unnatural&#8208;sterol AB&#8208;ring stereochemistry and new inhibitors of Aster&#8208;A. We propose that this strategy can and should be applied to any therapeutically relevant sterol&#8208;binding protein.

         <title>Precise Spatial&#8208;Designed Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Energy Transfer and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), especially MOF nanosheets (NS), are very good candidates for photocatalysis. In this work, two types of donor&#8211;acceptor MOF NSs were prepared, including an acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS and a donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor NS. It was found that the acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS type has very good performance even with fewer catalytic centres. This may help future research to design photocatalysts.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysis in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) and MOF nanosheets (NSs) are often limited by their short&#8208;lived charge separation as well as self&#8208;quenching. Here, we propose to use the energy&#8208;transfer process (EnT) to increase charge separation, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of a series of MOF NSs. With the use of NS, the photocatalyst can also be well isolated to reduce self&#8208;quenching. Tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H4TCPP) and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (H4TBAPy) linkers were chosen as the acceptor and donor moieties, respectively. Accounting for the precise spatial design afforded by the MOF NSs, the donor and acceptor moieties could be closely positioned on the NSs, allowing for an efficient EnT process as well as a high degree of site isolation. Two templates, donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor NS and acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS catalysts, were successfully synthesized, and the results show that the second one has much enhanced catalytic performances over the first one due to site&#8208;isolated active photocatalysts.

         <title>IrOx@In2O3 Heterojunction from Individually Crystallized Oxides for Weak&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During heterogeneous nucleation for the formation of the IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction, IrOx and In2O3 are observed to crystallize independently. This crystallization avoids Ir loss and ensures that all Ir&#8208;based sites are fully exposed. More importantly, surface&#8208;exposed nano&#8208;sized IrOx can be 100&#8201;% activated by weak&#8208;light (1.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) irradiation, which can enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work focuses on the importance of multi&#8208;field coupling for promoting OER performance.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;field coupling, especially photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysis, has recently been studied to further improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, an n&#8208;type cubic In2O3 semiconductor is employed for the first time to load IrOx species (Ir&#8208;In2O3 mass ratio: 17.6&#8201;%). Consequently, the IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction, which exhibits outstanding OER performance promoted by weak&#8208;light irradiation, is formed. Notably, IrOx (approximately 1.7&#8197;nm in size) and In2O3 are observed to crystallize independently during heterogeneous nucleation with no Ir atoms doped in the In2O3 lattice. This avoids Ir loss and ensures the full exposure of all Ir&#8208;based sites. The IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation with overpotential values of 190 and 231&#8197;mV at current densities of 10 and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing all IrOx&#8208;based catalyst results reported to date. Nano&#8208;sized IrOx on the surface, irradiated by the weak&#8208;light beam of LED&#8208;365 (1.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), can be fully activated as an OER site. Moreover, the overpotential is further reduced to 176 and 210&#8197;mV to deliver the corresponding current. This work is anticipated to aid in the design of more efficient multi&#8208;field coupling OER systems.

         <title>Cyclodextrins with Multiple Pyrenyl Groups: An Approach to Organic Molecules Exhibiting Bright Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much attention because of its potential for electronic and biological applications. Herein, we report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright CPL by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An a&#8208;cyclodextrin (  CyD  ) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8208;cyclodextrins (  PCD  s) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#949; ~ 10  5  M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  ), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|  g  lum  | ~ 10  &#8211;2  ), and quantum yield (  &#934;  f  ~ 0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (  B  CPL  ) reached 340 M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  . Comprehensive photophysical and chiroptical studies of the  PCD  s with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the  CyD  with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing A New Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material, &#223;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 Inspired by the Phase Transition of the BaB2O4 (BBO) Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals play a significant role in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing a new IR NLO crystal remains a huge challenge because of the unpredictability of inorganic structures. Herein, inspired by phase transformation of the famous BaB2O4  (BBO) crystal, a temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetric (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4  to uncover a new NCS ternary chalcogenide,  &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4  which can exhibit the well&#8208;balanced NLO properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matching SHG response (~0.6&#215;AgGaS2  ), high LDT (10&#215;AgGaS2  ), and large birefringence (  &#8710;n  = 0.18 in the visible region). Therefore,  &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4  will be a promising IR NLO crystal. The analysis for the structure&#8208;property relationship shows that the excellent NLO properties of  &#946;  &#8208;BaGa2Se4  mainly originate from edge&#8208;sharing GaSe4  tetrahedral chains, which are different from B3O6  groups in  &#946;&#8208;BBO and respect a new direction for the design of IR NLO crystals. So, we believe that the current research provides not only a new IR NLO crystal but also some insights for the design of new IR NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective C(sp3)&#8208;N Bond Cleavage of N,N&#8208;Dialkyl Tertiary Amines with the Loss of a Large Alkyl Group via an SN1 Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polar disconnection of the C(sp3)&#8208;N bond of N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tertiary amines via ammonium species conventionally favored the loss of the smaller alkyl group by an SN2 displacement, while selective C(sp3)&#8208;N bond cleavage by cutting off the larger alkyl group is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present a novel Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+1] annulation, proceeding through an alkyne&#8208;directed palladacycle formation and consecutive diamination with a tertiary hydroxylamine by cleaving its N&#8208;O bond and one C(sp3)&#8208;N bond, for the rapid assembly of tricyclic indoles in a single&#8208;step transformation. Noteworthy, experimental results indicated that large tert&#8208;butyl and benzyl groups were selectively cleaved via an SN1 pathway, in the presence of a smaller alkyl group (Me, Et, iPr). Under the guidance of this new finding, tricyclic indoles bearing a removable alkyl group could be exclusively obtained by using a (a&#8208;methyl)benzyl/benzyl or tert&#8208;butyl/2&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl mixed amino source.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Biobased Synthesis of Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Petrochemical based polymers, paints and coatings are cornerstones of modern industry but our future sustainable society demands for greener processes and renewable feedstock materials. A challenge is to access platform monomers from biomass resources while integrating the principles of Green Chemistry in their chemical synthesis. Here, we present a synthesis route starting from biomassderived furfural towards the commonly used monomers maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, implementing environmentally benign photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation and ethenolysis reactions. Maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, transformed into sodium acrylate, were isolated in yields of 85% (2 steps) and 81% (4 steps), respectively. With minimal waste and high atom efficiency, this biobased route provides a viable alternative to access key monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Oxyphosphonium Ions by&#160;Photoredox/Cobaloxime Catalysis for Scalable Amide and Peptide Synthesis in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late&#8208;stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous&#8208;flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>From Esters to Ketones via a Photoredox&#8208;Assisted Reductive Acyl Cross&#8208;Coupling (PARAC) Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel/photoredox dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two different carboxylic acid esters towards the synthesis of ketones via a photoredox&#8208;assisted reductive acyl cross&#8208;coupling (PARAC) strategy is developed. A variety of aryl, 1  o  , 2  o  , 3  o  &#8208;alkyl 2pyridyl esters can act as acyl electrophiles while  N  (acyloxy)phthalimides (NHPI esters) act as 1  o  , 2  o  , 3  o  &#8208;radical precursors. Our PARAC strategy provides an alternative and reliable way to synthesize various sterically congested 3  o  &#8208;3  o  , 3  o  &#8208;2  o  , and aryl3  o  ketones under mild and highly unified conditions, which have been otherwise difficult to access. The combined experimental and computational studies identified a Ni(0)/Ni(I)/Ni(III) pathway for ketone formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures for efficient CO2 chemical fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical fixation of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into value&#8208;added organics is regarded as a competitive and viable method in large scale industrial production, during which the catalysts with promoting CO  2  activation ability are needed. Herein, we proposed an in&#8208;plane heterostructure strategy to construct Lewis acid&#8211;base sites for efficient CO  2  activation. By taking ultrathin in&#8208;plane Cu  2  O/Cu heterostructures as a prototype, we show that Lewis acid&#8208;base sites on heterointerface can facilitate a mixed C and O dual coordination on surface, which not only strengthen CO  2  adsorption, but also effectively activate the inert molecules. As revealed by  in&#8208;situ  diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and quasi  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Lewis acid&#8208;base sites could readily activate CO  2  to &#8226;CO  2  &#8211;  species, which is the key intermediate radical for CO  2  fixation. As a result, abundant Lewis acid&#8211;base sites endow Cu  2  O/Cu nanosheets with excellent performances for dimethyl carbonate generation, a high conversion yield of 28% with nearly 100% selectivity under mild conditions. This study provides a model structure for CO  2  fixation reactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemical fixation of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into value-added organics is regarded as a competitive and viable method in large scale industrial production, during which the catalysts with promoting CO  2  activation ability are needed. Herein, we proposed an in-plane heterostructure strategy to construct Lewis acid&#8211;base sites for efficient CO  2  activation. By taking ultrathin in-plane Cu  2  O/Cu heterostructures as a prototype, we show that Lewis acid-base sites on heterointerface can facilitate a mixed C and O dual coordination on surface, which not only strengthen CO  2  adsorption, but also effectively activate the inert molecules. As revealed by  in-situ  diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and quasi  in-situ  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Lewis acid-base sites could readily activate CO  2  to &#8226;CO  2  &#8211;  species, which is the key intermediate radical for CO  2  fixation.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Copper Catalysis for the Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles represent one of the largest groups of organic moieties with significant medicinal, chemical, and industrial applications. Herein, we report the discovery and development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, synergistic excited&#8208;state copper catalysis using a combination of Cu(IPr)I as a catalyst and rac&#8208;BINAP as a ligand, which produces more than 10 distinct classes of heterocycles. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups and complex molecular scaffolds, including derivatives of peptides, natural products, and marketed drugs. Preliminary mechanistic investigation suggests in situ generations of [Cu(BINAP)  2  ]  +  and [Cu(IPr)  2  ]  +  catalysts that work cooperatively under visible&#8208;light irradiation to facilitate catalytic carbo&#8208;aroylation of unactivated alkenes, affording a wide range of useful heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Enabled Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular noncovalent interactions (INIs) have served as a powerful strategy for accessing organic semiconductors with enhanced backbone planarity and charge transport properties. Herein, we apply the INI strategy for developing dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) by constructing two small&#8208;molecular HTMs featuring an INI&#8208;integrated backbone for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Upon incorporating noncovalent S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction into their simple&#8208;structured backbones consisting of a bithiophene core and two triphenylamine ends, the resulting HTMs, BTORA and BTORCNA, showed self&#8208;planarized backbones, tuned energy levels, enhanced thermal properties, appropriate film morphology, and effective defect passivation. More importantly, the high film crystallinity enables the materials with substantial hole mobilities, thus rendering them as promising dopant&#8208;free HTMs. Consequently, the BTORCNA&#8208;based inverted PVSCs delivered a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 21.10% with encouraging long&#8208;term device stability, significantly outperforming the devices based on BTRA without S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction (18.40%). This work offers a general and practical approach to designing charge transporting layers with high intrinsic mobilities for high&#8208;performance PVSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Recurring Chemogenetic Switch for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a revolutionary cancer treatment, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications such as cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. Their mitigation desires controllable activation of CAR&#8208;T cells that is achievable through regulatory display of CARs. By embedding the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease (HCV&#8208;NS3) between the single&#8208;chain variable fragment (scFv) and the hinge domain, we showed that the display of anti&#8208;CD19 scFv on CAR&#8208;T cells was positively correlated to the presence of a clinical HCV&#8208;NS3 inhibitor asunaprevir (ASV). This novel CAR design that allows the display of anti&#8208;CD19 scFv in the presence of ASV and its removal in the absence of ASV creates a practically recurring chemical switch.  We demonstrated that the intact CAR on T cells can be repeatedly turned on and off by controlling the presence of ASV in a dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, which enables delicate modulation of CAR&#8208;T activation during cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on an Organic Antimony(III) Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free hybrids with higher stability and lower toxicity than those of three&#8208;dimensional lead perovskites, organic antimony(III) halides show great application potential in opt&#8208;electronic field owing to diverse topologies along with exceptional optical properties. We report herein an antimony(III) hybrid (MePPh  3  )  2  SbCl  5  with a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structure, which exhibits brilliant orange emission peaked at 593 nm with near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yield (99.4%). The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that the broadband emission with a microsecond lifetime (3.24 &#956;s) arises from self&#8208;trapped emission (STE). Electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on neat and doped films of (MePPh  3  )  2  SbCl  5  were fabricated. The doped devices show significant improvement in comparison to non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Owing to the much improved surface morphology and balanced carrier transport in light&#8208;emitting layers of doped devices, the peak luminance, current efficiency (CE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are boosted from 82 cd/m  2  to 3500 cd/m  2  , 1.1 cd/A to 6.8 cd/A, and 0.7% to 3.1% relative to non&#8208;doped devices, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Titanium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ti&#8208;MOFs), as an appealing type of artificial photocatalysts, have shown great potentials in the field of solar energy conversion due to their well&#8208;studied photo&#8208;redox activity similar to TiO  2  and good optical responsiveness of linkers serving as the antenna to absorb visible&#8208;light. Although enormous efforts have been dedicated to developing Ti&#8208;MOFs with high photocatalytic activity, their solar energy conversion performances are still poor. Herein, a covalent&#8208;integrated strategy has been implemented to construct a series of multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF hybrid materials, PdTCPP&#11814;PCN&#8208;415(NH  2  )/TpPa (composites 1, 2, and 3), featuring excellent visible&#8208;light utilization, suitable band gap, and high surface area for photocatalytic H  2  production. Notably, the resulting composites demonstrated remarkably enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic H  2  evolution performance, especially for the composite 2 with the maximum H  2  evolution rate of 13.98 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  (turn&#8208;over frequency (TOF) = 227 h  &#8208;1  ), which is much higher than the prototypical counterparts, PdTCPP&#11814;PCN&#8208;415(NH  2  ) (0.21 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) and TpPa (6.51 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ). Our work thereby suggests a new approach to develop highly efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic H  2  evolution reaction and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Functionalizations of Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids, into functionalized alkanes via deoxygenation would be highly desirable from a sustainability perspective and very enabling in chemical synthesis. This review covers the recent methodology development in carbonyl and carboxyl deoxygenative functionalizations, highlighting some typical and significant contributions in this field. These advances will be categorized based on types of bond formation, and in each part, selected examples will be discussed from their generalized mechanistic perspectives. Four summarized reactivity modes of aldehydes and ketones during the deoxygenation, namely, bis&#8208;electrophile, carbenoid, bis&#8208;nucleophile and alkyl radical, are presented, while the carboxylic acids are deoxygenated mainly via activated carbonyl or acetal intermediates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein the self&#8208;assembly synthesis of an octanuclear Co(II) [2]catenane {[Co4L6]2}16+ formed by the mechanical interlocking of two [Co4L6]8+ rectangles of unprecedented topology. Subtle manipulation of the synthetic conditions allows the isolation of a mixed valence [Co2III/Co2II]10+ non&#8208;catenated rectangle. The Co(II) centers in the [2]catenane exhibit slow relaxation of their magnetic moment, i.e. single&#8208;molecule magnet properties, dominated by quantum tunneling and Raman relaxation processes. This work shows that metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry can precisely control the organization single&#8208;molecule magnets in topologically complex arrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Elastic Interconnected Porous Hydrogels through Self&#8208;Assembled Templating for Solar Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial evaporation using porous hydrogels has demonstrated highly effective solar evaporation performance under natural sunlight to ensure an affordable clean water supply. However, it remains challenging to realize scalable and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use hydrogel materials with durable mechanical properties. Here, self&#8208;assembled templating (SAT) is developed as a simple yet effective method to fabricate large&#8208;scale elastic hydrogel evaporators with excellent desalination performance. The highly interconnected porous structure of the hydrogels with low tortuosity and tunable pore size enables high level of tunability on the water transport rate. With superior elasticity, the porous hydrogels are easy to process with a rapid shape recovery after being rolled, folded, and twisted over hundred times, and exhibit highly effective and stable evaporation with an evaporation rate of ~ 2.8 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  and ~ 90% solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. It is anticipated that this SAT strategy, without the typical need for freeze&#8208;drying, will accelerate the industrialization of hydrogel solar evaporators for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fighting Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria : Promising Strategies Orchestrated by Molecularly Imprinted Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infections caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are difficult and sometimes impossible to treat, making them one of the major public health problems of our time. We highlight how one unique material  ,  molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), can orchestrate several strategies to fight this major societal issue. MIPs are tailor&#8208;made biomimetic supramolecular receptors that recognize and bind target molecules with a high affinity and selectivity, comparable to those of antibodies. While research on MIPs for combatting cancer has been constantly flourishing, comprehensive work on their involvement in combatting resistant superbugs has been rather scarce. This review aims at filling this gap. We will describe what are the causes of bacterial resistance and at which level MIPs can deploy their weapons. MIPs&#8217; targets can be biofilm constituents, quorum sensing messengers, bacterial surface proteins and antibiotic&#8208;deactivating enzymes, among others. We will conclude on the current challenges and future developments in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Control of a Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Cage via the Dissymmetrical Modulation of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generally, self&#8208;assembly of dissymmetrical ligands can generate a series of isomers with similar thermodynamic stability. In this work, the conformation in the self&#8208;assembly process can be precisely controlled via the increase in ligand dissymmetry. Finally, only the cis&#8208;isomer was obtained. This strategy offered an avenue for designing metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures based on dissymmetrical organic ligands.







Abstract
In nature as well as life systems, the presence of asymmetrical and dissymmetrical structures with specific functions is extremely common. However, the construction of metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies based on dissymmetrical ligands still remains a considerable challenge for avoiding the generation of unexpected isomers with similar thermodynamic stabilities, especially for three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structures. In this study, a strategy for the conformational control of metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages via the enhancement of ligand dissymmetry was proposed. Four dissymmetrical ditopic ligands were designed and synthesized. By increasing the dissymmetry of length or angle, conformations of assemblies were precisely controlled to form discrete cis&#8208;PdnL2n molecular cages.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Triazolate&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived FeN4Cl1 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Hierarchical Porosity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic metal&#8208;triazolate framework (MET) modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole (dcIm) was used to prepare the Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst FeN4Cl1/NC. In the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the catalyst offers fast mass transfer and high catalytic activity because of abundant mesopores (pore:volume ratio 0.92), a high Fe loading (2.78&#8197;wt&#8201;%), and defined FeN4Cl1 sites with a distinct electronic structure.







Abstract
The construction of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high single atom densities, favorable electronic structures and fast mass transfer is highly desired. We have utilized metal&#8208;triazolate (MET) frameworks, a subclass of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high N content, as precursors since they can enhance the density and regulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites, as well as generate abundant mesopores simultaneously. Fe single atoms dispersed in a hierarchically porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix with high metal content (2.78&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and a FeN4Cl1 configuration (FeN4Cl1/NC), as well as mesopores with a pore:volume ratio of 0.92, were obtained via the pyrolysis of a Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic MET modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole. FeN4Cl1/NC exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Cl can optimize the adsorption free energy of Fe sites to *OH, thereby promoting the ORR process. The catalyst demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8208;air batteries. This strategy selects, designs, and adjusts MOFs as precursors for high&#8208;performance SACs.

         <title>Dimensionality Control of Inorganic and Hybrid Perovskite Nanocrystals by Reaction Temperature: From No&#8208;Confinement to 3D and 1D Quantum Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of both inorganic and hybrid halide perovskite nanocrystals is tunable from 3D nanocubes with no&#8208;confinement to 0D nanocubes and 2D nanoplatelets with 3D and 1D&#8208;quantum confinement, respectively by a decrease of the reaction temperature in the hot&#8208;plate approach under inert gas&#8208;free conditions. The synthesis is scalable, and their halide composition is tunable by simply using different combinations of precursor stock solutions.







Abstract
This work focuses on the systematic investigation of the shape, size, and composition&#8208;controlled synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) under inert gas&#8208;free conditions and using pre&#8208;synthesized precursor stock solutions. In the case of CsPbBr3 NCs, we find that the lowering of reaction temperature from &#8764;175 to 100&#8201;&#176;C initially leads to a change of morphology from bulk&#8208;like 3D nanocubes to 0D nanocubes with 3D&#8208;quantum confinement, while at temperatures below 100&#8201;&#176;C the reaction yields 2D nanoplatelets (NPls) with 1D&#8208;quantum confinement. However, to our surprise, at higher temperatures (&#8764;215&#8201;&#176;C), the reaction yields CsPbBr3 hexapod NCs, which have been rarely reported. The synthesis is scalable, and their halide composition is tunable by simply using different combinations of precursor solutions. The versatility of the synthesis is demonstrated by applying it to relatively less explored shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of FAPbBr3 NCs. Despite the synthesis carried out in the air, both the inorganic and hybrid perovskite NCs exhibit nearly&#8208;narrow emission without applying any size&#8208;selective separation, and it is precisely tunable by controlling the reaction temperature.

         <title>Remote C&#8722;H Pyridylation of Hydroxamates through Direct Photoexcitation of O&#8208;Aryl Oxime Pyridinium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote C&#8208;H pyridylation of hydroxamates was developed by designing a new class of photon&#8208;absorbing O&#8208;aryl oxime pyridinium salts generated in&#8197;situ from the corresponding pyridines and hydroxamates. This method involves photolytic N&#8722;O bond cleavage through the photoexcitation of oxime pyridinium intermediates to generate iminyl radicals, which enable the installation of pyridyl rings at the &#947;&#8208;CN position in complex settings under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient strategy for the remote C&#8722;H pyridylation of hydroxamates with excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity by designing a new class of photon&#8208;absorbing O&#8208;aryl oxime pyridinium salts generated in situ from the corresponding pyridines and hydroxamates. When irradiated by visible light, the photoexcitation of oxime pyridinium intermediates generates iminyl radicals via the photolytic N&#8722;O bond cleavage, which does not require an external photocatalyst. The efficiency of light absorption and N&#8722;O bond cleavage of the oxime pyridinium salts can be modulated through the electronic effect of substitution on the O&#8208;aryl ring. The resultant iminyl radicals enable the installation of pyridyl rings at the &#947;&#8208;CN position, which yields synthetically valuable C2&#8208;substituted pyridyl derivatives. This novel synthetic approach provides significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and simplicity and exhibits broad functional group tolerance in complex settings under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte Chemistry Towards High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life Na&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational design of the solvation configuration, a cation&#8211;solvent fully coordinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte with strong oxidation resistance up to 4.5&#8197;V (versus Na+/Na) was developed and applied in graphite//NVPF and LHC//NVPF full cells which showed superior rate performance and unprecedented cycling stability.







Abstract
Although ether&#8208;based electrolytes have been extensively applied in anode evaluation of batteries, anodic instability arising from solvent oxidability is always a tremendous obstacle to matching with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Herein, by rational design for solvation configuration, the fully coordinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte with strong resistance against oxidation is reported, which remains anodically stable with high&#8208;voltage Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPF) cathode under 4.5&#8197;V (versus Na+/Na) protected by an effective interphase. The assembled graphite//NVPF full cells display superior rate performance and unprecedented cycling stability. Beyond that, the constructed full cells coupling the high&#8208;voltage NVPF cathode with hard carbon anode exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances in terms of high average output voltage up to 3.72&#8197;V, long&#8208;term cycle life (such as 95&#8201;% capacity retention after 700 cycles) and high energy density (247&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). In short, the optimized ether&#8208;based electrolyte enriches systematic options, the ability to maintain oxidative stability and compatibility with various anodes, exhibiting attractive prospects for application.

         <title>Critical Assessment of the Reducing Ability of Breslow&#8208;type Derivatives and Implications for Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major cleanup for starting anew: Bio&#8208;inspired Breslow&#8208;type enolates, which mimic thiamine derivatives, are far better reducing agents than previously considered. The reevaluation of the redox ability of these key intermediates refutes established misconceptions and sheds a new light on radical processes involving N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of acyl azolium salts stemming from thiazolylidenes CNS, triazolylidenes CTN, mesoionic carbenes CMIC and the generation of their corresponding radicals and enolates, covering about 60 Breslow&#8208;type derivatives. This study highlights the role of additives in the redox behavior of these compounds and unveils several critical misconceptions about radical transformations of aldehyde derivatives under N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. In particular, the reducing ability of enolates has been dramatically underestimated in the case of biomimetic CNS. In contrast with previous electrochemical studies, we show that these catalytic intermediates can transfer electrons to iodobenzene within minutes at room temperature. Enols derived from CMIC are not the previously claimed super electron donors, although enolate derivatives of CNS and CMIC are powerful reducing agents.

         <title>Structural Basis for Inhibition of ROS&#8208;Producing Respiratory Complex I by NADH&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH binds with high affinity to respiratory complex I, thereby blocking NADH oxidation and the production of reactive oxygen species. The tight interaction is mediated by residues conserved in complex I but lacking in other enzymes containing a Rossmann&#8208;fold. Accordingly, it is a lead structure for the development of new drugs for fighting oxygen stress.







Abstract
NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, respiratory complex I, plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism. As a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) it affects ageing and mitochondrial dysfunction. The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH specifically blocks NADH oxidation and ROS production by complex I in nanomolar concentrations. Attempts to elucidate its structure by NMR spectroscopy have failed. Here, by using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, we report the structure of NADH&#8208;OH bound in the active site of a soluble fragment of complex I at 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution. We have identified key amino acid residues that are specific and essential for binding NADH&#8208;OH. Furthermore, the structure sheds light on the specificity of NADH&#8208;OH towards the unique Rossmann&#8208;fold of complex I and indicates a regulatory role in mitochondrial ROS generation. In addition, NADH&#8208;OH acts as a lead&#8208;structure for the synthesis of a novel class of ROS suppressors.

&lt;p&gt;The novel inhibitor NADH-OH binds with high affinity to respiratory complex I, thereby blocking NADH oxidation and the production of reactive oxygen species. The tight interaction is mediated by residues conserved in complex I but lacking in other enzymes containing a Rossmann-fold. Accordingly, it is a lead structure for the development of new drugs for fighting oxygen stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, respiratory complex I, plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism. As a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) it affects ageing and mitochondrial dysfunction. The novel inhibitor NADH-OH specifically blocks NADH oxidation and ROS production by complex I in nanomolar concentrations. Attempts to elucidate its structure by NMR spectroscopy have failed. Here, by using X-ray crystallographic analysis, we report the structure of NADH-OH bound in the active site of a soluble fragment of complex I at 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution. We have identified key amino acid residues that are specific and essential for binding NADH-OH. Furthermore, the structure sheds light on the specificity of NADH-OH towards the unique Rossmann-fold of complex I and indicates a regulatory role in mitochondrial ROS generation. In addition, NADH-OH acts as a lead-structure for the synthesis of a novel class of ROS suppressors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luminescence Ratiometric Nanothermometry Regulated by Tailoring Annihilators of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanomicelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanomicelle based on triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion is proposed for luminescence ratiometric nanothermometry arising from temperature&#8208;dependent upconverted and downshifted luminescence emission intensities.







Abstract
Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a special non&#8208;linear photophysical process that converts low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons based on sensitizer/annihilator pairs. Here, we constructed a novel luminescence ratiometric nanothermometer based on TTA upconversion nanomicelles by encapsulating sensitizer/annihilator molecules into a temperature&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic triblock polymer and obtained good linear relationships between the luminescence ratio (integrated intensity ratio of upconverted luminescence peak to the downshifted phosphorescence peak) and the temperature. We also found chemical modification of annihilators would rule out the interference of the polymer concentration and stereochemical engineering of annihilators would readily regulate the thermal sensitivity.

         <title>Revealing the Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Dependent Ordering Transition of Highly Crystalline Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers</title>

When switching the alkyl linkers from C12H24 to C16H32 in double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers, perylene bisimide side units exhibited order phase transition from disordered structures to ordered H&#8208;aggregation, which is strongly correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.







Abstract
We developed a series of highly crystalline double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). These polymers contain conjugated backbones as electron donor and pendant perylene bisimide units (PBIs) as electron acceptor. PBIs are connected to the backbone via alkyl units varying from hexyl (C6H12) to eicosyl (C20H40) as flexible linkers. For double&#8208;cable polymers with short linkers, the PBIs tend to stack in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fashion, resulting in large d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 64&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P12 with C12H24 linker) along the lamellar stacking direction. When the length of the linker groups is longer than a certain length, the PBIs instead adopt a more ordered packing likely via H&#8208;aggregation, resulting in short d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 50&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P16 with C16H32 linker). This work highlights the importance of linker length on the molecular packing of the acceptor units and the influences on the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Interfacial Layer for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A slide&#8208;ring polymer with a high stiffness, high toughness and excellent fracture resistance is designed to adapt its shape to dynamic electrode volume variations and stabilize the lithium anode upon cycling.







Abstract
The plating/stripping of Li dendrites can fracture the static solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cause significant dynamic volume variations in the Li anode, which give rise to poor cyclability and severe safety hazards. Herein, a tough polymer with a slide&#8208;ring structure was designed as a self&#8208;adaptive interfacial layer for Li anodes. The slide&#8208;ring polymer with a dynamically crosslinked network moves freely while maintaining its toughness and fracture resistance, which allows it can to dissipate the tension induced by Li dendrites on the interphase layer. Moreover, the slide&#8208;ring polymer is highly stretchable, elastic, and displays an ultrafast self&#8208;healing ability, which allows even pulverized Li to remain coalesced without disintegrating upon consecutive cycling. The Li anodes demonstrate greatly improved suppression of Li dendrite formation, as evidenced by the high critical current density (6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stable cycling for the full cells with high&#8208;areal capacity LiFePO4, high&#8208;voltage NCM, and S cathodes.

N&#8208;doping significantly improves the peroxidase (POD) activity of titanium&#8208;based nanozymes. Titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) showed enhanced POD activity under NIR laser irradiation due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and temperature effects. Combined with glucose oxidase in liposomes, a TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;based nanoplatform (TLGp) showed an excellent antitumor activity under NIR&#8208;mediated mild thermal conditions through its cascade&#8208;catalytic activity.







Abstract
Nanozyme&#8208;based catalytic tumor therapy is an emerging therapeutic method with high reactivity in response to tumor microenvironments (TMEs). To overcome the current limitations of deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes, we studied the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on non&#8208;metallic&#8208;atom doping and irradiation. Nitrogen doping significantly enhanced the peroxidase activity of Ti&#8208;based nanozymes, which was shown experimentally and theoretically. Based on the excellent NIR&#8208;adsorption&#8208;induced surface plasmon resonance and photothermal effect, the enzymatic activity of TiN nanoparticles (NPs) was further improved under NIR laser irradiation. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and irradiation&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (TLGp) is presented by using TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;encapsulated liposomes linked with pH&#8208;responsive PEG&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive GOx&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, nitrogen&#8208;doping, and irradiation&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity of TiN NPs and mild&#8208;photothermal therapy enables an effective tumor inhibition by TLGp with minimal side effects in&#8197;vivo.

A solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is developed for facile synthesis of highly oriented and well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;95 membranes. The solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also reduce solvent&#8208;induced intercrystalline defects, leading to a significant enhancement of the H2 permselectivity for the separation of hydrogen from larger gas molecules compared to solvothermal synthesis.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework membranes are usually prepared by in situ or secondary growth in a solution/hydrogel. The use of organic solvents may cause safety and environmental problems and produce solvent&#8208;induced defects. Here, highly oriented and permselective ZIF&#8208;95 membranes are prepared for the first time via a solvent&#8208;free secondary growth method. The solvent&#8208;free growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also to reduce the intercrystalline defects. In case of solvent&#8208;free growth, a perfectly oriented structure leads to an outstanding reduction of intercrystalline defects and transport resistances. For the separation of equimolar binary gas mixtures by using the highly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 are 184 and 140, respectively, with H2 permeance of over 1.9&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 which are much higher than those of the randomly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane.

         <title>Stepwise Generation of Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Triply&#8208;Reduced Warped Nanographenes: Charge&#8208;Dependent Aromaticity, Surface Nonequivalence, Swing Distortion, and Metal Binding Sites</title>

Stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG, 1) with Cs metal affords the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and triply&#8208;reduced nanosized carbanions. In&#8208;depth X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and comprehensive theoretical investigations of this series of negatively charged nanographenes reveal a very complex response and core flexibility upon multi&#8208;electron charging.







Abstract
The stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG) having a negatively curved &#960;&#8208;surface and defined C80H30 composition with Cs metal used as the reducing and complexing agent allowed the isolation of three different reduced states with one, two, and three electrons added to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. This provided a unique series of nanosized carbanions with increasing negative charge for in&#8208;depth structural analysis of consequences of controlled electron charging of non&#8208;planar nanographenes, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational tools. The 3D molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps identified the negative charge localization at the central part of the WNG surface where selective coordination of Cs+ ions is confirmed crystallographically. In&#8208;depth theoretical investigation revealed a complex response of the WNG to the stepwise electron acquisition. The extended and contorted &#960;&#8208;surface of the WNG undergoes subtle swinging distortions that are accompanied by notable changes in the electronic structure and site&#8208;dependent aromaticity of the resulting carbanions.

Red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with high PLQY (65.5&#8201;%) were obtained from aliphatic precursors by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) peak, was constructed and resulted in a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB.







Abstract
Miniaturized solid&#8208;state lasers with a single longitudinal mode are vital for various photonic applications. Here we prepare red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 65.5&#8201;% by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. High&#8208;concentration doping alters the CDs&#8217; emission from blue to red, while the electron&#8208;donating groups and polymer coating on their surfaces improve the PLQY and photostability. The CDs exhibit excellent stimulated emission characteristics, with a low threshold of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and long gain lifetime. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; ASE peak, was constructed. Combining the CDs and microcavity produced a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB (Q&#8764;4600). Our results will aid the development of colorful solid&#8208;state micro/nano lasers with potential use in practical photonics.

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Induced Fragmentation of Polymerized Hydrophilic Carbon Nitride for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>

Iodide ions are utilized as an inhibitor for terminating the polymerization of PCN (TP&#8208;PCN). The resulting ultrathin and small&#8208;sized TP&#8208;PCN have abundant edge active sites (AEASs). They greatly enhance the O2 adsorption/activation capacity and the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) selectivity. As expected, the TP&#8208;PCN affords a remarkably increased photocatalytic H2O2 production activity.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a class of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR) photocatalyst has attracted much attention for H2O2 production. However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR greatly restrict the H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the terminating polymerization (TP&#8208;PCN) effect of iodide ions. The obtained TP&#8208;PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H2O2 generation rate (3265.4&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1), far surpassing PCN and other PCN&#8208;based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP&#8208;PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin&#8208;orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O2, which optimizes O2 activation and reduces the energy barrier of H2O2 formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O2 activation in ORR for H2O2 production.

Accurate co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2: HAL and 3BP&#8208;loaded microparticles specifically target and recognize tumor cells, wherein HAL induces the biosynthesis of PpIX in mitochondria and 3BP reduces the mitochondria oxygen consumption. The precise co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2 produces sufficient singlet oxygen to directly disrupt mitochondria, significantly improving PDT.







Abstract
Positioning essential elements of photodynamic therapy (PDT) near to mitochondria can conquer the rigorous spatiotemporal limitations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer and make considerable differences in PDT. However, precise accumulation of photosensitizer (PS) and oxygen within mitochondria is still challenging. We simultaneously encapsulated hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) and 3&#8208;bromopyruvic acid (3BP) into microparticles collected from X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated tumor cells (X&#8208;MP). After systemic administration, the developed HAL/3BP@X&#8208;MP can specifically target and recognize tumor cells, where HAL induces efficient accumulation of PpIX in mitochondria via the intrinsic haem biosynthetic pathway. Meanwhile, 3BP remarkably increases the oxygen supply by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The accurate co&#8208;localization and prompt encounter of PpIX and oxygen produce sufficient ROS to directly disrupt mitochondria, resulting in significantly improved PDT outcomes.

         <title>APEX2&#8208;based Proximity Labeling of Atox1 Identifies CRIP2 as a Nuclear Copper&#8208;binding Protein that Regulates Autophagy Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25346-25355, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeking to overcome challenges with the identification of copper chaperone protein's binding partners, we used APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling with Atox1 as the bait to identify weak/transient protein&#8211;protein interactions. Atox1 delivers copper into the nucleus and transfers it to a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein CRIP2, and copper promotes CRIP2 degradation to induce ROS&#8208;mediated activation of autophagy.







Abstract
Mammalian cell nuclei contain copper, and cancer cells are known to accumulate aberrantly high copper levels, yet the mechanisms underlying nuclear accumulation and copper's broader functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, by combining APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling focused on the copper chaperone Atox1 with mass spectrometry we identified a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein, Cysteine&#8208;rich protein 2 (CRIP2), that interacts with Atox1 in the nucleus. We show that Atox1 transfers copper to CRIP2, which induces a change in CRIP2&#8242;s secondary structure that ultimately promotes its ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of CRIP2&#8208;as well as copper&#8208;induced CRIP2 degradation&#8208;elevates ROS levels and activates autophagy in H1299 cells. Thus, our study establishes that CRIP2 as an autophagic suppressor protein and implicates CRIP2&#8208;mediated copper metabolism in the activation of autophagy in cancer cells.

         <title>Ultrathin Crystalline Covalent&#8208;Triazine&#8208;Framework Nanosheets with Electron Donor Groups for Synergistically Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25381-25390, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets with electron donor groups are prepared for the first time by a novel redox strategy. They demonstrate ultrahigh photocatalytic overall water splitting performance arising from the optimized band structure and improved light&#8208;responsive range from the electron donor groups introduced into the 2D ordered molecular plane.







Abstract
Ultrathin nanosheets have great potential for photocatalytic applications, however, suffer from enlarged band gap and narrowed visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range due to the quantum confinement effect. Herein, we report a novel redox strategy for efficient preparation of ultrathin crystalline amide&#8208;functionalized covalent&#8208;triazine&#8208;framework nanosheets (CTF NSs) with enhanced visible light absorption. The CTF NSs exhibited photocatalytic hydrogen (512.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and oxygen (12.37&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) evolution rates much higher than that of pristine bulk CTF. Photocatalytic overall water splitting could be achieved with efficient stoichiometric H2 (5.13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and O2 (2.53&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) evolution rates under visible light irradiation. Experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that introduction of amide groups as electron donor optimized the band structure and improve its visible&#8208;light absorption, hydrophilicity and carrier separation efficiency, thus resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic performance. The well&#8208;dispersed CTF NSs could be easily cast onto a support as a thin film device and demonstrate excellent photocatalytic activity (25.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution).

Simple and selective synthesis of fluoromethylated alkenes, heterocycles, enamines and heteroarenes by using the readily available and bench&#8208;stable fluoromethylphosphonium iodide salts is described. Key to this privileged transformation is the formation of a photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complex involving the &#963;&#8208;hole effect of phosphonium salts.







Abstract
The sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole effect has emerged as a promising tool to construct novel architectures endowed with new properties. A simple yet effective strategy for the generation of monofluoromethyl radicals is a continuing challenge within the synthetic community. Fluoromethylphosphonium salts are easily available, air&#8208; and thermally stable, as well as simple&#8208;to&#8208;handle. Herein, we report the ability of the &#963;&#8208;hole effect to facilitate the visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photolysis of phosphonium iodide salts, a charge&#8208;transfer complex, selectively giving fluoromethyl radicals. The usefulness and versatility of this new protocol are demonstrated through the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoromethylation of a variety of alkenes.

         <title>Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;Index Faceting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25391-25396, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With density functional theory, the phenomena that drive the shape selectivity of NiO particles crystallized by molten salt synthesis were studied. Trapezohedral NiO particles are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to the interaction of locally ordered alkali&#8208;chloride structures with the growing high&#8208;index oxide facets, thus acting as capping agents. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO formation is driven by the dissociative adsorption of water.







Abstract
Given the strong influence of surface structure on the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, understanding the mechanisms that control crystal morphology is an important component of designing catalytic materials with targeted shape and functionality. Herein, we employ density functional theory to examine the impact of growth media on NiO crystal faceting in line with experimental findings, showing that molten&#8208;salt synthesis in alkali chlorides (KCl, LiCl, and NaCl) imposes shape selectivity on NiO particles. We find that the production of NiO octahedra is attributed to the dissociative adsorption of H2O, whereas the formation of trapezohedral particles is associated with the control of the growth kinetics exerted by ordered salt structures on high&#8208;index facets. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that growth inhibition of metal&#8208;oxide facets occurs by a localized ordering of molten salts at the crystal&#8211;solvent interface. These findings provide new molecular&#8208;level insight on kinetics and thermodynamics of molten&#8208;salt synthesis as a predictive route to shape&#8208;engineer metal&#8208;oxide crystals.

         <title>Proton Traffic Jam: Effect of Nanoconfinement and Acid Concentration on Proton Hopping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25419-25427, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of proton transport within nonionic reverse micelles is dependent on the proton concentration ([H+]) and the size of the nanoconfined environment. For small reverse micelles and/or low [H+], protons diffuse via the Grotthuss mechanism (forward hopping). In larger reverse micelles and/or at high [H+], ions accumulate at the reverse micelles interface, resulting in a proton &#8220;traffic jam,&#8221; in which an oscillatory hopping mechanism becomes dominant.







Abstract
The properties of the water network in concentrated HCl acid pools in nanometer&#8208;sized reverse nonionic micelles were probed with TeraHertz absorption, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, and reactive force field simulations capable of describing proton hopping mechanisms. We identify that only at a critical micelle size of W0=9 do solvated proton complexes form in the water pool, accompanied by a change in mechanism from Grotthuss forward shuttling to one that favors local oscillatory hopping. This is due to a preference for H+ and Cl&#8722; ions to adsorb to the micelle interface, together with an acid concentration effect that causes a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in which the short&#8208;circuiting of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif of the hydronium ion decreases the forward hopping rate throughout the water interior even as the micelle size increases. These findings have implications for atmospheric chemistry, biochemical and biophysical environments, and energy materials, as transport of protons vital to these processes can be suppressed due to confinement, aggregation, and/or concentration.

         <title>Plenty of Room at the Top: A Multi&#8208;Scale Understanding of nm&#8208;Resolution Polymer Patterning on 2D Materials</title>

Striped phase polydiacetylenes create 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution chemical patterns on 2D materials, well below the limits possible through most fabrication methods. A new multi&#8208;scale view of polymerization enables the design of monomers that undergo efficient on&#8208;surface polymerization, opening the door to new applications that rely on stable, near&#8208;atomic&#8208;scale chemical environments.







Abstract
Lamellar phases of alkyldiacetylenes in which the alkyl chains lie parallel to the substrate represent a straightforward means for scalable 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution interfacial patterning. This capability has the potential for substantial impacts in nanoscale electronics, energy conversion, and biomaterials design. Polymerization is required to set the 1&#8208;nm functional patterns embedded in the monolayer, making it important to understand structure&#8211;function relationships for these on&#8208;surface reactions. Polymerization can be observed for certain monomers at the single&#8208;polymer scale using scanning probe microscopy. However, substantial restrictions on the systems that can be effectively characterized have limited utility. Here, using a new multi&#8208;scale approach, we identify a large, previously unreported difference in polymerization efficiency between the two most widely used commercial diynoic acids. We further identify a core design principle for maximizing polymerization efficiency in these on&#8208;surface reactions, generating a new monomer that also exhibits enhanced polymerization efficiency.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity: Effect of Iron Spin&#8208;State Tuning</title>

The enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts is studied from Fe spin&#8208;state tuning. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra monitoring further supported the low&#8208;spin (LS) single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of the C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for the ORR.







Abstract
Heteroatom doped atomically dispersed Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts have been found to show excellent activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure&#8208;function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(S)&#8208;doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe&#8208;NC materials. 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe1&#8208;NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process. This work elucidates the underlying mechanisms towards S doping for enhancing ORR activity, and paves a way to investigate the function of broader heteroatom doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts to offer a general guideline for spin&#8208;state&#8208;determined ORR.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Phosphate Cathode for High&#8208;Rate and Ultralong Cycle&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A low&#8208;strain phosphate cathode material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (KVP) nanoruler is synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach. The KVP nanorulers manifest high discharge voltage, superior rate capability, and ultralong cyclic life as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). This work would provide guidance to exploit high&#8208;performance PIB cathode materials.







Abstract
Most potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) cathode materials have deficient structural stability because of the huge radius of potassium ion, leading to inferior cycling performance. We report the controllable synthesis of a novel low&#8208;strain phosphate material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (denoted KVP) nanorulers as an efficient cathode for PIBs. The as&#8208;synthesized KVP nanoruler cathode exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 80.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a large average working potential of 4.11&#8197;V. It also manifests an excellent rate property of 54.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity preservation of 92.1&#8201;% over 2500&#8197;cycles. The outstanding potassium storage capability of KVP nanoruler cathode originates from a low&#8208;strain K+ uptake/removal mechanism, inherent semiconductor characteristic, and small K+ migration energy barrier. The high energy density and prolonged cyclic stability of KVP nanorulers//polyaniline&#8208;intercalated layered titanate full battery verifies the superiority of KVP nanoruler cathode in PIBs.

The elusive SbI cation has been stabilized by the 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene ligand (see structure). The bis(phosphine) not only acts as a supporting ligand, but also enables the unique two&#8208;electron reduction of the SbIII precursor in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate, leading to SbI cation. The strategically introduced nucleophilicity at the SbI site enabled the first examples of its coordination to transition metals.







Abstract
Upon stabilization by 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene to form compound 1, the fugitive antimony (I) cation exhibited nucleophilic behavior towards coinage metals. Compound 1 was strategically synthesized at room temperature from SbCl3, the bis(phosphine), and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate taken in a 1:2:3 ratio, whereby the bis(phosphine) plays the dual role of a reductant and a supporting ligand. The generation of 1 involves two&#8208;electron oxidation of the ligand to form a P&#8722;P bonded diphosphonium dication. Compound 1 was separated from this dication to give both products in pure form in moderate yields. Despite the overall positive charge, the SbI site in 1 was found to bind to metal centers, forming complexes with AuI, AgI and CuI. Compound 1 reduced CuII to CuI and formed a coordination complex with the resulting CuI species. The effects of the electron&#8208;rich bis(phosphine) and the constrained peri geometry in stabilizing and enhancing the nucleophilicity of 1 have been rationalized through computational studies.

         <title>NMR Spectroscopy of the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Fragment&#8208;Based Screening Identify Three Protein Hotspots and an Antiviral Fragment</title>

We report the liquid&#8208;sate NMR spectroscopy analysis of the dimeric SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (3CLp), including its backbone assignments, to study its complex conformational regulation. Using fragment&#8208;based NMR screening, we highlighted three hotspots on the protein, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface, and we identified a non&#8208;covalent reversible inhibitor of 3CLp that has antiviral activity in infected cells.







Abstract
The main protease (3CLp) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the causative agent for the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, is one of the main targets for drug development. To be active, 3CLp relies on a complex interplay between dimerization, active site flexibility, and allosteric regulation. The deciphering of these mechanisms is a crucial step to enable the search for inhibitors. In this context, using NMR spectroscopy, we studied the conformation of dimeric 3CLp from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and monitored ligand binding, based on NMR signal assignments. We performed a fragment&#8208;based screening that led to the identification of 38 fragment hits. Their binding sites showed three hotspots on 3CLp, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface. F01 is a non&#8208;covalent inhibitor of the 3CLp and has antiviral activity in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells. This study sheds light on the complex structure&#8208;function relationships of 3CLp and constitutes a strong basis to assist in developing potent 3CLp inhibitors.

         <title>Block Copolymers Based on Ethylene and Methacrylates Using a Combination of Catalytic Chain Transfer Polymerisation (CCTP) and Radical Polymerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25356-25364, November 22, 2021. </description>

Catalytic chain transfer polymerisation was used to produce methacrylic macromonomers. Those were involved in a simple radical polymerisation of ethylene to form block copolymers featuring a polyethylene segment and various polymethacrylic segments.







Abstract
Two scalable polymerisation methods are used in combination for the synthesis of ethylene and methacrylate block copolymers. &#969;&#8208;Unsaturated methacrylic oligomers (MMAn) produced by catalytic chain transfer (co)polymerisation (CCTP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are used as reagents in the radical polymerisation of ethylene (E) in dimethyl carbonate solvent under relatively mild conditions (80&#8197;bar, 70&#8201;&#176;C). Kinetic measurements and analyses of the produced copolymers by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques indicate that MMAn is involved in a degradative chain transfer process resulting in the formation of (MMA)n&#8208;b&#8208;PE block copolymers. Molecular modelling performed by DFT supports the overall reactivity scheme and observed selectivities. The effect of MMAn molar mass and composition is also studied. The block copolymers were characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and their bulk behaviour studied by SAXS/WAXS analysis.

         <title>A Cryptic Plant Terpene Cyclase Producing Unconventional 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic C25 and C20 Terpenoids with Immunosuppressive Activity</title>

A cryptic plant terpene cyclase producing unconventional macrocyclic sesterterpenoids and diterpenoids was characterized from Leucosceptrum canum. Two variants producing more sesterterpenoids were engineered, and the immunosuppressive activity of these sesterterpenoids was found.







Abstract
A versatile terpene synthase (LcTPS2) producing unconventional macrocyclic terpenoids was characterized from Leucosceptrum canum. Engineered Escherichia coli and Nicotiana benthamiana expressing LcTPS2 produced six 18&#8208;/14&#8208;membered sesterterpenoids including five new ones and two 14&#8208;membered diterpenoids. These products represent the first macrocyclic sesterterpenoids from plants and the largest sesterterpenoid ring system identified to date. Two variants F516A and F516G producing approximately 3.3&#8208; and 2.5&#8208;fold, respectively, more sesterterpenoids than the wild&#8208;type enzyme were engineered. Both 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered ring sesterterpenoids displayed significant inhibitory activity on the IL&#8208;2 and IFN&#8208;&#947; production of T&#8197;cells probably via inhibition of the MAPK pathway. The findings will contribute to the development of efficient biocatalysts to create bioactive macrocyclic sesterterpenoids, and also herald a new potential in the well&#8208;trodden territory of plant terpenoid biosynthesis.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides by Hydrogen with Rhodium(I)&#8211;Platinum(II) Olefin Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25372-25380, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyzed hydrogenation of NO2, NO, and N2O is achieved under mild conditions by air stable olefin RhI&#8211;PtII bimetallic complexes. In the molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8722;Pt interaction is a direct metal&#8722;metal bond and cooperativity of both metals in substrate activation is proposed based on DFT. A hyponitrite rhodium complex is a key intermediate for the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step in the catalytic reduction of NO.







Abstract
The nitrogen oxides NO2, NO, and N2O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21st century. A bimetallic RhI&#8211;PtII complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxifying these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to form water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3&#8211;4&#8197;bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to water and N2 was recorded, making these RhI&#8211;PtII complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON=38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2, TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NOx were investigated by a combination of multinuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO2 proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H2O, followed by the generation of N2O and H2O, which is then further converted to N2 and H2O. The nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen bond&#8208;forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N2O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) complex, which was detected as an intermediate.

     alt="Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides by Hydrogen with Rhodium(I)&#8211;Platinum(II) Olefin Complexes as Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalyzed hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is achieved under mild conditions by air stable olefin Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; bimetallic complexes. In the molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8722;Pt interaction is a direct metal&#8722;metal bond and cooperativity of both metals in substrate activation is proposed based on DFT. A hyponitrite rhodium complex is a key intermediate for the N&#8722;N bond-forming step in the catalytic reduction of NO.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nitrogen oxides NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. A bimetallic Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxifying these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to form water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3&#8211;4&#8197;bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to water and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was recorded, making these Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON=38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; were investigated by a combination of multinuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, followed by the generation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is then further converted to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen bond-forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) complex, which was detected as an intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Double the stoichiometry in radical recognition: A highly selective and efficient protocol, based on radical&#8208;pairing interactions, was developed for the recognition of two viologen radical cations in solution using a size&#8208;matched radical host.







Abstract
Complexation between a viologen radical cation (V.+) and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) diradical dication (CBPQT2(.+)) has been investigated and utilized extensively in the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) and artificial molecular machines (AMMs). The selective recognition of a pair of V.+ using radical&#8208;pairing interactions, however, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the efficient encapsulation of two methyl viologen radical cations (MV.+) in a size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host &#8212; namely, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalene)2(.+), i.e., CBPQN2(.+). Central to this dual recognition process was the choice of 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene linkers for incorporation into the bisradical dicationic host. They provide the space between the two bipyridinium radical cations in CBPQN2(.+) suitable for binding two MV.+ with relatively short (3.05&#8211;3.25&#8197;&#197;) radical&#8208;pairing distances. The size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host was found to exhibit highly selective and cooperative association with the two MV.+ in MeCN at room temperature. The formation of the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex &#8212; namely, [(MV)2&#8834;CBPQN]4(.+) &#8211; in MeCN was confirmed by VT 1H&#8197;NMR, as well as by EPR spectroscopy. The solid&#8208;state superstructure of [(MV)2&#8834;CBPQN]4(.+) reveals an uneven distribution of the binding distances (3.05, 3.24, 3.05&#8197;&#197;) between the three different V.+, suggesting that localization of the radical&#8208;pairing interactions has a strong influence on the packing of the two MV.+ inside the bisradical dicationic host. Our findings constitute a rare example of binding two radical guests with high affinity and cooperativity using host&#8208;guest radical&#8208;pairing interactions. Moreover, they open up possibilities of harnessing the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex as a new, orthogonal and redox&#8208;switchable recognition motif for the construction of MIMs and AMMs.

         <title>Highly Selective Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene over Atomically Isolated Nickel&#8211;Nitrogen Site/Copper Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25485-25492, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to enhance the selectivity of the CO2 electroreduction reaction towards C2H4 with a 6&#8208;fold increase in comparison with that of the non&#8208;tandem catalysts. The local high concentration of CO generated by atomically isolated nickel&#8211;nitrogen sites PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 on the nearby Cu NP sites, thus switching from CH4 to C2H4 production with a Faradaic efficiency of 57.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Herein, an effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to improve the selectivity of the CO2RR towards C2H4 by multiple distinct catalytic sites in local vicinity. An earth&#8208;abundant elements&#8208;based tandem electrocatalyst PTF(Ni)/Cu is constructed by uniformly dispersing Cu nanoparticles (NPs) on the porphyrinic triazine framework anchored with atomically isolated nickel&#8211;nitrogen sites (PTF(Ni)) for the enhanced CO2RR to produce C2H4. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 reaches 57.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is about 6 times higher than the non&#8208;tandem catalyst PTF/Cu, which produces CH4 as the major carbon product. The operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the local high concentration of CO generated by PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 on the nearby Cu NP sites. The work offers an effective avenue to design electrocatalysts for the highly selective CO2RR to produce multicarbon products via a tandem route.

Thioflavin&#8197;T dramatically enhances the structural and mechanical properties of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel and drives the self&#8208;assembly by interfering the metastable phase of the two&#8208;step nucleation process.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of peptides is a key direction for fabrication of advanced materials. Novel approaches for fine tuning of macroscopic and microscopic properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies are of a high demand for constructing biomaterials with desired properties. In this work, while studying the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;Diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) dipeptide self&#8208;assembly using the Thioflavin&#8197;T (ThT) dye, we observed that the presence of ThT strongly modifies structural and mechanical properties of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel. Notably, the presence of ThT resulted in a tenfold increase of the gelation time and in the formation of short and dense fibers in the hydrogel. As a result of these morphological alteration higher thermal stability, and most important, tenfold increase of the hydrogel rigidity was achieved. Hence, ThT not only slowed the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel formation, but also strongly enhanced its mechanical properties. In this study, we provide a detailed description of the ThT effect on the hydrogel properties and suggest the mechanisms for this phenomenon, paving the way for the novel approach to the control of the peptide hydrogels&#8217; micro&#8208; and macroscale properties.

         <title>Overcoming the Low Driving Force in Forming Depolymerizable Polymers through Monomer Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25493-25498, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization of fused&#8208;ring cyclooctene monomers substantially elevates the driving force in forming depolymerizable polymers, enabling living polymerization and block copolymer synthesis at initial monomer concentration &#8805;0.025&#8197;M. The sequence of isomerization&#8208;polymerization&#8208;depolymerization forms a unique closed&#8208;loop that can be exploited for developing chemically recyclable polymers.







Abstract
While depolymerizable polymers have been intensely pursued as a potential solution to address the challenges in polymer sustainability, most depolymerization systems are characterized by a low driving force in polymerization, which poses difficulties for accessing diverse functionalities and architectures of polymers. Here, we address this challenge by using a cyclooctene&#8208;based depolymerization system, in which the cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans alkene isomerization significantly increases the ring strain energy to enable living ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization at monomer concentrations &#8805;0.025&#8197;M. An additional trans&#8208;cyclobutane fused at the 5,6&#8208;position of the cyclooctene reduces the ring strain energy of cyclooctene, enabling the corresponding polymers to depolymerize into the cis&#8208;cyclooctene monomers. The use of excess triphenylphosphine was found to be essential to suppress secondary metathesis and depolymerization. The high&#8208;driving&#8208;force living polymerization of the trans&#8208;cyclobutane fused trans&#8208;cyclooctene system holds promise for developing chemically recyclable polymers of a wide variety of polymer architectures.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Formation of Rh2O3 Nanoparticles on h&#8208;BN Support for Highly Controlled Methane Partial Oxidation to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25411-25418, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;phase Rh2O3 nanocatalyst is developed by exploiting the stabilization of the (110) plane of the Rh2O3(I) seed on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) after decomposition of the rhodium precursor. By using the Rh/h&#8208;BN, catalytic methane partial oxidation to syngas was accomplished solely via the direct route.







Abstract
Single&#8208;phase formation of active metal oxides on supports has been vigorously pursued in many catalytic applications to suppress undesired reactions and to determine direct structure&#8208;property relationships. However, this is difficult to achieve in nanoscale range because the effect of non&#8208;uniform metal&#8208;support interfaces becomes dominant in the overall catalyst growth, leading to the nucleation of various metastable oxides. Herein, we develop a supported single&#8208;phase corundum&#8208;Rh2O3(I) nanocatalyst by utilizing controlled interaction between metal oxide and h&#8208;BN support. Atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and first&#8208;principle calculation reveal that single&#8208;phase formation occurs via uniform and preferential attachment of Rh2O3(I) (110) seed planes on well&#8208;defined h&#8208;BN surface after decomposition of rhodium precursor. By utilizing the Rh/h&#8208;BN catalyst in methane partial oxidation, syngas is successfully produced solely following the direct route with keeping a H2/CO ratio of 2, which makes it ideal for most downstream chemical processes.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Induced Perpetual Recovery on All Elemental Defects in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25567-25574, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards stable solar cells, ferrocene as a perpetual recovering agent has been developed to fix all elemental defects in ABX3 perovskite by a chain&#8208;reaction cycle. The ferrocene cations can form a 1D perovskite structure which has suitable dissociation energy to convert back to light&#8208;harvesting 3D perovskite and reactivate its photovoltaic performance. Based on this recovering agent, perovskite solar cell can achieve &gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;h lifetime.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskites always emerge complex interactions among different elemental ions, which lead to multiple intrinsic imperfections. Elemental defects, such as amine, Pb, and I vacancies at A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and X&#8208;sites, are main issues to deteriorate perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, most previous passivators can only temporarily fix partial inactive vacancies as sacrificial agents. Herein, we propose a recovery agent, ferrocene (Fc), which can form a one&#8208;dimensional perovskite with adequate steric cavities and suitable dissociation energy to recover all elemental defects back to active light&#8208;harvesting perovskites, and regenerate Fc itself meanwhile. Based on this perpetual chain&#8208;reaction cycle, corresponding PSCs maintain &gt;10&#8201;000&#8208;hour lifetime in inert condition and &gt;1000&#8208;hour durabilities under various extreme environments, including continuous 85&#8201;&#176;C heating, 50&#8201;% relative humidity wetting, and 1&#8208;sun light soaking.

A supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem that reprograms the cellular antioxidant system via synergistic chemical and gene regulations is reported, achieving an efficient suppression of breast cancer.







Abstract
Incorporating multiple molecular interactions within a system to realize the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is prospected to be of great potential in cancer therapy. Herein, we report a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem, which reprogrammed the cellular antioxidant system via synergistic chemical and gene regulations. In the nanosystem, amphipathic telluroether was coordinated with MnII to self&#8208;assemble into micelle, on which a siNrf2 integrated DNA network was assembled. The great electron&#8208;donating capability of telluroether was revealed to greatly promote MnII&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reaction to generate subversive .OH in cancer cells. In response to adenosine triphosphoric acid, the siNrf2 was specially released in cytoplasm for down&#8208;regulating expression of detoxification enzymes, which enhanced chemocatalysis&#8208;mediated oxidative stress in cancer cells, thus significantly suppressing tumor progression.

         <title>The Facile Dissociation of Carbon&#8211;Oxygen Bonds in CO2 and CO on the Surface of LaCoSiHx Intermetallic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25538-25545, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the facile dissociation of CO2 and CO on the surface of the LaCoSiHx catalyst is observed at room temperature. This is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO2 and CO.







Abstract
In catalysis science, the electronic structure of the active site determines the structure&#8211;activity relationship of the catalyst to a large extent. Therefore, modulating the electronic structure has become a main route for the rational design of metal&#8208;based catalyst materials. In this work, we prepared a LaCoSiHx material that has more electronegativity and a lower workfunction than traditional supported Co&#8208;based catalysts. Using CO2 methanation as a model catalytic reaction, the facile dissociation of CO2 and CO (a key reaction intermediate) on the surface of the LaCoSiHx catalyst is observed by various experimental methods (e.g., in situ Raman and FTIR) at room temperature. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further show that LaCoSiHx has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8211;oxygen bond activation than the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO2 and CO.

Therefore, modulating the electronic structure has become a main route for the rational design of metal-based catalyst materials. In this work, we prepared a LaCoSiH&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; material that has more electronegativity and a lower workfunction than traditional supported Co-based catalysts. Using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation as a model catalytic reaction, the facile dissociation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO (a key reaction intermediate) on the surface of the LaCoSiH&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst is observed by various experimental methods (e.g., in situ Raman and FTIR) at room temperature. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further show that LaCoSiH&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8211;oxygen bond activation than the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A porous platinum&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon results in improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance as a result of the interaction between the ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C units.







Abstract
Integrated fabrication through the strong interaction between catalyst and carrier is crucial to realize efficient oxygen electrocatalysis for fuel cells. We report herein a porous Pt&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon via integration engineering, where a synergistic catalysis between ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C results in the optimized reaction pathway and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The hybrid catalyst PtCuCo@Co&#8208;N&#8208;C delivers a mass activity of 1.14&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and a peak power density of 960&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the full&#8208;cell assessment, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.12&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and 780&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Experimental results combined with theoretical simulations suggest that the mutual assistance between porous Pt alloy and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C accounts for the enhanced catalytic performance. Such integrated engineering concept is significant for strengthening the anti&#8208;corrosion capabilities and improving the ORR performance of Pt&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Bridged Bicyclic Glycosyl Dioxacarbenium Ion by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy: Importance of Conformation on Participation by Distal Esters</title>

Simple methylation at the 4&#8208;position of a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enables direct observation by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy of the previously elusive bridging dioxacarbenium ion, supporting the hypothesis that distal group participation by secondary esters is disfavored by the conformation of the ester.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature NMR studies with a 4&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enable the observation and characterization of a bridged bicyclic dioxacarbenium ion arising from participation by a distal ester. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies reveal this bridged ion to decompose at temperatures above &#8776;&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. In the absence of the methyl group, the formation of a bicyclic ion is not observed. It is concluded that participation by typical secondary distal esters in glycosylation reactions is disfavored in the ground state conformation of the ester from which it is stereoelectronically impossible. Methylation converts the secondary ester to a conformationally more labile tertiary ester, removes this barrier, and renders participation more favorable. Nevertheless, the minor changes in selectivity in model glycosylation reactions on going from the secondary to the tertiary esters at both low and room temperature argue against distal group participation being a major stereodirecting factor even for the tertiary system.

A hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice is prepared by on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic nanographene.







Abstract
The atomically precise control over the size, shape and structure of nanographenes (NGs) or the introduction of heteroatom dopants into their sp2&#8208;carbon lattice confer them valuable electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice, achieved via on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic NG. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements reveal a considerable variation of the local contact potential difference toward lower values with respect to the gold surface, indicative of its positive net charge. Altogether, we introduce the concept of cationic nitrogen doping of NGs on surfaces, opening new avenues for the design of novel carbon nanostructures.

Ammonia has been converted into hydrazine, a chemical of utmost importance for organic synthesis and energy purposes. In their Communication on page&#8197;25230, Fran&#231;ois J&#233;r&#244;me et&#8197;al. report that cavitation bubbles, created by ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous ammonia at a high frequency, act as microreactors to activate and convert ammonia into hydrazine at the gas&#8211;liquid interface. Maintaining the aqueous solution close to 30&#8201;&#176;C prevents the degradation of in&#8197;situ produced hydrazine.

         <title>Inside Cover: Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;Index Faceting (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48/2021)</title>

High&#8208;index NiO faceting during molten salt synthesis is investigated with density functional theory by Jeffrey&#8197;D. Rimer, Matteo Maestri, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;25391. Trapezohedral NiO particles observed in experiments are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to locally ordered alkali chloride structures, which act as capping agents during crystal growth. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO particles are produced because of their stable hydroxylated surfaces.

         <title>Back Cover: Proton Traffic Jam: Effect of Nanoconfinement and Acid Concentration on Proton Hopping Mechanism (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25584-25584, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protons confined within nonionic reverse micelles experience a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in which forward proton hopping, or the Grotthuss mechanism, is restricted. This effect is size&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent: Protons in small micelles or at lower concentrations diffuse freely via forward hopping. For larger sizes or higher concentrations, ions accumulate at the interfacial region of the micelle, causing a gridlock that decreases available pathways for movement of protons to the water interior, as reported by Martina Havenith, Teresa Head&#8208;Gordon, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;25419.

Selective recognition of two stacked viologen radical cations in solution using a size&#8208;matched radical host is reported by J.&#8197;Fraser Stoddart and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;25454. By employing 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene as the linker, the bisradical dicationic host is able to accommodate two methyl viologen radical cation guests with strong and cooperative binding.

         <title>Crystalline Sponge Method: X&#8208;ray Structure Analysis of Small Molecules by Post&#8208;Orientation within Porous Crystals&#8212;Principle and Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Studies</title>

Crystal growth is not needed for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis when the crystalline sponge method is used. This method makes use of single&#8208;crystalline porous coordination networks (&#8220;crystalline sponges&#8221;) that can absorb small guest molecules within the pores and make the absorbed guests observable by conventional single&#8208;crystal diffraction. This Review focuses on the principles of this approach as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies.







Abstract
This Review discusses, along with the historical background, the principles as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies of the crystalline sponge (CS) method, a new single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) method for the analysis of the structures of small molecules without sample crystallization. The method uses single&#8208;crystalline porous coordination networks (crystalline sponges) that can absorb small guest molecules within their pores. The absorbed guest molecules are ordered in the pores through molecular recognition and become observable by conventional SCXRD analysis. The complex {[(ZnI2)3(tpt)2]&#8901;x(solvent)}n (tpt=tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine) was first proposed as a crystalline sponge and has been most generally used. Crystalline sponges developed later are also discussed here. The principle of the CS method can be described as &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization&#8221; of the absorbed guest, whose ordering is templated by the pre&#8208;latticed cavities. The method has been widely applied to synthetic chemistry as well as natural product studies, for which proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples will be shown here.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocycles via Oxidant&#8208;Free Dehydrocyclization of Alcohols Using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>

This Minireview summarizes recent developments in which both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts are used to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and N&#8208;nucleophiles via acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. The strategies for the preparation and functionalization of heterogeneous catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and the roles of heterogeneous catalysts in these reactions are also discussed.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocycles, such as pyrroles, pyrimidines, quinazolines, and quinoxalines, are important building blocks for organic chemistry and the fine&#8208;chemical industry. For their synthesis, catalytic borrowing hydrogen and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions of alcohols as sustainable reagents have received significant attention in recent years. To overcome the problems of product separation and catalyst reusability, several metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to achieve these transformations with good yields and selectivity. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments using both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and N&#8208;nucleophiles via acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. Furthermore, this Minireview introduces strategies for the preparation and functionalization of the corresponding heterogeneous catalysts, discusses the reaction mechanisms and the roles of metal electronic states, and the influence of support Lewis acid&#8211;base properties on these reactions.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Fluorescent Polymeric Particles with Tunable White Light Emission Based on Aggregation Microenvironment Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25246-25251, November 22, 2021. </description>

Core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particles (CS&#8208;FPPs) were constructed based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation (2SP) polymerization, and white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs was achieved with the CIE1931 coordinate of (0.33, 0.34), which could be simply but effectively tuned by manipulating the aggregation microenvironment of the AIEgens.







Abstract
White&#8208;light emitting polymers (WLEPs) based on aggregation microenvironment&#8208;sensitive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have aroused great interest in lighting and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we developed a novel strategy to construct WLEP particles via a stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation polymerization of two emission&#8208;complementary AIEgens under core&#8211;shell engineering, where the AIE characteristics and FRET process of core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particles (CS&#8208;FPPs) could be modulated by altering aggregation microenvironment under swelling and shrinking of polymers, facilitating the tunable white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs. Furthermore, such tuning could be fast realized in the solid state, thus demonstrating the potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work proved the significance of aggregation microenvironment on emission of luminogens, guiding the development of high&#8208;efficiency emission&#8208;tunable materials.

Ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation of mono, di and trisubstituted cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;aroyloxy ketones is reported. Key step is the radical/radical cross&#8208; coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle and a ketyl radical formed in the NHC catalysis cycle.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced C(sp2)&#8722;H Amidation with an Aryl&#8211;Alkyl &#963;&#8208;Bond Relocation via Redox&#8208;Neutral Radical&#8211;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25235-25240, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a photocatalyzed, intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides has been developed to afford &#948;&#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8208;alkyl &#963;&#8208;bond relocation. Upon the formation of amidyl radical via reductive N&#8722;O bond cleavage, selective radical ipso&#8208;addition followed by a redox&#8208;neutral radical&#8211;polar crossover was suggested to be responsible for the preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.







Abstract
We report an approach for the intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of N&#8208;acyloxyamides under photoredox conditions to produce &#948;&#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8208;alkyl &#963;&#8208;bond relocation. Computational studies on the designed reductive single electron transfer strategy led us to identify N&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl] group as the most effective amidyl radical precursor. Upon the formation of an azaspirocyclic radical intermediate by the selective ipso&#8208;addition with outcompeting an ortho&#8208;attack, radical&#8211;polar crossover was then rationalized to lead to the rearomative ring&#8208;expansion with preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.

     alt="Visible-Light Induced C(sp2)&#8722;H Amidation with an Aryl&#8211;Alkyl &#963;-Bond Relocation via Redox-Neutral Radical&#8211;Polar Crossover"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a photocatalyzed, intramolecular C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amidation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzoyloxyamides has been developed to afford &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-benzolactams with an aryl-alkyl &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-bond relocation. Upon the formation of amidyl radical via reductive N&#8722;O bond cleavage, selective radical &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-addition followed by a redox-neutral radical&#8211;polar crossover was suggested to be responsible for the preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an approach for the intramolecular C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amidation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyloxyamides under photoredox conditions to produce &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-benzolactams with an aryl-alkyl &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-bond relocation. Computational studies on the designed reductive single electron transfer strategy led us to identify &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl] group as the most effective amidyl radical precursor. Upon the formation of an azaspirocyclic radical intermediate by the selective &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-addition with outcompeting an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-attack, radical&#8211;polar crossover was then rationalized to lead to the rearomative ring-expansion with preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Propargyl Esters and Alkynylsilanes: Synthesis of Vinylallene Derivatives through a Twofold 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25258-25262, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of structurally complex allenylsilanes through gold&#8208;catalyzed coupling of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes is described. DFT calculations support a stepwise pathway consisting of two 1,2&#8208;rearrangements (acyloxy and silyl). A preliminary study on the enantioselective version would demonstrate its feasibility (er up to 95:5).







Abstract
The reaction of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes under gold catalysis provides vinylallene derivatives through consecutive [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy/[1,2]&#8208;silyl rearrangements. Good yields, full atom&#8208;economy, broad substrate scope, easy scale&#8208;up and low catalyst loadings are salient features of this novel transformation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest a reaction mechanism involving initial [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy rearrangement to generate a gold vinylcarbene intermediate which upon regioselective attack of the alkynylsilane affords a vinyl cation which undergoes a type II&#8208;dyotropic rearrangement involving the silyl group and the metal fragment. Preliminary results on the enantioselective version of this transformation are also disclosed.

         <title>1,6&#8208;Anthrazoline&#8208;Linked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles and Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Friedl&#228;nder Synthesis</title>

An old chemistry, but a new efficient method for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and 2D polymer! We demonstrated that Friedl&#228;nder synthesis which involves both dynamic imine condensation and aldol condensation is highly effective for the synthesis of kinetically stable, 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline&#8208;based all sp2 C/N containing macrocycles and crystalline 2D polymer.







Abstract
Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodology. Herein, we report the preparation of a 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline (AZ)&#8208;linked crystalline 2D polymer AZP via acid mediated Friedl&#228;nder synthesis. The feasibility was examined first by two model reactions, followed by synthesis of three AZ&#8208;based macrocycles MCn (n=5&#8211;7), in which hexagonal MC6 was isolated as the major product. The favorable macrocycle formation could be largely attributed to the dynamic feature of Friedl&#228;nder synthesis, which involves both imine condensation and aldol condensation. The structure and crystallinity of AZP were confirmed by experiments and simulation. The skeletons of the macrocycles and polymer consist of all&#8208;sp2 hybridized C/N atoms and are thus &#960;&#8208;conjugated and electro&#8208;active. Our studies provide a rational way to access kinetically stable 2D crystalline polymers by combination of different dynamic covalent chemistries.

         <title>Reactions of a Dilithiomethane with CO and N2O: An Avenue to an Anionic Ketene and a Hexafunctionalized Benzene</title>

The dianion [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO affording C&#8722;C bond formation and Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment migration. Subsequent reaction with N2O cleaves a P&#8722;C bond generating an anionic ketene&#8208;derivative which cyclotrimerizes to give the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative, [Ph2P(S)COLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. The experimental observations are rationalized by a detailed theoretical study of the reaction mechanism by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT methods.







Abstract
Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from simple C1 feedstocks is an attractive alternative avenue to traditional fossil fuels. Hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives are highly useful molecules but are often challenging to prepare. Herein, we report that the lithium complex [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO lead to C&#8722;C bond formation and migration of a Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment affording 2. Subsequent reaction with N2O results in oxidative cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond affording [Ph2P(S)OLi(THF)2]2 4 and the anionic ketene&#8208;derivative Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2 5. Heating 5 prompts cyclotrimerization giving the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative [Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. This transition metal&#8208;free protocol to a hexa&#8208;substituted benzene is viable on a gram scale and permits the incorporation of 13C labels. The mechanisms of these reactions are detailed via extensive DFT computations.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Sacrificial Bond Transformation in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Molecular Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25296-25301, November 22, 2021. </description>

Bond breaking/re&#8208;formation to tune local coordination: Deliberate construction and subsequent selective cleavage of sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds render flexible tunability to control the local coordination of metal single atoms. The oxidized sulfur functionalization around the Fe center helps the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C reach the ORR volcano&#8208;plot apex by optimizing the adsorption strength of the oxygenated intermediates.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen sites show great prospect for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), whereas the unsatisfactory adsorption&#8208;desorption behaviors of oxygenated intermediates on the metal centers impede improvement of the ORR performance. We propose a new conceptual strategy of introducing sacrificial bonds to remold the local coordination of Fe&#8722;Nx sites, via controlling the dynamic transformation of the Fe&#8722;S bonds in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst. Spectroscopic and theoretical results reveal that the selective cleavage of the sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds induces the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxidized sulfur on the Fe centers. The newly functionalized moieties endow the catalyst with superior ORR activity and remarkable stability, owing to the reduced electron localization around the Fe centers facilitating the desorption of ORR intermediates. These findings provide a unique perspective for precisely controlling the coordination structure of single&#8208;atom materials to optimize their activity.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical NO Reduction into NH3 by MoS2 Nanosheet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25263-25268, November 22, 2021. </description>

MoS2/GF behaves as a superb and durable electrocatalyst for ambient NH3 generation via NO reduction in acids. It is capable of attaining a Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH3 yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. The MoS2&#8208;based Zn&#8208;NO battery delivers a power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of NO not only offers an attractive alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ambient NH3 production but mitigates the human&#8208;caused unbalance of nitrogen cycle. Herein, we report that MoS2 nanosheet on graphite felt (MoS2/GF) acts as an efficient and robust 3D electrocatalyst for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. In acidic electrolyte, such MoS2/GF attains a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH3 yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Using MoS2 nanosheet&#8208;loaded carbon paper as the cathode, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device of Zn&#8208;NO battery was assembled to deliver a discharge power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1. Calculations reveal that the positively charged Mo&#8208;edge sites facilitate NO adsorption/activation via an acceptance&#8211;donation mechanism and disfavor the binding of protons and the coupling of N&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Chiral Benzothiophene Synthesis via Enantiospecific Coupling of Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides with Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25313-25317, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C2 alkylation of functionalized benzothiophenes has been explored. Enantiospecific C&#8722;C bond formation is achieved via O&#8208;activation and 1,2&#8208;metalate shift of benzothiophene S&#8208;oxide boronate complexes, which enables expedient access to chiral C2&#8208;alkylated benzothiophenes.







Abstract
Benzothiophenes are valuable heterocycles that are widely used in medicines, agrochemicals, and materials science. Herein, we report a general method for the synthesis of enantioenriched 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzothiophenes via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C2&#8208;alkylation of benzothiophenes with boronic esters. The reactions utilize benzothiophene S&#8208;oxides in lithiation&#8208;borylations to generate intermediate arylboronate complexes, and subsequent Tf2O&#8208;promoted S&#8722;O bond cleavage to trigger a Pummerer&#8208;type 1,2&#8208;metalate shift, which gives the coupled products with complete enantiospecificity. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl boronic esters and aryl boronic esters are successfully coupled with a range of C3&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes. Importantly, this transformation does not require the use of C3 directing groups, therefore it overcomes a major limitation of previously developed transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated C2 alkylations of benzothiophenes.

         <title>Unexpected Formation of Metallofulleroids from Multicomponent Reactions, with Crystallographic and Computational Studies of the Cluster Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25269-25273, November 22, 2021. </description>

Various metallofulleroids were generated from a new isocyanide&#8208;induced multicomponent reaction on clusterfullerenes. One ketenimine metallofulleroid has fixed Lu3N cluster due to the presence of the nearby organic appendant from a neighbor molecule in the solid state.







Abstract
New multicomponent reactions involving an isocyanide, terminal or internal alkynes, and endohedral metallofullerene (EMF) Lu3N@C80 yield metallofulleroids which are characterized by mass&#8208;spectrometry, HPLC, and multiple 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Single crystal studies revealed one ketenimine metallofulleroid has ordered Lu3N cluster which is unusual for EMF monoadducts. Computational analysis, based on crystallographic data, confirm that the endohedral cluster motion is controlled by the position of the exohedral organic appendants. Our findings provide a new functionalization reaction for EMFs, and a potential facile approach to freeze the endohedral cluster motion at relatively high temperatures.

Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids were fabricated through molten salt etching for illustrating their interactions. The pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu were demonstrated. A symmetric supercapacitor based on Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode delivered a high energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
MXenes have attracted great interests as supercapacitors due to their metallic conductivity, high density, and hydrophilic nature. Herein we report Ti3C2&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids via molten salt etching in which the existence of metal atoms and their interactions with MXene via surficial O atoms were elucidated by XAFS for the first time. The electrochemical investigation of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode demonstrated the pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of 885.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 1.0&#8197;M H2SO4. Symmetric supercapacitor Ti3C2&#8208;Cu//Ti3C2&#8208;Cu was demonstrated with operating voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, areal capacitance of 290.5&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stability over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. It delivered an areal energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at power density of 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, based on which a supercapacitor pouch was fabricated. It provides deeper insights into the molten salt mechanism and strategies for designing MXene&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Sulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25307-25312, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl sulfonyl fluorides, typically inert to transition metal catalysis, undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. The reaction can occur without added base and turns the &#8722;SO2F group into a divergent handle for C&#8722;C or S&#8722;Nu coupling.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as powerful &#8220;click&#8221; electrophiles to access sulfonylated derivatives. Yet, they are relatively inert towards C&#8722;C bond forming transformations, notably under transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Here, we describe conditions under which aryl sulfonyl fluorides act as electrophiles for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This desulfonative cross&#8208;coupling occurs selectively in the absence of base and, unusually, even in the presence of strong acids. Divergent one&#8208;step syntheses of two analogues of bioactive compounds showcase the expanded reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides to encompass both S&#8722;Nu and C&#8722;C bond formation. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest oxidative addition occurs at the C&#8722;S bond followed by desulfonation to form a Pd&#8208;F intermediate that facilitates transmetalation.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed s&#8208;Block Magnesium Sites for Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25241-25245, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitized C3N4 (Mg&#8208;C3N4) show weak CO adsorption because of nondirectionally delocalized Mg 3&#8197;s orbit. Mg&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of &#8776;18&#8201;000&#8197;hour&#8722;1 under a CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;%. Furthermore, the flow cell fabricated with Mg&#8208;C3N4 reaches a large current density of &#8722;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under a CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal sites have been extensively studied for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO due to their robust CO2 activation ability. However, the strong hybridization between directionally localized d orbits and CO vastly limits CO desorption and thus the activities of atomically dispersed transition metal sites. In contrast, s&#8208;block metal sites possess nondirectionally delocalized 3s orbits and hence weak CO adsorption ability, providing a promising way to solve the suffered CO desorption issue. Herein, we constructed atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitic carbon nitride (Mg&#8208;C3N4) through a facile heat treatment for CO2RR. Theoretical calculations show that the CO desorption on Mg sites is easier than that on Fe and Co sites. This theoretical prediction is demonstrated by experimental CO temperature program desorption and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. As a result, Mg&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a high turnover frequency of &#8776;18&#8201;000 per hour in H&#8208;cell and a large current density of &#8722;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell, under a high CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;% in KHCO3 electrolyte. This work sheds a new light on s&#8208;block metal sites for efficient CO2RR to CO.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Cyapho&#8208;Cyanamide Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25286-25289, November 22, 2021. </description>

We describe the step&#8208;wise synthesis of the novel cyapho&#8208;cyanamide ion, [N(CN)(CP)]&#8722;, obtained by the reaction of sodium phosphanide, Na(PH2), with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). Preliminary reactions of the ion with electrophiles reveal the cyclisation reactions are available on functionalisation.







Abstract
We describe a facile synthesis of the cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH2] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6=1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). The reaction proceeds with elimination of two equivalents of methanol. Careful tuning of the reaction conditions allowed for the isolation and characterization of the N&#8208;cyano(carboximidate)phosphide intermediate [HP{C(OMe)N(CN)}]&#8722;. Due to the adverse effects of methanol in these reaction mixtures, a bulk scale synthesis of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] could be achieved by addition of a base (LiHMDS) to neutralize the resulting alcohol. Further reactivity studies of this anion reveal that functionalization at the phosphorus atom is viable to yield a new family of cyanide&#8208;functionalised phosphorus heterocycles.

         <title>An Effective Strategy for Designing Nonlinear Optical Crystals by Combining the Structure&#8208;Directing Property of Oxyfluorides with Chemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25302-25306, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) was synthesized by combining the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluorides with chemical substitution. Measurement of the optical properties shows that the compound satisfies all key property requirements to be promising application from UV to mid&#8208;infrared regions as SHG materials.







Abstract
Rationally designing a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal remains a great ongoing challenge. It involves not only the design of noncentrosymmetric structures but also property optimization. In this communication, a new strategy for effectively designing the NLO crystal has been put forward, that is, using the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluoride anions to obtain a noncentrosymmetric and polar structure, and then by substitution of IO3&#8722; for isovalent F&#8722; anions to further enhance the SHG response. With this strategy, a new iodate fluoride, Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) has been successfully designed from the Ba2(MoO3F2)F2 with the cis&#8208;directing [MoO4F2]4&#8722; groups. It exhibits a large SHG response (&#8776;8&#215;KDP), a wide transparent region (0.30&#8211;10.92&#8197;&#956;m), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT) (88.53&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and a large birefringence (&#8776;0.264@532&#8197;nm). These indicate Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) would be a promising NLO crystal.

With this strategy, a new iodate fluoride, Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)](MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has been successfully designed from the Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-directing [MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups. It exhibits a large SHG response (&#8776;8&#215;KDP), a wide transparent region (0.30&#8211;10.92&#8197;&#956;m), a high laser-induced damage threshold (LDT) (88.53&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and a large birefringence (&#8776;0.264@532&#8197;nm). These indicate Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)](MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) would be a promising NLO crystal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Collective Spin Excitations of a Triangulene&#8208;Based Nanostar</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25224-25229, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A star&#8208;shaped triangulene cyclic hexamer, which accumulates 12 unpaired electrons, was prepared by combining solution chemistry and on&#8208;surface synthesis. The resulting triangulene&#8208;based nanostar was visualized by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy on a gold substrate. The collective spin excitations, explained by the Heisenberg model, were revealed by inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy.







Abstract
Triangulene nanographenes are open&#8208;shell molecules with predicted high spin state due to the frustration of their conjugated network. Their long&#8208;sought synthesis became recently possible over a metal surface. Here, we present a macrocycle formed by six [3]triangulenes, which was obtained by combining the solution synthesis of a dimethylphenyl&#8208;anthracene cyclic hexamer and the on&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of this precursor over a gold substrate. The resulting triangulene nanostar exhibits a collective spin state generated by the interaction of its 12 unpaired &#960;&#8208;electrons along the conjugated lattice, corresponding to the antiferromagnetic ordering of six S=1 sites (one per triangulene unit). Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy resolved three spin excitations connecting the singlet ground state with triplet states. The nanostar behaves close to predictions from the Heisenberg model of an S=1 spin ring, representing a unique system to test collective spin modes in cyclic systems.

         <title>Probing Water State during Lipidic Mesophases Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25274-25280, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the phase transitions from cubic to reverse hexagonal phase in lipidic mesophase at molecular level. The dynamics of both water and lipids, as well as the hydrogen bond network of confined water were monitored during the phase transition. The results demonstrate clear dynamical difference between bound and interstitial water in both phases.







Abstract
We investigate the static and dynamic states of water network during the phase transitions from double gyroid (
) to double diamond (
) bicontinuous cubic phases and from the latter to the reverse hexagonal (HII) phase in monolinolein based lipidic mesophases by combining FTIR and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). In both cubic(s) and HII phase, two dynamically different fractions of water are detected and attributed to bound and interstitial free water. The dynamics of the two water fractions are all slower than bulk water due to the hydrogen&#8208;bonds between water molecules and the lipid's polar headgroups and to nanoconfinement. Both FTIR and BDS results suggest that a larger fraction of water is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the headgroup of lipids in the HII phase at higher temperature than in the cubic phase at lower temperature via H&#8208;bonds, which is different from the common expectation that the number of H&#8208;bonds should decrease with increase of temperature. These findings are rationalized by considering the topological ratio of interface/volume of the two mesophases.

         <title>Conversion of Ammonia to Hydrazine Induced by High&#8208;Frequency Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25230-25234, November 22, 2021. </description>

Cavitation bubbles act as microreactors to activate NH3, resulting in the formation of NH species that further recombine to hydrazine at the bubble&#8211;liquid interface. One of the advantages of this technology is the compartmentation of the as&#8208;formed hydrazine in the bulk solution, maintained at only 30&#8201;&#176;C, which limits its thermal degradation.







Abstract
Hydrazine is a chemical of utmost importance in our society, either for organic synthesis or energy use. The direct conversion of NH3 to hydrazine is highly appealing, but it remains a very difficult task because the degradation of hydrazine is thermodynamically more feasible than the cleavage of the N&#8722;H bond of NH3. As a result, any catalyst capable of activating NH3 will thus unavoidably decompose N2H4. Here we show that cavitation bubbles, created by ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous NH3 at a high frequency, act as microreactors to activate and convert NH3 to NH species, without assistance of any catalyst, yielding hydrazine at the bubble&#8211;liquid interface. The compartmentation of in&#8208;situ&#8208;produced hydrazine in the bulk solution, which is maintained close to 30&#8201;&#176;C, advantageously prevents its thermal degradation, a recurrent problem faced by previous technologies. This work also points towards a path to scavenge .OH radicals by adjusting the NH3 concentration.

         <title>Phenylimino Indolinone: A Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive T&#8208;Type Photoswitch Exhibiting Negative Photochromism</title>

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive T&#8208;type photoswitches with negative photochromism are rare and interesting candidates for a wide range of applications. Here, we describe the computer&#8208;assisted rational design of phenylimino indolinone (PIO) and its characterization in the ground and excited state using the full toolbox of physical organic chemistry.







Abstract
Imines are photoaddressable motifs useful in the development of new generations of molecular switches, but their operation with low&#8208;energy photons and control over isomer stability remain challenging. Based on a computational design, we developed phenylimino indolinone (PIO), a green&#8208;light&#8208;addressable T&#8208;type photoswitch showing negative photochromism. The isomerization behavior of this photoactuator of the iminothioindoxyl (ITI) class was studied using time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies on time scales from femtoseconds to the steady state and by quantum&#8208;chemical analyses. The understanding of the isomerization properties and substituent effects governing these photoswitches opens new avenues for the development of novel T&#8208;type visible&#8208;light&#8208;addressable photoactuators based on C=N bonds.

         <title>High Water Adsorption MOFs with Optimized Pore&#8208;Nanospaces for Autonomous Indoor Humidity Control and Pollutants Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indoor air quality is of prime importance for human daily life and health, for which the adsorbents like zeolites and silica&#8208;gels are widely used for air dehumidification and harmful gases capture. Herein, we develop a pore&#8208;nanospace post&#8208;engineering strategy to optimize the hydrophilicity, water&#8208;uptake capacity and air&#8208;purifying ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with long&#8208;term stability, offering an ideal candidate with autonomous multi&#8208;functionality of moisture control and pollutants sequestration. Through variant tuning of organic&#8208;linkers carrying hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in the pore&#8208;nanospaces of prototypical UiO&#8208;67, a moderately hydrophilic MOF (UiO&#8208;67&#8208;4Me&#8208;NH  2  &#8208;38%) with high thermal, hydrolytic and acid&#8208;base stability is screened out, featuring S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherms exactly located in the recommended comfortable and healthy ranges of relative humidity for indoor ventilation (45%&#8722;65% RH) and adverse health effects minimization (40&#8208;60% RH). Its exceptional attributes of water&#8208;uptake working capacity/efficiency, contaminates removal, recyclability and regeneration promise a great potential in confined indoor environment application.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Dynamic Nanospaces in Solution by Cationic Cages as Multirole Catalytic Platform for Unconventional C(sp)&#8208;H Activation&#160;Beyond Enzyme Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular catalysis of artificial synthetic&#8208;hosts is originally bio&#8208;inspired for reactivities intrinsic to enzymes, but more exceptional properties and functions may be expected beyond enzyme mimics. Herein we demonstrate that, based on the creation of dynamic nanospaces in solution by highly charged positive coordination cage of [Pd  6  (RuL  3  )  8  ]  28+  , multirole and multi&#8208;way cageconfined catalysis is accomplishable for versatile functions and anomalous reactivities with the aid of biomimetic cage effect. The high cationic&#8208;host charges drive partial deprotonation of 24 imidazole&#8208;NHs on cage sphere alike imidazole&#8208;residuals in proteins, generating amphoteric heterogeneity in solution to enforce effective cavitybasicity against solution&#8208;acidity. Synergistic actions arisen from cage hydrophobicity, host&#8208;guest electrostatic interactions and imidazole&#8208;N coordination facilitate C(sp)&#8208;H activation and carbanionic intermediate stabilization of terminal alkynes to achieve unusual H/D&#8208;exchange and Glaser coupling under acidic conditions, and enable phase transfers of water&#8208;insoluble substrates/products/co&#8208;catalysts to make immiscible&#8208;phase and bi&#8208;phase catalysis feasible, thus providing a useful catalytic protocol to combine merits from homogeneous, heterogeneous, enzymatic and phase transfer catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;C Coupling Is Unlikely to Be the Rate&#8208;Determining Step in the Formation of C2+ Products in the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Reduction of CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identity of the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu catalysts remains unresolved because: 1) the presence of mass transport limitation of CO; and 2) the absence of quantitative correlation between CO partial pressure (  p  CO  ) and surface CO coverage. In this work, we determined CO adsorption isotherms on Cu in a broad pH range of 7.2&#8208;13.9. Together with electrokinetic data, we demonstrate that the reaction orders of adsorbed CO at  p  CO  &lt; 0.4 and &gt; 0.6 atm are 1  st  and 0  th  , respectively, on three Cu catalysts. These results indicate that&#160;the C&#8208;C coupling is unlikely to be the RDS in the formation of C2+ products in the CORR. We propose that the hydrogenation of CO with adsorbed water is the RDS, and the site competition between CO and water leads to the observed transition of the CO reaction order.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Silica Nano&#8208;Organelles for Regulation of Cascade Reactions in Multi&#8208;Compartmentalized Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In eukaryotic cells, enzymes are compartmentalized into specific organelles so that different reactions and processes can be performed efficiently and with a high degree of control. In this work, we show that these features can be artificially emulated in robust synthetic organelles constructed using an enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization strategy. We describe an in&#8208;situ encapsulation approach that allows enzymes to be loaded into silica nanoreactors in well&#8208;defined compositions. The nanoreactors can be combined into integrated systems to produce a desired reaction outcome. We used the selective enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization and nanoreactor integration to regulate competitive cascade reactions and to modulate the kinetics of sequential reactions involving multiple nanoreactors. Furthermore, we show that the nanoreactors can be efficiently loaded into giant polymer vesicles, resulting in multi&#8208;compartmentalized microreactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Friedel&#8208;Crafts Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identification of spiro N&#8208;heterocycles as scaffolds that display structural novelty, three&#8208;dimensionality, beneficial physicochemical properties, and enable the controlled spatial disposition of substituents has led to a surge of interest in utilizing these compounds in drug discovery programs. Herein, we report the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven Friedel&#8208;Crafts spirocyclization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;tethered (hetero)aryls for the synthesis of a unique library of azetidine spiro&#8208;tetralins. The reaction was discovered to proceed through an unexpected interrupted Friedel&#8208;Crafts mechanism, generating a highly complex azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold. This dearomatized intermediate, formed exclusively as a single diastereomer, can be subsequently converted to the Friedel&#8208;Crafts product upon electrophilic activation of the tertiary amine, or trapped as a Diels&#8208;Alder adduct in one&#8208;pot. The rapid assembly of molecular complexity demonstrated in these reactions highlights the potential of the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven spirocyclization strategy to be utilized in the synthesis of medicinally relevant scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivariate&#8208;Gated DNA Nanodevice for Spatioselective Imaging of Pro&#8208;metastatic Targets in Extracellular Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Probing pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers is of significant importance to evaluate the risk of tumor metastasis, but spatially&#8208;selective imaging of such targets in extracellular microenvironment is particularly challenging. By introducing the bilinguality of PNA/peptide hybrid that can speak both peptide substrate and nucleobase&#8208;pairing languages to combine with aptamer technology, we designed a smart DNA nanodevice programmed to respond sequentially to dual pro&#8208;metastatic targets, MMP2/9 and ATP, in extracellular tumor microenvironment (TME). The DNA nanodevice is established based on the combination of an ATP&#8208;responsive aptamer sensor and a MMP2/9&#8208;hydrolyzable PNA/peptide copolymer with a cell membrane&#8208;anchoring aptamer module. Taking 4T1 xenograft as a highly aggressive tumor model, the robustness of the DNA nanodevice in spatioselective imaging of MMP2/9 and ATP in TME is demonstrated. We envision that this design will enable the simultaneous visualization of multiple pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers, which allows to gain insights into their pathological roles in tumor metastasis.</dc:description>

The DNA nanodevice is established based on the combination of an ATP-responsive aptamer sensor and a MMP2/9-hydrolyzable PNA/peptide copolymer with a cell membrane-anchoring aptamer module. Taking 4T1 xenograft as a highly aggressive tumor model, the robustness of the DNA nanodevice in spatioselective imaging of MMP2/9 and ATP in TME is demonstrated. We envision that this design will enable the simultaneous visualization of multiple pro-metastatic biomarkers, which allows to gain insights into their pathological roles in tumor metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;cell Visualization of Monogenic RNA G&#8208;quadruplex and Occupied G&#8208;quadruplex Ratio through Module Assembled Multifunctional Probes Assay (MAMPA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid secondary structure, regulate many biological functions and are considered as potential molecular targets for therapeutics of cancers. However, due to the lack of analytical methods, the regulating mechanism of monogenic G4s is still unclear. Here, we developed a Module Assembled Multifunctional Probes Assay (MAMPA) for visualizing endogenous G4s in individual genes in single cells. Two modular probes separately recognize G4 structures and the adjacent RNA sequences, and the module assembly enables imaging of G4s in an individual RNA with high specificity. Through imaging G4s in several individual genes, we found that G4s were steadily occupied by G4 Binding Proteins (G4BPs) in various mRNAs in every cell line and defined &#8220;Occupied G4 Ratio&#8221;. In all, we demonstrated MAMPA was suitable for most experiment situations and found that Occupied G4 Ratios had the potential to become a new parameter for the study of G4s in living cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Total syntheses of two  Isodon  diterpenes, isorosthin L and isoadenolin I, are reported. The synthetic strategy features a quick assembly of two simple building blocks through a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and a subsequent radical cyclization for efficient construction of a rather complex advanced intermediate bearing a quaternary stereocenter present in all  Isodon  diterpenes. Oxidative cleavage of the C&#8208;C bond in the cyclopentane enabled the conversion to a lactone moiety which is desired for the construction of the molecular skeleton through reductive coupling with an aldehyde carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical Resolution of Configurationally Stable Zwitterionic Pentacoordinate Silicon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereogenic silicon centres in functionalized tetracoordinated organosilanes generally exhibit very high configurational stability under neutral conditions. This stability drops completely when higher coordination states of the silicon center are reached due to rapid substituent exchange. Herein we describe the synthesis of chiral and neutral pentacoordinate silicon derivatives with high configurational stability. The zwitterionic nature of these air and water tolerant species allows for the first time their direct and efficient optical resolution using chiral HPLC techniques. By means of this method, pentacoordinate silicon compounds exhibiting high Si&#8208;inversion have been obtained as single enantiomers. A rationalisation of the enantiomerisation pathways has been also carried out using DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cell membrane is a dynamic and heterogeneous structure composed of distinct sub&#8208;compartments.&#160; Within these compartments, preferential interactions occur among various lipids and proteins.&#160; Currently, it is still challenging to image these short&#8208;lived membrane complexes, especially in living cells.&#160; In this work, we present a DNA&#8208;based probe, termed &#8220;DNA Zipper&#8221;, which allows the membrane order and pattern of transient interactions to be imaged in living cells using standard fluorescence microscopes.&#160; By fine&#8208;tuning the length and binding affinity of DNA duplex, these probes can precisely extend the duration of membrane lipid interactions via dynamic DNA hybridization.&#160; The correlation between membrane order and the activation of T&#8208;cell receptor signalling has also been studied.&#160; These programmable DNA probes function after a brief cell incubation, which can be easily adapted to study lipid interactions and membrane order during different membrane signalling events.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the substrate induced generation of a transient catalytic microenvironment from a single amino acid functionalized fatty acid in presence of a cofactor hemin. The catalytic state accessed under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions showed acceleration of peroxidase activity resulting in degradation of the substrate and subsequently led to disassembly. Equilibrated systems could not access the three&#8208;dimensional microphases and showed substantially lower catalytic activity. Further, the assembled state showed latent catalytic function (promiscuity) to hydrolyze a precursor to yield the same substrate. Consequently, the assembly demonstrated protometabolism by exploiting the peroxidase&#8208;hydrolase cascade to augment the lifetime and the mechanical properties of the catalytic state.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Reactivity of Accessible Protons in Sodalite Cages of Faujasite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.7) undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6 M of NH  4  NO  3  solutions) resulting in protons circumscribed by sodalite cages becoming accessible for reaction without conspicuous changes to bulk crystallinity.&#160;The ratio of protons in sodalite cages (H  SOD  ) to supercages (H  SUP  ) can be systematically manipulated from 0 to ca. 1 by adjusting ammonium concentrations used in ion exchange. The fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is assessed by virtue of infrared spectra for H&#8208;D exchange of deuterated propane based on the band area ratio of OD  2620  / OD  2680  (OD  SOD  / OD  SUP  ). Protons in sodalite cages (H  SOD  ) show higher rate constants of propane dehydrogenation (  k  D  ) and cracking (  k  C  ) than protons in supercages (H  SUP  ) plausibly due to confinement effects being more prominent in smaller voids. Rate constants of dehydrogenation and cracking including  k  D  /  k  C  ratios are also augmented as the fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is enhanced. These effects of accessibility and reactivity of protons in sodalite cages hitherto inconspicuous are revealed herein via methods that systematically increase accessibility of cations located in sodalite cages.</dc:description>

The fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is assessed by virtue of infrared spectra for H-D exchange of deuterated propane based on the band area ratio of OD  2620  / OD  2680  (OD  SOD  / OD  SUP  ). Protons in sodalite cages (H  SOD  ) show higher rate constants of propane dehydrogenation (  k  D  ) and cracking (  k  C  ) than protons in supercages (H  SUP  ) plausibly due to confinement effects being more prominent in smaller voids. Rate constants of dehydrogenation and cracking including  k  D  /  k  C  ratios are also augmented as the fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is enhanced. These effects of accessibility and reactivity of protons in sodalite cages hitherto inconspicuous are revealed herein via methods that systematically increase accessibility of cations located in sodalite cages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MOF Encapsulating N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Ligated Copper Single&#8208;Atom Site Catalyst towards Efficient Methane Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of highly efficient carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) electrocatalyst for methane (CH4) electrosynthesis has attracted great attention for the intermittent renewable electricity storage, but remain challenges. Here, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;ligated Copper single atom site (Cu SAS) embedded in metal organic framework is reported (2Bn&#8208;Cu@UiO&#8208;67), which can achieve an outstanding Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81% for the CO2 reduction to CH4 at &#8208;1.5 V vs RHE with a current density of 420 mA cm&#8208;2. Notably, the CH4 FE of our catalyst remains above 70% within a wide potential range, and achieves an unprecedented turnover frequency (TOF) of 16.3 s&#8208;1, which almost represents the best molecular catalyst for CH4 electrosynthesis to date. The experimental results show that the &#963; donation of NHC enriches the surface electron density of Cu SAS and promotes the preferential adsorption of CHO* intermediates. Meanwhile, the porosity of the catalyst facilitates the diffusion of CO2 to 2Bn&#8208;Cu, thereby significantly increasing the availability of each catalytic center. This NHC&#8208;ligated Cu SAS catalyst design has great advantages in CH4 electrosynthesis and provides ideas for the commercial production of CH4.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Dominate Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in Zeolite SSZ&#8208;42 &#8211; A Classification of Their Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zeolite catalyst SSZ&#8208;42 shows a remarkable high abundance (~80%) of hydrogen&#8208;bonded Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS), which are deshielded from the  1  H chemical shift of unperturbed BAS at typically 4 ppm. This is due to their interaction with neighboring oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework when oxygen alignments are suitable. The classification and diversity of hydrogen bonding is assessed by DFT calculations, showing that oval&#8208;shaped 6&#8208;rings and 5&#8208;rings allow for a stronger hydrogen bond to oxygen atoms on the opposite ring side, yielding higher experimental chemical shifts (&#948; (  1  H) = 6.4 ppm), than circular 6&#8208;rings (&#948;(  1  H) = 5.2 ppm). Cage&#8208;like structures and intra&#8208;tetrahedral interactions can also form hydrogen bonds. The alignment of oxygen atoms is expected to impact their role in the stabilization of intermediates in catalytic reactions, such as surface alkoxy groups and possibly transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenation of Nitrous Oxide and Nitro Compounds Using Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene)Amido Iron Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the efficient degradation of N2O with a well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complex as catalyst. The deoxygenation of N2O using the iron silanone complex (  4  ) as a catalyst and pinacolborane (HBpin) as a sacrificial reagent proceeds smoothly at 50 &#8304;C to form N2  , H2,  and (pinB)2O. Mechanistic studies suggest that the iron&#8208;silicon cooperativity is the key to this catalytic transformation, which involves N2O activation, H atom transfer, H2  release and oxygenation of the boron sites. This approach has been further developed to enable catalytic reductions of nitro compounds, producing amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteome profiling by activated esters identified &gt;9000 ligandable lysines but they are limited as covalent inhibitors due to poor hydrolytic stability. Here we report our efforts to design and discover a new series of  T  unable  A  mine&#8208;  R  eactive  E  lectrophiles (TAREs) for selective and robust&#160;labeling of lysine. The major challenges in developing selective covalent ligands for lysine are the high nucleophilicity of cysteines and poor hydrolytic&#160;stability. Our work circumvents these challenges by a unique design of the TAREs that form stable adducts with lysine and on reaction with cysteine generate another reactive electrophiles for lysine. We highlight that TAREs exhibit substantially high hydrolytic stability as compared to the activated esters and are non&#8208;cytotoxic thus have the potential to act as covalent ligands. We applied these alternative TAREs for the intracellular labeling of proteins, and for the selective identification of lysines in the human proteome on a global scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Reaction Dynamics and Size Change During the Photomechanical Transformation of 9&#8208;Methylanthracene Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photomechanical molecular crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon&#8208;powered actuators. In this study, we find that the use of high&#8208;quality single crystals of 9&#8208;methylanthracene (  9MA  ) leads to more homogeneous reaction kinetics than that previously seen for polycrystalline samples, presumably due to a lower concentration of defects. Furthermore, simultaneous observation of absorbance and shape changes in single crystals revealed that the dimensional change mirrors the reaction progress, resulting in a smooth expansion of 7% along the  c  &#8208;axis that is linearly correlated with reaction progress. The same expansion dynamics are highly reproducible across different single crystal samples.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photomechanical molecular crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon-powered actuators. In this study, we find that the use of high-quality single crystals of 9-methylanthracene (  9MA  ) leads to more homogeneous reaction kinetics than that previously seen for polycrystalline samples, presumably due to a lower concentration of defects. Furthermore, simultaneous observation of absorbance and shape changes in single crystals revealed that the dimensional change mirrors the reaction progress, resulting in a smooth expansion of 7% along the  c  -axis that is linearly correlated with reaction progress. The same expansion dynamics are highly reproducible across different single crystal samples. Organic single crystals exhibit well-defined linear expansions during 100% photoconversion, suggesting that this class of solid-state phase change material that could be used for actuation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational flexibility of the protein insertase BamA in the native asymmetric bilayer elucidated with ESR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;&#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) consisting of the central &#946;&#8208;barrel BamA and four other lipoproteins mediates folding of majority of the outer membrane proteins. BamA is placed in an asymmetric bilayer and its lateral gate is suggested to be the functional hotspot. Here we used  in situ  pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy to characterize BamA in the native outer membrane. In the detergent micelles, the data is consistent with mainly an inward&#8208;open conformation of BamA. The native membrane considerably enhanced the conformational heterogeneity. The lateral gate and the extracellular loop 3 exist in an equilibrium between different conformations. The outer membrane provides a favorable environment for occupying multiple conformational states independent of the lipoproteins. Our results reveal a highly dynamic behavior of the lateral gate and other key structural elements and provide direct evidence for the conformational modulation of a membrane protein  in situ  .</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;inspired fragment merging and growing affords efficacious LasB inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extracellular virulence factors have emerged as attractive targets in the current antimicrobial resistance crisis. The Gram&#8208;negative pathogen  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  secretes the virulence factor elastase B (LasB), which plays an important role in the infection process. Here, we report a sub&#8208;micromolar, non&#8208;peptidic, fragment&#8208;like inhibitor of LasB discovered by careful visual inspection of structural data. Inspired by the natural LasB substrate, the original fragment was successfully merged and grown. The optimized inhibitor is accessible via simple chemistry and retained selectivity with a substantial improvement in activity, which can be rationalized by the crystal structure of LasB in complex with the inhibitor. We also demonstrate an improved  in viv  o efficacy of the optimized hit in  Galleria mellonella  larvae, highlighting the significance of this class of compounds as promising drug candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bivalent Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Screening and Intravital Imaging of Chemotherapy&#8208;induced Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection and quantification of apoptotic cells is a key process in cancer research, particularly during the screening of anticancer therapeutics and in mechanistic studies using preclinical models. Intravital optical imaging enables high&#8208;resolution visualisation of cellular events in live organisms; however, there are few fluorescent probes that can reliably provide functional readouts in situ without interference from tissue autofluorescence. Here we report the design and optimisation of the fluorogenic probe Apotracker Red for real&#8208;time detection of cancer cell death. The strong fluorogenic behaviour, high selectivity, and excellent stability of Apotracker Red make it a reliable optical reporter for the characterisation of the effects of anticancer drugs in cells in vitro and for direct imaging of chemotherapy&#8208;induced apoptosis in vivo in mouse models of breast cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Late&#8208;Stage C&#8211;H Oxidations of ent&#8208;Trachylobane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present our studies to construct seven  ent  &#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids by employing a bioinspired two&#8208;phase synthetic strategy. The first phase provided enantioselective and scalable access to five  ent  &#8208;trachylobanes, of which methyl  ent  &#8208;trachyloban&#8208;19&#8208;oate was produced on a 300 mg scale. During the second phase, chemical C&#8211;H oxidation methods were employed to enable selective conversion to two naturally occurring higher functionalized  ent  &#8208;trachylobanes. The formation of regioisomeric analogs, which are currently inaccessible via enzymatic methods, reveals the potential as well as limitations of established chemical C&#8211;H oxidation protocols for complex molecule synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Activity of Phthalocyanine&#8208;Artesunate Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinic prospect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has not been fully realized due to the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers. Herein, we designed phthalocyanine&#8208;artesunate conjugates (e.g. ZnPcT  4  A), which could generate up to ca. 10&#8208;fold more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the known sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. Meanwhile, an interesting and significant finding of aggregation&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic activity (AESA) was observed for the first time. ZnPcT  4  A showed about 60&#8208;fold higher sonodynamic ROS generation in aggregation form than disaggregation form in aqueous solutions. That could be attributed to the boosted ultrasonic cavitation of nanostructures. The levels of AESA effect depended on the aggregation ability of sonosensitizer molecules and the particle sizes of their aggregates. Moreover, biological studies demonstrated that ZnPcT  4  A had high anticancer activities and biosafety. This study thus opens up a new avenue the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered 2D Halide Perovskites beyond Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#160;Phase: Tailored Interlayer Chemistries for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) with crystallographically 2D structures have gained increasing interest for photovoltaic applications due to their superior chemical stability and intriguing anisotropic properties, as compared to their conventional 3D perovskite counterparts. The mostly studied LHPs are Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) phases, which suffer from a carrier&#8208;transport bottleneck due to the van der Waals gap associated with their intrinsic organic interlayer structures. To address this issue, Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) and alternating&#8208;cation&#8208;interlayer (ACI) LHPs have rapidly emerged, which exhibit unique structural and (opto)electronic characteristics that may resemble the 3D counterparts owing to the eliminated or reduced van der Waals gap. Improved photophyiscal properties have been achieved in DJ and ACI LHPs, leading towards better photovoltaic performance. Here we provide a comprehensive discussion on the merits and promise of DJ and ACI LHPs from a chemistry perspective. Then, we review recent progress on synthesis and tailoring of DJ and ACI LHP crystals and thin films, as well as their optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Finally, we discuss future directions&#160;to realize the full potential of DJ and ACI LHPs for high&#8208;performance solar cells and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of a &#960;&#8208;Bonded Isomer of [P4]4&#8722; by Aluminyl Reduction of White Phosphorus and its Ammonolysis to PH3</title>

         <dc:description>
The reduction of white phosphorus by an aluminum(I) anion is explored. The four&#8208;electron reduction product serves as a means of phosphine gas production on exposure to ammonia.







Abstract
By employing the highly reducing aluminyl complex [K{(NON)Al}]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene), we demonstrate the controlled formation of P42&#8722; and P44&#8722; complexes from white phosphorus, and chemically reversible inter&#8208;conversion between them. The tetra&#8208;anion features a unique planar &#960;&#8208;bonded structure, with the incorporation of the K+ cations implicit in the use of the anionic nucleophile offering additional stabilization of the unsaturated isomer of the P44&#8722;fragment. This complex is extremely reactive, acting as a source of P3&#8722;: exposure to ammonia leads to the release of phosphine (PH3) under mild conditions (room temperature and pressure), which contrast with those necessitated for the direct combination of P4 and NH3 (&gt;5 kbar and &gt;250&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dolabriferol&#8197;C by a Highly Stereoselective One&#8208;Pot Coupling of a meso&#8208;3,7&#8208;Diketone with Two Chiral Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of dolabriferol&#8197;C was achieved by retro&#8208;Claisen fragmentation of its putative contiguous precursor, thus establishing the former as a plausible isolation artifact. The carbon skeleton of the precursor was assembled using a novel strategy involving a highly stereoselective three&#8208;component bisaldol coupling that sets the absolute configuration of seven (or eight) stereocenters in a one&#8208;pot process.







Abstract
Total synthesis of the noncontiguous polypropionate dolabriferol&#8197;C was achieved by retro&#8208;Claisen fragmentation of its putative contiguous precursor under mild conditions, thus establishing the former as a plausible isolation artifact. The precursor was prepared by a novel one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component bisaldol coupling of a meso (Z,Z)&#8208;bisenolate (generated in situ from a 3,7&#8208;diketone) with two enantioenriched aldehydes to set the absolute configuration of seven stereocenters in one step. The first aldol reaction proceeded with enantioselective desymmetrization of the bisenolate to produce an enantiomerically pure enolate&#8211;aldolate. Quenching at this stage enabled a streamlined synthesis of dolabriferol. Addition of a racemic aldehyde to the enolate&#8211;aldolate resulted in aldol coupling with kinetic resolution of the &#8220;matched&#8221; aldehyde; overall, a sequential enantiotopic&#8208;group&#8208;selective (SEGS) bisaldol reaction. Because the desired adduct results from the &#8220;mismatched&#8221; aldol reaction, use of enantioenriched aldehyde was required.

         <title>Water Splitting by C60&#8208;Supported Vanadium Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splitting of water by a single vanadium is greatly facilitated by a C60 support, which can be regarded as a small piece of porous carbon nanomaterials, especially those with intrinsic pentagonal defects and curvatures. The compelling experimental and theoretical evidence demonstrates the important role of support in single vanadium atom catalysis.







Abstract
Water splitting is an important source of hydrogen, a promising future carrier for clean and renewable energy. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting, catalyzed by supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, is essential to improve the design of efficient catalysts. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study of such a water splitting process, assisted by a C60 supported vanadium atom, C60V++H2O&#8594;C60VO++H2. We probe both the entrance channel complex C60V+(H2O) and the end product C60VO+, and observe the formation of H2 as a result from resonant infrared absorption. Density functional theory calculations exploring the detailed reaction pathway reveal that a quintet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C60&#8208;supported V+, whereas this reaction is kinetically hindered on the isolated V+ ion by a high energy barrier. The C60 support has an important role in lowering the reaction barrier with more than 70&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 due to a large orbital overlap of one water hydrogen atom with one carbon atom of the C60 support. This fundamental insight in the water splitting reaction by a C60&#8208;supported single vanadium atom showcases the importance of supports in single atom catalysts by modifying the reaction potential energy surface.

         <title>Evolution of Cationic Vacancy Defects: A Motif for Surface Restructuration of OER Precatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Along with increasing voltage during the OER process, the structural evolution of cationic defects within NiFe&#8208;LDH, where the simple vacancy VM changes to VMOH and then to the most reactive VMOH&#8208;H, and the surface restructuration, where surface crystalline Ni(OH)x is converted to disordered Ni(OH)x and then to the surface local NiOOH species, are voltage&#8208;regulated concurrent events defining the eventual catalytic performance of the precatalyst.







Abstract
Defects have been found to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of NiFe&#8208;LDH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, their specific configuration and the role played in regulating the surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts remain ambiguous. Herein, cationic vacancy defects are generated via aprotic&#8208;solvent&#8208;solvation&#8208;induced leaking of metal cations from NiFe&#8208;LDH nanosheets. DFT calculation and in situ Raman spectroscopic observation both reveal that the as&#8208;generated cationic vacancy defects tend to exist as VM (M=Ni/Fe); under increasing applied voltage, they tend to assume the configuration VMOH, and eventually transform into VMOH&#8208;H which is the most active yet most difficult to form thermodynamically. Meanwhile, with increasing voltage the surface crystalline Ni(OH)x in the NiFe&#8208;LDH is gradually converted into disordered status; under sufficiently high voltage when oxygen bubbles start to evolve, local NiOOH species become appearing, which is the residual product from the formation of vacancy VMOH&#8208;H. Thus, we demonstrate that the cationic defects evolve along with increasing applied voltage (VM &#8594; VMOH &#8594; VMOH&#8208;H), and reveal the essential motif for the surface restructuration process of NiFe&#8208;LDH (crystalline Ni(OH)x &#8594; disordered Ni(OH)x &#8594; NiOOH). Our work provides insight into defect&#8208;induced surface restructuration behaviors of NiFe&#8208;LDH as a typical precatalyst for efficient OER electrocatalysis.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Reactivity Relationship for Nano&#8208;Catalysts in the Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Controlled Reaction Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prediction of the activity of a large nano&#8208;catalyst is a challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we developed a theoretical model to build the dependence of activity on generalized coordination number based on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In the application on Cu catalytic WGS reaction, the apparent activation energy predicted by our simple model is in close agreement with experiments for particles up to 1000&#8197;nm.







Abstract
For the activity of a nano&#8208;catalyst, a general and quantitative solution to building direct structure&#8211;reactivity relationship has not yet been established. On top of the first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we developed a model to build the adsorption site dependence of the activity.

&lt;p&gt;The prediction of the activity of a large nano-catalyst is a challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we developed a theoretical model to build the dependence of activity on generalized coordination number based on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In the application on Cu catalytic WGS reaction, the apparent activation energy predicted by our simple model is in close agreement with experiments for particles up to 1000&#8197;nm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the activity of a nano-catalyst, a general and quantitative solution to building direct structure&#8211;reactivity relationship has not yet been established. On top of the first-principle-based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we developed a model to build the adsorption site dependence of the activity. We applied this model to study the nano effects of Cu catalysts in the water-gas shift reaction. By accumulating the activities of different adsorption sites, our model satisfactorily reproduced the experimental apparent activation energies for catalysts with sizes over hundreds of nanometers, which were out of reach for conventional KMC simulations. Our results disclose that, even for a cubic catalyst with size of 877&#8197;nm, its activity can still be closely related to the activity of edge sites, instead of only the exposed Cu(100) facets as might be expected. The present model is expected to be useful for systems that are controlled by the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Electrophilic fluorination of alkyl substituted vinyl&#8208;Bmida species proceeds through bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type rearrangement.







Abstract
The electrophilic fluorination of geminal alkyl substituted vinyl&#8208;Bmida derivatives proceeds via bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. According to DFT modelling studies this rearrangement occurs with a low activation barrier via a bora&#8208;cyclopropane shaped TS. The Bmida group has a larger migration aptitude than the alkyl moiety in the Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement of the presented electrophilic fluorination reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Control of Spiroketal Formation in Rubromycin Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural snapshots and mechanistic investigation of a key spiroketal synthase provide insights into extensive oxidative backbone rearrangements and spiroketal pharmacophore assembly in rubromycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The medically important bacterial aromatic polyketide natural products typically feature a planar, polycyclic core structure. An exception is found for the rubromycins, whose backbones are disrupted by a bisbenzannulated [5,6]&#8208;spiroketal pharmacophore that was recently shown to be assembled by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes. In particular, a flavoprotein monooxygenase proved critical for the drastic oxidative rearrangement of a pentangular precursor and the installment of an intermediate [6,6]&#8208;spiroketal moiety. Here we provide structural and mechanistic insights into the control of catalysis by this spiroketal synthase, which fulfills several important functions as reductase, monooxygenase, and presumably oxidase. The enzyme hereby tightly controls the redox state of the substrate to counteract shunt product formation, while also steering the cleavage of three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Our work illustrates an exceptional strategy for the biosynthesis of stable chroman spiroketals.

         <title>Fluorinated S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine as a Reagent for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a biocatalytic approach to the production of fluorinated compounds, halide methyltransferases (HMTs) were found to form fluorinated S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Although too unstable for isolation, fluorinated SAM was accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) to enable the fluoromethylation of small molecules (see scheme).







Abstract
Strategic replacement of protons with fluorine atoms or functional groups with fluorine&#8208;containing fragments has proven a powerful strategy to optimize the activity of therapeutic compounds. For this reason, the synthetic chemistry of organofluorides has been the subject of intense development and innovation for many years. By comparison, the literature on fluorine biocatalysis still makes for a slim chapter. Herein we introduce S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases as a new tool for the production of fluorinated compounds. We demonstrate the ability of halide methyltransferases to form fluorinated SAM (S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;S&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) is too unstable for isolation, but is accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific methyltransferases for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation of small molecules.

         <title>General Synthesis of Multiple&#8208;Cores@Multiple&#8208;Shells Hollow Composites and Their Application to Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable synthesis strategy is developed to fabricate multiple&#8208;cores@multiple&#8208;shells composite, which is applicable for diverse cores and shells. The cores and shells could be tuned to be homogeneous or heterogeneous with the number of cores and shells well controlled. Such a structure shows great promise for superior energy storage, multi&#8208;drug co&#8208;delivery and sequential release, and tandem catalysis applications.







Abstract
Rational nanostructure design has proved fruitful in addressing the bottlenecks of diverse fields. Especially hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) have stood out due to their temporal&#8211;spatial ordering mass transfer and buffering effect. Localizing multiple cores in a HoMS is highly desired, which could endow it with more fascinating properties. However, such a structure has been barely reported due to the highly challenging fabrication. Here, we develop a controllable synthesis strategy to realize such a structure, which is applicable for diverse cores and shells. Additionally, cores and shells could be tuned to be homogeneous or heterogeneous, with the core and shell number well controlled. In&#8197;situ TEM analysis verifies that the inner shell confines the expansion orientation of cores, while the outer shell maintains a stable interface. In addition to energy storage, such structure is also promising for multi&#8208;drug co&#8208;delivery and sequential responsive release as well as tandem catalysis applications.

         <title>Thermal and Magnetic Field Switching in a Two&#8208;Step Hysteretic Mn(III) Spin Crossover Compound Coupled to Symmetry Breakings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Mn(III) spin crossover complex with atypical two&#8208;step hysteretic thermal switching at 74 K and 84 K shows rich structural&#8208;magnetic interplay and magnetic field&#8208;induced spin state switching below 14 T with an onset below 5 T. The spin states, structures, and the nature of the phase transitions are elucidated via X&#8208;ray and magnetization measurements. An unusual intermediate phase containing four individual sites, where &#188; are in a pure low spin state, is observed. The splitting of equivalent sites in the high temperature phase into four inequivalent sites is due to a structural reorganization involving a primary and a secondary symmetry&#8208;breaking order parameter that induces a crystal system change from orthorhombic &#8594; monoclinic and a cell doubling. Further cooling leads to a reconstructive phase transition and a monoclinic low temperature phase with two inequivalent low spin sites. The coupling between the order parameters is identified in the framework of Landau theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Role of a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Family Protein in Type II Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type II polyketide natural products are an important source of novel pharmaceutical molecules. Yet, their biosynthetic pathways and associated mechanisms are still largely under&#8208;explored. In this work, we investigated the biosynthetic pathway of type II polyketide murayaquinone. It has been found that the murayaquinone biosynthetic cluster contains genes for three putative short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family enzymes including MrqF  and MrqH  with known functions and MrqM  with unclear function. In particular, we report the functional characterization of MrqM for its role in murayaquinone biosynthesis. Intriguingly, our gene deletion experiment and structural elucidation of the accumulated intermediates revealed that MrqM is unprecedentedly related with the second polyketide ring cyclization, because the inactivation of  mrqM  resulted in the accumulation of an off&#8208;pathway intermediate SEK43 and disrupted the second and third ring cyclization. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies showed that two conserved residues in MrqM and homologous proteins Y151 and K155 are essential for its activity. Also, the previously proposed second/third ring cyclase, MrqD, might instead play another important role in the chain releasing step of the murayaquinone biosynthesis. The discovery of MrqM as a new type II polyketide cyclase expands our knowledge of the functions of the short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins and opens up new opportunities for type II polyketide biosynthesis study.</dc:description>

         <title>Commercial Cu2Cr2O5 Decorated with Iron Carbide Nanoparticles as a Multifunctional Catalyst for Magnetically Induced Continuous&#8208;Flow Hydrogenation of Aromatic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A commercial heterogeneous catalyst is decorated with iron carbide nanoparticles to produce a multifunctional catalytic system with magnetic heating capabilities. Under magnetic induction, local hot spots are generated at the catalyst surface, unlocking continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation of aromatic ketones under mild conditions. This approach is versatile and potentially transferrable to a wide range of heterogeneous catalysts and transformations.







Abstract
Copper chromite is decorated with iron carbide nanoparticles, producing a magnetically activatable multifunctional catalytic system. This system (ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5) can reduce aromatic ketones to aromatic alcohols when exposed to magnetic induction. Under magnetic excitation, the ICNPs generate locally confined hot spots, selectively activating the Cu2Cr2O5 surface while the global temperature remains low (&#8776;80&#8201;&#176;C). The catalyst selectively hydrogenates a scope of benzylic and non&#8208;benzylic ketones under mild conditions (3&#8197;bar H2, heptane), while ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5 or Cu2Cr2O5 are inactive when the same global temperature is adjusted by conventional heating. A flow reactor is presented that allows the use of magnetic induction for continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation at elevated pressure. The excellent catalytic properties of ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5 for the hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfuralacetone are conserved for at least 17&#8197;h on stream, demonstrating for the first time the application of a magnetically heated catalyst to a continuously operated hydrogenation reaction in the liquid phase.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Functionalization with d0 Early Transition Metals Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a general class of electrocatalysts covering the majority of early transition metals for ambient methane functionalization. The broad applicability of this discovery offers fundamental insights and new opportunities for natural gas utilization.







Abstract
The undesirable loss of methane (CH4) at remote locations welcomes approaches that ambiently functionalize CH4 on&#8208;site without intense infrastructure investment. Recently, we found that electrochemical oxidation of vanadium(V)&#8208;oxo with bisulfate ligand leads to CH4 activation at ambient conditions. The key question is whether such an observation is a one&#8208;off coincidence or a general strategy for electrocatalyst design. Here, a general scheme of electrocatalytic CH4 activation with d0 early transition metals is established. The pre&#8208;catalysts&#8217; molecular structure, electrocatalytic kinetics, and mechanism were detailed for titanium&#8197;(IV), vanadium&#8197;(V), and chromium&#8197;(VI) species as model systems. After a turnover&#8208;limiting one&#8208;electron electrochemical oxidation, the yielded ligand&#8208;centered cation radicals activate CH4 with low activation energy and high selectivity. The reactivities are universal among early transition metals from Period 4 to 6, and the reactivities trend for different early transition metals correlate with their d orbital energies across periodic table. Our results offer new chemical insights towards developing advanced ambient electrocatalysts of natural gas.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Green Process to Synthesize MXene with Controllable Surface Terminations using Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first study to use a molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching (MS&#8208;E&#8208;etching) method to synthesize Ti3C2Cl2 without metallic impurities. The Tx surface terminations could be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S in this one&#8208;pot process. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx electrode exhibited a significant increase in capacity.







Abstract
Surface terminations of two&#8208;dimensional MXene (Ti3C2Tx) considerably impact its physicochemical properties. Commonly used etching methods usually introduce &#8208;F surface terminations or metallic impurities in MXene. We present a new molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching method to synthesize fluorine&#8208;free Ti3C2Cl2. Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus, no metallics are present in the Ti3C2Cl2 product. The surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the variety of surface terminations. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, exhibiting capacitances of 225&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;Ag&#8722;1, good rate performance (91.1&#8201;% at 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1), and excellent capacitance retention (100&#8201;% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles at 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1), which is superior to multi&#8208;layered Ti3C2Tx prepared by other etching methods.

Achieving high electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor simultaneously for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics is still challenging. By constructing two new acceptor&#8208;acceptor n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and introducing the 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl group to form the new n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI), high electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 are achieved. Calculations using Density Functional Theory show that TP&#8208;DMBI presents a higher singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) energy level of &#8722;1.94&#8197;eV than that of the common dopant 4&#8208;(1, 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2, 3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenyl) dimethylamine (N&#8208;DMBI) (&#8722;2.36&#8197;eV), which can result in a larger offset between the SOMO of dopant and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of n&#8208;type polymers, though that effect may not be dominant in the present work. The doped polymer films exhibit higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor than films using N&#8208;DMBI at the same doping levels or similar electrical conductivity levels. Moreover, TP&#8208;DMBI doped polymer films offer much higher electron mobility of up to 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 than films with N&#8208;DMBI doping, demonstrating the potential of TP&#8208;DMBI, and 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxy DMBIs more broadly, for high performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

         <title>Probing Redox Non&#8208;Innocence in Iron&#8211;Carbene Complexes {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11 by 1,2H and 13C Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented herein are detailed 1/2H and 13C pulse EPR and DFT investigations of an S=1/2 terminal iron&#8211;carbene species. These studies reveal substantial spin density localized at the carbene&#8208;bound Fe center, in contrast with what has been reported to date for radical metal&#8211;carbenoid species. The {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 complex serves as a well&#8208;defined reference compound for comparison to data reported for in situ trapped&#8208;intermediates.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a series of iron&#8208;carbene complexes in redox states {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11. Pulse EPR studies of the 1,2H and 13C isotopologues of {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 reveal the high covalency of the Fe&#8211;carbene bonding, leading to a more even spin distribution than commonly observed for reduced Fischer carbenes.

         <title>Direct, Site&#8208;Selective and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Tetrahydrofurans via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, THF is activated by visible light irradiation of quantum dots in a direct, site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The resultant &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl radicals, generated from &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H of THF on the surface of QD, enable couple with either &#945;&#8208;amino radical of amine, or addition to chromones and terminal alkynes.







Abstract
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, the intrinsic chemical inertness of tetrahydrofuran (THF) makes direct and site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation difficult, especially under redox neutral condition. Here, we demonstrate that semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of THF via forming QDs/THF conjugates. Under visible light irradiation, the resultant alkoxyalkyl radical directly engages in radical cross&#8208;coupling with &#945;&#8208;amino radical from amino C&#8722;H bonds or radical addition with alkene or phenylacetylene, respectively. In contrast to stoichiometric oxidant or hydrogen atom transfer reagents required in previous studies, the scalable benchtop approach can execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of THF only by a QD photocatalyst under redox&#8208;neutral condition, thus providing a broad of value added chemicals starting from bulk THFs reagent.

         <title>Multiplexed Small Molecule Ligand Binding Assays by Affinity Labeling and DNA Sequence Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule binding assays to target proteins are a core component of drug discovery and development. While a number of assay formats are available, significant drawbacks still remain in cost, sensitivity, and throughput. To improve assays by capitalizing on the power of DNA sequence analysis, we have developed an assay method that combines DNA encoding with split&#8208;and&#8208;pool sample handling. The approach involves affinity labeling of DNA&#8208;linked ligands to a protein target.&#160; Critically, the labeling event assesses ligand binding and enables subsequent pooling of several samples . Application of a purifying selection on the pool for protein&#8208;labeled DNAs allows detection of ligand binding by quantification of DNA barcodes. We demonstrate the approach in both ligand displacement and direct binding formats and demonstrate its utility in determination of relative ligand affinity, profiling ligand specificity, and high&#8208;throughput small molecule screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetization Dynamics on Isotope&#8208;Isomorphic Holmium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the nuclear&#8208;spin driven magnetization dynamics involving both metal ion and the ligand, for first time, in two HoIII isomorphic single&#8208;molecule magnets, where the behavior is originated from the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in nuclear spin number of protium (I=1/2) and deuterium (I=1).







Abstract
Here we reported the deuteration of the metal&#8208;binding equatorial water molecules in a reported HoIII single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry, from [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5]3+ to [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(D2O)5]3+. The hyperfine structures originating from the nuclear spin of 165HoIII can be clearly observed. Moreover, the resulting magnetization dynamics revealed the switch of the relative relaxation rates for the two isotope&#8208;isomorphic complexes&#8212;respectively faster/slower at low/high temperature. The noticeable isotope effect arises from not only the paramagnetic metal center but also the diamagnetic ligands, which can be explained by the ab initio calculated tunnel splitting and the involvement of the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in the nuclear spin number of protium (1H, I=1/2) and deuterium (2H, I=1).

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Simultaneous Imaging of Acidification and Proteolysis in Single Phagosomes Using Bifunctional Janus&#8208;Particle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional Janus&#8208;particle probe consisting of a pH and proteolysis sensor enables the simultaneous imaging and quantification of acidification and proteolysis within single phagosomes in live cells.







Abstract
The digestion of pathogens inside phagosomes by immune cells occurs through a sequence of reactions including acidification and proteolysis, but how the reactions are orchestrated in the right order is unclear due to a lack of methods to simultaneously measure more than one reaction in phagosomes. Here we report a bifunctional Janus&#8208;particle probe to simultaneously monitor acidification and proteolysis in single phagosomes in live cells. Each probe consists of a pH reporter and a proteolysis reporter that are spatially separated but function concurrently. Using the Janus probes, we found the acidic pH needed to initiate and maintain proteolysis, revealing the mechanism for the sequential occurrence of both reactions during pathogen digestion. We showed how bacterium&#8208;derived lipopolysaccharides alter the acidification and proteolysis in phagosomes. This study showcases Janus&#8208;particle probes as a generally applicable tool for monitoring multiple reactions in intracellular vesicles.

         <title>Stabilization of Reactive Nitrene by Silylenes without Using a Reducing Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncharged univalent and reactive nitrene is captured and stabilized by silylenes. Two nitrene compounds are synthesized and fully characterized. The nitrene character was established by X&#8208;ray analysis, first&#8208;principles electronic structure studies using density functional theory, and natural bond orbital&#8208;based bonding analysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of nitrene reagents as the source of a nitrogen atom to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;incorporated R1LSi&#8208;N&#8592;SiLR2 (1) [L=PhC(NtBu)2; R1=NTMS2, R2=NTMS]. Compound 1 is synthesized by reacting LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 3.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at low temperature to afford a triene&#8208;like structural framework. Whereas the reaction of the LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 2.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at room temperature produced silaimine 2 with a central four&#8208;membered Si2N2 ring which is accompanied by a silylene LSi and a cleaved silylene fragment. 1 further reacts with AgOTf at room temperature to yield compound 3 which shows coordination of nitrene to silver with the triflate salt. The compounds 1 and 2 were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The quantum mechanical calculations reveal that compounds 1 and 2 have dicoordinated monovalent N atoms having two active lone pairs of electrons. These lone pairs are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions.

         <title>Photochemical Organocatalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Conjugate Addition of Allyl Groups to Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is disclosed. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then stereoselectively intercepted with high &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, complete chemoselectivity, and moderate to good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We report the first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then intercepted stereoselectively. The underlying radical mechanism of this process overcomes the poor regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity that traditionally affects the conjugate allylation of enals proceeding via polar pathways. We also demonstrate how this organocatalytic strategy could selectively install a valuable prenyl fragment at the &#946;&#8208;carbon of enals.

         <title>Asymmetric Deoxygenative Alkynylation of Tertiary Amides Enabled by Iridium/Copper Bimetallic Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Ir/Cu bimetallic relay catalysis was developed to achieve the challenging asymmetric deoxygenative alkynylation of inert amides under mild conditions, affording a series of synthetically important chiral propargylamines in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A variety of inert tertiary amides have been successfully transformed into synthetically important chiral propargylamines in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities via a relayed sequence of Ir catalyzed partial reduction and Cu/GARPHOS catalyzed asymmetric alkynylation with terminal alkynes. The reaction was readily extended to some drug molecules and the transformations of representative products have been demonstrated, thus attesting the practical utilities and the robust nature of the protocol.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8211;radical chain reactions may contribute to rapid growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in combustion and astrochemical environments. Phenyl and benzyl radicals were experimentally observed to complete this chain reaction, producing diphenylmethyl and triphenylmethyl radicals by prompt H&#8208;atom loss (see scheme). This observation confirms the plausibility of such chain reactions at high temperature and low pressure.







Abstract
Rapid molecular&#8208;weight growth of hydrocarbons occurs in flames, in industrial synthesis, and potentially in cold astrochemical environments. A variety of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature chemical mechanisms have been proposed and confirmed, but more facile pathways may be needed to explain observations. We provide laboratory confirmation in a controlled pyrolysis environment of a recently proposed mechanism, radical&#8211;radical chain reactions of resonance&#8208;stabilized species. The recombination reaction of phenyl (c&#8208;C6H5) and benzyl (c&#8208;C6H5CH2) radicals produces both diphenylmethane and diphenylmethyl radicals, the concentration of the latter increasing with rising temperature. A second phenyl addition to the product radical forms both triphenylmethane and triphenylmethyl radicals, confirming the propagation of radical&#8211;radical chain reactions under the experimental conditions of high temperature (1100&#8211;1600&#8197;K) and low pressure (ca. 3&#8197;kPa). Similar chain reactions may contribute to particle growth in flames, the interstellar medium, and industrial reactors.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Halogenation/Semipinacol Rearrangement of 3&#8208;Hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;vinyl Oxindoles: A Stereodivergent Kinetic Resolution Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective halogenation/semipinacol rearrangement was realized through a ligand&#8208;controlled stereodivergent kinetic resolution. An array of optically active quinolone derivates and quinoline alkaloids were provided simultaneously by using a chiral Sc(OTf)3/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex as catalyst. The reaction mechanism was proposed to rationalize the reaction process and enantiocontrol.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective halogenation/semipinacol rearrangement of isatin&#8208;derived allylic alcohols has been developed with a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex as catalyst. This strategy involved a pivotal stereodivergent kinetic resolution process and provided a facile and efficient entry to optically active halo&#8208;substituted quinolone derivatives and quinoline alkaloids with a quaternary stereocenter simultaneously under mild reaction conditions. Based on the control experiments together with kinetic studies and DFT calculations, a possible catalytic cycle was proposed to illustrate the reaction process and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Mediated Inner&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer Induces Homogeneous Reduction of CO2 via Through&#8208;Space Electronic Conjugation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space electronic conjugation between a redox mediator and molecular Cr complex enables emergent co&#8208;electrocatalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. In the reduced forms, the aromatic portions interact through a combination of dispersion forces, &#960; conjugation, and weak coordination of the sulfone to Cr.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is an appealing method for converting renewable energy sources into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. We report a co&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the reduction of CO2 to CO comprised of a molecular Cr complex and dibenzothiophene&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (DBTD) as a redox mediator, which achieves high activity (TOF=1.51&#8211;2.84&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) and quantitative selectivity. Under aprotic or protic conditions, DBTD produces a co&#8208;electrocatalytic response with 1 by coordinating trans to the site of CO2 binding and mediating electron transfer from the electrode with quantitative efficiency for CO. This assembly is reliant on through&#8208;space electronic conjugation between the &#960; frameworks of DBTD and the bpy fragment of the catalyst ligand, with contributions from dispersive interactions and weak sulfone coordination.

         <title>Enantioselective Tertiary Electrophile (Hetero)Benzylation: Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Substitution of Isoprene Monoxide with Arylacetates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective benzylation of racemic isoprene monoxide is achieved through a two&#8208;step Pd&#8208;catalyzed substitution&#8211;decarboxylation strategy. A variety of electron&#8208;poor (hetero)arylacetates can be used as benzyl nucleophile surrogates to give products with acyclic quaternary stereocenters in 80&#8211;96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
The enantioselective generation of quaternary carbon centers remains challenging but is of growing importance for the preparation of functional molecules. Metal catalyzed allylic alkylations of tertiary electrophiles can provide access to these substructures but remain generally incompatible with organometallic benzyl nucleophiles. Here we demonstrate that electron&#8208;deficient arylacetates can serve as benzyl nucleophile surrogates to generate enantioenriched acyclic molecules containing a quaternary carbon center via a two&#8208;step substitution&#8211;decarboxylation process using isoprene monoxide. Products are often obtained in &gt;90&#8201;% ee using a commercially available catalyst. An array of electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups on the arylacetate moiety are tolerated. The lactone generated by the initial substitution reaction can be used in further stereoselective transformations to prepare molecules with acyclic vicinal quaternary stereocenters.

         <title>Responsive Interfacial Assemblies Based on Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of charge transfer (CT) interactions between water&#8208;soluble electron&#8208;deficient acceptor and oil&#8208;soluble electron&#8208;rich donor, the formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8211;water interface is presented. With CTCSs as the building block, higher&#8208;order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties are produced, which can be used to stabilize and structure liquids.







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) interactions have been widely used to construct supramolecular systems, such as functional nanostructures and gels. However, to date, there is no report on the generation of CT complexes at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. Here, by using an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor dissolved in water and an electron&#8208;rich donor dissolved in oil, we present the in situ formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8211;water interface. With time, CTCSs can assemble into higher&#8208;order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties, allowing the stabilization of liquids and offering the possibility to structure liquids into nonequilibrium shapes. Moreover, due to the redox&#8208;responsiveness of the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, the association and dissociation of CTCSs can be reversibly manipulated in a redox process, leading to the switchable assembly and disassembly of the resultant constructs.

         <title>An on&#8208;surface Diels&#8211;Alder reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was demonstrated on&#8208;surface in single molecules of a cyclic strained triyne. The starting material, several intermediates and the product were visualized by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips. Our results pave the way to use this iconic pericyclic reaction for on&#8208;surface synthesis, introducing the concept of atom economy in the field.

The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is one of the most popular reactions in organic chemistry. However, its use in the field of on&#8208;surface synthesis is hampered by the spatial restrictions of this cycloaddition reaction. Herein we selected a cyclic strained triyne to demonstrate an on&#8208;surface hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in a single molecule. The reaction was studied in detail by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips. Our results pave the way to use this iconic pericyclic reaction for on&#8208;surface synthesis, introducing the concept of atom economy in the field.

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Hybrid Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanosheets of Phase Pure n=2: Stabilized Colloids Stored in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum confined nanosheets (NSs) of 3D perovskites with a thickness of two lead halide layers can be prepared by using the dodecylammonium/tosylate ligand pair. The addition of Eu&#8208;nanodots to the colloid prevented the NSs from a structural rearrangement and/or coalescence. Deep blue&#8208;emissive colloids were recovered by simply dispersing it in toluene.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper lead halide perovskite (RP&#8208;LHP) nano&#8208;nanostructures can be regarded as self&#8208;assembled quantum wells or superlattices of 3D perovskites with an intrinsic quantum well thickness of a single or a few (n=2&#8208;4) lead halide layers; the quantum wells are separated by organic layers. They can be scaled down to a single quantum well dimension. Here, the preparation of highly (photo)chemical and colloidal stable hybrid LHP nanosheets (NSs) of ca. 7.4&#8197;&#956;m lateral size and 2.5&#8197;nm quantum well height (thereby presenting a deep blue emission at ca. 440&#8197;nm), is reported for the first time. The NSs are close&#8208;lying and they even interconnect when deposited on a substrate. Their synthesis is based on the use of the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid/dodecylamine (pTS/DDA) ligand pair and their (photo)chemical stability and photoluminescence is enhanced by adding EuBr2 nanodots (EuNDs). Strikingly, they can be preserved as a solid and stored for at least one year. The blue emissive colloid can be recovered from the solid as needed by simply dispersing the powder in toluene and then using it to prepare solid films, making them very promising candidates for manufacturing devices.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Vicinal Difunctionalization of Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes with Dual Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis was developed involving coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal difunctionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes. The reaction is site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral, tolerating air, moisture and a broad scope of functional groups, which makes this method attractive for modular synthesis of complex heteroarene&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
A new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is reported involving the selective coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal double C&#8208;H functionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes in a site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The key is to use alkynyl bromides as the second electrophile, which allows vicinal difunctionalization of a wide range of heteroarenes including pyrroles, thiophenes and furans at their C4 and C5 positions. One&#8208; or two&#8208;step tetrafunctionalizations of simple pyrrole and thiophene have also been realized. The C2&#8208;substituted NBEs prove most effective in these reactions, and the mechanistic exploration discloses the origin of the high selectivity of this transformation. Synthetic utility of this method has been exemplified in the concise preparations of thiophene&#8208;containing organic materials and a protein kinase inhibitor analogue. Preliminary success has also been achieved in a direct annulation event, using a tethered ketone as the second electrophile.

         <title>Tailoring the Pore Surface of 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Synthetic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) have gained increasing attention for their attractive features. However, the development of 3D COFs is strongly restricted, mainly due to their synthetic difficulty and complicated structure determination. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, which can avoid these problems by incorporating functional moieties into a predetermined framework, provides an alternative way to construct 3D COFs with specific functions. Herein, we report the designed synthesis and characterization of a series of highly crystalline 3D COFs with different loadings of ethynyl groups. Notably, these alkyne&#8208;tagged 3D COFs provide a platform for targeted anchoring various specific groups onto the pore walls via click reactions. Moreover, the pore surface engineering can accordingly change their properties, e.g., the obtained click products exhibited higher CO  2  /N  2  selectivity. This work described a simple but powerful strategy to build functional 3D COFs, which will certainly advance them for a ranging of interesting applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Two&#8208;Step Access to p&#8208;Extended Naphthyridine Systems &#8211; Potent Building Blocks for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient synthetic approaches of incorporation of nitrogen into polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in different patterns as stabilising moiety for p&#8208;extended systems and modification tool for optoelectronic properties remains a challenge until today. In this work we developed a new versatile pathway to napthyridine&#8208;based PAHs as non&#8208;symmetric and regioisomeric pendant to pyrazine&#8208;based PAHs. A combination of a gold&#8208;catalysed synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoquinolines and the development of an in situ  desulfonation and condensation of these precursors are the key steps of the protocol. The shape and type of attached functional groups of the PAHs can be designed in a late stage of the overall synthetic procedure by the chosen anthranile and backbone of the ynamide introduced in the gold&#8208;catalysed step. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the investigation of electronic properties of the compounds show the influence of the attached substituents. All naphthyridine based PAHs show halochromic behaviour implying their use as highly sensitive proton sensor in non&#8208;protic solvents.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Condensation of DNA helices into hexagonally packed bundles and toroids represents an intriguing example of functional organization of biological macromolecules at the nanoscale. The condensation models are based on the unique polyelectrolyte features of DNA, however here we could reproduce a DNA&#8208;like condensation with supramolecular helices of small chiral molecules, thereby demonstrating that it is a more general phenomenon. We show that bile salt sodium deoxycholate can form supramolecular helices upon interaction with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes of homopolymer or block copolymers. At higher order, a controlled hexagonal packing of the helices into DNA&#8208;like bundles and toroids could be accomplished. The results disclose unknown similarities between covalent and supramolecular non&#8208;covalent helical polyelectrolytes, which inspire visionary ideas of constructing supramolecular versions of biological macromolecules. As drug nanocarriers the polymer&#8208;BS superstructures would get advantage of a complex chirality at molecular and supramolecular levels, whose effect on the nanocarrier assisted drug efficiency is a still unexplored fascinating issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Evidence of Subsurface Oxygen Formation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Cu&#160;by X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subsurface oxygen has been proposed to be crucial in oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) electrocatalysts for enhancing the binding of CO intermediates during CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the presence of such oxygen species under reductive conditions still remains debated. In this work, the existence of subsurface oxygen is validated by grazing incident hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, where OD&#8208;Cu was in&#8208;situ prepared by reduction of Cu oxide with H2&#160;without exposing to air. The results suggest two types of subsurface oxygen embedded between the fully reduced metallic surface and the Cu2O buried beneath: (i) oxygen staying at lattice defects and/or vacancies in the surface&#8208;most region and (ii) interstitial oxygen intercalated in metal structure.&#160;This study adds convincing support to the presence of subsurface oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu, which previously has been suggested to play an important role to mitigate the &#963;&#8208;repulsion of Cu for CO intermediates in CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Approaches to &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Arylated Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed simple and efficient protocols for palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;arylations of structurally diverse vinyl ethers. Both catalytic methods proceed under relatively mild reactions conditions applying to a broad substrate range including more complex compounds providing arylated glucal or isochromene. Lacking the common requirement of a large reagent excess, the transformations are highly economic and limiting the waste production. Results from computational studies (DFT) provided insight into the key factors determining the pronounced regio&#173;selectivities of the investigated reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>What Distinguishes the Strength and the Effect of a Lewis Acid: Analysis of the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IUPAC defines Lewis acidity as &#8220;the thermodynamic tendency for Lewis pair formation&#8221;. This &#8220;strength&#8221; property was recently specified as &#8220;global Lewis acidity&#8221; (  gLA  ), and is gauged, e.g., by the fluoride ion affinity. Experimentally, Lewis acidity is usually evaluated by the &#8220;effect&#8221; on a bound molecule, such as the induced  31  P NMR shift of triethylphosphine oxide in the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett (GB) method. This type of scaling was called &#8220;effective Lewis acidity&#8221; (  eLA  ). Unfortunately,  gLA  and  eLA  often correlate poorly, but a reason for this is unknown. Hence, the  strength  and the  effect  of a Lewis acid are two distinct properties, but they are often granted interchangeably. The present work analyzes thermodynamic, NMR specific, and London dispersion effects on GB numbers for 130 Lewis acids by theory and experiment. The deformation energy of a Lewis acid is identified as the prime cause for the critical deviation between  gLA  and  eLA  &#8211; but its correction allows a unification for the first time. Hence, the gained insights allow to answer the question &#8220;  What is the GB number?&#8221;  and push the theory of Lewis acids on a more advanced level. It substantiates the need to describe Lewis acidity by multiple dimensions and provides a rationale for future principles in design and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Control over multiple Nano&#8208; and Secondary Structures in Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the unique morphological and conformational versatility of a biologically active peptide (  PEP&#8208;1  ), which undergoes diverse self&#8208;assembly pathways to form up to six distinct nanostructures and up to four different secondary structures through subtle modulations in pH, concentration and temperature.  PEP&#8208;1  forms twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures and nanofibers at pH 7.4, which transform into fractal&#8208;like structures with strong &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations at pH 13.0 or short disorganized elliptical aggregates at pH 5.5. Upon dilution at pH 7.4, the nanofibers with twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structural elements convert into nanoparticles with random coil conformations. Interestingly, these two self&#8208;assembled states at pH 7.4 and room temperature are kinetically controlled and undergo a further transformation into thermodynamically stable states upon annealing: whereas the twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and corresponding nanofibers transform into 2D sheets with well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;sheet domains, the nanoparticles with random coil structures convert into short nanorods with &#945;&#8208;helix conformations. Notably,  PEP&#8208;1  also showed high biocompatibility, low hemolytic activity and marked antibacterial activity, rendering our system a promising candidate for multiple bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Configurational Lability at Tetrahedral Phosphorus: syn/anti&#8208;Isomerization of a P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphiranium Cation by&#160;Intramolecular Epimerization at Phosphorus</title>

         <dc:description>Tetrahedral main group compounds are normally configurationally stable, but P&#8208;epimerization of the chiral phosphiranium cations  syn  &#8208; or  anti  &#8208;[Mes*P(Me)CH2CHPh][OTf] (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;(t&#8208;Bu)3C6H2) occurred under mild conditions at 60 &#176;C in CD2Cl2  , resulting in isomerization to give a  syn  &#8208;enriched equilibrium mixture.

         <title>syn/anti&#8208;Oligothienoacene Diimides with up to 10 Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a facile and powerful strategy to prepare libraries of oligothienoacene diimides that include anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;isomers using palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation and an unexpected 1,2&#8208;sulfur migration. Through this strategy, a series of oligothienoacene diimides containing 6, 8, and 10 fused rings were synthesized. The molecular geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation have dramatic effects on the electronic properties, degree of crystallinity, and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. Notably, single&#8208;crystal microfibers of syn&#8208;3c show electron mobilities up to 4.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, illustrating the significant potential of these materials for organic electronic devices. Our work demonstrates the versatility of this strategy for the development of oligothienoacene diimide libraries, in particular complex and large syn&#8208;oligothienoacene diimides, which are difficult to prepare by present methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons as a New Class of Promising Cathode Materials for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an emerging post&#8208;lithium battery technology, aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) have the advantages of large Al reserves and high safety, and have great potential to be applied to power grid energy storage. But current graphite cathode materials are limited in charge storage capacity due to the formation of stage&#8208;4 graphite&#8208;intercalated compounds (GICs) in the fully charged state. Herein, we propose a new type of cathode materials for AIBs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which resembles graphite in large conjugated &#960; bond, but do not form GICs in the charge process. Quantum chemistry calculation results show that PAHs can bind AlCl4&#8208; through the interaction between the conjugated &#960; bond in the PAHs and AlCl4&#8208;, forming on&#8208;plane interaction. The theoretical specific capacity of PAHs is negatively correlated with the number of benzene rings in the PAHs. Then, under the guidance of theoretical calculations, anthracene, a three&#8208;ring PAHs, was evaluated as a cathode material for AIBs. Electrochemical measurements show that anthracene owns a high specific capacity of 157 mAh g&#8208;1 (at 100 mA g&#8208;1) and still maintains a specific capacity of 130 mAh g&#8208;1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a feasible &#8220;theory guides practice&#8221; research model for the development of energy storage materials, and also provides a new class of promising cathode materials for AIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated SuFEx Click Chemistry For Modular Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SuFEx click chemistry is a powerful method designed for the selective, rapid and modular synthesis of functional molecules. Classical SuFEx reactions form stable S&#8208;O linkages upon exchange of S&#8208;F bonds with aryl silyl&#8208;ether substrates, and while near&#8208;perfect in their outcome, are sometimes disadvantaged by relatively high catalyst loadings and prolonged reaction times. We herein report the development of &#8216;Accelerated SuFEx Click Chemistry&#8217; (ASCC), an improved SuFEx method for the efficient and catalytic coupling of aryl and alkyl alcohols with a range of SuFExable hubs. We demonstrate Barton&#8217;s hindered guanidine base (2&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine; BTMG) as a superb SuFEx catalyst that, when used in synergy with silicon additive hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), yields stable S&#8208;O bond linkages in a single step; often within minutes. The powerful combination of BTMG and HMDS reagents allows for catalyst loadings as low as 1.0 mol% and, in congruence with click&#8208;principles, provides a scalable method that is safe, efficient, and practical for modular synthesis. ASSC expands the number of accessible SuFEx products and will find significant application in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and materials science .</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivities of Interstitial Hydrides in a Cu11 Template: En Route to Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sharp contrast to that of surface hydrides, reactivities on interstitial hydrides are difficult to explore. When treated with a metal ion (Cu  +  , Ag  +  , and Au  +  ), the stable Cu(I) dihydride template [Cu  11  H  2  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  (C&#8801;CPh)  3  ] (  H  2  Cu  11  ) generates surprisingly three very different compounds; namely [CuH  2  Cu  11  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  (C&#8801;CPh)  3  ]  +  (  1  ), [AgH  2  Cu  14  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  ((C&#8801;CPh)  6  ]  +  (  2  ), and [AuCu  11  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  (C&#8801;CPh)  3  Cl] (  3  ).  1  and  2  are both M(I) species and maintain the same number of hydride ligands as their  H  2  Cu  11  precursor. Neutron diffraction revealed the first time a trigonal pyramidal hydride coordination mode in an AgCu  3  environment of  2  . The bimetallic cluster of  3  has no hydride and exhibits a mixed&#8208;valent [AuCu  11  ]  10+  metal core, making it a 2&#8208;electron superatom. Thus, depending on the nature of M  +  , trigonal pyramidal hydrides of the  H  2  Cu  11  reactant behave differently. In the cases of M = Cu or Ag, they act as regular 2&#8208;electron ligands. In the case of M = Au, they behave as electron donors, leading to the formation of a 2&#8208;electron superatom, with liberation of H  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Recombination and Oligonucleotide Assembly in Peptide&#8208;RNA Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, a prebiotically plausible ribozyme formed from short oligonucleotides reversibly cleaves an RNA substrate. However, in the presence of poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, phase separation occurs owing to charge interactions between the oppositely charged RNA and peptide. The resulting compartments greatly enhance ribozyme activity, driving the reaction equilibrium towards the ligation of long and complex RNA in mild conditions.







Abstract
The ability of RNA to catalyze RNA ligation is critical to its central role in many prebiotic model scenarios, in particular the copying of information during self&#8208;replication. Prebiotically plausible ribozymes formed from short oligonucleotides can catalyze reversible RNA cleavage and ligation reactions, but harsh conditions or unusual scenarios are often required to promote folding and drive the reaction equilibrium towards ligation. Here, we demonstrate that ribozyme activity is greatly enhanced by charge&#8208;mediated phase separation with poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, which shifts the reaction equilibrium from cleavage in solution to ligation in peptide&#8208;RNA coaggregates and coacervates. This compartmentalization enables robust isothermal RNA assembly over a broad range of conditions, which can be leveraged to assemble long and complex RNAs from short fragments under mild conditions in the absence of exogenous activation chemistry, bridging the gap between pools of short oligomers and functional RNAs.

         <title>Combining Electrochemiluminescence Detection with Aptamer&#8208;Gated Indicator Releasing Mesoporous Nanoparticles Enables ppt Sensitivity for Strip&#8208;Based Rapid Tests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The best of both worlds in one strip, i.e., electrochemical excitation and luminescence emission, together with aptamer&#8208;gated hybrid nanomaterials enables the detection of penicillin directly in milk at ultra&#8208;trace levels in less than 5&#8197;min with a simple test strip and a mobile communication device.







Abstract
The combination of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) and aptamer&#8208;gated indicator delivering (gAID) magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles embedded into glass fibre paper functionalised with poly(ethyleneglycol) and N&#8208;(3&#8208;triethoxysilylpropyl)diethanolamine allowed the development of a rapid test that detects penicillin directly in diluted milk down to 50&#177;9 ppt in &lt;5&#8197;min. Covalent attachment of the aptamer &#8220;cap&#8221; to the silica scaffold enabled pore closure through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions with surface amino groups, while binding of penicillin led to a folding&#8208;up of the aptamer thus releasing the ECL reporter Ru(bpy)32+ previously loaded into the material and letting it be detected after lateral flow by a smartphone camera upon electrochemical excitation with a screen printed electrode inserted into a 3D&#8208;printed holder. The approach is simple, generic and presents advantages with respect to sensitivity, measurement uncertainty and robustness compared with conventional fluorescence or electrochemical detection, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;need analyses of challenging matrices and analytes at ultra&#8208;trace levels.

A Ni&#8208;based catalyst derived from Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 was synthesized and studied for the photothermal methanation reaction. The catalyst shows high performance for CH4 production under visible&#8208;IR irradiation. The catalysts also shows high stability and excellent recyclability after several consecutive reaction cycles.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a highly active and stable metal&#8208;organic framework derived Ni&#8208;based catalyst for the photothermal reduction of CO2 to CH4. Through the controlled pyrolysis of MOF&#8208;74 (Ni), the nature of the carbonaceous species and therefore photothermal performance can be tuned. CH4 production rates of 488&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8208;visible&#8208;IR irradiation are achieved when the catalyst is prepared under optimized conditions. No particle aggregation or significant loss of activity were observed after ten consecutive reaction cycles or more than 12&#8197;hours under continuous flow configuration. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we performed an outdoor experiment under ambient solar irradiation, demonstrating the potential of our catalyst to reduce CO2 to CH4 using only solar energy.
