         <title>Confined Element Distribution with Structure&#8208;driven Energy Coupling for Enhanced Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural failure of Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] could not be alleviated with traditional modification strategies through the adjustable composition property&#160;of Prussian blue analogues&#160;(PBAs), considering that the accumulation and release of stress derived from the MnN6&#160;octahedrons are unilaterally restrained.&#160;Herein, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;&#160;to directionally tune the enrichment of elements, is proposed to restrain structural degradation and induce unconventional energy coupling phenomenon. The non&#8208;uniform distribution of elements at the M1&#160;site of&#160;PBAs&#160;(NFM&#8208;PB) is manipulated by the sequentially precipitated Ni, Fe, and Mn according to the Irving&#8208;William order.&#160;Electrochemically active Fe is operated to accompany Mn, and zero&#8208;strain Ni is modulated to enrich at the surface, synergistically mitigating with the enrichment and release of stress and then significantly improving the structural stability.&#160;Furthermore, unconventional energy coupling effect, a fusion of the electrochemical behavior between FeLS&#160;and MnHS, is triggered by the confined element distribution, leading to the&#160;enhanced electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;polarization ability. Consequently, the NFM&#8208;PB demonstrates superior rate performance and cycling stability. These findings further exploit potentialities of the adjustable composition property and provide new insights into the component design engineering for advanced PBAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Triggered H&#8208;Abstraction Photoinitiators for the Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Independent Therapy of Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by oxygen&#8208;dependence and side effects caused by photosensitizer residues. Photoinitiators based on the H&#8208;abstraction reaction can address these challenges because they can generate alkyl radical&#8208;killing cells independently of oxygen and undergo rapid bleaching following H&#8208;abstraction. Nonetheless, the development of photoinitiators for PDT has been impeded by the absence of effective design strategies. Herein, we have developed aryl&#8208;ketone substituted cyanine (ACy&#8208;R), the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer therapy. These ACy&#8208;R molecules inherited the near&#8208;infrared absorption of cyanine dye, and aryl&#8208;ketone modification imparted H&#8208;abstraction capability. Experimental and quantum calculations revealed that modifying the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of the aryl (e.g., ACy&#8208;5F) improved the contribution of the O atom to the photon excitation process promoting intersystem crossing and H&#8208;abstraction ability. Particularly, ACy&#8208;5F rapidly penetrated cells and enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum. Even under severe hypoxia, ACy&#8208;5F initiated red&#8208;light induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules, inducing necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, ACy&#8208;5F was degraded after H&#8208;abstraction, thus avoiding the side effects of long&#8208;term phototoxicity after therapy. This study not only provides a crucial molecular tool for hypoxic tumors therapy, but also presents a promising strategy for the development of multifunctional photosensitizers and photoinitiators.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Syngas Production from Natural Lignin, Sunlight, and Water over Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformation of lignin to syngas can turn waste into treasure yet remains a tremendous challenge because of its naturally evolved stubborn structure. In this work, light&#8208;driven reforming of natural lignin in water for green syngas production is explored using Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires. Syngas is &#160;yielded from the continuous evolution of &#8226;CH3&#160;and &#8226;OH from photocatalytic reforming of lignin in water. Together with the superior optoelectronic attributes of Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires, the evolution rate of syngas approaches to 43.4&#160;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1&#160;with tunable H2/CO ratios and a remarkable turnover number (TON) of 150, 543mol syngas per mol Pt.&#160;Notably, the architecture demonstrates a high light efficiency of 12.1% for syngas generation under focused light without any extra thermal input. Outdoor test ascertains the viability of producing syngas with the only inputs of natural lignin, water, and sunlight, thus presenting a low&#8208;carbon route for synthesizing transportation fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A simple and Sequential Strategy for the Introduction of Complexity and Hierarchy in Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework (HOF) Crystals for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a new class of crystalline porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) with great potential for a diverse range of applications. HOFs face common challenges to POMMs, and in general to purely organic crystals, that is, the difficulty of integrating complexity in crystals. Herein, we proposed a simple and sequential strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures. The strategy is based on controlling the assembly conditions, avoiding the use of any surface functionalization or template, which allows to obtain hierarchical crystalline porous superstructures in an easy manner. As proof of concept, we obtained the first example of core&#8208;shell (HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF) crystals and HOFs with hierarchical superstructures having superhydrophobicity and trapping abilities for the capture of persistent water contaminants such as oils and microplastics. We expect that this strategy could serve as inspiration for the construction of more intricated multiscale structures that could greatly expand the library of HOFs materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Skeletal Indole Editing via Nitrogen Atom Insertion by Sustainable Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal molecular editing gained considerable recent momentum and emerged as a uniquely powerful tool for late&#8208;stage diversifications. Thus far, superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents were largely required for skeletal indole editing. In contrast, we herein show that electricity enables sustainable nitrogen atom insertion reactions to give bio&#8208;relevant quinazoline scaffolds without stoichiometric chemical redox&#8208;waste product. The transition metal&#8208;free electro&#8208;editing was enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and proved robust on scale, while tolerating a variety of valuable functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetric Anion Mediated&#160;Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Knoevenagel Reaction for N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N Atropisomers Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N atropisomers.   The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The key to excellent regio&#8208; and remote enantiocontrol could be owed to the hydrogen bond between the enolate anion and triflamide block of the organocatalyst. This connected the enolate anion and iminium cation by a chiral backbone. The mechanism investigation via control experiments, correlation analysis, and density functional theory calculations further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones. The synthetic applications also demonstrated the reaction's potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Proton Transfer in Carboxylated Supramolecular Polymer for Highly Efficient Overall Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton supply is as critical as O2 activation for artificial photosynthesis of H2O2&#160;via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR). However, proton release via water dissociation is frequently hindered because of the sluggish water oxidation reaction (WOR), extremely limiting the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production. To tackle this challenge, carboxyl&#8208;enriched supramolecular polymer (perylene tetracarboxylic acid &#8208; PTCA) is elaborately prepared by molecular self&#8208;assembly for overall photosynthesis of H2O2. Interestingly, the interconversion between carboxyl as Br&#248;nsted acid and its conjugated base realizes rapid proton circulation. Through this efficient tandem proton transfer process, the spatial effect of photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reaction is greatly enhanced with reduced reaction barrier. This significantly facilitates 2e&#8208; photocatalytic ORR to synthesize H2O2 and in the meanwhile promotes 4e&#8208; photocatalytic WOR to evolve O2. Consequently, the as&#8208;developed PTCA exhibits a remarkable H2O2 yield of 185.6 &#956;M h&#8208;1 in pure water and air atmosphere under visible light illumination. More impressively, an appreciable H2O2 yield of 78.6 &#956;M h&#8208;1 can be well maintained in an anaerobic system owing to in&#8208;situ O2 generation by 4e&#8208; photocatalytic WOR. Our study presents a novel concept for artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 via constructing efficient proton transfer pathway to enable rapid proton circulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully&#8208;Fused Indacenodithiophene&#8208;Centered Small Molecule n&#8208;Type Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing novel n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is an enduring research endeavour, given their pivotal roles in organic electronics and their relative scarcity compared to p&#8208;type counterparts. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring fully&#8208;fused conjugated backbone. By attaching two sets of adjacent amino and formyl groups to the indacenodithiophene&#8208;based central cores and triggering a tandem reaction of Knoevenagel condensation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization, DFA1 and DFA2 were realized. The solution&#8208;processed organic field effect transistors based on DFA1 exhibited unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a decent electron mobility of ca. 0.10 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 (ca. 0.038 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 for DFA2 based devices). When employing DFA1 as a third component in organic solar cells, a high power conversion efficiency of 19.2% can be achieved in ternary devices fabricated with PM6:L8&#8208;BO:DFA1. This work paves a new pathway in the molecular engineering of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, propelling relevant research forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Carbon Formation and its Impact on Methane Dry Reforming Kinetics on Rhodium&#8208;based Catalysts by Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mechanism for carbon deposition and its impact on the reaction kinetics of Methane Dry Reforming (MDR) using Rhodium&#8208;based catalysts is presented. By integrating Raman spectroscopy with kinetic analysis in an operando&#8208;annular chemical reactor under strict chemical conditions, we discovered that carbon deposition on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst follows a nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism. The dynamics of carbon aggregates at the surface is found to be ruled by the CO2/CH4 ratio and the inlet CH4 concentration. The findings elucidate the spatiotemporal development of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their effects on catalytic performance. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism for carbon formation shows that the influence of CO2 on MDR kinetics is an indirect result of carbon accumulation over time frames exceeding the turnover frequency, thus reconciling conflicting reports in the literature regarding CO2's kinetic role in MDR.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymerization by a Machine&#8208;Learning Discovered Crystallization Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapidly synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial to their practical applications. Here, we use a machine&#8208;learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom&#8208;up model derivation for the non&#8208;classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond&#8208;forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide&#8208;reaching relevance for many of the applications for which 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Oxygenation of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative oxygenation strategy that occurs under extraordinarily mild conditions, displays high functional group tolerance, and has a broad substrate scope. We conducted a detailed mechanistic study of the transformation, underpinning the further development of iron&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylative methodologies.







Abstract
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming reaction under mild, base&#8208;free conditions with visible light irradiation. The transformation uses readily available and structurally diverse carboxylic acids, iron photocatalyst, and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) derivatives as oxygenation reagents. The process exhibits a broad scope in acids possessing a wide range of stereoelectronic properties and functional groups. The developed reaction was applied to late&#8208;stage oxygenation of a series of bio&#8208;active molecules. The reaction leverages the ability of iron complexes to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals directly from carboxylic acids by photoinduced carboxylate&#8208;to&#8208;iron charge transfer. Kinetic, electrochemical, EPR, UV/Vis, HRMS, and DFT studies revealed that TEMPO has a triple role in the reaction: as an oxygenation reagent, an oxidant to turn over the Fe&#8208;catalyst, and an internal base for the carboxylic acid deprotonation. The obtained TEMPO adducts represent versatile synthetic intermediates that were further engaged in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions using commercial organo&#8208;photocatalysts and nucleophilic reagents.

         <title>Divalent Titanium via Reductive N&#8722;C Coupling of a TiIV Nitrido with &#960;&#8208;Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A titanium nitride undergoes N&#8722;C bond coupling with carbon monoxide and isocyanides to form TiII cumulene complexes [(PN)2Ti(NCE)]&#8722; (E=O, NAd, NtBu). Oxidation of these affords the TiIII cumulene [(PN)2Ti(NCE)]. Further oxidation affords a TiIV bis&#8208;cumulene trans&#8208;[(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2]. Structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic studies (HFEPR, CW X&#8208;band, NMR and IR spectroscopies), including 15N isotopic labelling studies are presented and discussed to understand the bonding and topology.







Abstract
The nitrido&#8208;ate complex [(PN)2Ti(N){&#956;2&#8208;K(OEt2)}]2 (1) (PN&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) reductively couples CO and isocyanides in the presence of DME or cryptand (Kryptofix222), to form rare, five&#8208;coordinate TiII complexes having a linear cumulene motif, [K(L)][(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E=O, L=Kryptofix222, (2); E=NAd, L=3 DME, (3); E=NtBu, L=3 DME, (4); E=NAd, L=Kryptofix222, (5)). Oxidation of 2&#8211;5 with [Fc][OTf] afforded an isostructural TiIII center containing a neutral cumulene, [(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E=O, (6); E=NAd (7), NtBu (8)) and characterization by CW X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy, revealed unpaired electron to be metal centric. Moreover, 1e&#8722; reduction of 6 and 7 in the presence of Kryptofix222cleanly reformed corresponding discrete TiII complexes 2 and 5, which were further characterized by solution magnetization measurements and high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, oxidation of 7 with [Fc*][B(C6F5)4] resulted in a ligand disproportionated TiIV complex having transoid carbodiimides, [(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2] (9). Comparison of spectroscopic, structural, and computational data for the divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent systems, including their 15N enriched isotopomers demonstrate these cumulenes to decrease in order of backbonding as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV and increasing order of &#960;&#8208;donation as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV, thus displaying more covalency in TiIII species.

     alt="Divalent Titanium via Reductive N&#8722;C Coupling of a TiIV Nitrido with &#960;-Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A titanium nitride undergoes N&#8722;C bond coupling with carbon monoxide and isocyanides to form Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; cumulene complexes [(PN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(NCE)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (E=O, NAd, N&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu). Oxidation of these affords the Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; cumulene [(PN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(NCE)]. Further oxidation affords a Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; bis-cumulene &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[(PN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(NCNAd)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. Structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic studies (HFEPR, CW X-band, NMR and IR spectroscopies), including &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N isotopic labelling studies are presented and discussed to understand the bonding and topology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nitrido-ate complex [(PN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(N){&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-K(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) (PN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=(N-(2-P&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4-methylphenyl)-2,4,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reductively couples CO and isocyanides in the presence of DME or cryptand (Kryptofix222), to form rare, five-coordinate Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes having a linear cumulene motif, [K(L)][(PN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(NCE)] (E=O, L=Kryptofix222, (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;); E=NAd, L=3 DME, (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;); E=N&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu, L=3 DME, (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;); E=NAd, L=Kryptofix222, (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;)). Oxidation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; with [Fc][OTf] afforded an isostructural Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; center containing a neutral cumulene, [(PN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(NCE)] (E=O, (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;); E=NAd (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), N&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;)) and characterization by CW X-band EPR spectroscopy, revealed unpaired electron to be metal centric. Moreover, 1e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction of &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of Kryptofix222cleanly reformed corresponding discrete Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, which were further characterized by solution magnetization measurements and high-frequency and -field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, oxidation of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; with [Fc*][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] resulted in a ligand disproportionated Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complex having &lt;i&gt;transoid&lt;/i&gt; carbodiimides, [(PN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(NCNAd)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;). Comparison of spectroscopic, structural, and computational data for the divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent systems, including their &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N enriched isotopomers demonstrate these cumulenes to decrease in order of backbonding as Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and increasing order of &#960;-donation as Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;, thus displaying more covalency in Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; species. Lastly, we show a synthetic cycle whereby complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can deliver an N-atom to CO and CNAd.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expedited Synthesis of Metal Phosphides Maximizes Dispersion, Air Stability, and Catalytic Performance in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis based on cheap and safe precursors delivers a wide range of supported metal phosphides with small particle diameters and high dispersion. Ni2P/Al2O3 prepared in this fashion is a bench&#8208;stable catalyst that delivers activity on par with the Pd&#8208;based benchmark catalyst in alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal phosphides have been hailed as potential replacements for scarce noble metal catalysts in many aspects of the hydrogen economy from hydrogen evolution to selective hydrogenation reactions. But the need for dangerous and costly phosphorus precursors, limited support dispersion, and low stability of the metal phosphide surface toward oxidation substantially lower the appeal and performance of metal phosphides in catalysis. We show here that a 1&#8208;step procedure that relies on safe and cheap precursors can furnish an air&#8208;stable Ni2P/Al2O3 catalyst containing 3.2&#8197;nm nanoparticles. Ni2P/Al2O3&#8201;1&#8208;step is kinetically competitive with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst in selective hydrogenation catalysis, and a loading corresponding to 4&#8197;ppm Ni was sufficient to convert 0.1&#8197;mol alkyne. The 1&#8208;step synthetic procedure alters the surface ligand speciation of Ni2P/Al2O3, which protects the nanoparticle surface from oxidation, and ensures that 85&#8201;% of the initial catalytic activity was retained after the catalyst was stored under air for 1.5&#8197;years. Preparation of Ni2P on a variety of supports (silica, TiO2, SBA&#8208;15, ZrO2, C and HAP) as well as Co2P/Al2O3, Co2P/TiO2 and bimetallic NiCoP/TiO2 demonstrates the generality with which supported metal phosphides can be accessed in a safe and straightforward fashion with small sizes and high dispersion.

         <title>Catalytic Refining Lignin&#8208;Derived Monomers: Seesaw Effect between Nanoparticle and Single&#8208;Atom Pt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seesaw effect between Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles in the catalytic refining of lignin monomers, viz. demethoxylation on a single&#8208;atom catalyst versus deep deoxygenation on a nanoparticle, is disclosed. The weak hydrogen spillover behavior on SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H inhibits hydrogenation of the benzene ring and removal of the phenol hydroxyl group, presenting in a high demethoxylation selectivity.







Abstract
Pt automatically adsorbed on oxygen vacancy of TiO2 via an in situ interfacial redox reaction, resulting in atomically dispersion of Pt on TiO2. In the upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived 4&#8208;propylguaiacol, single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) Pt/TiO2&#8722;H achieved a conversion of 96.9&#8201;% and a demethoxylation selectivity of 93.3&#8201;% under 3&#8197;MPa H2 at 250&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h, markedly different from the performance of nanoparticle counterpart that gave deep deoxygenation selectivity over 99.0&#8201;%. The high demethoxylation activity of SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H is mainly attributed to its weak hydrogen spillover capacity that suppressed the benzene ring hydrogenation and the deep deoxygenation. Additionally, SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H reduced the energy barrier of CAr&#8722;OCH3 bond cleavage and accordingly lowered the Gibbs free energy of the demethoxylation reaction. This facile method could fabricate single&#8208;atom Au, Pd, Ir, and Ru supported on TiO2&#8722;H, demonstrating the generality of this strategy for the establishment of a library of SACs. Moreover, SAC exhibited versatile capacity in demethoxylation of different lignin&#8208;derived monomers and high stability. This study showcases the superiority of atomically dispersed metal catalysts for selective demethoxylation reactions and proposes a renewable alternative to fossil&#8208;based 4&#8208;alkylphenols through upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived monomers.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lissodendoric Acid A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy leading to the first total synthesis of lissodendoric acid A is reported. The 12&#8208;step synthesis centers on an enantiospecific Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of a strained azacyclic allene to construct the core of the natural product. The study demonstrates that strained cyclic allenes are valuable synthetic building blocks for total synthesis.

         <title>piSTING: A Pocket&#8208;Independent Agonist Based on Multivalency&#8208;Driven STING Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate downstream signalling pathways. piSTINGs could serve as novel STING agonists for vaccines and combination therapies. And STING oligomerization is a useful strategy for the development of a new generation of STING agonists.







Abstract
The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a potent therapeutic target for innate immunity. Despite the efforts to develop pocket&#8208;dependent small&#8208;molecule STING agonists that mimic the endogenous STING ligand, cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), most of these agonists showed disappointing results in clinical trials owing to the limitations of the STING pocket. In this study, we developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate STING. Additionally, a piSTING&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant antibody response and inhibited tumour growth in therapeutic models. Moreover, a piSTING&#8208;based vaccine combination with aPD&#8208;1 showed remarkable potential to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In particular, piSTING can strengthen the impact of STING pathway in immunotherapy and accelerate the clinical translation of STING agonists.

     alt="piSTING: A Pocket-Independent Agonist Based on Multivalency-Driven STING Oligomerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed novel pocket-independent STING-activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency-driven oligomerization to activate downstream signalling pathways. piSTINGs could serve as novel STING agonists for vaccines and combination therapies. And STING oligomerization is a useful strategy for the development of a new generation of STING agonists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a potent therapeutic target for innate immunity. Despite the efforts to develop pocket-dependent small-molecule STING agonists that mimic the endogenous STING ligand, cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), most of these agonists showed disappointing results in clinical trials owing to the limitations of the STING pocket. In this study, we developed novel pocket-independent STING-activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency-driven oligomerization to activate STING. Additionally, a piSTING-adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant antibody response and inhibited tumour growth in therapeutic models. Moreover, a piSTING-based vaccine combination with aPD-1 showed remarkable potential to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In particular, piSTING can strengthen the impact of STING pathway in immunotherapy and accelerate the clinical translation of STING agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Unique Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Titanium Dioxide Supported Platinum Clusters for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieve the first construction of strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) between Pt sub&#8208;nanometer clusters and amorphous TiO2 nanosheets. Unique SMSI behaviors &#8211; ordering process of Pt atoms within clusters and superior stability in oxygen at high temperatures &#8211; are unraveled. Further investigation suggests that the disappeared CO adsorption ability originates from the unique electronic interaction after forming SMSI.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial to modulating the nature of metal species, yet the SMSI behaviors of sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters remain unknown due to the difficulties in constructing SMSI at cluster scale. Herein, we achieve the successful construction of the SMSI between Pt clusters and amorphous TiO2 nanosheets by vacuum annealing, which requires a relatively low temperature that avoids the aggregation of small clusters. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy observation is employed to explore the SMSI behaviors, and the results reveal the dynamic rearrangement of Pt atoms upon annealing for the first time. The originally disordered Pt atoms become ordered as the crystallizing of the amorphous TiO2 support, forming an epitaxial interface between Pt and TiO2. Such a SMSI state can remain stable in oxidation environment even at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Further investigations prove that the electron transfer from TiO2 to Pt occupies the Pt 5d orbitals, which is responsible for the disappeared CO adsorption ability of Pt/TiO2 after forming SMSI. This work not only opens a new avenue for constructing SMSI at cluster scale but also provides in&#8208;depth understanding on the unique SMSI behavior, which would stimulate the development of supported metal clusters for catalysis applications.

         <title>Suppressed Dissolution of Fluorine&#8208;Rich SEI Enables Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode for Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;rich SEI dissolution is a major cause of zinc anode failure. The SEI content fluctuates significantly during the plating/stripping process, resulting in an unstable electrode/electrolyte interface. A versatile functional electrolyte additive, thioether&#8208;TX was introduced to reduce solvent polarity, as a poor solvent molecule for F&#8722;. Additionally, TX could modulate the Zn2+ solvation structure and adsorb at the electrode/electrolyte interface to reduce the activity of local water, further suppressing the dissolution of ZnF2 and stabilizing the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer.







Abstract
The instability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is a critical challenge for the zinc metal anodes, leading to an erratic electrode/electrolyte interface and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ultimately resulting in anode failure. This study uncovers that the fluorine species dissolution is the root cause of SEI instability. To effectively suppress the F&#8722; dissolution, an introduction of a low&#8208;polarity molecule, 1,4&#8208;thioxane (TX), is proposed, which reinforces the stability of the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI. Moreover, the TX molecule has a strong affinity for coordinating with Zn2+ and adsorbing at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby diminishing the activity of local water and consequently impeding SEI dissolution. The robust fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer promotes the high durability of the zinc anode in repeated plating/stripping cycles, while concurrently suppressing HER and enhancing Coulombic efficiency. Notably, the symmetric cell with TX demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, sustaining over 500&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Zn||KVOH full cell exhibits excellent capacity retention, averaging 6.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 98&#8201;% retention after 400&#8197;cycles, even at high loading with a lean electrolyte. This work offers a novel perspective on SEI dissolution as a key factor in anode failure, providing valuable insights for the electrolyte design in energy storage devices.

         <title>Rational Design of the Spatial Effect in a Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Reverses the Regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation in Aliphatic Amino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
This study addressed the challenge of regioselectivity for remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond hydroxylation. A Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase (BlAH) was mined with a promiscuous hydroxylation for aliphatic amino acids. The regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond hydroxylation could be regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. As a proof of concept, the spatial effect of BlAH was redesigned and reversed the regioselectivity from the &#947; to the &#948; site.







Abstract
The hydroxylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aliphatic amino acids yields crucial precursors for the synthesis of high&#8208;value compounds. However, accurate regulation of the regioselectivity of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds hydroxylation in aliphatic amino acids continues to be a common challenge in chemosynthesis and biosynthesis. In this study, the Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BlAH) was mined and found to catalyze hydroxylation at the &#947; and &#948; sites of aliphatic amino acids. Crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations revealed that regioselectivity was regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. Based on these results, the spatial effect of BlAH was reconstructed to stabilize the transition state at the &#948; site of aliphatic amino acids, thereby successfully reversing the &#947; site regioselectivity to the &#948; site. For example, the regioselectivity of L&#8208;Homoleucine (5&#8201;a) was reversed from the &#947; site (1&#8201;:&#8201;12) to the &#948; site (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The present study not only expands the toolbox of biocatalysts for the regioselective functionalization of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, but also provides a theoretical guidance for the precision&#8208;driven modification of similarly remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in complex molecules.

         <title>Concomitant Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermy and Photoluminescence of Rod&#8208;Shaped Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 Synthesized Concurrently</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two rod&#8208;shaped Au52(PET)32&#8208;G and Au66(PET)38 are synthesized and precisely characterized. Basing on the unreported transverse growth mode from Au52(PET)32&#8208;G to Au66(PET)38, six novel nanoclusters are predicted. Although the two nanoclusters have different aspect ratios and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light collection abilities, they have concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under NIR irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance.







Abstract
Gold nanoclusters exhibiting concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation are rarely reported, and some fundamental issues remain unresolved for such materials. Herein, we concurrently synthesized two novel rod&#8208;shaped Au nanoclusters, Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate), and precisely revealed that their kernels were 4 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 and 5 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structures, respectively, based on the numbers of Au layers in the [100], [010], and [001] directions. Following the structural growth mode from Au52(PET)32 to Au66(PET)38, we predicted six more novel nanoclusters. The concurrent synthesis provides rational comparison of the two nanoclusters on the stability, absorption, emission and photothermy, and reveals the aspect ratio&#8208;related properties. An interesting finding is that the two nanoclusters exhibit concomitant PT and PL under 785&#8197;nm light irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance, which was explained by the qualitative evaluation of the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates. The ligand effects on PT and PL were also investigated.

&lt;p&gt;Gold nanoclusters exhibiting concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation are rarely reported, and some fundamental issues remain unresolved for such materials. Herein, we concurrently synthesized two novel rod-shaped Au nanoclusters, Au&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;(PET)&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; and Au&lt;sub&gt;66&lt;/sub&gt;(PET)&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt; (PET = 2-phenylethanethiolate), and precisely revealed that their kernels were 4 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 and 5 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 face-centered cubic (fcc) structures, respectively, based on the numbers of Au layers in the [100], [010], and [001] directions. Following the structural growth mode from Au&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;(PET)&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; to Au&lt;sub&gt;66&lt;/sub&gt;(PET)&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;, we predicted six more novel nanoclusters. The concurrent synthesis provides rational comparison of the two nanoclusters on the stability, absorption, emission and photothermy, and reveals the aspect ratio-related properties. An interesting finding is that the two nanoclusters exhibit concomitant PT and PL under 785&#8197;nm light irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance, which was explained by the qualitative evaluation of the radiative and non-radiative rates. The ligand effects on PT and PL were also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Giant Third&#8208;Order Optical Nonlinearity in (MA)2CuX4 through Introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(MA)2CuX4 (MA=methylammonium; X=Cl, Br) leads to giant nonlinear absorption coefficients and substantial modulation depth. These performance improvements are correlated with the specific alignment of metal d bands and ligand p band in the Mott&#8208;Hubbard compound, and a larger p&#8208;d transition probability to d&#8208;d transition probability associated with the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion.







Abstract
Nonlinear absorption coefficient and modulation depth stand as pivotal properties of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, while the existing NLO materials exhibit limitations such as low nonlinear absorption coefficients and/or small modulation depths, thereby severely impeding their practical application. Here we unveil that introducing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion in a Mott&#8208;Hubbard system, (MA)2CuX4 (MA=methylammonium; X=Cl, Br) affords the simultaneous attainment of a giant nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth. The optimized compound, (MA)2CuCl4, demonstrates a nonlinear absorption coefficient of (1.5&#177;0.08)&#215;105&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1, a modulation depth of 60&#8201;%, and a relatively low optical limiting threshold of 1.22&#215;10&#8722;5&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These outstanding attributes surpass those of most reported NLO materials. Our investigation reveals that a more pronounced distortion of the [CuX6]4&#8722; octahedron emerges as a crucial factor in augmenting optical nonlinearity. Mechanism study involving structural and spectral characterization along with theoretical calculations indicates a correlation between the compelling performance and the Mott&#8208;Hubbard band structure of the materials, coupled with the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion&#8208;induced d&#8208;d transition. This study not only introduces a promising category of high&#8208;performance NLO materials but also provides novel insights into enhancing the performance of such materials.

         <title>Controlling Tin Halide Perovskite Oxidation Dynamics in Solution for Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based perovskites hold promise for solar cell and LED applications, but suffer from inherent oxidation issues with the ubiquitous DMSO solvent. NMR spectroscopy reveals SnI2 oxidation kinetics, suggesting water involvement and HI generation. Processing at 60&#8201;&#176;C suppresses the Sn oxidation, improving film quality and PeLEDs. This low&#8208;temperature protocol promises oxidation&#8208;free Sn perovskites, shaping future device fabrication.







Abstract
As a leading contender to replace lead halide perovskites, tin&#8208;based perovskites have demonstrated ever increasing performance in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). They tend to be processed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, which has been identified as a major contributor to the Sn(II) oxidation during film fabrication, posing a challenge to the further improvement of Sn&#8208;based perovskites. Herein, we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of the oxidation of SnI2, revealing that autoamplification takes place, accelerating the oxidation as the reaction progresses. We propose a mechanism consistent with these observations involving water participation and HI generation. Building upon these insights, we have developed low&#8208;temperature Sn&#8208;based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) processed at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving enhanced external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). Our research underscores the substantial potential of low&#8208;temperature DMSO solvent processes and DMSO&#8208;free solvent systems for fabricating oxidation&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based perovskites, shaping the future direction in processing Sn&#8208;containing perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Amorphous FeSnOx Nanosheets with Hierarchical Vacancies for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous 2D nanosheets with abundant nano&#8208;sized perforations and oxygen vancancies, mixed with a small amount of monolayer MXene, are coated on PP separators. This simultaneously regulates uniform Na deposition, facilitates the kinetics of polysulfides conversion, and enhances the mechanical properties.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries, noted for their low material costs and high energy density, are emerging as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in various applications including power grids and standalone renewable energy systems. These batteries are commonly assembled with glass fiber membranes, which face significant challenges like the dissolution of polysulfides, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and the growth of Na dendrites. Here, we develop an amorphous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) iron tin oxide (A&#8208;FeSnOx) nanosheet with hierarchical vacancies, including abundant oxygen vacancies (Ovs) and nano&#8208;sized perforations, that can be assembled into a multifunctional layer overlaying commercial separators for RT Na&#8722;S batteries. The Ovs offer strong adsorption and abundant catalytic sites for polysulfides, while the defect concentration is finely tuned to elucidate the polysulfides conversion mechanisms. The nano&#8208;sized perforations aid in regulating Na ions transport, resulting in uniform Na deposition. Moreover, the strategic addition of trace amounts of Ti3C2 (MXene) forms an amorphous/crystalline (A/C) interface that significantly improves the mechanical properties of the separator and suppresses dendrite growth. As a result, the task&#8208;specific layer achieves ultra&#8208;light (~0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), ultra&#8208;thin (~200&#8197;nm), and ultra&#8208;robust (modulus=4.9&#8197;GPa) characteristics. Consequently, the RT Na&#8722;S battery maintained a high capacity of 610.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>Utilizing &#8220;Latent&#8221; Carbon: Repositioning Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Synthons and Assemblies via Halogen Bonding to &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding to &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon sites&#8212;unsubstituted carbon sites that are traditionally seen as dead&#8208;ends in hydrogen&#8208;bonded crystal engineering&#8212;has been used to direct the solid&#8208;state arrangement of discrete and extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded substructures based on acid&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and phenol&#8208;based homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;synthons, thereby generating higher&#8208;order molecular solids.







Abstract
Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Triphenylamine[3]arenes: Streamlining Synthesis of a Versatile Macrocyclic Platform for Supramolecular Architectures and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of triphenylamine[3]arenes using triphenylamine derivatized monomers via a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with paraformaldehyde is presented. These three&#8208;fold symmetric macrocycles, featuring alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, exhibit versatile properties in luminescence and iodine adsorption, and serve as building blocks for extended frameworks and molecular cages.







Abstract
Triphenylamine[3]arenes (TPA[3]s), featuring [16]paracyclophane backbone with alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, were synthesized through a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction using triphenylamine derivatized monomers and paraformaldehyde. This molecular design yielded a series of TPA[3] macrocycles with high efficiency, with their facile derivatizations also successfully demonstrated. On account of the strong electron&#8208;donating properties of the TPA moieties, these TPA[3]s exhibit remarkable delayed fluorescence, and possess a significant affinity for iodine. Furthermore, their inherent three&#8208;fold symmetry rendered TPA[3]s as novel building blocks for the construction of extended frameworks and molecular cages. This advancement expands the versatility of discrete macrocycles into complex architectures, enhancing their applicability across a broad spectrum of applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent and Covalent Binding of New Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;like Polyoxidovanadate Clusters to Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In NaCl solutions and in the presence of lysozyme, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] undergoes ligand exchange, partial oxidation of VIV to VV producing unexpected mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates with composition [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722;, which bind covalently and non&#8208;covalently to the protein surface.







Abstract
The high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures of the model protein lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] from crystals grown in 1.1&#8197;M NaCl, 0.1&#8197;M sodium acetate at pH&#8197;4.0 reveal the binding to the protein of different and unexpected mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, which non&#8208;covalently interacts with the lysozyme surface, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722; (this latter based on an unusual {V18O43} cage) which covalently bind the protein. EPR spectroscopy confirms the partial oxidation of VIV to VV and the formation of mixed&#8208;valence species. The results indicate that the interaction with proteins can stabilize the structure of unexpected &#8211; both for dimension and architecture &#8211; POVs, not observed in aqueous solution.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low selectivity is a key scientific challenge that hinders the commercialization of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In their Research Article (&lt;url href=&#8220;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202407287&#8221;&gt;e202407287), Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu et&#8197;al. found that the CH4 selectivity of p&#8208;block Bi element exhibits a &#8220;volcanic&#8221; structure&#8208;function relationship when gradually decreasing the p&#8208;band center. This CH4 selectivity of Bi element is also positively correlated with the adsorption energy of key intermediate *CHO and the photoexcited carriers separation efficiency.

         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;free, dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized and used as a hydrocarbon polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cells, as reported by Il&#8197;Seok Chae, Jong&#8197;Hak Kim et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202406796). The unique structure of the polymer chains led to the alignment of phase&#8208;separated domains and continuous proton channels were constructed throughout the membrane. This enabled efficient proton transport and ensured stable performance. A novel design of polymer structure demonstrates a promising prospect for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

         <title>Cover Picture: Symmetric Electron Transfer Coordinates are Intrinsic to Bridged Systems: an ab initio Treatment of the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In mixed&#8208;valent systems, an anti&#8208;symmetric motion leads to electron localisation on or electron transfer between the redox centers. In their Research Article (e202404727), Adam &#352;rut, Benjamin&#8197;J. Lear, Vera Krewald show that additionally, a symmetric motion is present in bridged systems: it is responsible for the characteristic shape of the inter&#8208;valence charge transfer band. The close relationship between the two motions is represented by one surface being the shadow of the other.

In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202404727"&gt;e202404727&lt;/a&gt;), Adam &#352;rut, Benjamin&#8197;J. Lear, Vera Krewald show that additionally, a symmetric motion is present in bridged systems: it is responsible for the characteristic shape of the inter-valence charge transfer band. The close relationship between the two motions is represented by one surface being the shadow of the other.

Built&#8208;in protection: A 1&#8208;step synthesis of supported metal phosphides from cheap precursors is described in the Research Article by Constanze&#8197;N. Neumann (e202404292). The approach delivers Ni2P/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 containing surface ligands that protect the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst from air oxidation. Facile displacement of the surface&#8208;bound phenyl phosphates by substrate molecules gives rise to catalytic activity on par with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst.

         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskite featuring a considerable piezochromic range of 232 nm is reported by Guanjun Xiao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406015). The cover picture describes an intriguing pressure&#8208;induced piezochromic behavior in typical Cs3Cu2Cl5 nanocrystals by using diamond anvil cell. The emission energy shifted from the lowest&#8208;energy red fluorescence (1.85&#8197;eV) to the highest&#8208;energy blue fluorescence (2.83&#8197;eV), covering almost the entire visible wavelength range, thus providing a promising naked&#8208;eye visual pressure monitoring and sensing &#8220;chameleon&#8221;.

         <title>Asymmetric Paired Electrolysis: Enantioselective Alkylation of Sulfonylimines via C(sp3)&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective transformation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds into three&#8208;dimensional chiral scaffolds is of longstanding interest to synthetic chemists. Herein, an asymmetric paired electrolysis enables a highly efficient and sustainable approach to the enantioselective alkylation of sulfonylimines via C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization. In this protocol, anodic oxidation for benzylic radical formation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylimine reduction on the cathode were seamlessly cross&#8208;coupled (up to 88% yield). Enantioenriched chiral amines containing a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter are accessed with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). Mechanistic studies suggest that the amine generated in situ could serve as a base to deprotonate phenols and decrease the oxidation potential of the reaction, allowing phenols with lower potentials to be preferentially oxidized.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus heterostructures consisting of multiple jointed components with distinct properties have gained growing interest in the photoredox catalytic field. Herein, we have developed a facile low&#8208;temperature method to gain anisotropic one&#8208;dimensional Au&#8208;tipped CdS (Au&#8208;CdS) nanorods (NRs), followed by assembling Ru molecular co&#8208;catalyst (RuN5) onto the surface of the NRs. The CdS NRs decorated with plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) and RuN5 complex harness the virtues of metal&#8208;semiconductor and inorganic&#8208;organic interface, giving directional charge transfer channels, spatially separated reaction sites, and enhanced local electric field distribution. As a result, the Au&#8208;CdS&#8208;RuN5 can act as an efficient dual&#8208;function photocatalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and valorization of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols. Benefiting from the interfacial charge decoupling and selective chemical bond activation, the optimal all&#8208;in&#8208;one Au&#8208;CdS&#8208;RuN5 heterostructure shows greatly enhanced photoactivity and selectivity as compared to bare CdS NRs, along with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 40.2% at 400 nm. The structural evolution and working mechanism of the heterostructures are systematically analyzed based on experimental and computational results.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom 3d Transition Metals on SnO2 as Model Cell for Conversion Mechanism: Revealing Thermodynamic Catalytic Effects on Enhanced Na Storage of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery in 2000, conversion&#8208;type materials have emerged as a promising negative&#8208;electrode candidate for next&#8208;generation batteries with high capacity and tunable voltage, limited by low reversibility and severe voltage hysteresis. Heterogeneous construction stands out as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient approach to reducing reaction barriers and enhancing energy density. However, the second term introduced by conventional heterostructure inevitably complicates the electrochemical analysis and poses great challenges to harvesting systematic insights and theoretical guidance. A model cell is designed and established herein for the conversion reactions between Na and TMSA&#8208;SnO2, where TMSA&#8208;SnO2 represents single atom modification of eight different 3d transition elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn). Such a model unit fundamentally eliminates the interference from the second phase and thus enables independent exploration of activation manifestations of the heterogeneous architecture. For the first time, a thermodynamically dependent catalytic effect is proposed and verified through statistical data analysis. The mechanism behind the unveiled catalytic effect is further elucidated by which the active d orbitals of transition metals weaken the surface covalent bonds and lower the reaction barriers. This research provides both theoretical insights and practical demonstrations of the advanced heterogeneous electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#160;Engineering Regulation Achieving&#160;Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization in Rare&#8208;Earth Hybrid Double Perovskites for Ferroelectrics and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is&#160;a highly desired&#160;property of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics for&#160;application in&#160;vertical&#160;sandwich&#8208;type&#160;photoferroelectric devices, especially in ultrathin&#160;ferroelectronic devices. Nevertheless, despite&#160;great advances&#160;that have been made&#160;in recent years, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization remains unrealized&#160;in the 2D hybrid double perovskite&#160;ferroelectric&#160;family. Here, from our&#160;previous work 2D hybrid double perovskite&#160;HQERN&#160;((S3HQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3HQ = S&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium), we designed a molecular strategy of F&#8208;substitution&#160;on organic component to successfully obtain&#160;FQERN ((S3FQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3FQ = S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoroquinuclidinium)&#160;showing&#160;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis&#160;ferroelectric&#160;HQERN,&#160;FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity&#160;and&#160;ferroelasticity but also realizes&#160;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization&#160;and&#160;a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of&#160;94 K.&#160;This is mainly due to the introduction of F&#8208;substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy.&#160;Our study demonstrates&#160;that F&#8208;substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving&#160;more possibility&#160;of 2D ferroelectric materials&#160;for applications in micro&#8208;nano&#160;optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Superior Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been proposed to break the limitation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the synergistic activation of multiple molecules and intermediates, offering an additional degree of freedom for catalytic regulation. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize DACs with high uniformity, atomic accuracy, and satisfactory loadings.  Herein, we report a facile cascade synthetic strategy for DAC via precise electrostatic interaction control and neighboring vacancy construction. We synthesized well&#8208;defined, uniformly dispersed dual Fe sites which were connected by two nitrogen bonds (denoted as Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe). The as&#8208;synthesized DAC exhibited superior catalytic performances towards oxygen reduction reaction, including good half&#8208;wave potential (0.91 V), high kinetic current density (21.66 mA cm&#8208;2), and perfect durability. Theoretical calculation revealed that the DAC structure effectively tunes the oxygen adsorption configuration and decreases the cleavage barrier, thereby improving the catalytic kinetics. The DAC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibited impressive power densities of 169.8 and 52.18 mW cm&#8208;2 at 25 oC and &#8208;40 oC, which is 1.7 and 2.0 times higher than those based on Pt/C+Ir/C, respectively. We also demonstrated the universality of our strategy in synthesizing other M&#8208;N2&#8208;M DACs (M= Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Au), facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover Mechanism at the Metal&#8211;Metal Interface in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen spillover in metal&#8208;supported catalysts can largely enhance electrocatalytic hydrogenation performance and reduce energy consumption. However, its fundamental mechanism, especially at the metal&#8211;metal interface, remains further explored, impeding relevant catalyst design. Here, we theoretically profile that a large free energy difference in hydrogen adsorption on two different metals (|&#916;GH&#8208;metal(i) &#8722; &#916;GH&#8208;metal(ii)|) induces a high kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover between the metals. Minimizing the difference in their d&#8208;band centers (&#916;&#949;d) should reduce |&#916;GH&#8208;metal(i) &#8722; &#916;GH&#8208;metal(ii)|, lowering the kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover for improved electrocatalytic hydrogenation. We demonstrated this concept using copper&#8208;supported ruthenium&#8211;platinum alloys with the smallest &#916;&#949;d, which delivered record high electrocatalytic nitrate hydrogenation performance, with ammonia production rate of 3.45&#177;0.12 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faraday efficiency of 99.8&#177;0.2 %, at low energy consumption of 21.4 kWh kgamm&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we further achieve continuous ammonia and formic acid production with a record high&#8208;profit space.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modified Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis Reaction for Selective Alkylation of Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of nucleophiles is among the most fundamental and well&#8208;developed transformations in chemistry. However, to achieve selective alkylation of complex substrates remains a nontrivial task. We report herein a general and selective alkylation method without using strong acids, bases, or metals. In this method, the readily available phosphinites/phosphites, in combination with ethyl acrylate, function as effective alkylating agents. Various nucleophilic groups, including alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, imides, and thiols can be alkylated. This method can be applied in the late&#8208;stage alkylation of natural products and pharmaceutical agents, achieving chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective modification of complex substrates. Experimental studies indicate the relative reactivity of a nucleophile depends on its acidity and its steric environment. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction pathway resembles that of the Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Path&#8208;Independent All&#8208;Visible Orthogonal Photoswitching for Applications in Multi&#8208;Photochromic Polymers and Molecular Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic molecular photoswitches have taken center stage as high&#8208;precision tools to introduce light&#8208;responsiveness at the smallest scales. Today they are found in all areas of applied chemistry, covering materials research, chemical biology, catalysis, or nanotechnology. For a next step of applicability truly orthogonal photoswitching is highly desirable but to date such independent addressability of different photoswitches remains to be highly challenging. In this work we present the first example of all&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path independent orthogonal photoswitching. By combining two recently developed indigoid photoswitches &#8208;&#160;peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based chromophore &#8208; a four&#8208;state system is established and each state can be accessed in high yields completely independently and also with visible light irradiation only. The four states give rise to four different colors, which can be transferred to a solid polymer matrix yielding a versatile multi&#8208;state photochromic material. Further, combination with a fluorescent dye as third component is possible, demonstrating applicability of this orthogonal photoswitching system in all&#8208;photonic molecular logic behavior and information processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Bias in Molecular Photogearing Evidenced by LED&#8208;Coupled Chiral Cryo&#8208;HPLC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular gearing systems are technomimetic nanoscale analogues to complex geared machinery in the macroscopic world and are likewise defined as systems incorporating intermeshed elements which perform correlated rotational motions by mechanical engagement. Only recently, new methods to actively drive molecular gearing motions instead of relying on passive thermal activation have been developed. Further progress in this endeavor will pave the way for unidirectional molecular gearing devices with a distinct type of molecular machine awaiting its realization. Within this work an essential step towards this goal is achieved by evidencing directional biases for the light&#8208;induced rotations in molecular photogear system 1. Using a custom&#8208;designed LED&#8208;coupled chiral cryo&#8208;HPLC setup for the in&#8208;situ irradiation of enantiomeric analytes, an intrinsic selectivity for clockwise or counterclockwise rotations was elucidated experimentally. Significant directional biases in the photogearing processes and light&#8208;induced single bond rotations (SBRs) are observed for photogear 1 with directional preferences of up to 4.8:1. Harnessing these effects will allow to rationally design and construct a fully directional molecular gearing motor in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Global Aromaticity of Aza&#8208;Superbenzene and Aza&#8208;Supernaphthalene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or macrocycles usually display localized aromaticity. On the other hand, incorporation of quinoidal units into the skeleton could lead to effective electron delocalization and global (anti)aromaticity. In this work, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle 1 and bismacrocycle 2 containing both para&#8208;quinodimethane and triphenylamine units are efficiently synthesized mainly through intermolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction. They can be considered as a tetraazasuperbenzene and a hexaazasupernaphthalene, respectively, due to their similar geometry and electronic structures to the benzene and naphthalene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses reveal a largely planar geometry for both 1 and 2 and variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclose slow dynamic processes owing to restricted ring flipping of the phenyl rings. 1 and 2 can be easily oxidized into higher&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state species. NMR and theoretical calculations indicate that 12+ and 14+ show global anti&#8208;aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway, while for the bismacrocycle 2, its dication 22+, tetracation 24+ and hexacation 26+exhibit global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity with a 54&#960;, 52&#960; and 50&#960; conjugation pathway along the outermost backbone, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon violet/blue irradiation to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.</dc:description>

         <title>Pomotrelvir and Nirmatrelvir Binding and

Reactivity with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease: Implications for Resistance Mechanisms from Computations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate the inhibition mechanism between pomotrelvir and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics simulations. Alchemical transformations where each Pi group of pomotrelvir was transformed into its counterpart in nirmatrelvir were performed to unravel the individual contribution of each group to the binding and reaction processes. We have shown that while a &#947;&#8208;lactam ring is preferred at position P1, a &#948;&#8208;lactam ring is a reasonable alternative. For the P2 position, tertiary amines are preferred with respect to secondary amines. Flexible side chains at P2 position can disrupt the preorganization of the active site, favouring the exploration of non&#8208;reactive conformations. The substitution of the P2 group of pomotrelvir by that of nirmatrelvir resulted in a compound, named as C2, that presents better binding free energy and a higher population of reactive conformations in the Michaelis complex. Analysis of the chemical reaction to form the covalent complex has shown a similar reaction mechanism and activation free energies for pomotrelvir, nirmatrelvir and C2. We hope that these findings could be useful to design better inhibitors to fight present and future variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of Charge Transport and Mass Deprivation in Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Kinetically&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries with admirable electrochemical performance below &#8208;20 &#176;C are desired but are hindered by sluggish interfacial charge transport and desolvation process. Li salt dissociation via Li+&#8208;solvent interaction enables mobile Li+ liberation and contributes to bulk ion transport, while is contradictory to fast interfacial desolvation. Designing kinetically&#8208;stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) without compromising strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction is expected to compatibly improve interfacial charge transport and desolvation kinetics. However, the relationship between physicochemical features and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics properties of SEI remains vague. Herein, we propose four key thermodynamics parameters of SEI potentially influencing low&#8208;temperature electrochemistry, including electron work function, Li+ transfer barrier, surface energy, and desolvation energy. Based on the above parameters, we further define a novel descriptor, separation factor of SEI (SSEI), to quantitatively depict charge (Li+/e&#8208;) transport and solvent deprivation processes at Gr/electrolyte interface. A Li3PO4&#8208;based, inorganics&#8208;enriched SEI derived by Li difluorophosphate (LiDFP) additive exhibits the highest SSEI (4.89&#215;103) to enable efficient Li+ conduction, e&#8208; blocking and rapid desolvation, and as a result, much suppressed Li&#8208;metal precipitation, electrolyte decomposition and Gr sheets exfoliation, thus improving low&#8208;temperature battery performances. Overall, our work originally provides visualized guides to improve low&#8208;temperature reaction kinetics/thermodynamics by constructing desirable SEI chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonic Anhydrase Variants Catalyze the Reduction of Dialkyl Ketones with High Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction between two achiral molecules &#8211; water and carbon dioxide &#8211; to yield the achiral product carbonic acid through a zinc hydroxide intermediate. We have previously shown that a zinc hydride, instead of a hydroxide, can be generated in this enzyme to create a catalyst for the reduction of aryl ketones. Dialkyl ketones are more challenging to reduce, and the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with two alkyl groups that are similar in size and electronic properties, is a particularly challenging transformation to achieve with high activity and selectivity. Here, we show that hCAII, as well as a double variant of it, catalyzes the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with high yields and enantioselectivities, even when the two alkyl groups are similar in size. We also show that variants of hCAII catalyze the site&#8208;selective reduction of one ketone over the other in an unsymmetrical aliphatic diketone. Computational docking of a dialkyl ketone to the double variant containing the zinc hydride provides insights into the origins of the reactivity of various substrates and the high enantioselectivity of the transformations and show how a confined environment can control the enantioselectivity of an abiological intermediate</dc:description>

         <title>Unconventional hcp/fcc Nickel Heteronanocrystal with Asymmetric Convex Sites Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing non&#8208;platinum group metal catalysts for the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for alkaline fuel cells. To date, Ni&#8208;based materials are the most promising candidates but still suffer from insufficient performance. Herein, we report an unconventional hcp/fcc Ni (u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni) heteronanocrystal with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating rugged surfaces with plenty of asymmetric convex sites. Systematic analyses discover that such convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy, circumventing the over&#8208;strong *H adsorption on traditional hollow positions, and simultaneously stabilizing interfacial *H2O. It thus synergistically optimizes the HOR thermodynamic process as well as reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step. Consequently, the developed u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni exhibits the top&#8208;rank alkaline HOR activity with a mass activity of 40.6 mA mgNi&#8208;1 (6.3 times higher than fcc Ni control) together with superior stability and high CO&#8208;tolerance. These results provide a paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by shifting the adsorption state of intermediates through configuring surface sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatioselective Occlusion of Copolymer Nanoparticles within Calcite Crystals Generates Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials with Controlled Internal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient occlusion of particulate additives into a single crystal has garnered an ever&#8208;increasing attention in materials science because it offers a counter&#8208;intuitive yet powerful platform to make crystalline nanocomposite materials with emerging properties. However, precisely controlling the spatial distribution of the guest additives within a host crystal remains highly challenging. We herein demonstrate a unique, straightforward method to engineer the spatial distribution of copolymer nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3) single crystals by judiciously adjusting initial [Ca2+] concentration used for the calcite precipitation. More specifically, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is employed to synthesize well&#8208;defined and highly anionic poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium)41&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)500 [PSPMA41&#8208;PBzMA500] diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which are subsequently used as model additives during the growth of calcite crystals. Impressively, such guest nanoparticles are preferentially occluded into specific regions of calcite depending on the initial [Ca2+] concentration. These unprecedented phenomena are most probably caused by dynamic change in electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ ions and PSPMA41 chains based on systematic investigations. This study not only showcases a significant advancement in controlling the spatial distribution of guest nanoparticles within host crystals, enabling the internal structure of composite crystals to be rationally tailored via a spatioselective occlusion strategy, but also provides new insights into biomineralization.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Manipulation of Electron Transfers in Clustered Five Redox Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are the origin of their unique functionalities both in natural and artificial systems. However, electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are generally complicated, and predicting and controlling these electron transfers is extremely difficult. Herein, we report the precise manipulation of the electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes. The development of a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of pentanuclear metal complexes which composed of metal ions and 3,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) as a platform to probe the phenomena. Electrochemical and spectroscopic investigations clarified overall picture of the electron transfers in the pentanuclear complexes. In addition, unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers. Our results provide comprehensive guidelines for interpreting the complicated electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Realization of Long&#8208;Life Proton Battery by Layer Intercalatable Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton batteries have attracted increasing interests because of their potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage with high safety and great low&#8208;temperature performances. However, their development is significantly retarded by electrolyte design due to free water corrosion. Herein, we report a layer intercalatable electrolyte (LIE) by introducing trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into traditional acidic electrolyte. Different from conventional role in batteries, the presence of TMP intriguingly achieves co&#8208;intercalation of solvent molecules into the interlayer of anode materials, enabling a new working mechanism for proton reactions. The electrode corrosion was also strongly retarded with expanded electrochemical stability window. The half&#8208;cell therefore showed an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability with 91.0% capacity retention at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled full batteries can even deliver an ultra&#8208;long lifetime with a capacity retention of 74.9% for 2 months running at &#8208;20 &#176;C. This work provides new opportunities for electrolyte design of aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Chemistry Modulation Enabled Environmental Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc Batteries: The Case of Carbonate Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic chemistry modulation represents a promising avenue to enhance the electrochemical performance and unlock versatile applications in cutting&#8208;edge energy storage devices. Herein, we propose a methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property. The elaborately designed batteries with an air&#8208;switch demonstrate rapid self&#8208;recharging capabilities, recovering over 80% of the electrochemical full charging capacity within a remarkably short timeframe of 1 hour and achieving a cumulative self&#8208;charging capacity of 5 Ah g&#8208;1. The aqueous self&#8208;charging battery strategy induced by carbonate anion, as proposed in this study, holds the potential for extending to various anionic systems, including seawater&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion batteries. This work offers a universal framework for advancing next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;functional power sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Organolanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets with Heterocyclic Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide (Ln) based mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) provide probably the finest ligand regulation model for magnetic property. Recently, the development of such SMMs has witnessed a fast transition from coordination to organometallic complexes because the latter provides a fertile, yet not fully excavated soil for the development of SMMs. Especially those SMMs with heterocyclic ligands have shown the potential to reach higher blocking temperature. In this minireview, we give an overview of the design principle of SMMs and highlight those &#8220;shining stars&#8221; of heterocyclic organolanthanide SMMs based on the ring sizes of ligands, analysing how the electronic structures of those ligands and the stiffness of subsequently formed molecules affect the dynamic magnetism of SMMs. Finally, we envisaged the future development of heterocyclic Ln&#8208;SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Catalysis of Encapsulated Pt Nanoparticles by Pore Wall Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) have shown significant promise in heterogeneous catalysis, precise control over their interaction with the support, which profoundly impacts their catalytic performance, remains a significant challenge. In this study, Pt NPs are incorporated into thioether&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (denoted COF&#8208;Sx), enabling precise control over the size and electronic state of Pt NPs by adjusting the thioether density dangling on the COF pore walls. Notably, the resulting Pt@COF&#8208;Sx demonstrate exceptional selectivity (&gt;99%) in catalytic hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene to p&#8208;chloroaniline, in sharp contrast to the poor selectivity of Pt NPs embedded in thioether&#8208;free COFs. Furthermore, the conversion over Pt@COF&#8208;Sx exhibits a volcano&#8208;type curve as the thioether density increases, due to the corresponding change of accessible Pt sites. This work provides an effective approach to regulating the catalysis of metal NPs via their microenvironment modulation, with the aid of rational design and precise tailoring of support structure.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Photoactive H&#8208;Bonding EDA Complex Model Drives the Selective Hydrothiolation and Hydroxysulfenylation of Carbonyl Activated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excitation of   photoactive electron donor&#8722;acceptor (EDA) complexes to generate radical is a promising approach in radical chemistry. In this study, we introduce a new model of H&#8208;bonding EDA complexes for the selective hydrothiolation and hydroxysulfenylation of carbonyl&#8208;activated alkenes with diverse thiols under visible light conditions. The reliability of this H&#8208;bonding EDA complex model has been confirmed by meticulous experimental and theoretical calculations. Mechanistic investigations have revealed the significant influence of the solvent in determining whether the excitation of photoactive H&#8208;bonding EDA complex leads to charge transfer (CT) or energy&#8208;charge transfer (En&#8208;CT), thereby controlling Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. Notably, the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analysis clearly shows that the excited state of the C&#65309;O&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;H&#8208;S EDA complex involves closed&#8208;shell partially covalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen, Chalcogen, Pnictogen, and Tetrel Bonding in Non&#8208;Covalent Organocatalysis: An Update</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments on the use of non&#8208;transient non&#8208;covalent interactions based on elements of groups 14&#8211;17 in organic synthesis and organocatalysis are discussed. While halogen and chalcogen bonding are now clearly established in this area, applications of pnictogen and particularly tetrel bonding are only starting to emerge.







Abstract
The use of noncovalent interactions based on electrophilic halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, or tetrel centers in organocatalysis has gained noticeable attention. Herein, we provide an overview on the most important developments in the last years with a clear focus on experimental studies and on catalysts which act via such non&#8208;transient interactions.

         <title>Accelerated Screening of Alternative DNA Base&#8208;Organic Molecule&#8208;Base Architectures via Integrated Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collaborative protocol of fast theoretical simulation and convenient experimental validation was developed for large&#8208;scale screening of alternative DNA base&#8208;organic molecule&#8208;base architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs, thereby expanding molecule&#8208;mediated non&#8208;classical DNA self&#8208;assembly structures.







Abstract
Organic molecule&#8208;mediated noncanonical DNA self&#8208;assembly expands the standard DNA base&#8208;pairing alphabets. However, only a very limited number of small molecules have been recognized as mediators because of the tedious and complicated experiments like crystallization and microscopy imaging. Here we present an integrative screening protocol incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) for fast theoretical simulation and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for convenient experimental validation. Melamine, the molecule that was confirmed mediating noncanonical DNA base&#8208;pairing, and 38 other candidate molecules were applied to demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol. We successfully identified seven stable noncanonical DNA duplex structures, and another eight novel structures with sub&#8208;stability. In addition, we discovered that hairpins at both ends can significantly stabilize the noncanonical DNA structures, providing a guideline to design small organic molecule&#8208;incorporated DNA structures. Such an efficient screening protocol will accelerate the design of alternative DNA&#8208;molecule architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. Considering the wide range of potential mediators, it will also facilitate applications such as noncovalent, highly dense loading of drug molecules in DNA&#8208;based delivery system and probe design for sensitive detection of certain molecules.

         <title>Chloride&#8208; and Hydrosulfide&#8208;Bound 2Fe Complexes as Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Stable State of [FeFe] Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the oxygen&#8208;stable state of the H&#8208;cluster are revealed. Terminal Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context, demonstrate a striking structural resemblance to the enzymatic Hinact state. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, and labile and kinetically controlled binding of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group.







Abstract
[FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of these enzymes to oxygen&#8208;induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen&#8208;production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen&#8208;stable (Hinact) state of the H&#8208;cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&#8722;/SH&#8722; ligation to the iron center bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t&#8208;Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the Hinact state of DdHydAB and CbA5H. The t&#8208;Cl/t&#8208;SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the Htrans and Hinact states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen&#8208;resistant nature of the Htrans and Hinact states. The swift reductive release of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O2&#8208;stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to the advancement of bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts and the integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H2&#8208;evolution devices and fuel&#8208;cell applications.

         <title>A Simple Organo&#8208;Electrocatalysis System for the Chlor&#8208;Related Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalyst has been applied in the field of electrochemistry. However, the large&#8208;scale production of the catalyst is hard to realize and the catalytic system nowadays is too complex to be applied in the practical production. This work first provides a highly efficient electro&#8208;organocatalyst for chloride ion oxidation both in acidic and neutral processes and cuts the cost down to 0.005&#8201;% compared with that of the dimensionally stable anode (DSA), providing an efficient choice for the chlor&#8208;related industry.







Abstract
Consuming a substantial quantum of energy (~165&#8197;TW&#8201;h), the chlor&#8208;alkali industry garners considerable scholarly and industrial interest, with the anode reaction involving the oxidation of chloride ions being a paramount determinant of reaction rates. While the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) displays commendable catalytic activity and longevity, they rely on precious metals and exhibit a non&#8208;negligible side reaction in sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) production, underscoring the appeal of metal&#8208;free alternatives. However, the molecules and systems currently available are characterized by intricate complexity and are not amenable to large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we have successfully developed an economical and highly efficient molecular catalyst, demonstrating superior performance compared with the former organic molecules in the chloride ion oxidation process (COP) for the production of both chlorine gas (Cl2) and NaClO. The molecule of 2N only needs 92&#8197;mV to reach a current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a small cost of only 0.002&#8197;$&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism underpinned by non&#8208;covalent interactions, serving as the foundation for an innovative approach to the design of efficient anodes for the COP.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dynamic Activation of Copper/Silicon Interface for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unprecedentedly reveals the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu/BSi interface during photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, which was validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by a light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. The adaptive junction is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.







Abstract
Numerous studies have shown a fact that phase transformation and/or reconstruction are likely to occur and play crucial roles in electrochemical scenarios. Nevertheless, a decisive factor behind the diverse photoelectrochemical activity and selectivity of various copper/silicon photoelectrodes is still largely debated and missing in the community, especially the possibly dynamic behaviors of metal catalyst/semiconductor interface. Herein, through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined facets on black p&#8208;type silicon (BSi) is unprecedentedly demonstrated to reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal&#8208;BSi interface during photoelectrocatalysis, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu&#8722;Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance for CO2 electroreduction, which efficiently restricts the C&#8722;C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products and an intriguing selectivity switch. This work offers new insights into dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction and design of highly efficient catalysts toward photosynthesis.

Herein, through in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well-defined facets on black p-type silicon (BSi) is unprecedentedly demonstrated to reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal-BSi interface during photoelectrocatalysis, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light-induced dynamic activation process. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu&#8722;Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction, which efficiently restricts the C&#8722;C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yield, resulting in a remarkable 16-fold improvement in the product ratio of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C2 products and an intriguing selectivity switch. This work offers new insights into dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction and design of highly efficient catalysts toward photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Isolation, and Reactivity Studies of &#8216;Naked&#8217; Acyclic Gallyl and Indyl Anions</title>

         <dc:description>
A tale of a &#8216;naked&#8217; acyclic gallyl and indyl compounds: By exploiting the electronic prowess of N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) groups, &#8242;naked&#8242; acyclic gallyl and indyl anions from [KGa{OB(NDippCH)2}2] and [KIn{OB(NDippCH)2}2] were obtained by K+ extraction, thereby resulting in the first O&#8208;ligated gallyl/indyl systems. The nucleophilicity of these trielyl species can be tuned by the presence of the K+ counterion.







Abstract
By exploiting the electronic capabilities of the N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligand, we have synthesized &#8220;naked&#8221; acyclic gallyl [Ga{OB(NDippCH)2}2]&#8722; and indyl [In{OB(NDippCH)2}2]&#8722; anions (as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;crypt)]+ salts) through K+ abstraction from [KGa{OB(NDippCH)2}2] and [KIn{OB(NDippCH)2}2] using 2.2.2&#8208;crypt. These systems represent the first O&#8208;ligated gallyl/indyl systems, are ultimately accessed from cyclopentadienyl GaI/InI precursors by substitution chemistry, and display nucleophilic reactivity which is strongly influenced by the presence (or otherwise) of the K+ counterion.

         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,n&#8208;remote aminoacetoxylation of cis&#8208;alkenes has been developed providing the acetoxylated lactams with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The sterically hindered pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) L3 is vital for the reaction. And the enantioenriched lactam products were proven to be good building blocks for the synthesis of azabicycles.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,n&#8208;remote aminoacetoxylation of cis&#8208;alkenes has been developed using PhI(OAc)2 as an oxidant, providing the acetoxylated lactams with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The sterically hindered pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) L3 with a tert&#8208;butyl group in oxazoline ring and propyl group in C6 position of pyridinyl is vital for the reaction, where the former is good for asymmetric aminopalladation step and the latter for the chain walking process. The enantioenriched lactam products were proven to be good building blocks for the synthesis of azabicycles.

         <title>Multifunctional Buffer Layer Engineering for Efficient and Stable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy incorporating AlOx deposited by controlled growth was developed to modulate the perovskite surface. The infiltrated Al3+ can suppress ion migration and phase separation, regulate the arrangement of energy levels, and passivate defects on the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. A monolithic perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cell achieved a PCE of 28.50&#8201;% with excellent photothermal stability.







Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are preferred for tandem applications due to their superior compatibility with diverse bottom solar cells. However, the solution processing and low formation energy of perovskites inevitably lead to numerous defects at both the bulk and interfaces. We report a facile and effective strategy for precisely modulating the perovskite by incorporating AlOx deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on the top interface. We find that Al3+ can not only infiltrate the bulk phase and interact with halide ions to suppress ion migration and phase separation but also regulate the arrangement of energy levels and passivate defects on the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Additionally, ALD&#8208;AlOx exhibits an encapsulation effect through a dense interlayer. Consequently, the ALD&#8208;AlOx treatment can significantly improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 21.80&#8201;% for 1.66 electron volt (eV) PSCs. A monolithic perovskite&#8208;silicon TSCs using AlOx&#8208;modified perovskite achieved a PCE of 28.5&#8201;% with excellent photothermal stability. More importantly, the resulting 1.55&#8197;eV PSC and module achieved a PCE of 25.08&#8201;% (0.04&#8197;cm2) and 21.01&#8201;% (aperture area of 15.5&#8197;cm2), respectively. Our study provides an effective way to efficient and stable wide&#8208;band gap perovskite for perovskite&#8208;silicon TSCs and paves the way for large&#8208;area inverted PSCs.

         <title>Modulating the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Interactions in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 into Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylene&#8208;linked MCOFs with continuously tunable D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A interactions by adjusting the structure of the monomer at the molecular level are synthesized for the first time. Benefiting from the unique moderate D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A interactions with suitable binding ability of intermediate, the obtained TMP&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance for CO2 to formate.







Abstract
Crystalline porous framework materials have attracted tremendous interest in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction owing to their ordered structures and high specific surface areas as well as rich designability, however, still suffer from a lack of accuracy in regulating the binding strength between the catalytic sites and intermediates, which is crucial for optimizing the electrocatalytic activity and expanding the product types. Herein, we report three new kinds of vinylene&#8208;linked metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (TMT&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF, TMP&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF and TMP&#8208;MCOF) with continuously tunable D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A interactions by adjusting the structure of the monomers at the molecular level for realizing efficient electroreduction of CO2 to formate for the first time. Interestingly, compared with TMT&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF and TMP&#8208;MCOF, the TMP&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF exhibited the highest HCOO&#8722; Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO&#8208;) of 95.6&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs RHE and displayed the FEHCOO&#8208; above 90&#8201;% at the voltage range of &#8722;1.0 to &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is one of the highest among various kinds of reported electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the catalytic sites in TMP&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF with unique moderate D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A interactions have suitable binding ability towards the reaction intermediate, which is beneficial for the formation of *HCOO and desorption of *HCOOH, thus effectively promoting the electroreduction of CO2 to formate.

         <title>Synthesis of Photoresponsive Fast Self&#8208;healing Polyolefin Composites by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Copolymerization of Ethylene and Lignin Cluster Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lignin cluster polymerization strategy (LCPS) prevents the poisoning of the &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalyst by polarmonomers or polar groups of lignin, and achieves efficient synthesis of polyolefin composites. This strategy enabled even dispersion of lignin, enhancing photothermal conversion and interfacial heat transfer between lignin and polymers, thereby accelerating self&#8208;healing speed.







Abstract
Polymers may suffer from sudden mechanical damages during long&#8208;term use under various harsh operating environments. Rapid and real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing will extend their service life, which is particularly attractive in the context of circular economy. In this work, a lignin cluster polymerization strategy (LCPS) was designed to prepare a series of lignin functionalized polyolefin composites with excellent mechanical properties through nickel catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene and lignin cluster monomers. These composites can achieve rapid self&#8208;healing within 30&#8197;seconds under a variety of extreme usage environments (underwater, seawater, extremely low temperatures as low as &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, organic solvents, acid/alkali solvents, etc.), which is of great significance for real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing of sudden mechanical damage. More importantly, the dynamic cross&#8208;linking network within these composites enable great re&#8208;processability and amazing sealing performances.

         <title>Modulating the Electrolyte Microenvironment in Electrical Double Layer for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy by mediating alkali metal cations in electrical double layer is proposed to enhance the nitrate reduction reaction performance. The activity, Faraday efficiency, selectivity, and yield of ammonia synthesis follow the increasing order Li+&lt;Cs+&lt;Na+&lt;K+, originating from the accelerated proton transport rate and improved activity of the rate&#8208;determining step (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) in K+&#8208;containing electrolyte.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to achieve remediation of nitrate&#8208;polluted wastewater and sustainable production of ammonia. However, it is still restricted by the low activity, selectivity and Faraday efficiency for ammonia synthesis. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to modulate the electrolyte microenvironment in electrical double layer (EDL) by mediating alkali metal cations in the electrolyte to enhance the NO3RR performance. Taking bulk Cu as a model catalyst, the experimental study reveals that the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 performance in different electrolytes follows the trend Li+&lt;Cs+&lt;Na+&lt;K+. Theoretical studies illustrate that the proton transport rate in NO3RR and the activity of the rate&#8208;determining step (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) increase in the order Li+&lt;Cs+&lt;Na+&lt;K+. The cation effects are also general for two typical nanostructured catalysts including copper/cuprous oxide and nickel phosphides, achieving near&#8208;100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and over 99&#8201;% conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NO3&#8722; can be converted to high&#8208;purity NH4Cl by copper/cuprous oxide catalyst in K+&#8208;containing electrolyte.

         <title>Discovery of A G&#8208;Quadruplex Unwinder That Unleashes the Translation of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Containing mRNA without Inducing DNA Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore the mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) mediated diseases, it is crucial to manipulate and intervene in intracellular G4 structures using small molecular tools. While hundreds of G4 stabilizers have been developed, there is a significant gap in the availability of G4 unwinding agents. Here, we propose a strategy to disrupt G&#8208;quadruplexes by forming G&#8208;C hydrogen bonds with chemically modified cytidine trimers. We validated a good G4 unwinder, the 2'&#8208;F cytidine trimer (2'&#8208;F C3). 2'&#8208;F C3 does not inhibit cell growth nor cause severe DNA damage at a concentration below 10 &#956;M. Moreover, 2'&#8208;F C3 does not affect gene transcription nor RNA splicing, while it significantly enhances the translation of G4&#8208;containing mRNA and upregulates RNA splicing, RNA processing and cell cycle pathways. The discovery of this G4 unwinder provides a functional tool for the chemical modulation of G4s in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Exhaled Anesthetic Xenon Regeneration by Gas Separation Using a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Sorbent&#8208;Sorbate Induced&#8208;Fit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble gas xenon (Xe) is an excellent anesthetic gas, but its rarity, high cost and constrained production prohibits wide use in medicine. Here, we have developed a closed&#8208;circuit anesthetic Xe recovery and reusage process with highly effective CO2&#8208;specific adsorbent CUPMOF&#8208;5 that is promising to solve the anesthetic Xe supply problem. CUPMOF&#8208;5 possesses spacious cage cavities interconnected in four directions by confinement throat apertures of ~3.4 &#197;, which makes it an ideal molecular sieving of CO2 from Xe, O2, N2 with the benchmark selectivity and high uptake capacity of CO2. In&#8208;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and computational simulation solidly revealed the vital sieving role of the confined throat and the sorbent&#8208;sorbate induced&#8208;fit strengthening binding interaction to CO2. CUPMOF&#8208;5 can remove 5% CO2 even from actual moist exhaled anesthetic gases, and achieves the highest Xe recovery rate (99.8%) so far, as verified by breakthrough experiments. This endows CUPMOF&#8208;5 great potential for the on&#8208;line CO2 removal and Xe recovery from anesthetic closed&#8208;circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Variation of Chemical Microenvironment of Pores in Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is an advantageous and ecologically sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, achieving high conversion efficiency without sacrificial agents remains a challenge. In this study, two covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8208;O and COF&#8208;C) were prepared with identical skeletal structures but with their pore walls anchored to different alkyl chains. They were used to investigate the effect of the chemical microenvironment of pores on photocatalytic H2O2 production. Experimental results reveal a change of hydrophilicity in COF&#8208;O, leading to suppressed charge recombination, diminished charge transfer resistance, and accelerated interfacial electron transfer. An apparent quantum yield as high as 10.3% (&#955; = 420 nm) can be achieved with H2O and O2 through oxygen reduction reaction. This is among the highest ever reported for polymer photocatalysts. This study may provide a novel avenue for optimizing photocatalytic activity and selectivity in H2O2 generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Fine&#8208;tuning to Achieve Highly Fluorescent Organic and Water&#8208;soluble Thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent molecular systems are important for various applications such as sensing of analytes, probes for biologically relevant processes and as optoelectronic materials. Achieving high fluorescence quantum yield across the spectrum of solvent polarity and in solid&#8208;state is challenging in molecular materials. Herein, we present a strategy to achieve strongly fluorescent molecular materials based on weak intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) in a family of unsymmetrical donor&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazoles&#8208;acceptor systems (both neutral and cationic). Detailed photophysical studies reveal that the delicate balance between the donor and acceptor result in high solution&#8208;state fluorescence quantum yield (&gt; 80%) in both polar protic and apolar solvents. Quantum chemical computations uncover a hitherto unappreciated insight that the extent of ICT is aptly represented by the change in Mulliken charges between the ground and excited&#8208;state for different fragments rather than the classical approach of monitoring the change in dipole moment for the entire molecule. This insight rationalizes the observed photophysical properties and can have implications in the design of tuneable donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent molecular systems are important for various applications such as sensing of analytes, probes for biologically relevant processes and as optoelectronic materials. Achieving high fluorescence quantum yield across the spectrum of solvent polarity and in solid-state is challenging in molecular materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Catalyzed Amide Synthesis Directly from Alcohol Under Red Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines to form amide bonds is typically catalysed by homogeneous transition metal catalysts at high temperatures ranging from 130&#8208;140 &#176;C. In our pursuit of an efficient and recyclable photocatalyst capable of conducting this transformation at room temperature, we report herein a COF&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative synthesis. The TTT&#8208;DHTD COF was strategically designed to incorporate a high density of functional units, specifically dithiophenedione, to trap photogenerated electrons and effectively facilitate hydrogen atom abstraction reactions. The photoactive TTT&#8208;DHTD COF, synthesized using solvothermal methods showed high crystallinity and moderate surface area, providing an ideal platform for heterogeneous amide synthesis.&#160; Light absorption by the COF across the entire visible range, narrow band gap, and valence band position make it well&#8208;suited for the efficient generation of excitons necessary for targeted dehydrogenation. Utilizing red light irradiation and employing extremely low loading of the COF, we have successfully prepared a wide range of amides, including challenging secondary amides, in good to excellent yields. The substrate's functional group tolerance, very mild reaction conditions, and the catalyst's significant recyclability represent substantial advancements over prior methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenophene&#8208;fused Perylene Diimide&#8208;based Cathode Interlayer Enables 19% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells via Stimulative Charge Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cathode interlayer is crucial for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), but the research on simple and efficient interlayer materials is lagging behind. Here, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) typed selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) derivative (SePDI3) is developed as cathode interlayer material (CIM) for OSCs, and a non&#8208;fused PDI derivative (PDI3) is used as the control CIM for comparison. Compared to PDI3, SePDI3 shows a stronger self&#8208;doping effect and better crystallinity, resulting in better charge transport ability. Furthermore, the interaction between SePDI3 and L8&#8208;BO can form an efficient extraction channel, leading to superior charge extraction behavior. Finally, benefitting from significantly enhanced charge transport and extraction capacity, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displays a champion PCE of 19.04% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65% for binary OSCs based on PM6:L8&#8208;BO active layer, which is one of the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs based novel CIMs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy to develop high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Driven Peptide Formation in Supersaturated Aerosol Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The condensation of amino acids into peptides plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and is thus essential for understanding the origins of life. However, the spontaneous formation of peptides from amino acids in bulk aqueous media is energetically unfavorable, posing a challenge for elucidating plausible abiotic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the formation of amide bonds between amino acids within highly supersaturated aerosol droplets containing dicyandiamide (DCD), a cyanide derivative potentially present on primordial Earth. Metastable states, i.e. supersaturation, within individual micron&#8208;sized droplets are studied using both an optical trap and a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance. When irradiated with intense visible light, amide bond formation is observed to occur and can be monitored using vibrational bands in Raman spectra. The reaction rate is found to be strongly influenced by droplet size and kinetic modelling suggests that it is driven by the photochemical product of a DCD self&#8208;reaction. Our results highlight the potential of atmospheric aerosol particles as reaction environments for peptide synthesis and have potential implications for the prebiotic chemistry of early Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Contraction of Saturated Cyclic Amines and Rearrangement of Acyclic Amines Through Their Corresponding Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to modifications at the molecular periphery, skeletal adjustments present greater challenges. Within this context, skeletal rearrangement technology stands out for its significant advantages in rapidly achieving structural diversity. Yet, the development of this technology for ring contraction of saturated cyclic amines remains exceedingly rare. While most existing methods rely on specific substitution patterns to achieve ring contraction, there is a persistent demand for a more general strategy for substitution&#8208;free cyclic amines. To address this issue, we report a B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of hydroxylamines with hydrosilanes. This methodology, when combined with the N&#8208;hydroxylation of amines, enables the regioselective ring contraction of cyclic amines and proves equally effective for rapid reorganization of acyclic amine skeletons. By this, the direct scaffold hopping of drug molecules and the strategic deletion of carbon atoms are achieved in a mild manner. Based on mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations, a possible mechanism for this process is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of kibdelomycin and related biosynthetic gene clusters and characterization of the C&#8208;branching of amycolose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many bacterial natural products contain C&#8208;branched sugars, including components from the outer cell wall or antibiotically active metabolites. The enzymatic C&#8208;branching of keto sugars leading to longer side chains (&#8805;C2), is catalyzed by thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes. Chiral tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are formed in this process. The ThDP enzymes that catalyze C&#8208;branching reactions belong to one of three enzymatic superfamilies: decarboxy&#173;lases, transketolases, and &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenases 2, but branching of keto sugars has only been demonstrated for decarboxylases. In this study, we showed that an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenase is responsible for C&#8208;branching of the deoxyketo sugar amycolose in the biosynthesis of kibdelomycin in Kibdelosporangium sp. MA7385. In addition, we characterized an amino transferase in the same biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that accepts a sterically demanding tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone in a downstream reaction. Subsequently, we identified approximately 400 similar BGCs in silico, suggesting that there is a large diversity of possible ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyzing the C&#8208;branching of keto sugars and subsequent modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Optical Control of Polarization Current Direction in a Cyanide&#8208;Bridged Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a remote and non&#8208;contact stimulus, light offers the potential for manipulating the polarization of ferroelectric materials without physical contact. However, in current research, the non&#8208;contact write&#8208;read (erase) process lacks direct observation through the stable current as output signal. To address this limitation, we investigated the photoinduced polarization switching capabilities of the cyanide&#8208;bridged compound [Fe2Co] using visible light, leading to the achievement of rewritable polarization. By subjecting [Fe2Co] crystals to alternating irradiation with 785 nm and 532 nm light, the polarization changes exhibited a distinct square wave pattern, confirming the reliability of the writing and erasing processes. Initialization involved exposing specific crystal units to 532 nm light for storing "1" or "0" information, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785 nm light, resulting in brief current pulses for "1" states and no current signal for "0" states. This research unveils new possibilities for optical storage systems, paving the way for efficient and rewritable data storage and retrieval technologies, such as the next&#8208;generation memories.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Pd2Lab2Lcc2 and Pd2Lab2Lcd2 Type Cages by Heteromeric Completive Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd(II)&#8208;based low&#8208;symmetry coordination cages possessing anisotropic cavities are of great interest. The common strategies employed to achieve such cages utilize either more than one type of symmetrical ligands (e.g., Laa, Lbb, etc.) or only one type of unsymmetrical ligand (e.g., Lab). To significantly enhance the anisotropy, we have designed two unsymmetrical bidentate ligands i.e., Lab and Lcd, aiming a low&#8208;symmetry Pd2Lab2Lcd2&#8208;type cage. It was accomplished by high&#8208;fidelity integrative self&#8208;sorting of two different low&#8208;symmetry cages having Pd2Lab4 and Pd4Lcd8&#8208;type architectures (homoleptic complexes of the designed ligands). Structural constraints and geometry complementarity in the ligand design drive the non&#8208;statistical exclusive self&#8208;assembly of the Pd2Lab2Lcd2&#8208;type cage. By taking advantage of the complemental geometries between ligands, a low&#8208;symmetry Pd2Lab2Lcc2&#8208;type cage was also obtained. Heteromeric completive self&#8208;sorting of three homoleptic assemblies (Pd2Lab4, Pd4Lcc8 and Pd4Lcd8&#8208;type cages) into an exclusive mixture of Pd2Lab2Lcd2 and Pd2Lab2Lcc2&#8208;type mixed ligated assemblies was demonstrated through cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Functional Switch Between Asperfumene and Fusicoccadiene Synthase and Entrance to Asperfumene Biosynthesis through a Vicinal Deprotonation&#8208;Reprotonation Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diterpene synthase AfAS was identified from Aspergillus fumigatiaffinis. Its amino acid sequence and &#8211; according to a structural model &#8211; active site architecture are highly similar to those of the fusicocca&#8208;2,10(14)&#8208;diene synthase PaFS, but AfAS produces a structurally much more complex diterpene with a novel 6&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5 tetracyclic skeleton called asperfumene. The cyclisation mechanism of AfAS was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The reaction cascade proceeds in its initial steps through similar intermediates as for the PaFS cascade, but then diverges through an unusual vicinal deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation process that triggers a skeletal rearrangement at the entrance to the steps leading to the unique asperfumene skeleton. The structural model revealed only one major difference between the active sites: The PaFS residue F65 is substituted by I65 in AfAS. Intriguingly, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments with both diterpene synthases revealed that position 65 serves as a bidirectional functional switch for the biosynthesis of tetracyclic asperfumene versus structurally less complex diterpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Effect of Fullerene Guest and Counterion on the Structural Stability and Electrical Conductivity of Octahedral Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages have garnered tremendous attention for their diverse yet molecular&#8208;level precision structures. However, physical properties of these supramolecular ensembles, which are of potential significance in molecular electronics, remain largely unexplored. We herein constructed a series of octahedral metallo&#8208;cages and cage&#8208;fullerene complexes with notably enhanced structural stability. As such, we could systematically evaluate the electrical conductivity of these ensembles at both single&#8208;molecule level and aggregated bulk state (as well&#8208;defined films). Our findings reveal that counteranions and fullerene guests play a pivotal role in determining the electrical conductivity of aggregated state, while such effects are less significant for single&#8208;molecule conductance. Both counteranions and fullerenes effectively tune the electronic structures and packing density of metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, and facilitate efficient charge transfer between the cage hosts and fullerenes, resulting in a notable one order of magnitude increase in electrical conductivity of the aggregated state.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680%) and toughness (47.5 MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0 mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Microfluidic Platform for Extravasation Studies Based on DNA Origami&#8212;Cell Interactions</title>

Microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier using a porous membrane decorated with DNA origami nanostructures displaying adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device allows visualization of cell transmigration under physiological flow conditions, revealing influences of adhesion peptide type, spatial arrangement, and density on the extravasation of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.







Abstract
The adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the endothelial lumen and their extravasation to surrounding tissues are crucial in the seeding of metastases and remain the most complex events of the metastatic cascade to study. Integrins expressed on CTCs are major regulators of the extravasation process. This knowledge is primarily derived from animal models and biomimetic systems based on artificial endothelial layers, but these methods have ethical or technical limitations. We present a versatile microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier by using a porous membrane functionalized with DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) that display nanoscale patterns of adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device simulates physiological flow conditions and allows direct visualization of cell transmigration through microchannel pores using 3D confocal imaging. Using this system, we studied integrin&#8208;specific adhesion in the absence of other adhesive events. Specifically, we show that the transmigration ability of the metastatic cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 is influenced by the type, distance, and density of adhesion peptides present on the DONs. Furthermore, studies with mixed ligand systems indicate that integrins binding to RGD (arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid) and IDS (isoleucine&#8208;aspartic acid&#8208;serine) did not synergistically enhance the extravasation process of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.

         <title>NETosis&#8208;Inspired Cell Surface&#8208;Constrained Framework Nucleic Acids Traps (FNATs) for Cascaded Extracellular Recognition and Cellular Behavior Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), capturing and killing microbes. Inspired by this, we introduce framework nucleic acid traps (FNATs), a DNA nanoplatform for dynamic molecule recognition and cellular behavior modulation. This platform visualizes extracellular activities and manipulates cell behaviors using programmable DNA devices.







Abstract
Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release nuclear DNA into the extracellular environment, forming web&#8208;like DNA structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which capture and kill bacteria, fungi, and cancer cells. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as NETosis. Inspired by this, we introduce a cell surface&#8208;constrained web&#8208;like framework nucleic acids traps (FNATs) with programmable extracellular recognition capability and cellular behavior modulation. This approach facilitates dynamic key chemical signaling molecule recognition such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is elevated in the extracellular microenvironment, and triggers FNA self&#8208;assembly. This, in turn, leads to in situ tightly interwoven FNAs formation on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting target cell migration. Furthermore, it activates a photosensitizer&#8208;capturing switch, chlorin e6 (Ce6), and induces cell self&#8208;destruction. This cascade platform provides new potential tools for visualizing dynamic extracellular activities and manipulating cellular behaviors using programmable in situ self&#8208;assembling DNA molecular devices.

Inspired by this, we introduce framework nucleic acid traps (FNATs), a DNA nanoplatform for dynamic molecule recognition and cellular behavior modulation. This platform visualizes extracellular activities and manipulates cell behaviors using programmable DNA devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release nuclear DNA into the extracellular environment, forming web-like DNA structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which capture and kill bacteria, fungi, and cancer cells. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as NETosis. Inspired by this, we introduce a cell surface-constrained web-like framework nucleic acids traps (FNATs) with programmable extracellular recognition capability and cellular behavior modulation. This approach facilitates dynamic key chemical signaling molecule recognition such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is elevated in the extracellular microenvironment, and triggers FNA self-assembly. This, in turn, leads to in situ tightly interwoven FNAs formation on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting target cell migration. Furthermore, it activates a photosensitizer-capturing switch, chlorin e6 (Ce6), and induces cell self-destruction. This cascade platform provides new potential tools for visualizing dynamic extracellular activities and manipulating cellular behaviors using programmable in situ self-assembling DNA molecular devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US&#8208;DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data&#8208;Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a data&#8208;driven strategy, we developed models to illustrate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of MgH2&#8208;based materials in solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. This model also shows the current gap between their performance and the US&#8208;DOE goal.







Abstract
Developing solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid&#8208;state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time&#8208;consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data&#8208;driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg&#8722;H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US&#8208;DOE).

         <title>Ternary Rotational Polyanion Coupling Enables Fast Li Ion Dynamics in Tetrafluoroborate Ion Doped Antiperovskite Li2OHCl Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knowledge on the Li ion dynamics associated with more than two types of polyanions is still lacking. In this work, a novel three&#8208;body responsive dynamics is stimulated by the ternary coupling of OH&#8722;, BF4&#8722; and Li2&#8722;O&#8722;H octahedron movements, which efficiently reduces the activation barrier and consequently improves the Li ion conductivity.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich antiperovskite (LiRAP) hydroxyhalides are emerging as attractive solid electrolyte (SEs) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) due to their low melting point, low cost, and ease of scaling&#8208;up. The incorporation of rotational polyanions can reduce the activation energy and thus improve the Li ion conductivity of SEs. Herein, we propose a ternary rotational polyanion coupling strategy to fasten the Li ion conduction in tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ion doped LiRAP Li2OHCl. Assisted by first&#8208;principles calculation, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state magnetic resonance and electrochemical impedance spectra, it is confirmed that Li ion transport in BF4&#8722; ion doped Li2OHCl is strongly associated with the rotational coupling among OH&#8722;, BF4&#8722; and Li2&#8722;O&#8722;H octahedrons, which enhances the Li ion conductivity for more than 1.8&#8197;times with the activation energy lowering 0.03&#8197;eV. This work provides a new perspective to design high&#8208;performance superionic conductors with multi&#8208;polyanions.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of High&#8208;Capacity Sulfur Cathodes via In&#8208;Situ Polymerization of a Porous Imine&#8208;Based Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization techniques encapsulate sulfur within microporous imine polymers, addressing the sulfur&#8208;shuttle issue and boosting electrochemical performance. This innovative strategy marks a new direction for creating efficient sulfur&#8208;based cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, essential for electronics and electric vehicles, predominantly use cathodes made from critical materials like cobalt. Sulfur&#8208;based cathodes, offering a high theoretical capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and environmental advantages due to sulfur's abundance and lower toxicity, present a more sustainable alternative. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based electrodes do not reach the theoretical capacities, mainly because conventional electrode production relies on mixing of components into weakly coordinated slurries. Consequently, sulfur&#8216;s mobility leads to battery degradation&#8212;an effect known as the &#8220;sulfur&#8208;shuttle&#8221;. This study introduces a solution by developing a microporous, covalently&#8208;bonded, imine&#8208;based polymer network grown in situ around sulfur particles on the current collector. The polymer network (i) enables selective transport of electrolyte and Li&#8208;ions through pores of defined size, and (ii) acts as a robust host to retain the active component of the electrode (sulfur species). The resulting cathode has superior rate performance from 0.1&#8197;C (1360&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) to 3&#8197;C (807&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Demonstrating a high&#8208;performance, sustainable sulfur cathode produced via a simple one&#8208;pot process, our research underlines the potential of microporous polymers in addressing sulfur diffusion issues, paving the way for sulfur electrodes as viable alternatives to traditional metal&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Force&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;spontaneous Dehalogenative Deuteration of Aromatic Iodides Enabled by Using Piezoelectric Materials as a Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a catalytic, non&#8208;spontaneous dehalogenation process for the deuteration of aryl iodides using BaTiO3 as a catalyst. This method achieves high levels of deuterium incorporation using only 2.0&#8197;equivalents of D2O, which additionally acts as an electron donor. Furthermore, deuteration enhances the biological activity of D&#8208;ipriflavone, markedly inhibiting osteoclast differentiation.







Abstract
The development of green and efficient deuteration methods is of great significance for various fields such as organic synthesis, analytical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we have developed a dehalogenative deuteration strategy using piezoelectric materials as catalysts in a solid&#8208;phase system under ball&#8208;milling conditions. This non&#8208;spontaneous reaction is induced by mechanical force. D2O can serve as both a deuterium source and an electron donor in the transformation, eliminating the need for additional stoichiometric exogenous reductants. A series of (hetero)aryl iodides can be transformed into deuterated products with high deuterium incorporation. This method not only effectively overcomes existing synthetic challenges but can also be used for deuterium labelling of drug molecules and derivatives. Bioactivity experiments with deuterated drug molecule suggest that the D&#8208;ipriflavone enhances the inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation of BMDMs in vitro.

         <title>Reconstructing Solvation Structure by Steric Hindrance&#8208;Coordination Push&#8208;Pull of Dipolymer&#8208;H2O&#8208;Zn2+ toward Long&#8208;life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;chained dipolymer with steric hindrance and coordination reconstructs the Zn2+ solvation structure in liquid electrolyte by a balanced push&#8208;pull dynamic on Zn2+ and H2O, forms a dipolymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI in situ, and regulates the electrochemical reduction kinetics, considerably prolonging the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries are prospective energy storge devices due to their intrinsically high safety and cost effectiveness. Yet, uneven deposition of zinc ions in electrochemical reduction and side reactions at the anode interface significantly hinder their development and application. Here, we propose a solvation&#8208;interface attenuation strategy enabled by a frustrated tertiary amine amphiphilic dipolymer electrolyte additive. The configuration of superhydrophilic segments with covalently bonded lipophilic spacers enables coupled steric hindrance/coordination, which establishes a balanced push&#8208;pull dynamic of dipolymer&#8208;H2O&#8208;Zn2+. Such interplay reconstructs the solvation structure of Zn2+ and allows the formation of a stable dipolymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. This SEI layer effectively shields the zinc&#8208;metal anode from water and anions, significantly reducing side reactions. In addition, the dipolymer adsorbed at the zinc&#8208;metal anode interface regulates the interfacial electrochemical reduction kinetics and ensures uniform zinc deposition. As a result, the Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cells with dipolymer&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibit remarkable cycling stability exceeding 5800&#8197;h (242&#8197;days). The Zn&#8208;NVO batteries and Zn&#8208;AC hybrid ion supercapacitors also deliver stable cycling for up to 1440&#8197;h (60&#8197;days) with high&#8208;capacity retention over 80&#8201;%. This research demonstrates the potential to facilitate the development and commercialization of zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Ligand Meta&#8208;Anchoring Strategy in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Remarkable Promotion of Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is reported to promote the quantum yields of luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks through the restriction of intramolecular motions.







Abstract
Aggregation is a conventional method to enhance the quantum yields (QYs) of pure organic luminophores due to the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM). However, how to realize RIM in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is still unclear and challenging. In this work, the ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is first proposed and proved to be an effective and systematic approach to restrict the intramolecular motions of MOFs for the QY improvement. By simply shifting the substituent position in the ligand from para to meta, the QY of the resulting MOF is significantly enhanced by eleven&#8208;fold. The value is even higher than that of ligand aggregates, demonstrating the strong RIM effect of this ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy. The introduction of co&#8208;ligand induces the appearance of visible yellow room temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 222&#8197;ms due to the QY enhancement and the charge transfer between the donor and accepter units. The present work thus broadens the understanding of the RIM mechanism from a new perspective, develops a novel method to realize RIM and expands the applicable objects from pure organic materials to organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Driven Dispersion of Bismuth Nanoparticles among Carbon Matrix for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique thermal&#8208;driven strategy is proposed to re&#8208;disperse bismuth core into nanoparticles among porous carbon shell, inhibiting the aggregation to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability.







Abstract
The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C&#8208;700&#8208;4) simply by a thermal&#8208;driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for CO2 reduction into formate. The in situ experimental observations on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8&#8201;% and the long&#8208;time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar&#8208;driven system renders the high 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2&#8201;%, presenting the impressive solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Interlayer Structure Manipulation of FeOCl/MXene with Soft/Hard Interface Design for Safe Water Production Using Dechlorination Battery Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soft/hard interfaces assembly was designed by manipulating the interlayer structure, in which Ti3C2Tx dressed the fragile FeOCl with a soft and conductive suit, solving the thorny troubles of structural stability and electronic conductivity for FeOCl. The rigidity and flexibility integrated FeOCl/Ti3C2Tx worked for electrochemical dechlorination with simultaneous energy recovery, demonstrating the feasibility of dechlorination battery.







Abstract
Suffering from the susceptibility to decomposition, the potential electrochemical application of FeOCl has greatly been hindered. The rational design of the soft&#8208;hard material interface can effectively address the challenge of stress concentration and thus decomposition that may occur in the electrodes during charging and discharging. Herein, interlayer structure manipulation of FeOCl/MXene using soft&#8208;hard interface design method were conducted for electrochemical dechlorination. FeOCl was encapsulated in Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly layer by layer to form a soft&#8208;hard mechanical hierarchical structure, in which Ti3C2Tx was used as flexible buffer layers to relieve the huge volume change of FeOCl during Cl&#8722; intercalation/deintercalation and constructed a conductive network for fast charge transfer. The CDI dechlorination system of FeOCl/Ti3C2Tx delivered outstanding Cl&#8722; adsorption capacity (158.47 &#177; 6.98&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), rate (6.07 &#177; 0.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1), and stability (over 94.49&#8201;% in 30 cycles), and achieved considerable energy recovery (21.14 &#177; 0.25&#8201;%). The superior dechlorination performance was proved to originate from the Fe2+/Fe3+ topochemical transformation and the deformation constraint effect of Ti3C2Tx on FeOCl. Our interfacial design strategy enables a hard&#8208;to&#8208;soft integration capacity, which can serve as a universal technology for solving the traditional problem of electrode volume expansion.

         <title>Merging High&#8208;Pressure Syngas Metal Catalysis and Biocatalysis in Tandem One&#8208;Pot Processes for the Synthesis of Nonchiral and Chiral Alcohols from Alkenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem one&#8208;pot process combining high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation of 1&#8208;octene and enzymatic reduction is demonstrated, leading to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 80&#8201;% yield of the isolated alcohol isomers. This concept was extended to the hydroformylation of styrene and enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution, resulting in excellent conversion (&gt;99&#8201;%) and an enantiomeric ratio of 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 for (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanol.







Abstract
While simultaneously proceeding reactions are among the most fascinating features of biosynthesis, this concept of tandem processes also offers high potential in the chemical industry in terms of less waste production and improved process efficiency and sustainability. Although examples of one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic syntheses exist, the combination of completely different reaction types is rare. Herein, we demonstrate that extreme &#8220;antipodes&#8221; of the &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221;, such as syngas&#8208;based high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation and biocatalyzed reduction, can be combined within a tandem&#8208;type one&#8208;pot process in water. No significant deactivation was found for either the biocatalyst or the chemocatalyst. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the one&#8208;pot process starting from 1&#8208;octene was established with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 80&#8201;% isolated yield of the desired alcohol isomers. All necessary components for hydroformylation and biocatalysis were added to the reactor from the beginning. This concept has been extended to the enantioselective synthesis of chiral products by conducting the hydroformylation of styrene and an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution in a tandem mode, leading to an excellent conversion of &gt;99&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 for (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanol. The overall process runs in water under mild and energy&#8208;saving conditions, without any need for intermediate isolation.

         <title>Solvation Properties of Neutral Gold Species in Supercritical Water Studied By THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold clusters in aqueous supercritial solution are found to interact very strongly with the solvent, forming well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;water solvation complexes. Their THz spectrum is distinctly different from that of supercritical water, which can be exploited to probe such neutral metal species in hydrothermal fluids.







Abstract
Supercritical water provides distinctly different solvation properties compared to what is known from liquid water. Despite its prevalence deep in the Earth's crust and its role in chemosynthetic ecosystems in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents, molecular insights into its solvation mechanisms are still very scarce compared to what is known for liquid water. Recently, neutral metal particles have been detected in hydrothermal fluids and proposed to explain the transport of gold species to ore deposits on Earth. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we elucidate the solvation properties of small gold species at supercritical conditions. The neutral metal clusters themselves contribute enormous THz intensity not because of their intramolecular vibrations, but due to their pronounced electronic polarization coupling to the dynamical supercritical solvent, leading to a continuum absorption up to about 1000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. On top, long&#8208;lived interactions between the gold clusters and solvation water leads at these supercritical conditions to a sharp THz resonance that happens to be close to the one due to H&#8208;bonding in liquid water at ambient conditions. The resulting distinct resonances can be used to analyse the solvation properties of neutral metal particles in supercritical aqueous solutions.

         <title>Identification of &#8220;Structural Pin&#8221; Interactions and their Significance for the Conformational Control of Macrocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we identify structural pins as intramolecular hydrogen bonds in macrocycles that are predominantly responsible for conformational stabilization. Characterization and structural analysis of macrocycles with NMR and molecular modelling indicates that removal of a structural pin drastically influences the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased conformational heterogeneity.







Abstract
While peptide macrocycles with rigidified conformations have proven to be useful in the design of chemical probes of protein targets, conformational flexibility and rapid interconversion can be equally vital for biological activity and favorable physicochemical properties. This study introduces the concept of &#8220;structural pin&#8221;, which describes a hydrogen bond that is largely responsible for stabilizing the entire macrocycle backbone conformation. Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X&#8208;ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Enhanced Photoreforming of Biomass Furans over a Urea&#8208;Incorporated Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urea&#8208;incorporated porphyrin framework can activate molecular oxygen to generate selectively &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 and enable the flat adsorption of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural in a low&#8208;energy configuration leveraging on hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to highly efficient photo&#8208;oxidation that produces bioplastic monomers from renewable feedstocks without over&#8208;oxidation and photo&#8208;corrosion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds great promise for sustainable production of bio&#8208;plastics and resins. However, the process is limited by poor selectivity and sluggish kinetics due to the vertical coordination of HMF at relatively strong metal sites. Here, we purposely developed a Cu(II) porphyrin framework featuring side&#8208;chain incorporated urea linkages, denoted as TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF, to render HMF a weak hydrogen bond at the urea site and flat adsorption via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking with the benzene moiety. The unique configuration promotes the approaching of &#8722;CHO of HMF to the photoexcited porphyrin ring towards kinetically and thermodynamically favourable intermediate formation and subsequent desorption. The charge localisation and orbital energy alignment enable the selective activation of O2 over the porphyrin to generate &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 instead of highly oxidative H2O2 and &#8901;OH via spin&#8208;flip electron transfer, which drive the ambient oxidation of proximal &#8722;CHO. The effective utilisation of redox species and circumvented over&#8208;oxidation facilitate a FDCA selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% with a high turnover number of 193&#8197;molHMF&#8201;molCu&#8722;1. The facile purification of high&#8208;purity FDCA and zero&#8208;waste recycling of intermediates and durable catalyst feature TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF a promising photo&#8208;oxidation platform towards net&#8208;zero biorefining and organic transformations.

         <title>tert&#8208;Butyl as a Functional Group: Non&#8208;Directed Catalytic Hydroxylation of Sterically Congested Primary C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers site&#8208;selective non&#8208;directed hydroxylation of remote primary C&#8722;H bonds in tert&#8208;butyl groups employing hydrogen peroxide and the highly electrophilic Mn(CF3bpeb) catalyst in nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (NFTBA).







Abstract
The tert&#8208;butyl group is a common aliphatic motif extensively employed to implement steric congestion and conformational rigidity in organic and organometallic molecules. Because of the combination of a high bond dissociation energy (~100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and limited accessibility, in the absence of directing groups, neither radical nor organometallic approaches are effective for the chemical modification of tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Herein we overcome these limits by employing a highly electrophilic manganese catalyst, [Mn(CF3bpeb)(OTf)2], that operates in the strong hydrogen bond donor solvent nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (NFTBA) and catalytically activates hydrogen peroxide to generate a powerful manganese&#8208;oxo species that effectively oxidizes tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Leveraging on the interplay of steric, electronic, medium and torsional effects, site&#8208;selective and product chemoselective hydroxylation of the tert&#8208;butyl group is accomplished with broad reaction scope, delivering primary alcohols as largely dominant products in preparative yields. Late&#8208;stage hydroxylation at tert&#8208;butyl sites is demonstrated on 6 densely functionalized molecules of pharmaceutical interest. This work uncovers a novel disconnection approach, harnessing tert&#8208;butyl as a potential functional group in strategic synthetic planning for complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Microwave Assisted Fast Synthesis of a Donor&#8208;Acceptor COF Towards Photooxidative Amidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a microwave&#8208;assisted rapid synthesis (in time scale, t=10&#8197;seconds to 10&#8197;minutes) of a D&#8722;A based covalent organic framework, TzPm&#8208;COF towards photooxidative amidation reaction from aldehyde and amine. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at bulk scale require robust, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective techniques. However, the traditional solvothermal synthetic methods of COFs suffer low scalability as well as requirement of sensitive reaction environment and multiday reaction time (2&#8211;10&#8197;days) which greatly restricts their practical application. Here, we report microwave assisted rapid and optimized synthesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) based highly crystalline COF, TzPm&#8208;COF in second (10&#8197;sec) to minute (10&#8197;min) time scale. With increasing the reaction time from seconds to minutes crystallinity, porosity and morphological changes are observed for TzPm&#8208;COF. Owing to visible range light absorption, suitable band alignment, and low exciton binding energy (Eb=64.6&#8197;meV), TzPm&#8208;COF can efficaciously produce superoxide radical anion (O2.&#8722;) after activating molecular oxygen (O2) which eventually drives aerobic photooxidative amidation reaction with high recyclability. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield. Furthermore, catalytic mechanism was established by monitoring the real&#8208;time reaction progress through in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) study.

         <title>New Alkalescent Electrolyte Chemistry for Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery assembled with an alkalescent (pH=12) Zn&#8208;EDTA anolyte and Fe(CN)63&#8722;/Fe(CN)64&#8722; catholyte is constructed and has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries are efficiency and economical as energy storage solutions. However, they suffer from low energy density and short calendar life. The strongly alkaline conditions (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 OH&#8722;) reduce the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide (normally only 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and induce the formation of zinc dendrites at the anode. Here, we report a new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on a mild alkalescent (pH&#8197;12) electrolyte. Using a chelating agent to rearrange ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide ion&#8208;solvent interactions and improve salt dissociation, we increased the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide to 1.7&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 and prevented zinc dendrites. Our battery has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. An alkalescent zinc&#8208;ferricyanide cell stack built using this alkalescent electrolyte stably delivers 608&#8197;W of power for ~40&#8197;days.

         <title>A Thermosalient and Mechanically Compliant Organic Crystalline Optical Waveguide Switcher</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic crystalline material exhibiting both plastic bending and thermosalient behavior with reversible crystal movement during phase transition is reported. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. This unique combination enables switching of the material&#8216;s waveguiding ability within a narrow temperature range, promising applications in heat&#8208;sensitive electronics like central processing units. Being entirely organic, it offers reduced weight compared to the materials that are currently being used in electronics.







Abstract
The dense and ordered molecular arrangements endow dynamic molecular crystals with fast response, rapid energy conversion, low energy dissipation, and strong coupling between heat/light and mechanical energy. Most of the known dynamic crystals can only respond to a single stimulus, and materials that can respond to multiple stimuli are rare. Here, we report an organic crystalline material that can be bent plastically and is also thermosalient, as its crystals can move when they undergo a reversible phase transition. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. The combination of light transduction and reversible thermomechanical deformation provides an opportunity to switch the waveguiding capability of the material in a narrow temperature range, which holds a tremendous potential for applications in heat&#8208;averse electronic components, such as central processing units. Unlike existing electronics, the material we report here is completely organic and therefore much lighter, potentially reducing the overall weight of electronic circuits.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tightly&#8208;coupled adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface manufactured by a bottom&#8208;up growth strategy exhibits outstanding selectivity and stability of CO2RR. The convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface promotes the dimerization of localized *CO adsorbate, thus form the C2 products with a lowered energy barrier.







Abstract
One challenge confronting the Cu2O catalysts in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is the reduction of active Cu(I) species, resulting in low selectivity and quick deactivation. In this study, we for the first time introduce a bottom&#8208;up growth of convex sphere with adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interfaces (Cux@Cu2O convex spheres). Interestingly, the interfaces are dynamically modulated by varying hydrothermal time, thus regulating the conversion of C1 and C2 products. In particular, the 4&#8197;h hydrothermal treatment applied to Cu0.25@Cu2O convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface results in the highest selectivity for C2 products (90.5&#8201;%). In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface lowers the energy barrier for the production of ethylene and ethanol while increasing the coverage of localized *CO adsorbate for increased dimerization. This work establishes a novel approach for transforming the state of valence&#8208;sensitive electrocatalysts into high&#8208;value energy&#8208;related engineering products.

         <title>Innovative Approach to Chiral Polyurethanes: Asymmetric Copolymerization with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrated the first example for the asymmetric copolymerization of various meso&#8208;epoxide with isocyanates toward the synthesis of chiral polymers with unique nitrogen functionality. Intramolecular bimetallic coordination strategies provided completely alternating copolymers with high carbamate unit content (up to 94&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The introduction of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to chiral polymer backbones enables the tailoring of physical properties and offers opportunities for further post&#8208;polymerization modification. However, the substrate scope of such polymers is extremely limited because monomers having nitrogen&#8208;containing groups can change coordination state with respect to the metal centers, thus decreasing the activity and enantioselectivity and even poisoning the catalyst completely. In this paper, we report our attempts to carry out the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide with highly reactive isocyanates. In particular, we found that biphenol&#8208;linked bimetallic Co(III) complexes with multiple chiral centers are very efficient in catalyzing this asymmetric copolymerization reaction, affording optically active polyurethanes with a completely alternating nature and a high enantioselectivity of up to 94&#8201;% ee. Crucially, we identified that the steric hindrance at the phenolate ortho position of the ligand strongly influences the catalytic activity and product enantioselectivity. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed that the highly sterically bulky substituents change the mechanism from bimetallic to monometallic, and result in the unexpected inversion of the chiral induction direction. Moreover, the high stereoregularity of the produced polyurethanes enhances their thermal stability, and they can be selectively decomposed into oxazolidinones. This study offers a versatile methodology for the synthesis of chiral polymers containing nitrogen functionalities.

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Lipid Heterogeneity in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane with a Super&#8208;photostable Environment&#8208;Sensitive Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly photostable and polarity&#8208;sensitive labeling agent for the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) has been developed, enabling visualization of mitochondrial cristae using STED microscopy. In combination with FLIM, it also allows the analysis of lipid heterogeneity at the single mitochondrion level. Time&#8208;lapse FLIM observations revealed that mitochondrial swelling is preceded by an increase in the IMM order resulting from lipid peroxidation.







Abstract
The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) undergoes dynamic morphological changes, which are crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions as well as cell survival. As the dynamics of the membrane are governed by its lipid components, a fluorescent probe that can sense spatiotemporal alterations in the lipid properties of the IMM over long periods of time is required to understand mitochondrial physiological functions in detail. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive IMM&#8208;labeling reagent with excellent photostability and sensitivity to its environment, which enables the visualization of the IMM ultrastructure using super&#8208;resolution microscopy as well as of the lipid heterogeneity based on the fluorescence lifetime at the single mitochondrion level. Combining the probe and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) showed that peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the IMM by reactive oxygen species caused an increase in the membrane order, which took place prior to mitochondrial swelling.

         <title>Fluorinated Surface Engineering Towards High&#8208;Rate and Durable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>

Tuned fluorinated surface was proposed to achieve an ultra&#8208;thin and KF&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase in potassium&#8208;ion battery. The tailored C&#8722;F configurations could induce local surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposing orderly and prompt the enrichment of KF crystals in SEI by self&#8208;sacrifice dissociation. The electrode shows boosted rate performance and durable cycling performance under high loading of ~8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) crucially affects the rate performance and cycling lifespan, yet to date more extensive research is still needed in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. We report an ultra&#8208;thin and KF&#8208;enriched SEI triggered by tuned fluorinated surface design in electrode. Our results reveal that fluorination engineering alters the interfacial chemical environment to facilitate inherited electronic conductivity, enhance adsorption ability of potassium, induce localized surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposition behavior for SEI formation, and especially, enrich the KF crystals in SEI by self&#8208;sacrifice from C&#8722;F bond cleavage. Hence, the regulated fluorinated electrode with generated ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and KF&#8208;enriched SEI shows improved capacity of 439.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.82&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), boosted rate performance (202.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8.70&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durable cycling performance (even under high loading of ~8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We expect this practical engineering principle to open up new opportunities for upgrading the development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Guiding Transient Peptide Assemblies with Structural Elements Embedded in Abiotic Phosphate Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We focus on fuel modifications to impact non&#8208;equilibrium systems, demonstrating how amino acid side chains within abiotic phosphates direct assembly and reactivity changes during structure formation. Through covalent binding to substrates, fuels drive the yield, the lifetime and the structural organization of transient species. Activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for fabricating structured fuels.







Abstract
Despite great progress in the construction of non&#8208;equilibrium systems, most approaches do not consider the structure of the fuel as a critical element to control the processes. Herein, we show that the amino acid side chains (A, F, Nal) in the structure of abiotic phosphates can direct assembly and reactivity during transient structure formation. The fuels bind covalently to substrates and subsequently influence the structures in the assembly process. We focus on the ways in which the phosphate esters guide structure formation and how structures and reactivity cross regulate when constructing assemblies. Through the chemical functionalization of energy&#8208;rich aminoacyl phosphate esters, we are able to control the yield of esters and thioesters upon adding dipeptides containing tyrosine or cysteine residues. The structural elements around the phosphate esters guide the lifetime of the structures formed and their supramolecular assemblies. These properties can be further influenced by the peptide sequence of substrates, incorporating anionic, aliphatic and aromatic residues. Furthermore, we illustrate that oligomerization of esters can be initiated from a single aminoacyl phosphate ester incorporating a tyrosine residue (Y). These findings suggest that activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for designing and fabricating structured fuels.

Furthermore, we illustrate that oligomerization of esters can be initiated from a single aminoacyl phosphate ester incorporating a tyrosine residue (Y). These findings suggest that activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for designing and fabricating structured fuels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of a Porous Crystalline Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy Overlayer on Metal Catalysts via Controlled Solid&#8208;State Reactions for High&#8208;temperature Stable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reactions with limited Mg migration transform the amorphous Al2O3 overlayer on MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts into a porous Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm and weakened acidity, which allows achieving remarkably high stability while preserving high activity over Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy&#8208;coated Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts in methane dry reforming and propane dehydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Catalyst deactivation by sintering and coking is a long&#8208;standing issue in metal&#8208;catalyzed harsh high&#8208;temperature hydrocarbon reactions. Ultrathin oxide coatings of metal nanocatalysts have recently appeared attractive to address this issue, while the porosity of the overlayer is difficult to control to preserve the accessibility of embedded metal nanoparticles, thus often leading to a large decrease in activity. Here, we report that a nanometer&#8208;thick alumina coating of MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts followed by high&#8208;temperature reduction can transform a nonporous amorphous alumina overlayer into a porous Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm and weakened acidity. The high porosity stems from the restrained Mg migration from the MgAl2O4 support to the alumina overlayer through solid&#8208;state reactions at high temperatures. The resulting Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts with a porous crystalline Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy overlayer achieved remarkably high stability while preserving much higher activity than the corresponding alumina&#8208;coated Ni and Pt catalysts on MgO and Al2O3 supports in the reactions of dry reforming of methane and propane dehydrogenation, respectively.

         <title>A Stretchable and Tough Graphene Film Enabled by Mechanical Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;bridged graphene (RBG) film was fabricated, in which graphene nanosheets were cross&#8208;linked by mechanical bonds. During the stretching process, the intramolecular motion of [2]rotaxanes resulted in the release of hidden chains, so that the mechanical properties of RBG films were improved, realizing the effect of strengthening and toughening graphene films.







Abstract
The pursuit of fabricating high&#8208;performance graphene films has aroused considerable attention due to their potential for practical applications. However, developing both stretchable and tough graphene films remains a formidable challenge. To address this issue, we herein introduce mechanical bond to comprehensively improve the mechanical properties of graphene films, utilizing [2]rotaxane as the bridging unit. Under external force, the [2]rotaxane cross&#8208;link undergoes intramolecular motion, releasing hidden chain and increasing the interlayer slip distance between graphene nanosheets. Compared with graphene films without [2]rotaxane cross&#8208;linking, the presence of mechanical bond not only boosted the strength of graphene films (247.3 vs 74.8&#8197;MPa) but also markedly promoted the tensile strain (23.6 vs 10.2&#8201;%) and toughness (23.9 vs 4.0&#8197;MJ/m3). Notably, the achieved tensile strain sets a record high and the toughness surpasses most reported results, rendering the graphene films suitable for applications as flexible electrodes. Even when the films were stretched within a 20&#8201;% strain and repeatedly bent vertically, the light&#8208;emitting diodes maintained an on&#8208;state with little changes in brightness. Additionally, the film electrodes effectively actuated mechanical joints, enabling uninterrupted grasping movements. Therefore, the study holds promise for expanding the application of graphene films and simultaneously inspiring the development of other high&#8208;performance two&#8208;dimensional films.

         <title>Sucrose&#8208;Powered Liposome Nanosensors for Urinary Glucometer&#8208;Based Monitoring of Cancer</title>

Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer presents a tremendous opportunity to enhance prognostic outcomes, and there is an increasing desire for sensitive and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection tools. We present a liposome nanosensor for sensitive urinalysis&#8208;based cancer monitoring by using sucrose to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into a glucose meter&#8208;compatible readout. Such a non&#8208;invasive diagnostic platform assists in the personalized assessment of pharmacological efficacy.







Abstract
Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer holds immense potential in enhancing prognostic outcomes. There is an increasing desire for versatile tools to enable simple, sensitive, and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection. By exploiting the extraintestinal metabolic inertness and efficiency renal clearance of sucrose, we designed a liposome nanosensor using sucrose as a messenger to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into glucose meter readout, enabling economical and sensitive urinalysis for cancer detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT). Our results demonstrate that the nanosensors exhibited significant signal differences between tumor&#8208;bearing and healthy mice in both orthotopic and metastatic tumor models. Additionally, efficient elimination of the nanosensors through the hepatobiliary pathway was observed with no significant toxicity. Such a non&#8208;invasive diagnostic modality significantly assists in personalized pharmacological treatment and follow&#8208;up efficacy assessment. We envision that this modular liposome nanosensor platform might be applied for economically detecting diverse diseases via a simple urinary test.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Concentration Mediating Asymmetric Transformations of Silver Nanoclusters: NIR&#8208;II Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Lighting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>

Chiral ligand&#8208;concentration mediating asymmetric transformations of silver nanoclusters realize visible and second near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized phosphorescences.







Abstract
Near infrared (NIR) emitter with circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), known as NIR CPP, has emerged as a key part in the research of cutting&#8208;edge luminescent materials. However, it remains a challenge to obtain nanoclusters with NIR CPP activity. Here, we propose an asymmetric transformation approach to efficiently synthesize two pairs of chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag29 and R/S&#8208;Ag16) using an achiral Ag10 nanocluster as starting material in the presence of different concentration chiral inducer (R/S)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (R/S&#8208;BNP). R/S&#8208;Ag29, formed in the low&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, exhibits a unique kernel&#8208;shell structure consisting of a distorted Ag13 icosahedron and an integrated cage&#8208;like organometallic shell with a C3 symmetry, and possesses a superatomic 6&#8208;electron configuration (1S2|1P4). By contrast, R/S&#8208;Ag16, formed in the high&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, features a sandwich&#8208;like pentagram with AgI&#8208;pure kernel. Profiting from the hierarchically chiral structures and superatomic kernel&#8208;dominated phosphorescence, R/S&#8208;Ag29 exhibits infrequent CPP activity in the second near&#8208;infrared (975&#8197;nm) region, being the first instance of NIR&#8208;II CPP observed among CPL&#8208;active metal nanoclusters. This study presents a new approach to reduce the difficulty of de novo synthesis for chiral silver nanomaterials, and facilitates the design of CPP&#8208;active superatomic nanoclusters in NIR region.

         <title>Assembly of Glycopeptides in Living Cells Resembling Viral Infection for Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosylated peptide is designed to formulate SgVEIP that exhibits cancer cell targeting and enzyme&#8208;responsive properties arising from the galactose&#8208;galectin&#8208;1 association and galactosidase&#8208;induced hydrolysis. Precursor SgVEIP undergoes an in situ cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation assembly resembling to viral infection in a holistic manner, thus allowing for efficient delivery of irinotecan and peptide drugs to kill cancer cells.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly in living cells represents one versatile strategy for drug delivery; however, it suffers from the limited precision and efficiency. Inspired by viral traits, we here report a cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation (THT) assembly of glycosylated peptides in living cells holistically resembling viral infection for efficient cargo delivery and combined tumor therapy. We design a glycosylated peptide via incorporating a &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8208;serine residue into bola&#8208;amphiphilic sequences. Co&#8208;assembling of the glycosylated peptide with two counterparts containing irinotecan (IRI) or ligand TSFAEYWNLLSP (PMI) results in formation of the glycosylated co&#8208;assemblies SgVEIP, which target cancer cells via &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8208;galectin&#8208;1 association and undergo galactosidase&#8208;induced morphological transformation. While GSH&#8208;reduction causes release of IRI from the co&#8208;assemblies, the PMI moieties release p53 and facilitate cell death via binding with protein MDM2. Cellular experiments show membrane targeting, endo&#8208;/lysosome&#8208;mediated internalization and in situ formation of nanofibers in cytoplasm by SgVEIP. This cascade THT process enables efficient delivery of IRI and PMI into cancer cells secreting Gal&#8208;1 and overexpressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. In vivo studies illustrate enhanced tumor accumulation and retention of the glycosylated co&#8208;assemblies, thereby suppressing tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate an in situ assembly strategy mimicking viral infection, thus providing a new route for drug delivery and cancer therapy in the future.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Potential Methanol Oxidation on Single&#8208;Ir&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the coupling of thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis, methanol was first thermally catalyzed to decompose to CO and H2 under the voltage promotion, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton at ultra&#8208;low onset potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) over the the electron&#8208;deficient IrC4 sites, which strongly adsorb the methanol to break H&#8722;O/H&#8722;C.







Abstract
Methanol oxidation plays a central role to implement sustainable energy economy, which is restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics due to the multi&#8208;electron transfer process accompanied by numerous sequential intermediate. In this study, an efficient cascade methanol oxidation reaction is catalyzed by single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalyst at ultra&#8208;low potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) with the promotion of the thermal and electrochemical integration in a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. At the elevated temperature, the electron deficient Ir site with higher methanol affinity could spontaneous catalyze the CH3OH dehydrogenation to CO under the voltage, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton. However, the methanol cannot thermally decompose with the voltage absence, which confirm the indispensable of the coupling of thermal and electrochemical integration for the methanol oxidation. By assembling the methanol oxidation reaction with hydrogen evolution reaction with single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalysts in the anode chamber, a max hydrogen production rate reaches 18&#8197;mol&#8201;gIr&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is much greater than that of Ir nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C. This study also demonstrated the electrochemical methanol oxidation activity of the single atom catalysts, which broadens the renewable energy devices and the catalyst design by an integration concept.

         <title>Dilute RuCo Alloy Synergizing Single Ru and Co Atoms as Efficient and CO&#8208;Resistant Anode Catalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>

Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, stable, and CO resistant alkaline HOR electrocatalysts are crucial for achieving the application of AEMFCs. (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT with and dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and highly dispersed Ru and Co single atoms can achieve efficient alkaline HOR, with superior stability and outstanding CO resistance. When used (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT to AEMFC anode catalyst, AEMFCs can achieve high peak power density with low noble metal loading (1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a load of 0.1&#8197;mgRu&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered a promising candidate catalyst for alkaline hydroxide oxidation reaction (HOR) due to its hydrogen binding energy (HBE) like that of platinum (Pt) and its much higher oxygenophilicity than that of Pt. However, Ru still suffers from insufficient intrinsic activity and CO resistance, which hinders its widespread use in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a hybrid catalyst (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT consisting of dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and atomically single Ru and Co atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes The catalyst exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity with a high mass activity of 7.35&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1. More importantly, when (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT is used as an anode catalyst for AEMFCs, its peak power density reaches 1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is one of the best AEMFCs properties of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts at present. Moreover, (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT has superior long&#8208;time stability and CO resistance. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the dilute alloying and monodecentralization of the exotic element Co greatly modulates the electronic structure of the host element Ru, thus optimizing the adsorption of H and OH and promoting the oxidation of CO on the catalyst surface, and then stimulates alkaline HOR activity and CO tolerance of the catalyst.

         <title>Autophagy&#8208;Inducing MoO3&#8208;x Nanowires Boost Photothermal&#8208;Triggered Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy acts as a photothermal agent in combination with photothermal therapy to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus induces pro&#8208;death function of autophagy, and increases the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to act as an effective specific immunostimulant, finally promotes immunogenic cell death in tumor therapy.







Abstract
Autophagy could play suppressing role in cancer therapy by facilitating release of tumor antigens from dying cells and inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Therefore, discovery and rational design of more effective inducers of cytotoxic autophagy is expected to develop new strategies for finding innovative drugs for precise and successful cancer treatment. Herein, we develop MoO3&#8208;x nanowires (MoO3&#8208;x NWs) with high oxygen vacancy and strong photothermal responsivity to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus promote the induction of cytotoxic autophagy and severe ICD. As expected, the combination of MoO3&#8208;x NWs and photothermal therapy (PTT) effectively induces autophagy to promote the release of tumor antigens from the ablated cells, and induces the maturation and antigen presentation of dendritic cells (DCs), subsequently activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;mediated adaptive immunity. Furthermore, the combination treatment of MoO3&#8208;x NWs with immune checkpoint blockade of PD&#8208;1 could promote the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization into tumor&#8208;killing M1 macrophages, inhibit infiltration of Treg cells at tumor sites, and alleviate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, finally intensify the anti&#8208;tumor activity in vivo. This study provides a strategy and preliminary elucidation of the mechanism of using MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy to induce autophagy and thus enhance photothermal immunotherapy.

As expected, the combination of MoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; NWs and photothermal therapy (PTT) effectively induces autophagy to promote the release of tumor antigens from the ablated cells, and induces the maturation and antigen presentation of dendritic cells (DCs), subsequently activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)-mediated adaptive immunity. Furthermore, the combination treatment of MoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; NWs with immune checkpoint blockade of PD-1 could promote the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization into tumor-killing M1 macrophages, inhibit infiltration of Treg cells at tumor sites, and alleviate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, finally intensify the anti-tumor activity in vivo. This study provides a strategy and preliminary elucidation of the mechanism of using MoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires with high oxygen vacancy to induce autophagy and thus enhance photothermal immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Frameworks Based on Multiple Dynamic Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs) are prepared based on covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale production can be achieved at low cost, alongside excellent solution processibility, paving the way to diverse applications. Remarkably, the CPOFs exhibit exceptionally high NH3 uptake capacities, indicating their great potential toward NH3 capture.







Abstract
A novel class of crystalline porous materials has been developed utilizing multilevel dynamic linkages, including covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Typically, boronic acids undergo in situ condensation to afford B3O3&#8208;based units, which further extend to molecular complexes or chains via B&#8592;N bonds. The obtained superstructures are subsequently interconnected via hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, producing crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs). The CPOFs display excellent solution processability, allowing dissolution and subsequent crystallization to their original structures, independent of recrystallization conditions, possibly due to the diverse bond energies of the involved interactions. Significantly, the CPOFs can be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale using cost&#8208;effective monomers. In addition, the numerous acidic sites endow the CPOFs with high NH3 capacity, surpassing most porous organic materials and commercial materials.

         <title>On the Dendrite&#8208;Suppressing Effect of Laser&#8208;Processed Polylactic Acid&#8208;Derived Carbon Coated Zinc Anode in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare Zn metal when used as anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), is prone to dendrite formation and parasitic side reactions due to uneven Zn deposition on its surface. A porous carbon layer derived from the laser&#8208;assisted carbonization of bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) on Zn metal effectively mitigates the formation of dendrites and parasitic side reactions on the Zn anode, thereby enhancing the stability and lifespan of the battery.







Abstract
A major bottleneck limiting the commercialization of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is dendrite formation on the zinc (Zn) anode during the plating/stripping process, which leads to rapid deterioration in performance and, consequently to the device failure. In this regard, researchers are trying to design more stable anodes toward suppressing dendrite formation. One possible solution to tackle this problem and to extend the cycling life of AZIBs is to modify the zinc anode surface by coating carbonaceous materials, enabling more controlled charge flux and uniform ion distribution. This work reports sustainable and bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) as a coating layer on the zinc anode. Carbonizing this polymer under ambient conditions using a high&#8208;power nanosecond laser forms a carbon&#8208;coated zinc foil, which was directly utilized as the anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The fabricated laser&#8208;processed PLA&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;coated zinc anode demonstrated an extended cycling life of almost 1600&#8197;hours, significantly outperforming the bare zinc anode. A full aqueous zinc ion battery assembled from as&#8208;modified anode and as&#8208;prepared V2O5 nanofibers as cathode was able to deliver a specific capacity of 238&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 70&#8201;% after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Silylenes with a Small Chalcogenide Substituent: Tuning Frontier Orbital Energies from O to Te</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic dicoordinated silylenes with small chalcogenide substituents were prepared and characterised, enabled by a bulky carbazolyl scaffold. The electronic properties change dramatically from O to Te, with decreasing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and increasing chemical shift of the 29Si NMR resonances.







Abstract
The general synthesis of heteroleptic acyclic silylenes with a bulky carbazolyl substituent (dtbpCbz) is detailed and a series of compounds with a chalcogenide substituent of the type [(dtbpCbz)SiE16R] (E16R=OtBu, SEt, SePh, TePh) is reported. With the bulky carbazolyl substituent present, the chalcogenide moiety can be very small, as is shown by incorporating groups as small as ethyl, phenyl or tert&#8208;butyl. For the first time, the electronic properties of the silylene can be tuned along a complete series of chalcogenide substituents. The effects are clearly visible in the NMR and UV/Vis spectra, and were rationalised by DFT computations. The reactivity of the heaviest chalcogenide&#8208;substituted silylenes was probed by reactions with trimethylphosphine selenide and the terphenyl azide TerN3 (Ter=2,6&#8208;dimesitylphenyl).

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Regulating D&#8208;Orbital Spin&#8208;Electron Filling in Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst, we implemented an asymmetric coordination within the first coordination shell of Fe site. The creation of the Fe&#8722;N3O configuration, characterized by asymmetrical oxygen coordination and adjacent defect, caused electrons in d orbitals from low&#8208;spin state to a medium&#8208;spin state. This optimization effectively weakened the adsorption of oxygen species and altered the potential&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst has shown great promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the intrinsic activity is not satisfactory. There is a pressing need to gain a deeper understanding of the charge configuration of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and to develop rational modulation strategies. Herein, we have prepared a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst with the co&#8208;coordination of N and O (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C) and adjacent defect, proposing a strategy to optimize the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron filling of Fe sites by fine&#8208;tuning the first coordination shell. The Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C exhibits significantly better ORR activity compared to its Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart and commercial Pt/C, with a much more positive half&#8208;wave potential (0.927&#8197;V) and higher kinetic current density. Moreover, using the Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C catalyst, the Zn&#8208;air battery and proton exchange membrane fuel cell achieve peak power densities of up to 490 and 1179&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Theoretical studies and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C undergoes charge redistribution and negative shifting of the d&#8208;band center compared to Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, thus optimizing the adsorption free energy of ORR intermediates. This work demonstrates the feasibility of introducing an asymmetric first coordination shell for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides a new optimization direction for their practical application.

         <title>Rapid Defect Engineering in FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 Hybrid for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis: A Pathway to High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the defect engineering, ultrasonic cavitation was utilized to rapidly introduce different types of defects into a FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 coating to increase edge unsaturated active sites. Simultaneously, different defects synergistically enhance the oxygenophilicity character, allowing the coating to activate the surface reconstruction into highly active catalytic species at low potential.







Abstract
Rational modulation of surface reconstruction in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers is a topical interest in the field of catalysis. The introduction of point defects has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to regulate the electronic configuration of electrocatalysts, but the influence of more complex planar defects (e.g., twins and stacking faults), on their intrinsic activity is still not fully understood. This study harnesses ultrasonic cavitation for rapid and controlled introduction of different types of defects in the FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 hybrid coating, optimizing OER catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the different defects optimize the coordination environment and facilitate the activation of surface reconstruction into true catalytic activity centers at lower potentials. Moreover, it demonstrates exceptional durability, maintaining stable oxygen production at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 120&#8197;hours. This work not only presents a novel pathway for designing advanced electrocatalysts but also deepens our understanding of defect&#8208;engineered catalytic mechanisms, showcasing the potential for rapid and efficient enhancement of electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Tunable Interfacial Electric Field&#8208;Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 Heterostructure for High&#8208;Efficiency Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 (UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5) heterostructure with optimized interfacial electric field (IEF) is designed and fabricated for high&#8208;efficiency potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) anodes. The IEF intensity in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 is 3.65&#8197;times that of pure FeSe/Fe3Se4. Intriguingly, this uniform doping strategy has strong generality in improving IEF strength and PIB performance. As expected, amorphous carbon&#8208;coated UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (95.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
The interfacial electric field (IEF) in the heterostructure can accelerate electron transport and ion migration, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Nevertheless, the quantification and modulation of the IEF for high&#8208;efficiency PIB anodes currently remains a blank slate. Herein, we achieve for the first time the quantification and tuning of IEF via amorphous carbon&#8208;coated undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (denoted UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C) for efficient potassium storage. Co doping can increase the IEF in FeSe/Fe3Se4, thereby improving the electron transport, promoting the potassium adsorption capacity, and lowering the diffusion barrier. As expected, the IEF magnitude in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C is experimentally quantified as 62.84&#8197;mV, which is 3.65&#8197;times larger than that of amorphous carbon&#8208;coated FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (Fe4Se5/C). Benefiting from the strong IEF, UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C as a PIB anode exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle lifespan (capacity retention of 95.1&#8201;% over 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Furthermore, this undifferentiated doping strategy can universally regulate the IEF magnitude in CoSe2/Co9Se8 and FeS2/Fe7S8 heterostructures. This work can provide fundamental insights into the design of advanced PIB electrodes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Photochemical C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated bis(diiminopyridine)cobalt complex enables the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles with chloro&#8208; and bromoarenes. Spectroscopic and computational studies elucidate the photoelectron transfer processes of the metal complex with triethylamine and a bromoarene, suggesting that electron transfer is facilitated by a preassembly of these molecules with the complex.







Abstract
Precious metal complexes remain ubiquitous in photoredox catalysis (PRC) despite concerted efforts to find more earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and replacements based on 3d metals in particular. Most otherwise plausible 3d metal complexes are assumed to be unsuitable due to short&#8208;lived excited states, which has led researchers to prioritize the pursuit of longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes through careful molecular design. However, we report herein that the C&#8722;H arylation of pyrroles and related substrates (which are benchmark reactions for assessing the efficacy of photoredox catalysts) can be achieved using a simple and readily accessible octahedral bis(diiminopyridine) cobalt complex, [1&#8208;Co](PF6)2. Notably, [1&#8208;Co]2+ efficiently functionalizes both chloro&#8208; and bromoarene substrates despite the short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the key photoexcited intermediate *[1&#8208;Co]2+ (8&#8197;ps). We present herein the scope of this C&#8722;H arylation protocol and provide mechanistic insights derived from detailed spectroscopic and computational studies. These indicate that, despite its transient existence, reduction of *[1&#8208;Co]2+ is facilitated via pre&#8208;assembly with the NEt3 reductant, highlighting an alternative strategy for the future development of 3d metal&#8208;catalyzed PRC.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich RuO2 Porous Nanosheet for Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) was synthesized as an efficient acid OER catalyst. Grain boundaries effectively regulated the electronic structure of the active site and optimized the adsorption behavior of intermediates, but also stabilized the active site structure by preventing Ru dissolution and converting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM).







Abstract
RuO2 has been considered as the most likely acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst to replace IrO2, but its performance, especially long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic conditions, is still unacceptable. Here, we propose a grain boundary (GB) engineering strategy by fabricating the ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) as an efficient acid OER catalyst. The involvement of GB induces significant tensile stress and creates an unsaturated coordination environment, effectively optimizing the adsorption of intermediates and stabilizing active site structure during OER process. Notably, the GB&#8208;RuO2 not only exhibits a low overpotential (&#951;10=187&#8197;mV) with an ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), but also steadily operates for over 550&#8197;h in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4. Quasi in situ/operando methods confirm that the improved stability is attributed to GB preventing Ru dissolution and greatly inhibiting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). A proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) using the GB&#8208;RuO2 catalyst operates a low voltage of 1.669&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operates stably for 100&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

Notably, the GB-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; not only exhibits a low overpotential (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;=187&#8197;mV) with an ultra-low Tafel slope (34.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), but also steadily operates for over 550&#8197;h in 0.1&#8197;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Quasi in situ/operando methods confirm that the improved stability is attributed to GB preventing Ru dissolution and greatly inhibiting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). A proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) using the GB-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst operates a low voltage of 1.669&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and operates stably for 100&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An optomagnetic hybrid micromotor was developed using an optimized silicon&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell. The micromotor displays diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment. Additionally, an innovative hole&#8208;assisted assembly strategy is introduced, facilitating assembly into functional microrobots and enabling precise cell manipulation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven micro/nanorobots (LMNRs) are tiny, untethered machines with great potential in fields like precision medicine, nano manufacturing, and various other domains. However, their practicality hinges on developing light&#8208;manipulation strategies that combine versatile functionalities, flexible design options, and precise controllability. Our study introduces an innovative approach to construct micro/nanorobots (MNRs) by utilizing micro/nanomotors as fundamental building blocks. Inspired by silicon Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell principles, we design a new type of optomagnetic hybrid micromotors (OHMs). These OHMs have been skillfully optimized with integrated magnetic constituent, resulting in efficient light propulsion, precise magnetic navigation, and the potential for controlled assembly. One of the key features of the OHMs is their ability to exhibit diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment, streamlining cargo conveyance along &#8220;micro expressway&#8221;&#8212;the predesigned microchannels. Further enhancing their versatility, a template&#8208;guided assembly strategy facilitates the assembly of these micromotors into functional microrobots, encompassing various configurations such as &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8208;shaped&#8221;, and 3D structured microrobots. The heightened capabilities of these microrobots, underscore the innovative potential inherent in hybrid micromotor design and assembly, which provides a foundational platform for the realization of multi&#8208;component microrobots. Our work moves a step toward forthcoming microrobotic entities boasting advanced functionalities.

         <title>Single&#8208;cluster Functionalized TiO2 Nanotube Array for Boosting Water Oxidation and CO2 Photoreduction to CH3OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile electrosynthesis strategy was developed to achieve single dispersion of various POMs on TiO2 nanotube array. The POMs can serve as electronic sponge to store multi&#8208;electrons thus greatly improving the surface hole concentration to promote water oxidation. The left electron on P2Mo18@TiO2 can effeiciently drive CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with much enhanced performance compared to that of pristine TiO2 nanoarray.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and water oxidation to liquid fuels represents a promising solution to alleviate energy crisis and climate issue, but it remains a great challenge for generating CH3OH and CH3CH2OH dominated by multi&#8208;electron transfer. Single&#8208;cluster catalysts with super electron acceptance, accurate molecular structure, customizable electronic structure and multiple adsorption sites, have led to greater potential in catalyzing various challenging reactions. However, accurately controlling the number and arrangement of clusters on functional supports still faces great challenge. Herein, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to uniformly disperse Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208; and Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates on TiO2 nanotube arrays, resulting in a series of single&#8208;cluster functionalized catalysts P2M18O62@TiO2 and PM12O40@TiO2 (M=Mo or W). The single polyoxometalate cluster can be distinctly identified and serves as electronic sponge to accept electrons from excited TiO2 for enhancing surface&#8208;hole concentration and promote water oxidation. Among these samples, P2Mo18O62@TiO2&#8208;1 exhibits the highest electron consumption rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with H2O as the electron source, which is 11&#8197;times higher than that of isolated TiO2 nanotube arrays. This work supplied a simple synthesis method to realize the single&#8208;dispersion of molecular cluster to enrich surface&#8208;reaching holes on TiO2, thereby facilitating water oxidation and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Hyperbranched Vitrimer for Ultrahigh Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers have been utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effectively dissipate energy as heat during service. Our work firstly presents hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks, which exhibit ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency range of nearly 10 orders of magnitude. This innovative design concept will provide opportunities for the further development of damping materials with multiple synergistic effects.







Abstract
Polymers are ideally utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effective suppression of vibrations and noises in various fields. Current strategies rely on broadening the glass transition region or introducing additional relaxation components to enhance the energy dissipation capacity of polymeric damping materials. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve high damping efficiency through structural control while maintaining dynamic characteristics. In this work, we propose a new strategy to develop hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks. A novel yet weak dynamic transesterification between the carboxyl and boronic acid ester was confirmed and used to prepare HBVs based on poly (hexyl methacrylate&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;ethenylphenyl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborinane) P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) copolymers. The

&#8208;type of macromonomers, the crosslinking points formed by the dynamic covalent connection via the associative exchange, and the weak yet dynamic exchange reaction are the three keys to developing high&#8208;performance HBV damping materials. We found that P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) 20k&#8208;40&#8208;60&#8197;HBV exhibited ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency and temperature range, attributed to the synergistic effect of dense pendant chains and weak dynamic covalent crosslinks. This unique design concept will provide a general approach to developing advanced damping materials.

         <title>Enrooted&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supported metal catalyst with new enrooted&#8208;type metal&#8208;support interaction, where the Ir clusters atomically enrooted into the lattice of WO3 support, has been synthesized through a facile approach, achieving a stable metal&#8208;support interface and maximized exposure of metal active sites.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts with appropriate metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs) hold a great promise for heterogeneous catalysis. However, ensuring tight immobilization of metal clusters/nanoparticles on the support while maximizing the exposure of surface active sites remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report an Ir/WO3 catalyst with a new enrooted&#8208;type MSI in which Ir clusters are, unprecedentedly, atomically enrooted into the WO3 lattice. The enrooted Ir atoms decrease the electron density of the constructed interface compared to the adhered (root&#8208;free) type, thereby achieving appropriate adsorption toward oxygen intermediates, ultimately leading to high activity and stability for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Importantly, this work provides a new enrooted&#8208;type supported metal catalyst, which endows suitable MSI and maximizes the exposure of surface active sites in contrast to the conventional adhered, embedded, and encapsulated types.

The enrooted Ir atoms decrease the electron density of the constructed interface compared to the adhered (root-free) type, thereby achieving appropriate adsorption toward oxygen intermediates, ultimately leading to high activity and stability for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Importantly, this work provides a new enrooted-type supported metal catalyst, which endows suitable MSI and maximizes the exposure of surface active sites in contrast to the conventional adhered, embedded, and encapsulated types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Charge Transfer Cocrystals with Dynamically Reversible Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting Display Chain Length&#8208;Selective Vapochromism to Alkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral macrocycle&#8208;based cocrystal system that undergoes dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism to alkyl ketones. The unique vapochromic behavior was mainly due to different solid&#8208;state superstructures and noncovalent interactions from the homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting plays an essential role in controlling the biofunction of biosystems, such as the chiral double&#8208;helix structure of DNA from self&#8208;recognition by hydrogen bonding. However, achieving precise control over the chiral self&#8208;sorted structures and their functional properties for the bioinspired supramolecular systems still remains a challenge, not to mention realizing dynamically reversible regulation. Herein, we report an unprecedented saucer[4]arene&#8208;based charge transfer (CT) cocrystal system with dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting synergistically induced by chiral triangular macrocycle and organic vapors. It displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism toward alkyl ketones due to precise modulation of optical properties by vapor&#8208;induced diverse structural transformations. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the unique vapochromic behavior is mainly attributed to the formation of homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;sorted assemblies with different alkyl ketone guests, which differ dramatically in solid&#8208;state superstructures and CT interactions, thus influencing their optical properties. This work highlights the essential role of chiral self&#8208;sorting in controlling the functional properties of synthetic supramolecular systems, and the rarely seen controllable chiral self&#8208;sorting at the solid&#8208;vapor interface deepens the understanding of efficient vapochromic sensors.

A hexagonal prism&#8208;shaped crystal known as KBCOB, renowned for its exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation response and high transparency in the deep ultraviolet spectrum, is shown on the cover image. At the center of the image, the crystal's chemical structure is depicted. This structure consists of a tri&#8208;layered arrangement of green, multifaceted polyhedral units [B4O5(OH)4]2&#8722; representing the borate's boron&#8208;oxygen framework. Uniquely, the center of the crystal features a rarely reported superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; configuration, as demonstrated by Chi Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202403328).

THz spectra of aqueous solutions at ambient conditions encode precious information about H&#8208;bonding, but what about aqueous solutions at supercritical conditions? In their Research Article (e202402120) on neutral gold particles in supercritical water Jan Noetzel et&#8197;al. show that a broad continuum absorption comes from the metal particles while an additional sharp THz resonance is due to strongly interacting water.

Photocatalytic electron transfer commonly depends on scarce and precious transition metals like Ru and Ir due to their exceptional photophysical properties. In their Research Article (e202405780), Patrick Nuernberger, Regina de&#8197;Vivie&#8208;Riedle, Robert Wolf et&#8197;al. present an alternative approach using readily available complexes with earth&#8208;abundant 3d metals. Despite their short excited&#8208;state lifetimes, photocatalysis is made possible by dispersive preassembly in the ground state, opening exciting opportunities for new catalytic applications in organic synthesis.

A photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive probe for imaging inner mitochondrial membranes is presented by Masayasu Taki, Shigehiro Yamaguchi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404328). The probe can visualize the lipid properties of the membranes as it alters spatiotemporally in living cells. Peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the inner membrane results in membrane remodeling, which leads to an increase in membrane order.

         <title>Recent Progress in Using Covalent Organic Frameworks to Stabilize Metal Anodes for Highly&#8208;Efficient Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a comprehensive discussion of the advantages and challenges of alkali metals and multivalent metals as anodes, this minireview summarizes the latest progress on the application of COFs in electrode engineering, electrolyte optimization, and separator modification. Emphasis is placed on new insights into the synthesis, design, and characterization analysis of COFs to effectively improve metal anode performance.







Abstract
Alkali metals (e.g. Li, Na, and K) and multivalent metals (e.g. Zn, Mg, Ca, and Al) have become star anodes for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and excellent conductivity. However, the inevitable dendrites and unstable interfaces of metal anodes pose challenges to the safety and stability of batteries. To address these issues, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as emerging materials, have been widely investigated due to their regular porous structure, flexible molecular design, and high specific surface area. In this minireview, we summarize the research progress of COFs in stabilizing metal anodes. First, we present the research origins of metal anodes and delve into their advantages and challenges as anodes based on the physical/chemical properties of alkali and multivalent metals. Then, special attention has been paid to the application of COFs in the host design of metal anodes, artificial solid electrolyte interfaces, electrolyte additives, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and separator modifications. Finally, a new perspective is provided for the research of metal anodes from the molecular design, pore modulation, and synthesis of COFs.

         <title>To DISP or Not? The Far&#8208;Reaching Reaction Mechanisms Underpinning Lithium&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Views on the mechanism of metal&#8208;air batteries have seen a remarkable number of U&#8208;turns, which changed paradigms on how to improve performance. The latest findings show that the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism emerges as the pivot point for explaining rate and capacity limitation as well as the origin of side reactions. Therefrom, directions emerge for materials design to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.







Abstract
The short history of research on Li&#8722;O2 batteries has seen a remarkable number of mechanistic U&#8208;turns over the years. From the initial use of carbonate electrolytes, that were then found to be entirely unsuitable, to the belief that (su)peroxide was solely responsible for degradation, before the more reactive singlet oxygen was found to form, to the hypothesis that capacity depends on a competing surface/solution mechanism before a practically exclusive solution mechanism was identified. Herein, we argue for an ever&#8208;fresh look at the reported data without bias towards supposedly established explanations. We explain how the latest findings on rate and capacity limits, as well as the origin of side reactions, are connected via the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism. Therefrom, directions emerge for the design of electrolytes and mediators on how to suppress side reactions and to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.

         <title>An Unprecedented [BO2]&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal by Superhalogen Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV transparent NLO oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2) has been synthesized by an ambient aqueous evaporation method. It possesses a strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG, a short UV absorption edge, and a significantly enlarged birefringence by a superhalogen substitution strategy.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state structures with the superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; have thus far only been observed with a few compounds whose syntheses require high reaction temperatures and complicated procedures, while their optical properties remain almost completely unexplored. Herein, we report a facile, energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of the first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) transparent oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O (KBCOB). Detailed structural characterization and analysis confirm that KBCOB possesses a rare four&#8208;in&#8208;one three&#8208;dimensional quasi&#8208;honeycomb framework, with three &#960;&#8208;conjugated anions ([BO2]&#8722;, [BO3]3&#8722;, and [CO3]2&#8722;) and one non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated anion ([BO4]5&#8722;) in the one crystal. The evolution from the traditional halogenated nonlinear optical (NLO) analogues to KBCOB by superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; substitution confers deep&#8208;UV transparency (&lt;190&#8197;nm), a large second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.0&#215;KH2PO4 @&#8197;1064&#8197;nm), and a 15&#8208;fold increase in birefringence. This study affords a new route to the facile synthesis of functional [BO2]&#8208;based oxides, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performing deep&#8208;UV NLO materials.

&lt;p&gt;The first [BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]-based deep-UV transparent NLO oxide K&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has been synthesized by an ambient aqueous evaporation method. It possesses a strong phase-matchable SHG, a short UV absorption edge, and a significantly enlarged birefringence by a superhalogen substitution strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state structures with the superhalogen [BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; have thus far only been observed with a few compounds whose syntheses require high reaction temperatures and complicated procedures, while their optical properties remain almost completely unexplored. Herein, we report a facile, energy-efficient synthesis of the first [BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]-based deep-ultraviolet (deep-UV) transparent oxide K&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (KBCOB). Detailed structural characterization and analysis confirm that KBCOB possesses a rare four-in-one three-dimensional quasi-honeycomb framework, with three &#960;-conjugated anions ([BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, [BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and one non-&#960;-conjugated anion ([BO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in the one crystal. The evolution from the traditional halogenated nonlinear optical (NLO) analogues to KBCOB by superhalogen [BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; substitution confers deep-UV transparency (&amp;lt;190&#8197;nm), a large second-harmonic generation response (1.0&#215;KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; @&#8197;1064&#8197;nm), and a 15-fold increase in birefringence.

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Trisulfides from S&#8208;Substituted Sulphenylthiosulphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general and efficient approach for accessing unsymmetrical trisulfides through an I2&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphates (RSSSO3Na), alkyl electrophiles and thiourea. This is the first report on utilizing RSSSO3Na as disulfurating reagent and provides a convenient method for converting bromides, chlorides, iodides and tosylates into trisulfides.







Abstract
Trisulfide unit is widely found in natural products and has garnered attention due to the unique pharmacological and physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, widely applicable approaches for constructing unsymmetrical trisulfides have so far remain scarce. In this work, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, solid&#8208;state and scalable reagent, S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphate, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical trisulfides. Alkyl electrophile substrates, including bromides, chlorides, iodides and tosylates, with diverse substituents are smoothly converted to the corresponding trisulfides with S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphates and thiourea as another sulfur source. Furthermore, the late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules was successfully achieved through this method.

         <title>Kinase Inhibition via Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Protein Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report ynamide&#8208;based, small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. This strategy exploits the close distance between highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues present in almost all protein kinases, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and cellular potency.







Abstract
Remarkable progress has been made in the development of cysteine&#8208;targeted covalent inhibitors. In kinase drug discovery, covalent inhibitors capable of targeting other nucleophilic residues (i.e. lysine, or K) have emerged in recent years. Besides a highly conserved catalytic lysine, almost all human protein kinases possess an equally conserved glutamate/aspartate (e.g. E/D) that forms a K&#8211;E/D salt bridge within the enzyme's active site. Electrophilic ynamides were previously used as effective peptide coupling reagents and to develop E/D&#8208;targeting covalent protein inhibitors/probes. In the present study, we report the first ynamide&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of various protein kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. Our strategy took advantage of the close distance between the highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues in a targeted kinase, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and desirable cellular potency. Finally, this ynamide&#8208;facilitated, ligand&#8208;induced mechanism leading to intramolecular kinase cross&#8208;linking and inhibition was unequivocally established by using recombinant ABL kinase as a representative.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of C4&#8208;Symmetric Axially Chiral &#946;&#8208;Aryl Porphyrins and Application for Supporting Ir(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Alkylation</title>

Cyclotetramerization of 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrroles affords a novel class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins in good yields. Both regioisomers of the Ir&#8208;complex catalyze efficiently the carbene C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins has been synthesized and the application of their iridium (Ir) complexes in catalytic asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is documented. Cyclotetramerization of enantioenriched axially chiral 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;naphthyl pyrroles under mild acidic conditions affords, after oxidation with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), the C4&#8208;symmetric &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;atropenantiomer as an only isolable diastereomer. Both regioisomeric Ir(Por*)(CO)(Cl) complexes catalyze the carbene C&#8722;H insertion reaction affording the same enantiomer, albeit with slight difference in enantioselectivity. With the optimum Ir&#8208;complex 3&#8201;e, the 2&#8208;substituted arylacetic acid derivatives were generated from diazo compounds and cyclohexadiene in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed and Pnictogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Access to PIII&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral PIII compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis was developed. The Lewis acidic P center simultaneously activate the bonded formyl group and stabilize the conformation of Breslow intermediates, it may help to achieve high stereo and regio&#8208;selectivities. Following the oxidation of the Breslow intermediate, nucleophile facilitates recycling of NHC to generate enantioenriched trivalent phosphorus compounds.







Abstract
Intermolecular pnictogen bonding (PnB) catalysis has received increased interest in non&#8208;covalent organocatalysis. It has been demonstrated that organic electron&#8208;deficient pnictogen atoms can act as prospective Lewis acids. Here, we present a catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral PIII compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis. Our design features a pre&#8208;chiral phosphorus molecule bearing two electron&#8208;withdrawing benzoyl groups, resulting in the formation of a &#963;&#8208;hole at the P atom. X&#8208;ray and non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) analysis indicate that the model substrates exhibit intrinsic PnB interaction between the oxygen atom of the formyl group and the phosphorus atom. This induces a conformational locking effect, leading to the crystallization of the phosphorus substrate in a preferred conformation (P212121 chiral group). Under the catalysis of N&#8211;heterocyclic carbene, the aldehyde moiety activated by the pnictogen bond selectively reacts with an alcohol to yield the corresponding chiral monoester/phosphorus product with excellent enantioselectivity. This Lewis acidic phosphorus center, aroused by the non&#8208;polarized intramolecular pnictogen bond interaction, assists in conformational and selective regulations, providing unique opportunities for catalysis and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;A catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis was developed. The Lewis acidic P center simultaneously activate the bonded formyl group and stabilize the conformation of Breslow intermediates, it may help to achieve high stereo and regio-selectivities. Following the oxidation of the Breslow intermediate, nucleophile facilitates recycling of NHC to generate enantioenriched trivalent phosphorus compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermolecular pnictogen bonding (PnB) catalysis has received increased interest in non-covalent organocatalysis. It has been demonstrated that organic electron-deficient pnictogen atoms can act as prospective Lewis acids. Here, we present a catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis. Our design features a pre-chiral phosphorus molecule bearing two electron-withdrawing benzoyl groups, resulting in the formation of a &#963;-hole at the P atom. X-ray and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis indicate that the model substrates exhibit intrinsic PnB interaction between the oxygen atom of the formyl group and the phosphorus atom. This induces a conformational locking effect, leading to the crystallization of the phosphorus substrate in a preferred conformation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; chiral group). Under the catalysis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;heterocyclic carbene, the aldehyde moiety activated by the pnictogen bond selectively reacts with an alcohol to yield the corresponding chiral monoester/phosphorus product with excellent enantioselectivity. This Lewis acidic phosphorus center, aroused by the non-polarized intramolecular pnictogen bond interaction, assists in conformational and selective regulations, providing unique opportunities for catalysis and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Domain Swapping in Abiotic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abiotic foldamers have been shown to reproduce some of the patterns of protein folding in organic solvents, including cooperative folding transition and the accommodation of conformational strain within tertiary folds. Here, we show that a foldamer initially designed to form a quaternary structure in fact leads to a domain&#8208;swapped dimer, another pattern well&#8208;known in proteins.







Abstract
Foldamer sequences that adopt tertiary helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix folds mediated by helix&#8208;helix hydrogen bonding in organic solvents have been previously reported. In an attempt to create genuine abiotic quaternary structures, i.e. assemblies of tertiary structures, new sequences were prepared that possess additional hydrogen bond donors at positions that may promote an association between the tertiary folds. However, a solid state structure and extensive solution state investigations by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) show that, instead of forming a quaternary structure, the tertiary folds assemble into stable domain&#8208;swapped dimer motifs. Domain swapping entails a complete reorganization of the arrays of hydrogen bonds and changes in relative helix orientation and handedness that can all be rationalized.

         <title>Coupling Nano and Atomic Electric Field Confinement for Robust Alkaline Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy of nano and atomic electric field confinement enrich OH&#8722; concentration around the surface of the catalyst and facilitates *O desorption. As such, the designed Mn single atom doped CoP nanoneedles exhibit an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 189&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stability over 100&#8197;h at around 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during alkaline OER.







Abstract
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a promising avenue for producing clean fuels and storing intermittent energy. However, challenges such as excessive OH&#8722; consumption and strong adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates hinder the development of alkaline OER. In this study, we propose a cooperative strategy by leveraging both nano&#8208;scale and atomically local electric fields for alkaline OER, demonstrated through the synthesis of Mn single atom doped CoP nanoneedles (Mn SA&#8208;CoP NNs). Finite element method simulations and density functional theory calculations predict that the nano&#8208;scale local electric field enriches OH&#8722; around the catalyst surface, while the atomically local electric field improves *O desorption. Experimental validation using in situ attenuated total reflection infrared and Raman spectroscopy confirms the effectiveness of the nano&#8208;scale and atomically electric fields. Mn SA&#8208;CoP NNs exhibit an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 189&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable operation over 100&#8197;hours at ~100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during alkaline OER. This innovative strategy provides new insights for enhancing catalyst performance in energy conversion reactions.

         <title>A New Family of High Oxidation State Antiperovskite Nitrides: La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn and Mo)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) are the first examples of ternary antiperovskite (Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type) nitrides containing [MN4]6&#8722; anions for M=Cr and Mo, but for M=Mn off&#8208;stoichiometry modelled by excess&#8208;nitride clusters gives La3MnN5.30 with Mn oxidised almost to the +7 state. This is the first report of excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials, and this or other mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.







Abstract
Three new nitrides La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) have been synthesized using a high pressure azide route. These are the first examples of ternary Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type nitrides, and show that this (MN4)NLa3 antiperovskite structure type may be used to stabilise high oxidation&#8208;state transition metals in tetrahedral molecular [MN4]n&#8722; nitridometallate anions. Magnetic measurements confirm that Cr and Mo are in the M6+ state, but the M=Mn phase has an anomalously small paramagnetic moment and large cell volume. Neutron powder diffraction data are fitted using an anion&#8208;excess La3MnN5.30 model (space group I4/mcm, a=6.81587(9)&#8197;&#197; and c=11.22664(18)&#8197;&#197; at 200&#8197;K) in which Mn is close to the +7 state. Excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials has not been previously reported, and this or other substitution mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.

         <title>Molecular Wiring of Electrocatalytic Nitrate reduction to Ammonia and Water Oxidation by Iron&#8208;Coordinated Macroporous Conductive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site active iron electrocatalysts is reported by integration of a solvated iron complex in conductive organic networks. Sufficient coordinatively unsaturated active sites can be created electrochemically for simultaneous NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and H2O oxidation to O2 in basic media.







Abstract
Developing stable electrocatalysts with accessible isolated sites is desirable but highly challenging due to metal agglomeration and low surface stability of host materials. Here we report a general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site Fe electrocatalysts by integrating a solvated Fe complex in conductive macroporous organic networks through redox&#8208;active coordination linkages. Electrochemical activation of the electrode exposes high&#8208;density coordinately unsaturated Fe sites for efficient adsorption and conversion of reaction substrates such as NO3&#8722; and H2O. Using the electrode with isolated active Fe sites, electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction and H2O oxidation can be coupled in a single cell to produce NH3 and O2 at Faradaic efficiencies of 97&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. The electrode exhibits excellent robustness in electrocatalysis for 200&#8197;hours with small decrease in catalytic efficiencies. Both the maximized Fe&#8208;site efficiency and the microscopic localization effect of the conductive organic matrix contribute to the high catalytic performances, which provides new understandings in tuning the efficiencies of metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic cells.

Electrochemical activation of the electrode exposes high-density coordinately unsaturated Fe sites for efficient adsorption and conversion of reaction substrates such as NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Using the electrode with isolated active Fe sites, electrocatalytic NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation can be coupled in a single cell to produce NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at Faradaic efficiencies of 97&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. The electrode exhibits excellent robustness in electrocatalysis for 200&#8197;hours with small decrease in catalytic efficiencies. Both the maximized Fe-site efficiency and the microscopic localization effect of the conductive organic matrix contribute to the high catalytic performances, which provides new understandings in tuning the efficiencies of metal catalysts for high-performance electrocatalytic cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Olefin&#8208;Linked Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks as a Platform for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) are synthesized with uniform chiral catalytic sites on the pore walls, exhibiting satisfactory catalytic performance in enantioselective electrophilic amination reactions with good stability and recyclability.







Abstract
The construction of olefin&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity is highly desirable while remains great challenge due to the poor reversibility of the formation reaction for the olefin linkages during the in situ structural self&#8208;healing process. Herein, we successfully synthesized two sets of enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked COFs. The chiral catalytic groups are uniformly distributed on the pore walls of COFs, resulting in the full exposure of catalytic sites to the reactants in asymmetric catalysis. The as&#8208;prepared (R)/(S)&#8208;CCOF8 exhibits excellent catalytic performance with exceeding 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess in the enantioselective electrophilic amination reaction. Moreover, the heterogeneous chiral catalysts are conveniently recycled and could maintain the performance after ten catalytic cycles. Our findings expand the scope to construct stable and crystalline chiral COFs for the asymmetric catalysis.

Type&#8197;I [4&#963;+4&#960;] and [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] cycloadditions were developed to access synthetically challenging seven/eight&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). A mechanism was proposed based on kinetic and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments. Notably, one product was found to be a potent and selective liver X receptor &#946; binding ligand (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition leading to cyclooctanoids has centered on dimerization between 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;type substrates. Herein, we describe a [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] and [4&#963;+4&#960;] cycloaddition strategy to access 7/8&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between the 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs. The two pathways can be controlled by adjusting the solvated CO concentration. A broad range (&gt;40 examples) of 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 and 5&#8211;6&#8211;8 polyfused carbocycles was obtained in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). DFT calculations, kinetic monitoring and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments were carried out, suggesting a plausible mechanism. Notably, one 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 tricycle was found to be a very rare, potent, and selective ligand for the liver X receptor &#946; (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M), which is a potential therapeutic target for cholesterol&#8208;metabolism&#8208;related fatal diseases.

         <title>Water and Air Stable Copper(I) Complexes of Tetracationic Catenane Ligands for Oxidative C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I) molecular catalysts that are water soluble and stable against oxidative degradation are obtained by the strategic use of multiply charged catenane ligands. By using the new catalysts, oxidative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling is realized in water using H2O2 as a green and convenient oxidant, highlighting the potential of ligand interlocking in leveraging transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Aqueous soluble and stable Cu(I) molecular catalysts featuring a catenane ligand composed of two dicationic, mutually repelling but mechanically interlocked macrocycles are reported. The ligand interlocking not only fine&#8208;tunes the coordination sphere and kinetically stabilizes the Cu(I) against air oxidation and disproportionation, but also buries the hydrophobic portions of the ligands and prevents their dissociation which are necessary for their good water solubility and a sustained activity. These catenane Cu(I) complexes can catalyze the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of indoles and tetrahydroisoquinolines in water, using H2O2 as a green oxidant with a good substrate scope. The successful use of catenane ligands in exploiting aqueous Cu(I) catalysis thus highlights the many unexplored potential of mechanical bond as a design element for exploring transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.

         <dc:description>
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol generating chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes with high yields and selectivities has been established. It uses a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, and expands the nickel&#8208;catalysed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.







Abstract
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol to generate chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes has been established by a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, providing a straightforward and modular route to access this type of product in good yields and enantioselectivities. The halogen&#8208;atom transfer process is essential for the reaction and this novel strategy offers another promising way to utilize alkyl halides with highly negative reduction potentials. It firstly expands nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;couplings of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Formation of Supernarrow Borophene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of supernarrow borophene nanoribbons has been experimentally realized. The ribbons have a uniform width of &#8764;10&#8197;&#197; and can be as long as 200&#8197;&#197;. They are embedded in the outermost layer of Au(111) and shielded on top by evacuated Au atoms. Distinct edge states are revealed from the ribbons, which are primarily attributed to the localized spin at their zigzag edges.

Borophenes have sparked considerable interest owing to their fascinating physical characteristics and diverse polymorphism. However, borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) with widths less than 2&#8197;nm have not been achieved. Herein, we report the experimental realization of supernarrow BNRs. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy imaging with density functional theory modeling and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, under the applied growth conditions, boron atoms can penetrate the outermost layer of Au(111) and form BNRs composed of a pair of zigzag (2,2) boron rows. The BNRs have a width self&#8208;contained to &#8764;1&#8197;nm and dipoles at the edges to keep them separated. They are embedded in the outermost Au layer and shielded on top by the evacuated Au atoms, free of the need for post&#8208;passivation. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals distinct edge states, primarily attributed to the localized spin at the BNRs&#8217; zigzag edges. This work adds a new member to the boron material family and introduces a new physical feature to borophenes.

         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation is described. In the absence of expensive oxidants and external supporting electrolyte, the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in air was achieved.







Abstract
The selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds is a pivotal transformation in organic synthesis. Undoubtedly, achieving efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of methylarenes to benzaldehydes has been highly challenging due to the propensity of benzaldehyde to undergo overoxidation under typical aerobic conditions. Herein, we propose an innovative approach to address this issue by leveraging electrocatalytic processes, facilitated by ion&#8208;pair mediators [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;. By harnessing the power of electrochemistry, we successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy, which enables the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in benzylic molecules and toluene derivatives. Notably, our approach exhibited high efficiency, excellent selectivity, and compatibility with various functional groups, underscoring the broad applicability of our methodology.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of 1&#8208;Octene with [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the quantitative electro&#8208;hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes with H2O in neutral or even alkaline conditions. Electro&#8208;hydrogenation is typically driven by H+ reduction in acidic media to generate reactive metal&#8208;hydrides, which then either hydrogenate or react with H+ to liberate H2 in a parasitic process. Our work shows that H2 evolution can be suppressed by forming metal&#8208;hydrides via oxidative addition of H2O instead of H+ reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene as non&#8208;activated model substrate with neutral water as H&#8208;donor is reported, using [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] (1) as the catalyst, to form octane with high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96&#8201;% and a kobs of 87&#8197;s&#8722;1. Cyclic voltammetry with 1 revealed that two subsequent reductions trigger the elimination of Cl&#8722; and afford the highly reactive anionic Ir(I) hydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)]&#8722; (2), a previously merely proposed intermediate for which we now report first experimental data by mass spectrometry. In absence of alkene, the stoichiometric electrolysis of 1 in THF with water selectively affords the Ir(III) dihydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)2] (3) in 88&#8201;% FE from the reaction of 2 with H2O. Complex 3 then hydrogenates the alkene in classical fashion. The presented electro&#8208;hydrogenation works with extremely high FE, because the iridium hydrides are water stable, which prevents H2 formation. Even in strongly alkaline conditions (Bu4NOH added), the electro&#8208;hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene with 1 also proceeds cleanly (89&#8201;% FE), suggesting a highly robust process that may rely on H2O activation, reminiscent to transfer hydrogenation pathways, instead of classical H+ reduction. DFT calculations confirmed oxidative addition of H2O as a key step in this context.

         <title>Symmetric Electron Transfer Coordinates are Intrinsic to Bridged Systems: An ab Initio Treatment of the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We identify a symmetric dimension that is important for electron transfer or electronic localization from quantum chemical calculations and find that it naturally occurs in bridged mixed&#8208;valent systems as a consequence of the superexchange coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A long&#8208;standing question in electron transfer research concerns the number and identity of collective nuclear motions that drive electron transfer or localisation. It is well established that these nuclear motions are commonly gathered into a so&#8208;called electron transfer coordinate. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate that both anti&#8208;symmetric and symmetric vibrational motions are intrinsic to bridged systems, and that both are required to explain the characteristic shape of their intervalence charge transfer bands. Using the properties of a two&#8208;state Marcus&#8211;Hush model, we identify and quantify these two coordinates as linear combinations of normal modes from ab initio calculations. This quantification gives access to the potential coupling, reorganization energy and curvature of the potential energy surfaces involved in electron transfer, independent of any prior assumptions about the system of interest. We showcase these claims with the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, a prototypical Class III mixed valence complex. We find that the symmetric dimension is responsible for the asymmetric band shape, and trace this back to the offset of the ground and excited state potentials in this dimension. The significance of the symmetric dimension originates from geometry dependent coupling, which in turn is a natural consequence of the well&#8208;established superexchange mechanism. The conceptual connection between the symmetric and anti&#8208;symmetric motions and the superexchange mechanism appears as a general result for bridged systems.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Strained Amino Acids by a PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme through Cryptic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogenases enable organisms to alter the reactivity of a biological substrate by enzymatically installing a leaving group. In this communication, we discover a bacterial gene cluster which uses a pyridoxal 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme to form strained carbocyclic amino acids from halogenated substrates. We also examine the role of the non&#8208;canonical amino acid pazamine in plant&#8208;bacterial interactions.







Abstract
Amino acids (AAs) are modular building blocks which nature uses to synthesize both macromolecules, such as proteins, and small molecule natural products, such as alkaloids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides. While the 20 main proteinogenic AAs display relatively limited side chain diversity, a wide range of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) exist that are not used by the ribosome for protein synthesis, but contain a broad array of structural features and functional groups. In this communication, we report the discovery of the biosynthetic pathway for a new ncAA, pazamine, which contains a cyclopropane ring formed in two steps. In the first step, a chlorine is added onto the C4 position of lysine by a radical halogenase, PazA. The cyclopropane ring is then formed in the next step by a pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme, PazB, via an SN2&#8208;like attack at C4 to eliminate chloride. Genetic studies of this pathway in the native host, Pseudomonas azotoformans, show that pazamine potentially inhibits ethylene biosynthesis in growing plants based on alterations in the root phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. We further show that PazB can be utilized to make an alternative cyclobutane&#8208;containing AA. These discoveries may lead to advances in biocatalytic production of specialty chemicals and agricultural biotechnology.

         <title>A Systematic Study of Methyl Carbodithioate Esters as Effective Gold Contact Groups for Single&#8208;Molecule Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Carbodithioate ester&#8208;containing molecular wires have been synthesized and characterized to demonstrate the functionality as a great contact group for molecular electronics with good all&#8208;around properties including strong surface binding and high conductance. Raman, XPS and theoretical calculations support the STM&#8208;BJ conductance data and rationalize the binding groups&#8217; performance through a strong C=S to Au interaction.







Abstract
There are several binding groups used within molecular electronics for anchoring molecules to metal electrodes (e.g., R&#8722;SMe, R&#8722;NH2, R&#8722;CS2&#8722;, R&#8722;S&#8722;). However, some anchoring groups that bind strongly to electrodes have poor/unknown stability, some have weak electrode coupling, while for some their binding motifs are not well defined. Further binding groups are required to aid molecular design and to achieve a suitable balance in performance across a range of properties. We present an in&#8208;depth investigation into the use of carbodithioate esters as contact groups for single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, using scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction measurements (STM&#8208;BJ) and detailed surface spectroscopic analysis. We demonstrate that the methyl carbodithioate ester acts as an effective contact for gold electrodes in STM&#8208;BJ measurements. Surface enhanced Raman measurements demonstrate that the C=S functionality remains intact when adsorbed on to gold nanoparticles. A gold(I) complex was also synthesised showing a stable C=S&#8594;AuI interaction from the ester. Comparison with a benzyl thiomethyl ether demonstrates that the C=S moiety significantly contributes to charge transport in single&#8208;molecule junctions. The overall performance of the CS2Me group demonstrates it should be used more extensively and has strong potential for the fabrication of larger area devices with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship of p&#8208;block Bi element for selectivity CH4 was found. The CH4 selectivity of the p&#8208;block Bi element is also positively correlated with adsorption energy of *CHO. Further analysis indicates that the interaction in VO/Bi heterosites on Bi2MoO6 enhances the absorption and activation of *CHO, facilitates the *CO&#8208;*CHO process, and enriches carriers at the active site for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion.







Abstract
Selective photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels, such as CH4, is highly desirable due to its high mass&#8208;energy density. Nevertheless, achieving selective CH4 with higher production yield on p&#8208;block materials is hindered by non&#8208;ideal adsorption of *CHO key intermediate and an unclear structure&#8208;function relationship. Herein, we unlock the key reaction steps of CO2 and found a volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion by gradual reduction of the p&#8208;band center of the p&#8208;block Bi element leading to formation of Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites. The selectivity of CH4 is also positive correlation with adsorption energy of *CHO. The Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites with an appropriate filled Bi&#8208;6p orbital electrons and p band center (&#8722;0.64) enhance the coupling between C&#8208;2p of *CHO and Bi&#8208;6p orbitals, thereby resulting in high selectivity (95.2&#8201;%) and productivity (17.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) towards CH4. Further studies indicate that the synergistic effect between Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites reduces Gibbs free energy for *CO&#8208;*CHO process, activates the C&#8722;H and C=O bonds of *CHO, and facilitates the enrichment of photoexcited electrons at active sites for multielectron photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. This work provides a new perspective on developing p&#8208;block elements for selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion.

         <title>Digital Light Processing to Afford High Resolution and Degradable CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiol&#8208;ene based 3D printing of a low molar mass CO2&#8208; and bio&#8208;derived ABA triblock copolymer through digital light processing is reported. A series of sustainable elastomers are produced with varying thiol cross&#8208;linker lengths and poly(ethylene glycol) content to print complex geometries at high resolution. The materials display printing induced phase separation, tunable hydrophilicity, and complete hydrolytic degradation.







Abstract
Vat photopolymerization 3D printing has proven very successful for the rapid additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric parts at high resolution.

&lt;p&gt;The thiol-ene based 3D printing of a low molar mass CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- and bio-derived ABA triblock copolymer through digital light processing is reported. A series of sustainable elastomers are produced with varying thiol cross-linker lengths and poly(ethylene glycol) content to print complex geometries at high resolution. The materials display printing induced phase separation, tunable hydrophilicity, and complete hydrolytic degradation.

         <title>Tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficiently Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have recently emerged as fascinating scaffolds for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion because of their customizable structures and functionalities. Herein, two tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials (namely COF&#8208;JLU51 and COF&#8208;JLU52) featuring large surface area, high crystallinity, excellent stability and photoelectric properties were designed and constructed for the first time. Remarkably, COF&#8208;JLU51 gave an outstanding H2O2 production rate of over 4200 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in pure water and O2 under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF&#8208;JLU52 and most of the reported metal&#8208;free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with apparent quantum yield of 18.2% for COF&#8208;JLU52 was achieved in a 1:1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen&#8208;rich and high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Synthesis of Tacaman Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: This paper describes a concise, asymmetric and stereodivergent total synthesis of tacaman alkaloids. A key step in this synthesis is the biocatalytic Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone, which was developed to produce seven&#8208;membered lactones and establish the required stereochemistry at the C14 position (92% yield, 99% ee, 500 mg scale). Cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;tetracyclic indoloquinolizidine scaffolds were rapidly synthesized through an acid&#8208;triggered, tunable acyl&#8208;Pictet&#8208;Spengler type cyclization cascade, serving as the pivotal reaction for building the alkaloid skeleton. Computational results revealed that hydrogen bonding was crucial in stabilizing intermediates and inducing different addition reactions during the acyl&#8208;Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization cascade. By strategically using these two reactions and the late&#8208;stage diversification of the functionalized indoloquinolizidine core, the asymmetric total syntheses of eight tacaman alkaloids were achieved. This study may potentially advance research related to the medicinal chemistry of tacaman alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Human Ferritin: Enhanced Drug Delivery of Aurothiomalate in A2780 Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aurothiomalate (AuTM) is an FDA&#8208;approved antiarthritic gold drug with unique anticancer properties. To enhance its anticancer activity, we prepared a bioconjugate with human apoferritin (HuHf) by attaching some AuTM moieties to surface protein residues. The reaction of apoferritin with excess AuTM yielded a single adduct, that was characterized by ESI MS and ICP&#8208;OES analysis, using three mutant ferritins and trypsinization experiments. The adduct contains ~3 gold atoms per ferritin subunit, arranged in a small cluster bound to Cys90 and Cys102. MD simulations provide a plausible structural model for the cluster. The adduct was evaluated for its pharmacological properties and was found to be significantly more cytotoxic than free AuTM against A2780 cancer cells mainly due to higher gold uptake. NMR&#8208;metabolomics showed that AuTM bound to HuHf and free AuTM induced qualitatively similar changes in treated cancer cells, indicating that the effects on cell metabolism are approximately the same, in agreement with independent biochemical experiments. In conclusion, we have demonstrated here that a molecularly precise bioconjugate formed between AuTM and HuHf exhibits anticancer properties far superior to the free drug, while retaining its key mechanistic features. Evidence is provided that human ferritin can serve as an excellent carrier for this metallodrug.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the binding effect between the surface of an&#160;electrode material and reaction intermediates is essential in highly efficient CO2 electro&#8208;reduction to produce high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+)&#160;compounds. Theoretical study reveals that lattice tensile strain in single&#8208;component Cu&#160;catalysts can reduce the dipole&#8211;dipole repulsion between *CO intermediates and promotes *OH adsorption, and the high *CO and *OH coverage decreases the energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling. In this work, Cu catalysts with varying lattice tensile strain were fabricated by electro&#8208;reducing CuO precursors with different crystallinity, without adding any extra components. The as&#8208;prepared single&#8208;component Cu catalysts were used for CO2 electro&#8208;reduction, and it is discovered that the lattice tensile strain in Cu could enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products effectively. Especially, the as&#8208;prepared CuTPA catalyst with high lattice tensile strain&#160;achieves a FEC2+ of 90.9% at &#8722;1.25 V vs. RHE with a partial current density of 486.1 mA cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets&#8208;based membranes, which have controlled 2D nano&#8208;confined channels, are highly desirable for molecular/ionic sieving and confined reactions. However, it is still difficult to develop an efficient method to prepare large&#8208;area membranes with high stability, high orientation, and accurately adjustable interlayer spacing. Here, we present a strategy to produce metal ion cross&#8208;linked membranes with precisely controlled 2D nano&#8208;confined channels and high stability in different solutions using superspreading shear&#8208;flow&#8208;induced assembly strategy. For example, membranes based on graphene oxide (GO) exhibit interlayer spacing ranging from 8.0 &#177; 0.1 &#197; to 10.3 &#177; 0.2 &#197;, with a precision of down to 1 &#197;. At the same time, the value of the orientation order parameter (f) of GO membranes is up to 0.95 and GO membranes exhibit superb stability in different solutions. The strategy we present, which can be generalized to the preparation of 2D nano&#8208;confined channels based on a variety of 2D materials, will expand the application scope and provide better performances of membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and theoretical elucidation of the luminescence quenching mechanism in highly efficient Hg2+ and sulfadiazine sensing by Ln&#8208;MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy metal ions and antibiotic contamination have become a major environmental concern worldwide. The development of efficient recognition strategies of these pollutants at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in aqueous solutions as well as the elucidation of the intrinsic sensing mechanism are challenging tasks. In this work, unique luminescent Ln&#8208;MOF materials (NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Ln) were assembled by rational ligand design. Among them, NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb demonstrated highly selective luminescence quenching response toward Hg2+ and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations in less than 7 s. In addition, a Hg2+ sensing mechanism through chelation was proposed on the basis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and Hg2+ adsorption study. The interaction mechanism of NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a (TD&#8208;)DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF&#8208;analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states. Effect of ultrasonic treatment on the surface morphology important for MOF sensing performance was revealed by gas adsorption experiments. The presented results indicate that NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Ln is not only an advanced sensing material for the efficient detection of Hg2+ and SDI at ultra&#8208;low concentrations, but also opens up a new approach to study the sensing mechanism at the molecular level at ultra&#8208;low concentrations.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heavy metal ions and antibiotic contamination have become a major environmental concern worldwide. The development of efficient recognition strategies of these pollutants at ultra-low concentrations in aqueous solutions as well as the elucidation of the intrinsic sensing mechanism are challenging tasks. In this work, unique luminescent Ln-MOF materials (NIIC-3-Ln) were assembled by rational ligand design. Among them, NIIC-3-Tb demonstrated highly selective luminescence quenching response toward Hg2+ and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations in less than 7 s. In addition, a Hg2+ sensing mechanism through chelation was proposed on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and Hg2+ adsorption study. The interaction mechanism of NIIC-3-Tb with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a (TD-)DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF-analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states. Effect of ultrasonic treatment on the surface morphology important for MOF sensing performance was revealed by gas adsorption experiments. The presented results indicate that NIIC-3-Ln is not only an advanced sensing material for the efficient detection of Hg2+ and SDI at ultra-low concentrations, but also opens up a new approach to study the sensing mechanism at the molecular level at ultra-low concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Elucidation of a Metagenomic Urethanase and Its Engineering Towards Enhanced Hydrolysis Profiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While plastics like polyethylene terephthalate can already be degraded efficiently by the activity of hydrolases, other synthetic polymers like polyurethanes (PUs) and polyamides (PAs) largely resist biodegradation. In this study, we solved the first crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1, identified highly flexible loop regions to comprise active site residues, and targeted a total of 20 potential hot spots by site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis. Engineering campaigns yielded variants with single mutations, exhibiting almost 3&#8208; and 8&#8208;fold improved activity against highly stable N&#8208;aryl urethane and amide bonds, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the release of the corresponding monomers from a thermoplastic polyester&#8208;PU and a PA (nylon 6) by the activity of a single, metagenome&#8208;derived urethanase after short incubation times. Thereby, we expanded the hydrolysis profile of UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1 beyond the reported low&#8208;molecular weight carbamates. Together, these findings promise advanced strategies for the bio&#8208;based degradation and recycling of plastic materials and waste, aiding efforts to establish a circular economy for synthetic polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling White Phosphorus: Experimental and Computational Studies Reveal the Mechanisms of P4 Hydrostannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrostannylation of white phosphorus (P4) allows this crucial industrial precursor to be easily transformed into useful P1 products via direct, &#8216;one pot&#8217; (or even catalytic) procedures. However, a thorough mechanistic understanding of this transformation has remained elusive, hindering attempts to use this rare example of successful, direct P4 functionalization as a model for further reaction development. Here, we provide a deep and generalizable mechanistic picture for P4 hydrostannylation by combining DFT calculations with in situ31P NMR reaction monitoring and kinetic trapping of previously unobservable reaction intermediates using bulky tin hydrides. The results offer important insights into both how this reaction proceeds and why it is successful and provide implicit guidelines for future research in the field of P4 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tetracarbene Iron(II) Complex with a Long&#8208;lived Triplet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand Charge Transfer State due to a Triplet&#8208;Triplet Barrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth&#8208;abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state (3MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers  trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+with four NHC donors show 3MLCT&#8594;3MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While trans&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492 cm&#8211;1, which leads to a nanosecond 3MLCT lifetime at 77 K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states. This highlights the importance of detailed structural control and kinetic knowledge for the rational design of photosensitizers from first row transition metals such as iron.</dc:description>

         <title>Cycloadditions of Diazoalkenes with P4 and tBuCP: Access to Diazaphospholes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazoalkenes readily react with tert&#8209;butylphosphaalkyne (tBuCP) and white phosphorus (P4) to afford novel phosphorus heterocycles, 3H&#8209;1,2,4&#8208;diazamonophospholes and 1,2,3,4&#8208;diazadiphospholes. Both species represent rare examples of neutral heterophospholes. The mechanism of formation and the electronic structures of these formal (3+2) cycloaddition products were analyzed computationally. The new phospholes form structurally diverse coordination compounds with transition metal and main group elements. Given the growing number of stable diazoalkenes, this work offers a straightforward route to neutral aza(di&#8208;)phospholes as a new ligand class.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophilic C(sp2)&#8211;H Cyanation with Inorganic Cyanate (OCN&#8211;) by PIII/PV=O&#8208;Catalyzed Phase Transfer Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organophosphorus redox&#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8211;H nucleophiles with sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. The catalytic deoxyfunctionalization of the OCN&#8211; anion is enabled by the use of a small&#8208;ring phosphacyclic (phosphetane) catalyst in combination with a terminal hydrosilane O&#8208;atom acceptor and a malonate&#8208;derived bromenium donor. In situ spectroscopy under single&#8208;turnover conditions demonstrate that insoluble inorganic cyanate anion is activated by bromide displacement on a bromophosphonium catalytic intermediate to give a reactive N&#8208;bound isocyanatophosphonium ion, which delivers electrophilic &#8220;CN+&#8221; equivalents to nucleophilic (hetero)arenes and alkenes with loss of a phosphine oxide. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 2,7&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;linked bis(6&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4. The [2]catenane rearranges in DMF to yield two metallamacrocycles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. 2,7&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;(imidazolium) salt H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 (L = 2a, 2b) react with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield metallamacrocycles [Ag2(L)2](PF6)2 with interplanar distances between the fluorenone rings too small for [2]catenane formation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Cage Framework with High Selectivity and Reversibility in Fullerene Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest chemistry, a pivotal branch of supramolecular chemistry, plays an essential role in understanding and constructing complex structures through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Organic molecular cages, characterized by their intrinsic confined cavities, can selectively bind a variety of guest molecules. Their host&#8208;guest chemistry has been well studied in the solution phase, and several attempts have been made to encode well&#8208;defined molecular architectures into solid&#8208;state polymeric materials. However, only limited studies have explored their potential in the solid state, where their lack of robustness and less ordered networks significantly hinder practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a single&#8208;crystal cage framework and a systematic study of its host&#8208;guest chemistry, spanning from the solution state to the solid state. Our studies reveal that the host&#8208;guest interactions inherent to the cage are successfully maintained in the solid&#8208;state polymeric material. Furthermore, the framework's robustness allows for the guest molecules (fullerene) to be released triggered by an organic acid (trifluoracetic acid), with subsequent regeneration of the framework through an organic base (triethylamine) treatment. Our findings represent the first synthesis of a robust, single&#8208;crystal cage framework exhibiting highly selective and reversible host&#8208;guest chemistry, thus showing great potential towards molecular separation application.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe&#8208;Cu Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of acetic acid, an important industrial chemical traditionally obtained through the carbonylation of methanol using noble metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts, encounters challenges arising from high equipment costs and sustainability concerns. The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane emerges as a promising alternative, capitalizing on abundant natural gas resources and featuring a potentially mild and straightforward process. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to the scarcity of active sites and the swift generation of C1 oxygenates, posing difficulties for subsequent carbonylation and impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZ5&#8208;TF catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at 50 &#176;C, surpassing the previous maximum (12.0 mmol gcat&#8208;1h&#8208;1) by more than threefold. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process. This synergistic action promotes C&#8208;C coupling, resulting in the efficient synthesis of acetic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Are Redox&#8208;Active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry textbooks teach that the behavior of charged redox centers bound by saturated linkers is essentially governed by electrostatics. We show that for short alkanes and pyridiniums, as Coulombic and through&#8208;bond interactions become ineffective, reductive cyclomer formation is governed by London dispersion and &#963;&#8208;type overlap of 2pz atomic orbitals of the C&#947; atoms of electrophoric ends rather than by electron spin&#8208;spin interaction.







Abstract
The extent to which electrophores covalently bridged by a saturated linker are electrochemically independent was investigated considering the charge/spin duality of the electron and functionality of the electrophore as a spin carrier upon reduction. By combining computational modeling with electrochemical experiments, we investigated the mechanism by which tethered electrophores react together within 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oligo[n]methylene&#8208;bipyridinium assemblies (with n=2 to 5). We show that native dicationic electrophores (redox state Z=+2) are folded prior to electron injection into the system, allowing the emergence of supra&#8208;molecular orbitals (supra&#8208;MOs) likely to support the process of the reductive &#963; bond formation giving cyclomers. Indeed, for Z=+2, London Dispersion (LD) forces contribute to flatten the potential energy surface such that all&#8208;trans and folded conformers are approximately isoenergetic. Then, upon one&#8208;electron injection, for radical cations (Z=+1), LD forces significantly stabilize the folded conformers, except for the ethylene derivative deprived of supra&#8208;MOs. For radical cations equipped with supra&#8208;MOs, the unpaired electron is delocalized over both heterocycles through space. Cyclomer completion (Z=0) upon the second electron transfer occurs according to the inversion of redox potentials. This mechanism explains why intramolecular reactivity is favored and why pyridinium electrophores are not independent.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Macrocycle for Efficient Cytosolic Delivery of Proteins, DNA, and CRISPR Cas9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[+]	S.&#8197;Q. and I.&#8197;A.&#8197;B. contributed equally to this work.A cell penetrating macrocycle (CPM) with flexible amine linkages and amphiphilic nature assembles into a micellar&#8208;like structure that can passively permeate through the cell membrane. CPM can efficiently transfer fully functioning proteins and genetic materials into the cytosol, independent of size, charge, or complexity.







Abstract
The discovery of safe platforms that can circumvent the endocytic pathway is of great significance for biological therapeutics that are usually degraded during endocytosis. Here we show that a self&#8208;assembled and dynamic macrocycle can passively diffuse through the cell membrane and deliver a broad range of biologics, including proteins, CRISPR Cas9, and ssDNA, directly to the cytosol while retaining their bioactivity. Cell&#8208;penetrating macrocycle CPM can be easily prepared from the room temperature condensation of diketopyrrolopyrrole lactams with diamines. We attribute the high cellular permeability of CPM to its amphiphilic nature and chameleonic properties. It adopts conformations that partially bury polar groups and expose hydrophobic side chains, thus self&#8208;assembling into micellar&#8208;like structures. Its superior fluorescence makes CPM trackable inside cells where it follows the endomembrane system. CPM outperformed commercial reagents for biologics delivery and showed high RNA knockdown efficiency of CRISPR Cas9. We envisage that this macrocycle will be an ideal starting point to design and synthesize biomimetic macrocyclic tags that can readily facilitate the interaction and uptake of biomolecules and overcome endosomal digestion.

         <title>Transient Covalent Polymers through Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent polymers generated by chemical fuel reactions should serve as useful model systems for nonequilibrium assembly. Here, aqueous poly(anhydrides) have been generated by treatment of dicarboxylic acid monomers with carbodiimides. Molecular weights over 15,000 have been achieved, with polymer lifetimes on the order of hours to weeks. The effect of solvent, reactant concentrations, and temperature has been examined.







Abstract
Biochemical systems make use of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium polymers generated under kinetic control. Inspired by these systems, many abiotic supramolecular polymers driven by chemical fuel reactions have been reported. Conversely, polymers based on transient covalent bonds have received little attention, even though they have the potential to complement supramolecular systems by generating transient structures based on stronger bonds and by offering a straightforward tuning of reaction kinetics. In this study, we show that simple aqueous dicarboxylic acids give poly(anhydrides) when treated with the carbodiimide EDC. Transient covalent polymers with molecular weights exceeding 15,000 are generated which then decompose over the course of hours to weeks. Disassembly kinetics can be controlled using simple substituent effects in the monomer design. The impact of solvent polarity, carbodiimide concentration, temperature, pyridine concentration, and monomer concentration on polymer properties and lifetimes has been investigated. The results reveal substantial control over polymer assembly and disassembly kinetics, highlighting the potential for fine&#8208;tuned kinetic control in nonequilibrium polymerization systems.

Conversely, polymers based on transient covalent bonds have received little attention, even though they have the potential to complement supramolecular systems by generating transient structures based on stronger bonds and by offering a straightforward tuning of reaction kinetics. In this study, we show that simple aqueous dicarboxylic acids give poly(anhydrides) when treated with the carbodiimide EDC. Transient covalent polymers with molecular weights exceeding 15,000 are generated which then decompose over the course of hours to weeks. Disassembly kinetics can be controlled using simple substituent effects in the monomer design. The impact of solvent polarity, carbodiimide concentration, temperature, pyridine concentration, and monomer concentration on polymer properties and lifetimes has been investigated. The results reveal substantial control over polymer assembly and disassembly kinetics, highlighting the potential for fine-tuned kinetic control in nonequilibrium polymerization systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated and Lysosomal&#8208;Targeted Pt(II) Metallacycle for Highly Potent Evoking of Immunogenic Cell Death that Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tumors</title>

         <dc:description>
A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (1) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. 1 generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.







Abstract
Though platinum (Pt)&#8208;based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (1) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. 1 synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep&#8208;seated tumors via multiple&#8208;regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, 1 has excellent depth&#8208;activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti&#8208;diffusion and anti&#8208;ROS quenching ability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that 1 exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, 1 induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer&#8208;oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In vivo, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that 1 serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8+/CD4+ T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3+ T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal&#8208;based ICD agents in immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported, giving Z&#8208;alkene products in &gt;95&#8201;% ee and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 Z&#8201;:&#8201;E. Protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is likely the slow step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer with MeOH.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate arylations of electron&#8208;poor alkenes are highly selective processes for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. &#948;&#8208;Selective hydroarylations of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes are less well developed and reactions that deliver high enantioselectivity while giving single alkene isomer products are elusive. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes that gives nearly exclusive Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products (generally with &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 positional and geometrical selectivity). This remote functionalization provides access to chiral diarylated alkenes from readily available precursors poised for further functionalization, including in the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is the turnover limiting step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer pathway.

         <title>Solar Azo&#8208;Switches for Effective E&#8594;Z Photoisomerization by Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sunlight&#8208;induced isomerization of azo&#8208;switches is realized through spectral reshaping. Our sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches absorb across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum and achieve 80&#8211;90&#8201;% E&#8594;Z isomerization yields under unfiltered sunlight. Solar switches hold great potential for sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy utilization for applications such as molecular machines, actuators, and molecular solar thermal storage.







Abstract
Natural photoactive systems have evolved to harness broad&#8208;spectrum light from solar radiation for critical functions such as light perception and photosynthetic energy conversion. Molecular photoswitches, which undergo structural changes upon light absorption, are artificial photoactive tools widely used for developing photoresponsive systems and converting light energy. However, photoswitches generally need to be activated by light of specific narrow wavelength ranges for effective photoconversion, which limits their ability to directly work under sunlight and to efficiently harvest solar energy. Here, focusing on azo&#8208;switches&#8212;the most extensively studied photoswitches, we demonstrate effective solar E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with photoconversions exceeding 80&#8201;% under unfiltered sunlight. These sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches are developed by rendering the absorption of E isomers overwhelmingly stronger than that of Z isomers across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum. This unusual type of spectral profile is realized by a simple yet highly adjustable molecular design strategy, enabling the fine&#8208;tuning of spectral window that extends light absorption beyond 600&#8197;nm. Notably, back&#8208;photoconversion can be achieved without impairing the forward solar isomerization, resulting in unique light&#8208;reversible solar switches. Such exceptional solar chemistry of photoswitches provides unprecedented opportunities for developing sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy technologies.

         <title>Engineering Low Volume Resuscitants for the Prehospital Care of Severe Hemorrhagic Shock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traumatic injury is a leading cause of global suffering and death. We rationally design polymeric, low volume resuscitants (LVRs) for the prehospital treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock. By varying polymer architecture, Rg, and composition to influence resuscitation, coagulation, and biodistribution, we developed a radiant star polymer that is non&#8208;coagulopathic and corrects 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable LVR has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.







Abstract
Globally, traumatic injury is a leading cause of suffering and death. The ability to curtail damage and ensure survival after major injury requires a time&#8208;sensitive response balancing organ perfusion, blood loss, and portability, underscoring the need for novel therapies for the prehospital environment. Currently, there are few options available for damage control resuscitation (DCR) of trauma victims. We hypothesize that synthetic polymers, which are tunable, portable, and stable under austere conditions, can be developed as effective injectable therapies for trauma medicine. In this work, we design injectable polymers for use as low volume resuscitants (LVRs). Using RAFT polymerization, we evaluate the effect of polymer size, architecture, and chemical composition upon both blood coagulation and resuscitation in a rat hemorrhagic shock model. Our therapy is evaluated against a clinically used colloid resuscitant, Hextend. We demonstrate that a radiant star poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) polymer did not interfere with coagulation while successfully correcting metabolic deficit and resuscitating animals from hemorrhagic shock to the desired mean arterial pressure range for DCR &#8211; correcting a 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable and non&#8208;coagulopathic resuscitant has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.

         <title>Photoinitiated Transient Self&#8208;Assembly in a Catalytically Driven Chemical Reaction Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show a catalytically&#8208;driven chemical reaction network (CRN) photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light. By combining photoredox and organometallic catalysis relying on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release deactivating fuel, we can control the formation of transient supramolecular fibers. Irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of deactivating fuel, leading to faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light activation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.







Abstract
Chemically fueled chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are essential in controlling dissipative self&#8208;assembly. A key challenge in the field is to store chemical fuel&#8208;precursors or &#8220;pre&#8208;fuels&#8221; in the system that are converted into activating or deactivating fuels in a catalytically controlled CRN. In addition, real&#8208;time control over catalysis in a CRN by light is highly desirable, but so far not yet achieved. Here we show a catalytically driven CRN that is photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light, producing activated monomers that go on to perform transient self&#8208;assembly. Monomer activation proceeds via photoredox catalysis, converting the monomer alcohol groups into the corresponding aldehydes that self&#8208;assemble into large supramolecular fibers. Monomer deactivation is achieved by organometallic catalysis that relies on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release formate (i.e. the deactivating fuel). Additionally, irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of formate by photo&#8208;uncaging the pre&#8208;fuel, leading to a factor of ca. 2 faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light photoactivation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.

         <title>Surfactant Directionally Assembled at the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Facilitating Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant&#8208;modified electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces have been designed for cathodic catalytic conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Under the application potential conditions, the surfactant undergoes a conformational transition from random distribution to directional assembly. This microenvironmental regulation strategy achieves efficient hydrogenation of HMF and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is a promising alternative to conventional thermal processes. Both the catalyst and electrolyte deeply impact the performance. Designing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface remains challenging due to its compositional and structural complexity. Here, we employ the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a reaction model. The typical cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and its analogs are employed as electrolyte additives to tune the interfacial microenvironment, delivering high&#8208;efficiency hydrogenation of HMF and inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The surfactants experience a conformational transformation from stochastic distribution to directional assembly under applied potential. This oriented arrangement hampers the transfer of water molecules to the interface and promotes the enrichment of reactants. In addition, near 100&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) selectivity is achieved, and the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the BHMF is improved from 61&#8201;% to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the microenvironmental modulation strategy applies to a range of electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions involving aldehyde substrates. This work paves the way for engineering advanced electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and boosting unsaturated alcohol electrosynthesis efficiency.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Induced Interstitial Effects Drive Water Oxidation on Ordered Ir&#8722;B Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The B&#8208;induced interstitial effects in intermetallic IrB1.1 balance the acidic water oxidation activity and stability and leads to a good operation in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high&#8208;temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir&#8722;B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir&#8722;B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B&#8208;induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

         <title>Spirobifluorene Trimers: High Triplet Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of extended pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials with a high triplet energy, a wide HOMO/LUMO gap and improved thermal properties compared to reported PHCs have been constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. When used as the host in blue phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24&#8201;% with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off was reached.







Abstract
Pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHCs) represent a new generation of host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), free of heteroatoms. They reduce the molecular complexity, can be easily synthesized and are an important direction towards robust devices. As heteroatoms can be involved in bonds dissociations in operating OLEDs through exciton induced degradation processes, developing novel PHCs appear particularly relevant for the future of this technology. In the present work, we report a series of extended PHCs constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. The resulting positional isomers present a high triplet energy level, a wide HOMO/LUMO difference and improved thermal and morphological properties compared to previously reported PHCs. These characteristics are beneficial for the next generation of host materials for PhOLEDs and provide relevant design guidelines. When used as a host in blue&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs, which are still the weakest link of the field, a very high EQE of 24&#8201;% and low threshold voltage of 3.56&#8197;V were obtained with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off. This high performance strengthens the position of PHC strategy as an efficient alternative for OLED technology and opens the way to a more simple electronic.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Arylative Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled redox gold catalysis. Unlike the classical Cope rearrangement involving 1,5&#8208;hexadienes, a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes using the merger of &#960;&#8208;activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactivity, has been achieved.







Abstract
Cope rearrangements have garnered significant attention owing to their ability to undergo structural reorganization in stereoselective manner. While substantial advances have been achieved over decades, these rearrangements remained applicable exclusively to parent 1,5&#8208;hexadienes. Herein, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes via a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement employing ligand&#8208;enabled gold redox catalysis. Detailed mechanistic investigations including several control experiments, cross&#8208;over experiment, HRMS analysis, 31P&#8197;NMR and DFT studies have been performed to underpin the mechanism.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization Induced by Ferromagnetic Sulfur doped C3N4 Triggers Selective H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) catalyst causes the in&#8208;plane electronic perturbations, further inducing stronger electron delocalization state on carbon sites, which breaks the *C&#8722;O bond and involves the faster desorption of the key reaction intermediate *OOH on the metal surface to form the final product H2O2.







Abstract
For the 2D metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, the atomic coplanar architecture enables a large number of pz orbitals to overlap laterally, thus forming &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and the delocalization degree of the central atom dominates the catalytic activity. Herein, designing sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) materials as a model, we propose a strategy to promote localized electron polarization by enhancing the ferromagnetism of ultra&#8208;thin 2D carbon nitride nanosheets. The introduction of sulfur (S) further promotes localized ferromagnetic coupling, thereby inducing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and accelerating the electron interface transport. Meanwhile, the hybridization of sulfur atoms breaks the symmetry and integrity of the unit structure, promotes electron enrichment and stimulating electron delocalization at the active site. This optimization enhances the *OOH desorption, providing a favorable kinetic pathway for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consequently, S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and achieves a superb H2O2 production rate, approaching 4374.8&#8197;ppm during continuous electrolysis over 300&#8197;hour. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the ortho&#8208;S configuration can provide ferromagnetic perturbation in carbon active centers, leading to the electron delocalization, which optimizes the OOH* adsorption during the catalytic process.

         <title>A Cyclometalated Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces Oncosis for Synergistic Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleus and mitochondria dual&#8208;localized ruthenium(II) complex disrupts DNA to activate PARP1 protein combined with ATP consumption and produces mitochondrial oxidative stress, triggering porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 protein to induce cell oncosis and boosting innate and adaptive immunity.







Abstract
An optimal cancer chemotherapy regimen should effectively address the drug resistance of tumors while eliciting antitumor&#8208;immune responses. Research has shown that non&#8208;apoptotic cell death, such as pyroptosis and ferroptosis, can enhance the immune response. Despite this, there has been limited investigation and reporting on the mechanisms of oncosis and its correlation with immune response. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Ru(II) complex that targeted the nucleus and mitochondria to induce cell oncosis. Briefly, the Ru(II) complex disrupts the nucleus and mitochondria DNA, which active polyADP&#8208;ribose polymerase&#8197;1, accompanied by ATP consumption and porimin activation. Concurrently, mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress result in the release of Ca2+ ions and increased expression of Calpain&#8197;1. Subsequently, specific pore proteins porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 promote cristae destruction or vacuolation, ultimately leading to cell membrane rupture. The analysis of RNA sequencing demonstrates that the Ru(II) complex can initiate the oncosis&#8208;associated pathway and activate both innate and adaptive immunity. In vivo experiments have confirmed that oncosis promotes dendritic cell maturation and awakens adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also activates the innate immune by inducing the polarization of macrophages towards an M1 phenotype.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Iron(II) Catalyst for C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined iron catalyst with high efficiency for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling involving C(sp3) partners is described. In the presence of a lithium amide base, this catalyst enabled, for the first time, C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling of 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176; alkyl halides and (hetero)aryl boronic esters as well as C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of 1&#176; and 2&#176; alkyl halides and 1&#176; and 2&#176; alkyl boranes under mild conditions and with broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Despite the paramount importance of the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) in academia and industry, and the great promise of iron to offer sustainable catalysis, iron&#8208;catalyzed SMC involving sp3&#8208;hybridized partners is still in its infancy. We herein report the development of a versatile, well&#8208;defined electron&#8208;deficient anilido&#8208;aldimine iron(II) catalyst. This catalyst effectively performed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) SMC of alkyl halide electrophiles and (hetero)aryl boronic ester and alkyl borane nucleophiles respectively, in the presence of a lithium amide base. These couplings operated under mild reaction conditions and displayed wide functional group compatibility including various medicinally relevant N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;based heterocycles. They also tolerated primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), electron&#8208;neutral, &#8208;rich and &#8208;poor boronic esters and primary and secondary alkyl boranes. Our methodology could be directly and efficiently applied to synthesize key intermediates relevant to pharmaceuticals and a potential drug candidate. For C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) couplings, radical probe experiments militated in favor of a carbon&#8208;centered radical derived from the electrophile. At the same time, reactions run with a pre&#8208;formed activated boron nucleophile coupled to competition experiments supported the involvement of neutral, rather than an anionic, (hetero)aryl boronic ester in the key transmetalation step.

         <title>Facile Access to Organostibines via Selective Organic Superbase Catalyzed Antimony&#8208;Carbon Protonolysis</title>

C6F5, the perfect leaving group for highly selective antimony&#8208;carbon bond formation reactions via organosuperbase&#8208;catalysis! This novel approach enables mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted perfluorophenyl stibines to be smoothly converted to a range of synthetically useful aromatic, heteroaromatic and alkynyl&#8208;substituted stibines under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
The selective formation of antimony&#8208;carbon bonds via organic superbase catalysis under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions is reported. This novel approach utilizes electron&#8208;deficient stibine, Sb(C6F5)3, to give upon base&#8208;catalyzed reactions with weakly acidic aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons access to a range of new aromatic and heteroaromatic stibines, respectively, with loss of C6HF5. Also, the significantly less electron&#8208;deficient stibines, Ph2SbC6F5 and PhSb(C6F5)2 smoothly underwent base&#8208;catalyzed exchange reactions with a range of terminal alkynes to generate the stibines of formulae PhSb(C&#8801;CPh)2, and Ph2SbC&#8801;CR [R=C6H5, C6H4&#8208;NO2, COOEt, CH2Cl, CH2NEt2, CH2OSiMe3, Sb(C6H5)2], respectively. These formal substitution reactions proceed with high selectivity as only the C6F5 groups serve as a leaving group to be liberated as C6HF5 upon formal proton transfer from the alkyne. Kinetic studies of the base&#8208;catalyzed reaction of Ph2SbC6F5 with phenyl acetylene to form Ph2SbC&#8801;CPh and C6HF5 suggested the empirical rate law to exhibit a first&#8208;order dependence with respect to the base catalyst, alkyne and stibine. DFT calculations support a pathway proceeding via a concerted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis transition state, where the base catalyst activates the Sb&#8208;C6F5 bond sequence through secondary bond interactions.

         <title>Catalytic (4+2) Annulation via Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Interception of in&#8208;situ Generated Alkylgold Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished under gold&#8208;complex and chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide synergetic catalysis, providing chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans with high efficiency and selectivity. This method complements the (4+2) annulation of allene reagents via a formal cycloaddition on internal &#960;&#8208;bond, which is challenging and remains elusive.







Abstract
A regio&#8208; and stereoselective stepwise (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished with synergetic catalysis by a combination of a gold&#8208;complex and a chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide (QN&#8208;SQA), leading to highly functionalized chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans in good to high yields with generally excellent enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the in situ formed alkylgold species is the key intermediate in this transformation, and the amide group served as a traceless directing group in this highly selective transformation. This method complements the enantioselective (4+2) annulation of allene reagents, providing the formal internal C&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bond cycloaddition products, which is challenging and remains elusive.

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Framework Featuring Interactive Pockets for Bromine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine, a useful, although toxic halogen can coexist with I2 in an equilibrium product of IBr. Here, we propose a new Covalent Organic Framework (COF) featuring triple bonds, an electron&#8208;rich pyrene unit, and heteroatoms (N sites) to selectively capture Br2 over I2. The participation of the triple bond can be classified as a combined physisorption as well as chemisorption process, giving rise to a unique method for the capture of Br2.







Abstract
The high degree of corrosivity and reactivity of bromine, which is released from various sources, poses a serious threat to the environment. Moreover, its coexistence with iodine forming an equilibrium compound, iodine monobromide (IBr) necessitates the selective capture of bromine from halogen mixtures. The electrophilicity of halogens to &#960;&#8208;electron rich structures enabled us to strategically design a covalent organic framework for halogen capture, featuring a defined pore environment with localized sorption sites. The higher capture capacity of bromine (4.6&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) over iodine by ~41&#8201;% shows its potential in selective capture. Spectroscopic results uncovering the preferential interaction sites are supported by theoretical investigations. The alkyne bridge is a core functionality promoting the selectivity in capture by synergistic physisorption, rationalized by the higher orbital overlap of bromine due to its smaller atomic size as well as reversible chemical interactions. The slip stacking in the structure has further promoted this phenomenon by creating clusters of molecular interaction sites with bromine intercalated between the layers. The inclusion of unsaturated moieties, i.e. triple bonds and the complementary pore geometry offer a promising design strategy for the construction of porous materials for halogen capture.

         <title>Anomalous Structural Transformation of Cu(I) Clusters into Multifunctional CuAg Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a doping&#8208;induced, anomalous structural transformation in Cu nanoclusters and uncovered its capability to create different types of alloy nanoclusters with previously unreported structures, properties and functionalities.







Abstract
We report an anomalous structural transformation of a Cu(I) cluster into two different types of copper&#8208;silver (CuAg) alloy nanoclusters. Different from previous reports, we demonstrate that under specifically designed reaction conditions, the Ag&#8208;doping could induce a substantial growth of the starting Cu15 and a Ag13Cu20 nanocluster was obtained via the unexpected insertion of an Ag13 kernel inside the Cu(I)&#8208;S shell. Ag13Cu20 demonstrates high activity to initiate the photopolymerization of previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;print inorganic polymers in 3D laser microprinting. Interestingly, a slight modification of the reaction condition leads to the formation of another Ag18&#8208;xCuxS (8&#8804;x) nanocluster templated by a central S2&#8722; anion, which possesses a unique electronic structure compared to conventional template&#8208;free CuAg nanoclusters. Overall, this work unveils the intriguing doping chemistry of Cu clusters, as well as their capability to create different types of alloy nanoclusters with previously unobtainable structures and multifunctionality.

         <title>Cu1&#8722;Fe Dual Sites for Superior Neutral Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Cu is anchored on the oxide layer of Fe@Cu1FeOx to form Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;sites. The synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and the strengthened water activation on Cu sites decreases the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO hydrogenation, resulting in superior electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is able to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into reusable ammonia (NH3), offering a green treatment and resource utilization strategy of nitrate wastewater and ammonia synthesis. The conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3 undergoes water dissociation to generate active hydrogen atoms and nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation tandemly. The two relay processes compete for the same active sites, especially under pH&#8208;neutral condition, resulting in the suboptimal efficiency and selectivity in the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;. Herein, we constructed a Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst by anchoring Cu single atoms on amorphous iron oxide shell of nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) for the electrochemical NO3RR, achieving an impressive NO3&#8722; removal efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% and NH3 selectivity of 99.2&#8201;% under neutral pH and nitrate concentration of 50&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 NO3&#8722;&#8722;N conditions, greatly surpassing the performance of nZVI counterpart. This superior performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and strengthened water activation on single&#8208;atom Cu sites, decreasing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH. This work develops a novel strategy of fabricating dual&#8208;site catalysts to enhance the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;, and presents an environmentally sustainable approach for neutral nitrate wastewater treatment.
