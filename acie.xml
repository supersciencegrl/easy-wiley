         <title>Exclusive Co&#8208;N4 Sites Confined in Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Layers Enabling Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Together with the exclusive Co&#8208;N4 sites, enlarged surface area, improved electrical conductivity and CO2 adsorption capacity, Co porphyrin&#8208;based porous organic layers exhibit optimal activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO due to the strong *COOH binding and moderate *CO adsorption. Moreover, industrial&#8208;level current above 200&#8197;mA can be achieved in a membrane electrode assembly device with near&#8208;unity CO selectivity over 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework catalysts bring new opportunities for CO2 electrocatalysis. Herein, we first conduct density&#8208;functional theory calculations and predict that Co&#8208;based porphyrin porous organic layers (Co&#8208;PPOLs) exhibit good activity for CO2 conversion because of the low *CO adsorption energy at Co&#8208;N4 sites, which facilitates *CO desorption and CO formation. Then, we prepare two&#8208;dimensional Co&#8208;PPOLs with exclusive Co&#8208;N4 sites through a facile surfactant&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up method. The ultrathin feature ensures the exposure of catalytic centers. Together with large specific area, high electrical conductivity and CO2 adsorption capability, Co&#8208;PPOLs achieve a peak faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO=94.2&#8201;%) at a moderate potential in CO2 electroreduction, accompanied with good stability. Moreover, Co&#8208;PPOLs reach an industrial&#8208;level current above 200&#8197;mA in a membrane electrode assembly reactor, and maintain near&#8208;unity CO selectivity (FECO&gt;90&#8201;%) over 20&#8197;h in CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Non&#8208;symmetric Half&#8208;Fused B&#8592;N Coordinated Diketopyrrolopyrrole Building Block for n&#8208;type Semiconducting Polymers</title>

A new type of building block, half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N coordinated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), is developed for n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers towards flexible OFETs with reliability.







Abstract
The development of conjugated polymers with high semiconducting performance and high reliability is of great significance for flexible electronics. Herein, we developed a new type of electron&#8208;accepting building block; i.e., non&#8208;symmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N coordinated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) (HBNDPP), for amorphous conjugated polymers toward flexible electronics. The rigid B&#8592;N fusion part of HBNDPP endows the resulting polymers with decent electron transport, while its non&#8208;symmetric structure causes the polymer to exhibit multiple conformation isomers with flat torsional potential energies. Thus, it gets packed in an amorphous manner in solid state, ensuring good resistance to bending strain. Combined with hardness and softness, the flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor devices exhibit n&#8208;type charge properties with decent mobility, good bending resistance, and good ambient stability. The preliminary study makes this building block a potential candidate for future design of conjugated materials for flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Apolipoprotein&#8197;E Recognizes Alzheimer's Disease Associated 3&#8208;O Sulfation of Heparan Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of Apolipoprotein&#8197;E (ApoE) with cell surface Heparan Sulfate (HS) is enhanced by a rare, Alzheimer's Disease linked 3&#8208;O&#8208;Sulfo group. This binding motif is shared with tau protein, suggesting a mechanism for ApoE/tau interactions in the association of certain ApoE isoforms with AD.







Abstract
Apolipoprotein&#8197;E (ApoE)&#8217;s &#1013;4 alle is the most important genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cell&#8208;surface heparan sulfate (HS) is a cofactor for ApoE/LRP1 interaction and the prion&#8208;like spread of tau pathology between cells. 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfo (3&#8208;O&#8208;S) modification of HS has been linked to AD through its interaction with tau, and enhanced levels of 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated HS and 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfotransferases in the AD brain. In this study, we characterized ApoE/HS interactions in wildtype ApoE3, AD&#8208;linked ApoE4, and AD&#8208;protective ApoE2 and ApoE3&#8208;Christchurch. Glycan microarray and SPR assays revealed that all ApoE isoforms recognized 3&#8208;O&#8208;S. NMR titration localized ApoE/3&#8208;O&#8208;S binding to the vicinity of the canonical HS binding motif. In cells, the knockout of HS3ST1&#8208;a major 3&#8208;O sulfotransferase&#8208;reduced cell surface binding and uptake of ApoE. 3&#8208;O&#8208;S is thus recognized by both tau and ApoE, suggesting that the interplay between 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated HS, tau and ApoE isoforms may modulate AD risk.

         <title>Formation and Loading of a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;Ethylmalonamyl Starter Unit in the Assembly Line of Polyketide&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Hybrid Sanglifehrin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The process for forming and loading a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl starter unit in the assembly line of sanglifehrin A is uncovered. This process involves two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP): an amide synthetase catalyzes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl amidation, and a homolog of &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl onto the assembly line to prime the biosynthesis of sanglifehrin A.







Abstract
Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a spirolactam&#8208;conjugated, 22&#8208;membered macrolide with remarkable immunosuppressive and antiviral activities. This macrolide is a result of a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line that utilizes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl as a starter unit. Here, we report that the formation and loading of this starter unit in the SFA assembly line involve two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), SfaO. An amide synthetase, SfaP, catalyzes the amidation of (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl in a SfaO&#8208;dependent manner. Then, a &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III&#8208;like protein, SfaN, transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl from SfaO onto the loading ACP domain of the hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS assembly line to prime SFA biosynthesis. Both SfaP and SfaN display promiscuous activities. This study furthers the appreciation of assembly line chemistry, as a new paradigm for unusual building block formation and incorporation is provided.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site Conformational Exchange in the Synthetic Neomycin&#8208;Sensing Riboswitch Studied by 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motions are tightly coupled with function. Here we use a unique combination of five different fluorine NMR relaxation methods to reveal the dynamics in three structurally similar riboswitch:ligand complexes. Our data displays unexpectedly complex exchange topologies with up to four structurally different states. Importantly, the associated kinetic and thermodynamics parameters could be accurately determined.







Abstract
The synthetic neomycin&#8208;sensing riboswitch interacts with its cognate ligand neomycin as well as with the related antibiotics ribostamycin and paromomycin. Binding of these aminoglycosides induces a very similar ground state structure in the RNA, however, only neomycin can efficiently repress translation initiation. The molecular origin of these differences has been traced back to differences in the dynamics of the ligand:riboswitch complexes. Here, we combine five complementary fluorine based NMR methods to accurately quantify seconds to microseconds dynamics in the three riboswitch complexes. Our data reveal complex exchange processes with up to four structurally different states. We interpret our findings in a model that shows an interplay between different chemical groups in the antibiotics and specific bases in the riboswitch. More generally, our data underscore the potential of 19F NMR methods to characterize complex exchange processes with multiple excited states.

         <title>Transformation of an Imine Cage to a Covalent Organic Framework Film at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent chemistry&#8208;directed transformation of an imine cage to highly porous covalent organic framework free&#8208;standing films at the aqueous&#8211;organic interface has been demonstrated under ambient conditions for size&#8208;selective molecular separation. The faster formation and better crystallinity of cage&#8208;derived COF films are due to the imine intermediate&#8208;assisted facile transimination and the dynamic self&#8208;assembly processes at the interface.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) opens up a fascinating route for the construction of well&#8208;organized supramolecular architectures, starting from organic molecular cages to crystalline macromolecular covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein, for the first time, we have manifested a facile room&#8208;temperature DCC&#8208;directed transformation of discrete organic imine cage&#8208;to&#8208;COF film at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The unfolding of the cage leading to the generation of imine intermediates, followed by their interface&#8208;assisted preorganization and subsequent growth of the COF film, are elucidated through detailed spectroscopic and microscopic investigations. The interfacial cage&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation provides a facile route for the faster fabrication of free&#8208;standing COF films with high porosity and crystallinity, demonstrating excellent performance towards molecular sieving and high solvent permeance. Thus, the current study opens up a new route for structural interconversion between two crystalline entities with diverse dimensionality employing DCC at the confined interface.

Herein, for the first time, we have manifested a facile room-temperature DCC-directed transformation of discrete organic imine cage-to-COF film at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface.

         <title>A Cooperative Rhodium/Secondary Phosphine Oxide [Rh/P(O)nBu2] Template for Catalytic Hydrodefluorination of Perfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [Rh/P(O)nBu2] template for catalytic hydrodefluorination of perfluoroarenes is presented. Aside from substrates with electron&#8208;withdrawing functionalities, the system showed a high tolerance for challenging electron&#8208;donating functionalities and heterocycles. Mechanistic studies and a density functional theory study have identified a rhodium(I) dihydride as a catalytic species and the critical role of phosphine oxide as a cooperative fragment.







Abstract
The selective activation of C&#8722;F bonds under mild reaction conditions remains an ongoing challenge of bond activation. Here, we present a cooperative [Rh/P(O)nBu2] template for catalytic hydrodefluorination (HDF) of perfluoroarenes. In addition to substrates presenting electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, the system showed an exceedingly rare tolerance for electron&#8208;donating functionalities and heterocycles. The high chemoselectivity of the catalyst and its readiness to be deployed at a preparative scale illustrate its practicality. Empirical mechanistic studies and a density functional theory (DFT) study have identified a rhodium(I) dihydride complex as a catalytically relevant species and the determining role of phosphine oxide as a cooperative fragment. Altogether, we demonstrate that molecular templates based on these design elements can be assembled to create catalysts with increased reactivity for challenging bond activations.

         <title>Blended Conjugated Host and Unconjugated Dopant Polymers Towards N&#8208;type All&#8208;Polymer Conductors and High&#8208;ZT Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new n&#8208;type polymer PDPIN is synthesized and thermoelectric performance of N&#8208;DMBI, TABF and polymer PSpF&#8208;doped PDPIN are explored. All&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics of PDPIN:PSpF present high electrical conductivity of 78.1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, power factor of 163&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 and ZT of 0.53, suggesting the impressive superiority of PDPIN:PSpF systems in low thermal conductivity and high ZT&#8208;thermoelectrics.







Abstract
N&#8208;Type thermoelectrics typically consist of small molecule dopant+polymer host. Only a few polymer dopant+polymer host systems have been reported, and these have lower thermoelectric parameters. N&#8208;type polymers with high crystallinity and order are generally used for high&#8208;conductivity (
) organic conductors. Few n&#8208;type polymers with only short&#8208;range lamellar stacking for high&#8208;conductivity materials have been reported. Here, we describe an n&#8208;type short&#8208;range lamellar&#8208;stacked all&#8208;polymer thermoelectric system with highest 
 of 78&#8197;S&#8722;1, power factor (PF) of 163&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and maximum Figure of merit (ZT) of 0.53 at room temperature with a dopant/host ratio of 75&#8197;wt%. The minor effect of polymer dopant on the molecular arrangement of conjugated polymer PDPIN at high ratios, high doping capability, high Seebeck coefficient (S) absolute values relative to 
, and atypical decreased thermal conductivity (
) with increased doping ratio contribute to the promising performance.

Abstract
A novel, selective and high&#8208;yielding palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative arylation of a variety of weakly acidic (pKa 25&#8211;35 in DMSO) benzylic and heterobenzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with aryl bromides has been achieved. This system is applicable to a range of pro&#8208;nucleophiles for access to sterically and electronically diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl or &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones, which are ubiquitous substructures in biologically active compounds. The Josiphos SL&#8208;J001&#8208;1&#8208;based palladium catalyst was identified as the most efficient and selective, enabling carbonylative arylation with aryl bromides under 1&#8197;atm CO to provide the ketone products without the formation of direct coupling byproducts. Additionally, (Josiphos)Pd(CO)2 was identified as the catalyst resting state. A kinetic study suggests that the oxidative addition of aryl bromides is the turnover&#8208;limiting step. Key catalytic intermediates were also isolated.

         <title>Molecule Saturation Boosts Acetylene Semihydrogenation Activity and Selectivity on a Core&#8208;Shell Ruthenium@Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalyst for semihydrogenation of acetylene was created by layering Pd on large Ru nanoparticles with terrace sites and a smaller lattice constant. The catalyst stabilizes unsaturated acetylene as it undergoes semihydrogenation while promoting ethylene desorption, thereby achieving high activity and selectivity at the same time.







Abstract
Increasing selectivity without the expense of activity is desired but challenging in heterogeneous catalysis. By revealing the molecule saturation and adsorption sensitivity on overlayer thickness, strain, and coordination of Pd&#8208;based catalysts from first&#8208;principles calculations, we designed a stable Pd monolayer (ML) catalyst on a Ru terrace to boost both activity and selectivity of acetylene semihydrogenation. The least saturated molecule is most sensitive to the change in catalyst electronic and geometric properties. By simultaneously compressing the Pd ML and exposing the high coordination sites, the adsorption of more saturated ethylene is considerably weakened to facilitate the desorption for high selectivity. The even stronger weakening to the least saturated acetylene drives its hydrogenation such that it is more exothermic, thereby boosting the activity. Tailoring the molecule saturation and its sensitivity to structure and composition provides a tool for rational design of efficient catalysts.

         <dc:description>
An enantioselective RhI&#8208;catalyzed Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction (PKR) using 1,6&#8208;chloroenynes with challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins is described. DFT calculations reveal that the halide pre&#8208;polarizes the alkyne to lower the barrier for the metallacycle formation and provides the proper steric profile to permit a favorable enantiodetermining interaction between the 1,6&#8208;chloroenyne and the chiral diphosphine ligand in the rhodium complex.







Abstract
An enantioselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction (PKR) using 1,6&#8208;chloroenynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins is described. In contrast to the previous studies with these types of substrates, which are only suitable for a single type of tether and alkyne substituent, the new approach results in a more expansive substrate scope, including carbon and heteroatom tethers with polar and non&#8208;polar substituents on the alkene. DFT calculations provide critical insight into the role of the halide, which pre&#8208;polarizes the alkyne to lower the barrier for metallacycle formation and provides the proper steric profile to promote a favorable enantiodetermining interaction between substrate and chiral diphosphine ligand. Hence, the chloroalkyne enables the efficient and enantioselective PKR with 1,6&#8208;enynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins, thereby representing a new paradigm for enantioselective reactions involving 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Structure&#8208;editing Fluorescent Hydrogel Actuators for Environment&#8208;interactive Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the metamorphosis development of glowing octopus, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrated a strategy to replicate the structure&#8208;editing capacity of natural organisms into soft artificial actuators/robots. On this basis, it is possible to imitate the environment&#8208;interactive morphology/pattern information delivery function of glowing octopus and thus produce conceptually new environment&#8208;interactive information encryption systems.







Abstract
Many living organisms have the superb structure&#8208;editing capacity for better adaptation in dynamic environments over the course of their life cycle. However, it's still challenging to replicate such natural structure&#8208;editing capacity into artificial hydrogel actuating systems for enhancing environment&#8208;interactive functions. Herein, we learn from the metamorphosis development of glowing octopus to construct proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept fluorescent hydrogel actuators with life&#8208;like structure&#8208;editing capacity by developing a universal stepwise inside&#8208;out growth strategy. These actuators could perform origami&#8208;like 3D shape deformation and also enable the postnatal growth of new structures to adapt additional actuating states for different visual information delivery by using different environment keys (e.g., temperature, pH). This study opens previously unidentified&#8208;avenues of bio&#8208;inspired hydrogel actuators/robotics and extends the potential uses for environment&#8208;interactive information encryption.

         <title>Light&#8208;Start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a Reaction with Caged crRNA Enables Rapid and Sensitive Nucleic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay was developed by combining a light&#8208;start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a reaction system and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for nucleic acid detection. With this platform, the clinical samples of Epstein&#8208;Barr virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) samples can be effectively detected.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is a promising platform for nucleic acid detection. Regulating the CRISPR reaction would be extremely useful to improve the detection efficiency and speed of CRISPR diagnostic applications. Here, we have developed a light&#8208;start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a reaction by employing caged CRISPR RNA (crRNA). When combined with recombinase polymerase amplification, a robust photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay is achieved. The photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay is simpler and is 50&#8208;fold more sensitive than the conventional assay. This improved detection efficiency also facilitates the development of a faster CRISPR diagnostic method. The detection of clinical samples demonstrated that 10&#8211;20&#8197;min is sufficient for effective detection, which is much faster than the current gold&#8208;standard technique PCR. We expect this advance in CRISPR diagnostics to promote its widespread detection applications in biomedicine, agriculture, and food safety.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Arylation of Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of chemoselective, metal&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry.







Abstract
A systematic evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of hitherto unknown chemoselective O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry. Use of the CyPAd&#8208;DalPhos pre&#8208;catalyst C2 enabled particularly challenging O&#8208;arylation chemoselectivity in amino alcohols featuring branched primary and secondary alkylamine groups, while selective N&#8208;arylation was observed in substrates featuring less&#8208;hindered linear alkylamine and aniline reacting groups. Useful reaction scope in the (hetero)aryl chloride was achieved throughout, and the ability to conduct such transformations using benchtop handling of materials is demonstrated.

         <title>An Iridium/Aluminum Cooperative Strategy for the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium/aluminum cooperative catalytic system that enables the &#946;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines and lactams is described. An enantioselective variant using binaphthol&#8208;derived chiral aluminum catalysts to forge C&#8722;B bonds with high levels of stereocontrol has also been developed.







Abstract
Despite the widespread success in the functionalization of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds, the deliberate functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a highly site&#8208; and stereoselective manner remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, we report an iridium/aluminum cooperative catalytic system that enables the &#946;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines and lactams. Furthermore, we have accomplished an enantioselective variant using binaphthol&#8208;derived chiral aluminum catalysts to forge C&#8722;B bonds with high levels of stereocontrol. Computational studies suggest that the formation of a Lewis pair with the substrates is crucial to lower the energy of the transition state for the rate&#8208;determining reductive elimination step.

         <title>Selective Preparation of Phosphorus Mononitride (P&#8801;N) from Phosphinoazide and Reversible Oxidation to Phosphinonitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An o&#8208;benzoquinone complex bearing a P&#8801;N unit displays reversible covalent&#8208;bond formation when exposed to green light in cryogenic matrices. This is the first demonstration of the reactivity of phosphorus mononitride towards an organic molecule.







Abstract
The interstellar candidate phosphorus mononitride PN, a metastable species, was generated through high&#8208;vacuum flash pyrolysis of (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)phosphinoazide in cryogenic matrices. Although the PN stretching band was not directly detected because of its low infrared intensity and possible overlaps with other strong bands, o&#8208;benzoquinone, carbon monoxide, and cyclopentadienone as additional fragmentation products were clearly identified. Moreover, an elusive o&#8208;benzoquinone&#8208;PN complex formed when (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)phosphinoazide was exposed to UV irradiation at &#955;=254&#8197;nm. Its recombination to (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinonitrile was observed upon irradiation with the light at &#955;=523&#8197;nm, which demonstrates for the first time the reactivity of PN towards an organic molecule. Energy profile computations at the B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP density functional theory level reveal a concerted mechanism. To provide further evidence, UV/Vis spectra of the precursor and the irradiation products were recorded and agree well with time&#8208;dependent DFT computations.

         <title>Influence of Potassium Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Dendrite Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography imaging, cryogenic&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM), and mesoscale modeling are combined to explain how the potassium metal&#8208;support energetics influence the electrodeposit microstructure. Wettability critically influences the nucleation response, the growing film morphology and associated stress state, and the propensity for dendritic growth.







Abstract
Combined synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography imaging, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) and modeling elucidate how potassium (K) metal&#8208;support energetics influence electrodeposit microstructure. Three model supports are employed: O&#8208;functionalized carbon cloth (potassiophilic, fully&#8208;wetted), non&#8208;functionalized cloth and Cu foil (potassiophobic, nonwetted). Nanotomography and focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) cross&#8208;sections yield complementary three&#8208;dimensional (3D) maps of cycled electrodeposits. Electrodeposit on potassiophobic support is a triphasic sponge, with fibrous dendrites covered by solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and interspersed with nanopores (sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm to 100&#8197;nm scale). Lage cracks and voids are also a key feature. On potassiophilic support, the deposit is dense and pore&#8208;free, with uniform surface and SEI morphology. Mesoscale modeling captures the critical role of substrate&#8208;metal interaction on K metal film nucleation and growth, as well as the associated stress state.

         <title>A Tailored Versatile and Efficient NHC&#8208;Based NNC&#8208;Pincer Manganese Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Polar Unsaturated Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydride&#8208;transfer reactivity of Mn&#8208;hydride species has been greatly enhanced via rational design of a strong electron&#8208;donating and sterically unhindered NHC&#8208;based NNC&#8208;pincer ligand. This newly developed NNC&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst is highly effective for the hydrogenation of a broad range of polar unsaturated compounds (&gt;80 examples) including esters, N&#8208;heteroarenes, amides, carbonates, and urea derivatives, under relatively mild conditions.







Abstract
The reactivity of metal&#8208;hydride complexes can be harnessed by the modification of ancillary ligands. With the aim of improving the hydride&#8208;donor ability of the key Mn&#8722;H intermediate and reducing steric hindrance, we herein report the rational design of a versatile and efficient NHC&#8208;based NNC&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst for hydrogenation reactions. This newly developed catalyst exhibited higher activity than the corresponding NNP&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst owing to its reduced steric hindrance and enhanced Mn&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bonding orbital energy level through a &#960;&#8208;antibonding interaction. Using this highly active NNC&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst, a rich array of polar unsaturated compounds (&gt;80 examples) including esters, N&#8208;heteroarenes, amides, carbonates, and urea derivatives, were successfully hydrogenated under relatively mild conditions. This work represents a rare example of a general phosphine&#8208;free Mn&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation system.

         <title>Reconstruction of Solid Electrolyte Interphase with SrI2 Reactivates Dead Li for Durable Anode&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dead Li in anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery is suppressed effectively through synergistic mechanisms. With SrI2 incorporation, reversible I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox reaction reactivates dead Li; electronic insulation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) surface with SrF2 and LiF prevents electrolyte decomposition; the inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI demonstrates high ionic conduction (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and enables efficient Li+ transfer and Li deposition inside the SEI.







Abstract
Without excess Li, anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs) have been proposed as the most likely solution to realizing highly&#8208;safe and cost&#8208;effective Li&#8208;metal batteries. Nevertheless, short cyclic life puzzles conventional AFLMBs due to anodic dead Li accumulation with a local current concentration induced by irreversible electrolyte depletion, insufficient active Li reservoir and slow Li+ transfer at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, SrI2 is introduced into carbon paper (CP) current collector to effectively suppress dead Li through synergistic mechanisms including reversible I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox reaction to reactivate dead Li, dielectric SEI surface with SrF2 and LiF to prevent electrolyte decomposition and highly ionic conductive (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI to enable efficient Li+ transfer inside. With the SrI2&#8208;modified current collector, the NCM532/CP cell delivers unprecedented cyclic performances with a capacity of 129.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Visible Light Conjugation with Triazolinediones as a Route to Degradable Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;Lipids for mRNA Lipid Nanoparticle Formulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugation of triazolinediones to poly(ethylene glycol) under visible light irradiation introduces labile bonds into the polymer backbone. These polymers can be used for engineering mRNA lipid nanoparticle formulations with a polymer coating that is degradable under physiologically relevant aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is considered as the gold standard for colloidal stabilization of nanomedicines, yet PEG is non&#8208;degradable and lacks functionality on the backbone. Herein, we introduce concomitantly PEG backbone functionality and degradability via a one&#8208;step modification with 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones (TAD) under green light. The TAD&#8208;PEG conjugates are degradable in aqueous medium under physiological conditions, with the rate of hydrolysis depending on pH and temperature. Subsequently, a PEG&#8208;lipid is modified with TAD&#8208;derivatives and successfully used for messenger RNA (mRNA) lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery, thereby improving mRNA transfection efficiency on multiple cell cultures in vitro. In vivo, in mice, mRNA LNP formulation exhibited a similar tissue distribution as common LNPs, with a slight decrease in transfection efficiency. Our findings pave the road towards the design of degradable, backbone&#8208;functionalized PEG for applications in nanomedicine and beyond.

         <title>Conformationally Controlled sp3&#8208;Hydrocarbon&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aberrant protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) in disease can be disrupted through &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics. However, methods to control the conformation of mimetics for maximum efficacy can be restrictive. Here we show that destabilising syn&#8208;pentane interactions allow substituted hydrocarbons to adopt well&#8208;defined conformations to present functional groups in a way that mimics the &#945;&#8208;helix, thus allowing them to be used as scaffolds for inhibitor design.







Abstract
With over 60&#8201;% of protein&#8211;protein interfaces featuring an &#945;&#8208;helix, the use of &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics as inhibitors of these interactions is a prevalent therapeutic strategy. However, methods to control the conformation of mimetics, thus enabling maximum efficacy, can be restrictive. Alternatively, conformation can be controlled through the introduction of destabilizing syn&#8208;pentane interactions. This tactic, which is often adopted by Nature, is not a common feature of lead optimization owing to the significant synthetic effort required. Through assembly&#8208;line synthesis with NMR and computational analysis, we have shown that alternating syn&#8211;anti configured contiguously substituted hydrocarbons, by avoiding syn&#8208;pentane interactions, adopt well&#8208;defined conformations that present functional groups in an arrangement that mimics the &#945;&#8208;helix. The design of a p53 mimetic that binds to Mdm2 with moderate to good affinity, demonstrates the therapeutic promise of these scaffolds.

         <title>Crystallinity Regulation and Defects Passivation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Using Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones with high specific surface area and excellent stability. The PAFs were successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer, and the power conversion efficiencies and stability significantly increased.







Abstract
Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) have been constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones, high specific surface area, and excellent stability. The prepared PAF&#8208;154 and PAF&#8208;155 have been successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer. The champion PSC devices afford a power conversion efficiency of 22.8&#8201;% and 22.4&#8201;%. It is found that the PAFs can be used as an efficient nucleation template, thus regulating the perovskite crystallinity. Meanwhile, PAFs can also passivate defects and promote carriers transporting in the perovskite film. By the comparative study with their linear counterpart, we unravel that the efficacy of PAFs is highly related to their porous structure and rigid fully conjugated networks. The unencapsulated devices with PAFs doping exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 80&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after half&#8208;year storage in ambient conditions.

A Pd0 complex can mediate dehydrogenative formation of 2,4&#8208;diene systems from &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls in the presence of 2,6&#8208;DMBQ (2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone), which undergo vinylogous addition to imines via auto&#8208;tandem Pd0&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalysis. Both chemically inverse &#948;&#8208;regioselective aza&#8208;Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts and &#945;&#8208;regioselective normal ones are obtained switchably and stereoselectively by tuning catalytic conditions.







Abstract
&#963;&#8208;Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective aza&#8208;Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated systems remains a challenge due to the intrinsic covalent activation mode. Here we demonstrate that a Pd0 complex can mediate the dehydrogenative reaction of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated compounds to give corresponding electron&#8208;poor dienes, which further undergo &#948;&#8208;regioselective umpolung Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type addition to imines via auto&#8208;tandem Pd0&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalysis. After &#946;&#8208;H elimination of in situ formed PdII&#8208;complexes, unprecedented and chemically inverse aza&#8208;MBH&#8208;type adducts are finally furnished with fair to outstanding enantioselectivity, and a diversity of functional groups and both ketimine and aldimine acceptors can be well tolerated. Moreover, switchable &#945;&#8208;regioselective normal aza&#8208;MBH&#8208;type reaction also can be realized by tuning catalytic conditions, whereas moderate to good enantioselectivity with low to excellent Z/E&#8208;selectivity is attained.

         <title>A Hemilabile NHC&#8208;Gold Complex and its Application to the Redox Neutral 1,2&#8208;Oxyarylation of Feedstock Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A hemi&#8208;labile (C^N) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand mediates oxidative addition of aryl iodides to a AuI center. The oxidative addition process has been studied and analyzed computationally. This process allows the first examples of &#8220;exogenous oxidant&#8208;free&#8221; AuI/AuIII catalyzed 1,2&#8208;oxyarylations of ethylene and propylene.







Abstract
We describe a AuI complex of a hemi&#8208;labile (C^N) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand that is able to mediate oxidative addition of aryl iodides. Detailed computational and experimental investigations have been undertaken to verify and rationalize the oxidative addition process. Application of this initiation mode has resulted in the first examples of &#8220;exogenous oxidant&#8208;free&#8221; AuI/AuIII catalyzed 1,2&#8208;oxyarylations of ethylene and propylene. These demanding yet powerful processes establish these commodity chemicals as nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic building blocks in catalytic reaction design.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Receptors as Transmembrane Signal Transduction Systems for Protocellular Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based dimers are designed as artificial membrane receptors for transmembrane signal transduction and amplification without physical mass exchange, which facilitates the establishment of a signalling network in protocell colonies.







Abstract
The ability to reproduce signal transduction and cellular communication in artificial cell systems is significant in synthetic protobiology. Here, we describe an artificial transmembrane signal transduction through low pH&#8208;mediated formation of the i&#8208;motif and dimerization of DNA&#8208;based artificial membrane receptors, which is coupled to the occurrence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the activation of G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin&#8208;mediated fluorescence amplification inside giant unilamellar vesicles. Moreover, an intercellular signal communication model is established when the extravesicular H+ input is replaced by coacervate microdroplets, which activate the dimerization of the artificial receptors, and subsequent fluorescence production or polymerization in giant unilamellar vesicles. This study represents a crucial step towards designing artificial signalling systems with environmental response, and provides an opportunity to establish signalling networks in protocell colonies.

         <title>Structure&#8208; and Data&#8208;Driven Protein Engineering of Transaminases for Improving Activity and Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using structure&#8208;dependent protein engineering of transaminases, a high&#8208;quality catalytic activity and stereoselectivity dataset was collected. A machine learning predictor was built based on this dataset and successfully applied in the data&#8208;driven protein engineering resulting in enzyme variants with significantly improved activity, higher and even inversed stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Amine transaminases (ATAs) are powerful biocatalysts for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines. Machine learning provides a promising approach for protein engineering, but activity prediction models for ATAs remain elusive due to the difficulty of obtaining high&#8208;quality training data. Thus, we first created variants of the ATA from Ruegeria sp. (3FCR) with improved catalytic activity (up to 2000&#8208;fold) as well as reversed stereoselectivity by a structure&#8208;dependent rational design and collected a high&#8208;quality dataset in this process. Subsequently, we designed a modified one&#8208;hot code to describe steric and electronic effects of substrates and residues within ATAs. Finally, we built a gradient boosting regression tree predictor for catalytic activity and stereoselectivity, and applied this for the data&#8208;driven design of optimized variants which then showed improved activity (up to 3&#8208;fold compared to the best variants previously identified). We also demonstrated that the model can predict the catalytic activity for ATA variants of another origin by retraining with a small set of additional data.

         <title>Noninvasive Early Diagnosis of Allograft Rejection by a Granzyme B Protease Responsive NIR&#8208;II Bioimaging Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a non&#8208;invasive imaging strategy for sensing transplant rejection based on the granzyme B protease activity by using a ratiometric second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) nanosensor, ErGZ. ErGZ accomplished early detection of allograft rejection at 5 d post&#8208;operation by both in vivo fluorescence imaging and in vitro urinary excretion measurement, providing a promising alternative to biopsy for routine screening of early immunological rejection.







Abstract
Early diagnosis of allograft rejection helps to improve the immune&#8208;related management of transplant recipients. The clinically&#8208;used core needle biopsy method is invasive and subject to sampling error. In vivo fluorescence imaging for monitoring immune&#8208;related processes has the advantages of non&#8208;invasiveness, fast feedback and high sensitivity. Herein, we report a responsive second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent nanosensor (ErGZ) to detect early allograft rejection. ErGZ allows ratiometric in vivo fluorescence sensing of granzyme B, which is overexpressed in recipients&#8217; T cells during the onset of rejection. The sensor demonstrates efficacious detection of allograft rejection with high sensitivity and specificity, which accomplishes non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of rejection in skin and deep buried islets transplant mice models 2 d and 5 d earlier than biopsy, by in vivo fluorescence imaging and urinary detection, respectively, providing a valuable approach for therapeutical management.

         <title>A Strong&#8208;Acid&#8208;Resistant [Th6] Cluster&#8208;Based Framework for Effectively and Size&#8208;Selectively Catalyzing Reductive Amination of Aldehydes with N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong&#8208;acid&#8208;resistant [Th6] cluster&#8208;based framework containing stacked nanocages was constructed and demonstrated excellent efficiency and stability in the reductive amination of various aldehydes with N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide as the amino source, reductant and solvent. In addition, this catalyst displayed a catalytic size&#8208;selectivity for aldehydes that has not been observed previously for this reaction.







Abstract
Utilization of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) as an amine source and reductant for synthesizing tertiary amines is a promising way to replace the substrates formaldehyde and dimethylamine, and it is desirable to seek porous acid&#8208;resistant catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis of this reaction. Herein, a robust metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {[Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6(BCP)3]&#8901;10&#8201;DMF}n (1) containing stacked nanocages with a diameter of 1.55&#8197;nm was constructed. Compound 1 can maintain its single&#8208;crystal structure even kept in air at 400&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h, and in DMF or water at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 7&#8197;days. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the high interaction energy between the [Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6]12+ clusters and ligands was responsible for the excellent stability of 1. Catalytic investigations revealed that 1 can effectively and size&#8208;selectively catalyze the reductive amination of aldehydes with DMF, and it can be reused at least five times without obvious loss in catalytic activity.

         <title>Electroreductive Dicarboxylation of Unactivated Skipped Dienes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful electrochemical protocol that enables the first dicarboxylation of unactivated skipped dienes with CO2 is reported. Various valuable tethered adipic acids are formed in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields under mild conditions, showing great potential in synthetic, medicinal and polymer chemistry.







Abstract
Carboxylation of easily available alkenes with CO2 is highly important to afford value&#8208;added carboxylic acids. Although dicarboxylation of activated alkenes, especially 1,3&#8208;dienes, has been widely investigated, the challenging dicarboxylation of unactivated 1,n&#8208;dienes (n&gt;3) with CO2 remains unexplored. Herein, we report the first dicarboxylation of unactivated skipped dienes with CO2 via electrochemistry, affording valuable dicarboxylic acids. Control experiments and DFT calculations support the single electron transfer (SET) reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which is followed by sluggish radical addition to unactivated alkenes, SET reduction of unstabilized alkyl radicals to carbanions and nucleophilic attack on CO2 to give desired products. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, facile derivations of products and promising application in polymer chemistry.

         <title>Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of Enantiopure Bicyclic Ether&#8208;ester Monomers toward Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable and Crystalline Stereoregular Polyesters via Chemical Upcycling of Bioplastic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling of P3HB into enantiopure bicyclic ether&#8208;ester monomers, and their ROP to produce crystalline stereoregular polyesters and their reversed depolymerization are described.







Abstract
Although great successes have been achieved, the preparation of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyesters with high working temperatures still remains as a big challenge. Herein, we present the syntheses of a series of enantiopure bicyclic ether&#8208;ester monomers by upcycling of poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) bioplastic. The &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers to produce stereoregular polyesters with controlled molecular weights and well&#8208;defined chain ends were achieved. The effects of stereoconfiguration and substituent on polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as the thermal properties of resultant polyesters were investigated. Of note, the stereoregular polyesters are semi&#8208;crystalline materials with melting temperatures up to 176&#8201;&#176;C, even higher than the commodity polyolefin plastics. These polyesters can be depolymerized back to recover pristine monomers, thus successfully establishing a closed&#8208;loop life cycle.

         <title>Insight into the Molecular Mechanism for Enhanced Longevity of Supramolecular Vesicular Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study puts forward a new membrane&#8208;based heterogenization strategy to promote the stability of organic photocatalysts. The underlying mechanisms of enhanced longevity of supramolecular systems are disclosed at the molecular level. The as&#8208;prepared biomimetic photocatalysts display long exciton lifetime and fast &#8220;hot&#8221; electron relaxation, and work efficiently up to at least 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is a promising strategy for stabilizing the photo&#8208;sensitive components in photocatalysis. However, the underlying correlation between the enhanced photostability and supramolecular structure at the molecular level has not yet been fully understood. Herein, we develop a biomimetic vesicular membrane&#8208;based polyporphyrin photocatalyst exhibiting excellent photocatalytic stability with at least activity time of 240&#8197;h in hydrogen generation. Time&#8208;domain ab initio modelling together with transient absorption spectroscopy, visual frontier orbitals and Gibbs free energy calculation disclose that the ordered aggregation of porphyrin units in the vesicle membrane facilitates &#8220;hot&#8221; electron relaxation and the rapid dissipation of photo&#8208;generated charges, thereby contributing to the longevity. This work deepens the molecular&#8208;level understanding on photostability and photocatalytic mechanism of supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Inducing Covalent Atomic Interaction in Intermetallic Pt Alloy Nanocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the construction of covalent interactions between Pt and Ga atoms, the developed L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa/C ORR catalyst shows efficient and stable performance in practical fuel cells. This work may provide a new strategy to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts via tuning the type of chemical bonds for electrochemical energy conversion.







Abstract
The harsh working environments of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) pose huge challenges to the stability of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts. The widespread presence of metallic bonds with significantly delocalized electron distribution often lead to component segregation and rapid performance decay. Here we report L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticles with a unique covalent atomic interaction between Pt&#8722;Ga as high&#8208;performance PEMFC cathode catalysts. The L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa/C catalyst shows superb oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in fuel cell cathode (mass activity=0.57&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=2.60/1.24&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2/air, 28&#8197;mV voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Theoretical calculations reveal the optimized adsorption of oxygen intermediates via the formed biaxial strain on L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa surface, and the durability enhancement stems from the stronger Pt&#8722;M bonds than those in L11&#8722;PtCu resulted from Pt&#8722;Ga covalent interactions.

Here we report L1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuGa intermetallic nanoparticles with a unique covalent atomic interaction between Pt&#8722;Ga as high-performance PEMFC cathode catalysts. The L1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuGa/C catalyst shows superb oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in fuel cell cathode (mass activity=0.57&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=2.60/1.24&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air, 28&#8197;mV voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; after 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Theoretical calculations reveal the optimized adsorption of oxygen intermediates via the formed biaxial strain on L1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuGa surface, and the durability enhancement stems from the stronger Pt&#8722;M bonds than those in L1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;PtCu resulted from Pt&#8722;Ga covalent interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergizing Electron and Heat Flows in Photocatalyst for Direct Conversion of Captured CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ternary hybrid photocatalyst architecture is developed to convert amine&#8208;captured CO2 to syngas with solar energy. The carbon nanotube plays key roles in transferring photoexcited electrons from the quantum dot to the molecular catalyst and in generating local heat from light irradiation for carbamate activation.







Abstract
We report a ternary hybrid photocatalyst architecture with tailored interfaces that boost the utilization of solar energy for photochemical CO2 reduction by synergizing electron and heat flows in the photocatalyst. The photocatalyst comprises cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) molecules assembled on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are decorated with nearly monodispersed cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs). The CdS QDs absorb visible light and generate electron&#8208;hole pairs. The CNTs rapidly transfer the photogenerated electrons from CdS to CoPc. The CoPc molecules then selectively reduce CO2 to CO. The interfacial dynamics and catalytic behavior are clearly revealed by time&#8208;resolved and in situ vibrational spectroscopies. In addition to serving as electron highways, the black body property of the CNT component can create local photothermal heating to activate amine&#8208;captured CO2, namely carbamates, for direct photochemical conversion without additional energy input.

         <title>The Indenyl Effect: Accelerated C&#8722;H Amidation of Arenes via Ind*RhIII Nitrene Transfer Catalysis

The acyl silane directed C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes via nitrene transfer catalysis using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones as the N&#8208;donor source was significantly accelerated in the presence of a heptamethylindenyl&#8208;rhodium catalyst (Ind*RhIII).







Abstract
Investigations into C&#8722;H amidation reactions catalysed by cationic half&#8208;sandwich d6 metal complexes revealed that the indenyl&#8208;derived catalyst [Ind*RhCl2]2 significantly accelerated the directed ortho C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones. Ring slippage involving a haptotropic &#951;5 to &#951;3 rearrangement of the indenyl complex proposedly enables ligand substitution at the metal centre to proceed via associative, rather than dissociative pathways, leading to significant rate and yield enhancements. Intriguingly, this phenomenon appears specific for C&#8722;H amidation reactions involving weakly coordinating carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups with no acceleration observed for the corresponding reactions involving strongly coordinating nitrogen&#8208;based directing groups.

         <title>Co0&#8722;Co&#948;+ Interface Double&#8208;Site&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling for the Photothermal Conversion of CO2 into Light Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co0&#8722;Co&#948;+ interfacial double sites exhibit excellent selectivity toward light olefins during the hydrogenation of CO2 enhanced by light irradiation when compared with pure metallic Co. Owing to the interfacial effect, Co0&#8722;Co&#948;+ exhibits a lower hydrogenation ability than metallic Co, tuning a pathway with a manageable activation barrier for C&#8722;C coupling.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 hydrogenation into multi&#8208;carbon products is a highly desirable, but challenging reaction. The bottleneck of this reaction lies in the C&#8722;C coupling of C1 intermediates. Herein, we construct the C&#8722;C coupling centre for C1 intermediates via the in situ formation of Co0&#8722;Co&#948;+ interface double sites on MgAl2O4 (Co&#8722;CoOx/MAO). Our experimental and theoretical prediction results confirmed the effective adsorption and activation of CO2 by the Co0 site to produce C1 intermediates, while the introduction of the electron&#8208;deficient state of Co&#948;+ can effectively reduce the energy barrier of the key CHCH* intermediates. Consequently, Co&#8722;CoOx/MAO exhibited a high C2&#8211;4 hydrocarbons production rate of 1303&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1; the total organic carbon selectivity of C2&#8211;4 hydrocarbons is 62.5&#8201;% under light irradiation with a high ratio (&#8776;11) of olefin to paraffin. This study provides a new approach toward the design of photocatalysts used for CO2 conversion into C2+ products.

         <title>Towards Automated Microfluidic&#8208;based Platforms: Optimizing Hydrogenation Efficiency of Nitrobenzene through &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Pd Nanoparticles on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

A Put&amp;Play Automated Microplatform(PPAM) was established herein to enhance the hydrogenation performance of palladium nanoparticles on the covalent organic frameworks (Pd/TP&#8208;COFs) and also showed the unconventional superiority of coating over mixing in heterogeneous reactions.







Abstract
Microplatform with timed automata has been leveraged for guiding the preparation of molecules, whereas the requirement of handling expertise and sophisticated instrument is inevitable in combination with heterogeneous catalysis. Here we report a microfluidic&#8208;based autolab with open structures, called Put &amp; Play Automated Microplatform (PPAM). It shows the efficient hydrogenation performance of palladium nanoparticles on the triphenylene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Pd/TP&#8208;COFs) in which the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of TP rings in the vicinity of Pd is optimized by easy change&#8208;over of catalyst and simple tuning of reactor geometries in PPAM. Using experiment/simulation of the Pd/TP&#8208;COFs coating (PCC) and mixing (PCM) across PPAM with different channel sizes, the turnover frequencies are 60&#8197;times the commonly used batch reactor, and aniline productivity of 8.8&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 is achieved in 0.09&#8197;cm3. This work will raise awareness about the benefits of the catalyst&#8208;loaded microplatform in future materials performance campaigns.

         <title>Discovery of the Lanthipeptide Curvocidin&#8197;and Structural Insights into its Trifunctional Synthetase CuvL</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Class&#8208;IV lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL forms a central reaction chamber by arranging its three catalytic domains in circular manner. The precursor peptide of curvocidin uses its N&#8208;terminal leader region to wrap around the kinase N&#8208;lobe of CuvL, while its C&#8208;terminal substrate region can shuttle within the chamber for iterative phosphorylation, &#946;&#8208;elimination and thioether&#8208;ring installment.







Abstract
Lanthipeptides are ribosomally&#8208;synthesized natural products from bacteria featuring stable thioether&#8208;crosslinks and various bioactivities. Herein, we report on a new clade of tricyclic class&#8208;IV lanthipeptides with curvocidin from Thermomonospora curvata as its first representative. We obtained crystal structures of the corresponding lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL that showed a circular arrangement of its kinase, lyase and cyclase domains, forming a central reaction chamber for the iterative substrate processing involving nine catalytic steps. The combination of experimental data and artificial intelligence&#8208;based structural models identified the N&#8208;terminal subdomain of the kinase domain as the primary site of substrate recruitment. The ribosomal precursor peptide of curvocidin employs an amphipathic &#945;&#8208;helix in its leader region as an anchor to CuvL, while its substrate core shuttles within the central reaction chamber. Our study thus reveals general principles of domain organization and substrate recruitment of class&#8208;IV and class&#8208;III lanthipeptide synthetases.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;triggered Carbon Monoxide and Manganese Dioxide Generation based on Scintillating Nanoparticles for Cascade Cancer Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomposites displaying X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide and manganese dioxide generation were fabricated with UV&#8208;responsive manganese carbonyl and radioluminescent scintillating nanoparticles. The glycolytic inhibition of carbon monoxide, coupled with the Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like activity of manganese dioxide, greatly boost the effect of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with broad therapeutic effects. Here, a multifunctional X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide (CO) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) generation nanoplatform based on metal carbonyl and scintillating nanoparticles (SCNPs) is reported. Attributed to the radioluminescent characteristic of SCNPs, UV&#8208;responsive Mn2(CO)10 is not only indirectly activated to release CO by X&#8208;ray but can also be degraded into MnO2. A high dose of CO can be used as a glycolytic inhibitor for tumor suppression; it will also sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy. Meanwhile MnO2, as the photolytic byproduct of Mn2(CO)10, has both glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton&#8208;like Mn2+ delivery properties to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) in tumors. Thus, this strategy can realize X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated CO release, GSH depletion, and &#8901;OH generation for cascade cancer radiosensitization. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated Mn2+ in vivo demonstrates an MRI contrast effect, making it a potential theranostic nanoplatform.

         <title>Diazabicyclic Electroactive Ionenes for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazabicyclic electroactive ionenes with high density of interfacial dipoles are developed as interlayers in organic solar cells. Devices containing the optimal electroactive ionene interlayer give efficiency up to 18.43&#8201;% and excellent operational stability with exceptional interlayer thickness tolerance over 100&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Electroactive ionenes combining caged&#8208;shaped diazabicyclic cations and aromatic diimides were developed as interlayers in organic solar cells (OSCs). These ionenes reduce the work&#8208;function of air&#8208;stable metal electrodes (e.g., Ag, Cu and Au) by generating strong interfacial dipoles, and their optoelectronic and morphological characters can be modulated by aromatic diimides, leading to high conductivity and good compatibility with active layers. The optimal ionene exhibits superior charge&#8208;transport, desirable crystallinity, and weak visible&#8208;absorption, boosting the efficiency of benchmark PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based OSCs up to 17.44&#8201;%. The corresponding normal devices show excellent stability at maximum power point test under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h. Replacing Y6 with L8&#8208;BO promotes the efficiency to 18.43&#8201;%, one of the highest in binary OSCs. Notably, high efficiencies &gt;16&#8201;% are maintained as the interlayer thickness increasing to 105&#8197;nm, the best result with interlayer&#8208;thickness over 100&#8197;nm.

         <title>Manipulating Electric Double Layer Adsorption for Stable Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase in 2.3&#8197;Ah Zn&#8208;Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to the conventional &#8220;bulk solvation&#8221; mechanism, it is shown that the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) structure is dominated by electric double layer (EDL) adsorption. We manipulate the EDL adsorption and Zn2+ solvation with a series of ether additives (i.e. 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5, 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4, and triglyme), and 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 with medium adsorption on EDL led to a layer&#8208;structured SEI.







Abstract
Constructing a reliable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is imperative for enabling highly reversible zinc metal (Zn0) electrodes. Contrary to conventional &#8220;bulk solvation&#8221; mechanism, we found the SEI structure is dominated by electric double layer (EDL) adsorption. We manipulate the EDL adsorption and Zn2+ solvation with ether additives (i.e. 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5, 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4, and triglyme). The 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 with medium adsorption on EDL leads to a layer&#8208;structured SEI with inner inorganic ZnFx/ZnSx and outer organic C&#8722;O&#8722;C components. This structure endows SEI with high rigidness and strong toughness enabling the 100&#8197;cm2 Zn||Zn pouch cell to exhibit a cumulative capacity of 4250&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, a 2.3&#8197;Ah Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#8901;n&#8201;H2O pouch cell delivers a recorded energy density of 104&#8197;Wh&#8201;Lcell&#8722;1 and runs for &gt;70&#8197;days under the harsh conditions of low negative/positive electrode ratio (2.2&#8201;:&#8201;1), lean electrolyte (8&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1), and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity (&#8776;13&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Rapid Phase Transitions of Thermotropic Glycolipid Quasicrystal and Frank&#8208;Kasper Mesophases: A Mechanistic Rosetta Stone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rich thermotropic phase map is documented for a class of versatile glycolipids that now includes dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and Frank&#8208;Kasper A15, and &#963; mesophases of tunable periodicity that are connected through rapid thermotropic phase transitions as a function of increasing temperature. This includes the first direct observation of a rapid thermotropic A15&#8594;&#963; phase transition that is proposed to proceed through a diffusionless martensitic process.







Abstract
Experimental results are presented that serve to lower the barrier for developing the science and technology of non&#8208;classical thermotropic glycolipid mesophases, which now include dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and Frank&#8211;Kasper (FK) A15 and &#963; mesophases that can be produced under mild conditions from a versatile class of sugar&#8208;polyolefin conjugates. By employing &#8220;alloys&#8221; comprised of mono&#8208; and disaccharide&#8208;polyolefin conjugates, and optionally with vitamin E as a small molecule phase modulator, we report the spontaneous formation of stable A15 mesophases at ambient temperature. We further document a rich thermotropic phase map that includes DDQC, A15, and &#963; mesophases of tunable periodicity that are connected through rapid thermotropic phase transitions as a function of increasing temperature in the order: liquid&#8208;like packing (LLP)&#8594;DDQC &#8594; A15&#8594;&#963;&#8594; disorder. This first direct observation of a rapid thermotropic A15&#8594;&#963; phase transition provides support for a diffusionless martensitic process proceeding through strain&#8208;induced introduction of planar defects into the A15 lattice.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells by a Multifunctional Composite Photoanode to 14.13&#8201;%</title>

A new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres, Au nanoparticles and upconversion nanoparticles is presented. A champion power conversion efficiency of 14.13&#8201;% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells.







Abstract
We report a new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres (TiO2&#8208;HSs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and novel NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Yb,Er@NaLuF4&#8201;:&#8201;Eu@SiO2 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The AuNPs are grown on the photoanode film including TiO2&#8208;HSs and UCNPs by a simple in situ plasmonic treatment. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.13&#8201;% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, demonstrating great potential for the solar cells toward commercialization. This obvious enhancement is ascribed to a collaborative mechanism of the TiO2&#8208;HSs exhibiting excellent light&#8208;scattering ability, of the UCNPs converting near&#8208;infrared photons into visible photons and of the AuNPs presenting outstanding surface plasmon resonance effect. Notably, a steady&#8208;state experiment further reveals that the champion cell exhibits 95.33&#8201;% retainment in efficiency even after 180&#8197;h of measurements, showing good device stability.

         <title>Ambient Preparation of Benzoxazine&#8208;based Phenolic Resins Enables Long&#8208;term Sustainable Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and exceptional benzoxazine&#8208;based phenolic resin photocatalyst was developed for hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis. Benzoxazine structure was identified as the crucial active segment in resins, which accelerated the reaction kinetically through low energy barrier and favorable adsorption of oxygen and intermediates.







Abstract
Rational design of polymer structures at the molecular level promotes the iteration of high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production from oxygen and water, which also lays the basis for revealing the reaction mechanism. Here we report a benzoxazine&#8208;based m&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;formaldehyde resin (APFac) polymerized at ambient conditions, exhibiting superior H2O2 yield and long&#8208;term stability to most polymeric photocatalysts. Benzoxazine structure was identified as the crucial photocatalytic active segment in APFac. Favorable adsorption of oxygen/intermediates on benzoxazine structure and commendable product selectivity accelerated the reaction kinetically in stepwise single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The proposed benzoxazine&#8208;based phenolic resin provides the possibility of production in batches and industrial application, and sheds light on the de novo design and analysis of metal&#8208;free polymeric photocatalysts.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission by Molecular Design: A Route to High&#8208;Performance Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state nanomorphology that enables aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) is shown to be compatible with the ion redistribution that defines the operation of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), and appropriately designed AIE&#8208;LECs are reported to deliver fast&#8208;to&#8208;turn and efficient emission at low voltage.







Abstract
The emission efficiency of organic semiconductors (OSCs) often suffers from aggregation caused quenching (ACQ). An elegant solution is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which constitutes the design of the OSC so that its morphology inhibits quenching &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and non&#8208;radiative motional deactivation. The light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) can be sustainably fabricated, but its function depends on motion of bulky ions in proximity of the OSC. It is therefore questionable whether the AIE morphology can be retained during LEC operation. Here, we synthesize two structurally similar OSCs, which are distinguished by that 1 features ACQ while 2 delivers AIE. Interestingly, we find that the AIE&#8208;LEC significantly outperforms the ACQ&#8208;LEC. We rationalize our finding by showing that the AIE morphology remains intact during LEC operation, and that it can feature appropriately sized free&#8208;volume voids for facile ion transport and suppressed non&#8208;radiative excitonic deactivation.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Permeable Dual&#8208;Mechanism&#8208;Driven Graphene Oxide Framework Membranes for Precision Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p&#8208;IP) strategy is developed to fabricate a graphene oxide (GO) framework membrane with a highly positively charged surface for ion sieving. The generated electrostatic repulsion of ions from the positively charged surface, in conjunction with reinforced size exclusion from the p&#8208;IP&#8208;formed polyamide network, endows the membrane with outstanding performance for ion separation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional graphene oxide (GO) membranes are gaining popularity as a promising means to address global water scarcity. However, current GO membranes fail to sufficiently exclude angstrom&#8208;sized ions from solution. Herein, a de novo &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p&#8208;IP) strategy is reported to construct a tailor&#8208;made polyamide (PA) network in situ in an ultrathin GO membrane to strengthen size exclusion while imparting a positively charged membrane surface to repel metal ions. The electrostatic repulsion toward metal ions, coupled with the reinforced size exclusion, synergistically drives the high&#8208;efficiency metal ion separation through the synthesized positively charged GO framework (PC&#8208;GOF) membrane. This dual&#8208;mechanism&#8208;driven PC&#8208;GOF membrane exhibits superior metal ion rejection, anti&#8208;fouling ability, good operational stability, and ultra&#8208;high permeance (five times that of pristine GO membranes), enabling a sound step towards a sustainable water&#8208;energy&#8208;food nexus.

The generated electrostatic repulsion of ions from the positively charged surface, in conjunction with reinforced size exclusion from the p-IP-formed polyamide network, endows the membrane with outstanding performance for ion separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO) membranes are gaining popularity as a promising means to address global water scarcity. However, current GO membranes fail to sufficiently exclude angstrom-sized ions from solution. Herein, a de novo &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p-IP) strategy is reported to construct a tailor-made polyamide (PA) network in situ in an ultrathin GO membrane to strengthen size exclusion while imparting a positively charged membrane surface to repel metal ions. The electrostatic repulsion toward metal ions, coupled with the reinforced size exclusion, synergistically drives the high-efficiency metal ion separation through the synthesized positively charged GO framework (PC-GOF) membrane. This dual-mechanism-driven PC-GOF membrane exhibits superior metal ion rejection, anti-fouling ability, good operational stability, and ultra-high permeance (five times that of pristine GO membranes), enabling a sound step towards a sustainable water-energy-food nexus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Solar&#8208;osmotic Power Generation from Bioinspired Anti&#8208;fouling 2D WS2 Composite Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Kevlar&#8208;toughened WS2 composite membrane was fabricated for osmotic energy conversion. Benefiting from the synergistic cooperation of photo&#8208;electronic and photo&#8208;thermal effects of WS2, the output power density of osmotic energy generator with this membrane could reach 16.43&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under asymmetric irradiation.







Abstract
Nanofluidic reverse electrodialysis provides an attractive way to harvest osmotic energy. However, most attention was paid to monotonous membrane structure optimization to promote selective ion transport, while the role of external fields and relevant mechanisms are rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate a Kevlar&#8208;toughened tungsten disulfide (WS2) composite membrane with bioinspired serosa&#8208;mimetic structures as an efficient osmotic energy generator coupling light. As a result, the output power could be up to 16.43&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under irradiation, outperforming traditional two&#8208;dimensional (2D) membranes. Both the experiment and simulation uncover that the generated photothermal and photoelectronic effects could synergistically promote the confined ion transport process. In addition, this membrane also possesses great anti&#8208;fouling properties, endowing its practical application. This work paves new avenues for sustainable power generation by coupling solar energy.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Recycling of FeX2/FeX3 for Efficient Halogenation of C&#8722;H Bonds Using NaX</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeX2 coupled semiconductor system accelerates oxygen reduction and halogen radical generation, resulting in efficient, selective, and continuous photocatalytic halogenation using NaX as the halogen source under mild conditions.







Abstract
Environmental&#8208;friendly halogenation of C&#8722;H bonds using abundant, non&#8208;toxic halogen salts is in high demand in various chemical industries, yet the efficiency and selectivity of laboratory available protocols are far behind the conventional photolytic halogenation process which uses hazardous halogen sources. Here we report an FeX2 (X=Br, Cl) coupled semiconductor system for efficient, selective, and continuous photocatalytic halogenation using NaX as halogen source under mild conditions. Herein, FeX2 catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen and the consumption of generated oxygen radicals, thus boosting the generation of halogen radicals and elemental halogen for direct halogenation and indirect halogenation via the formation of FeX3. Recycling of FeX2 and FeX3 during the photocatalytic process enables the halogenation of a wide range of hydrocarbons in a continuous flow, rendering it a promising method for applications.

Photocatalytic activity can be enhanced up to three times by confining the catalyst within a compact single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticle environment, while retaining homocatalytic reaction conditions.







Abstract
We introduce a single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) system capable of catalyzing the photooxidation of nonpolar alkenes up to three times more efficiently than an equivalent small&#8208;molecule photosensitizer at an identical concentration. Specifically, we construct a polymer chain constituted of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate which we compact via multifunctional thiol&#8208;epoxide ligation and functionalize with Rose Bengal (RB) in a one pot reaction, affording SCNPs with a hydrophilic shell and hydrophobic photocatalytic regions. Photooxidation of the internal alkene in oleic acid proceeds under green light. RB confined within the SCNP is three times more effective for nonpolar alkenes than free RB in solution, which we hypothesize is due to the spatial proximity of the photosensitizing units to the substrate in the hydrophobic region. Our approach demonstrates that SCNP based catalysts can afford enhanced photocatalysis via confinement effects in a homogeneous reaction environment.

         <title>Insight into Bioactivity of In&#8208;situ Trapped Enzyme&#8208;Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
The bioactivity of the enzyme HRP immobilized with the covalent&#8208;organic framework COF&#8208;LZU1 is shown to be promoted by a weak interaction between the enzyme and COF&#8208;LZU1, the easy access of the substrate to COF&#8208;LZU1, as well as an optimal conformation of enzyme inside the COF&#8208;LZU1. This comprehensive understanding of interfacial interactions, substrate diffusion, and enzyme conformation alteration aids the design of biocatalysts.







Abstract
Selecting a suitable support material for enzyme immobilization with excellent biocatalytic activity and stability is a critical aspect in the development of functional biosystems. The highly stable and metal&#8208;free properties of covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) make them ideal supports for enzyme immobilization. Herein, we constructed three kinds of COFs via a biofriendly and one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy at room temperature in aqueous solution. Among the three developed COFs (COF&#8208;LZU1, RT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACOF&#8208;1), the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;incorporated COF&#8208;LZU1 is found to retain the highest activity. Structural analysis reveals that a weakest interaction between the hydrated enzyme and COF&#8208;LZU1, an easiest accessibility by the COF&#8208;LZU1 to the substrate, as well as an optimal conformation of enzyme together promote the bioactivity of HRP&#8208;COF&#8208;LZU1. Furthermore, the COF&#8208;LZU1 is revealed to be a versatile nanoplatform for encapsulating multiple enzymes. The COF&#8208;LZU1 also offers superior protection for the immobilized enzymes under harsh conditions and during recycling. The comprehensive understanding of interfacial interactions of COF host and enzyme guest, the substrate diffusion, as well as the enzyme conformation alteration within COF matrices represents an opportunity to design the ideal biocatalysts and opens a broad range of applications of these nanosystems.

On reaction with [MR2], up to four (Ge2As2)2&#8722; or (Ge3As)3&#8722; units can coordinate to M2+ ions (M=Zn, Cd, Hg) in [RZn(Ge3As)]2&#8722;, [PhHg(Ge3As)]2&#8722;, [(Ge3As)Zn(Ge2As2)]3&#8722;, [Cd3(Ge3As)3]3&#8722;, and [Zn3(Ge3As)4]6&#8722; (R=Ph, Mes). The anions apparently are related by a stepwise formation cascade.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral units of p&#8208;block atoms proved to be excellent building blocks for novel molecular architectures and for introducing new elemental combinations which are not otherwise accessible. In this work, we present a series of clusters obtained by reactions of binary Ge/As anions with [MPh2] (M=Zn, Cd, Hg; Ph=phenyl). The study is grounded on the fact that the binary reactant gained by extracting the solid &#8216;K2GeAs&#8217; with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (en) co&#8208;exists as (Ge2As2)2&#8722; and (Ge3As)3&#8722; in solution. This allows for a larger variety of products by &#8216;selecting&#8217; the most suitable species for the final ternary complex to crystallize. The reactions afforded the unprecedented first step of the corresponding interaction, thus attachment of (MPh)+ to a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral unit in [PhZn(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (1) and [PhHg(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (2), and complex anions with two, three, or four units, [(Ge3As)Zn(Ge2As2)]3&#8722; (3), [Cd3(Ge3As)3]3&#8722; (4), and [Zn3(Ge3As)4]6&#8722; (5). Quantum chemistry confirmed the compositions and the positions of the Ge or As atoms, beside explaining structural peculiarities. The subtle impact of different [MR2] reactants was additionally studied by corresponding reactions using [ZnMes2] (Mes=mesityl), which showed success in selectively crystallizing [MesZn(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (6). Based on our findings, we derive a suggestion of the underlying reaction cascade.

         <title>Time&#8208;dependent Phosphorescence Color of Carbon Dots in Binary Salt Matrices through Activations by Structural Confinement and Defects for Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color of carbon dots in binary salt matrices is achieved through activations by structural confinement and defects. The resulting material can be used for multi&#8208;level dynamic phosphorescence color 3D coding to achieve information encryption.







Abstract
The emergence of time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials has taken information encryption to high&#8208;security levels. However, due to the only path of exciton transfer, it is almost impossible to obtain TDPC for chromophores with a single emission center. Theoretically, in inorganic&#8208;organic composites, the exciton transfer of organic chromophores depends on the inorganic structure. Here, we assign two structural effects to inorganic NaCl by metal (Mg2+ or Ca2+ or Ba2+) doping, which triggers the TDPC performance of carbon dots (CDs) with a single emission center. The resulting material is used for multi&#8208;level dynamic phosphorescence color 3D coding to achieve information encryption. The structural confinement activates the green phosphorescence of CDs; while the structural defect activates tunneling&#8208;related yellow phosphorescence. Such simply doped inorganic matrices can be synthesized using the periodic table of metal cations, endowing chromophores with tremendous control over TDPC properties. This demonstration extends the design view of dynamic luminescent materials.

         <title>Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Oligo(disulfide) Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the automated synthesis of sequence&#8208;specific oligo(disulfides) on a solid support was developed. Six different dithiol monomer building blocks were prepared and applied in the synthesis of disulfide oligomers by extension of a T15 DNA strand. The disulfides were degraded in the presence of millmolar levels of glutathione, and a mechanism for cargo release upon reduction was also developed.







Abstract
A method for automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis of oligo(disulfide)s was developed. It is based on a synthetic cycle comprising removal of a protecting group from a resin&#8208;bound thiol followed by treatment with monomers containing a thiosulfonate as an activated precursor. For ease of purification and characterization, the disulfide oligomers were synthesized as extensions of oligonucleotides on an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. Six different dithiol monomer building blocks were synthesized. Sequence&#8208;defined oligomers of up to seven disulfide units were synthesized and purified. The sequence of the oligomer was confirmed by tandem MS/MS analysis. One of the monomers contains a coumarin cargo that can be released by a thiol&#8208;mediated release mechanism. When the monomer was incorporated into an oligo(disulfide) and subjected to reducing conditions, the cargo was released under near&#8208;physiological conditions, which underlines the potential use of these molecules in drug delivery systems.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;, Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Fluoroallylation/Annulation of Hydrazones with gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes via Tunable Palladium/NHC Catalysis</title>

A Pd/NHC&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselective fluoroallylation/annulation of hydrazones with gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is reported. This divergent defluorinative cross&#8208;coupling strategy is controlled by the nature of the hydrazones and the backbone of NHC ligands. It proceeds through either one&#8208;fold or two&#8208;fold C&#8722;F activation to afford N2 function&#8208;containing monofluoroalkenes or pyrazoles, respectively, in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Defluorinative manipulation of polyfluorinated molecules has shown great promise due to its granting of synthetic versatility to inert C&#8722;F bonds. The development of chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselective strategies to realize highly efficient formation of either the linear/branched or E/Z products from gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes (gem&#8208;F2CPs) is a challenging task. Herein, we have realized palladium/NHC&#8208;catalyzed fluoroallylation/annulation of hydrazones with gem&#8208;F2CPs that incorporate the hydrazone N2 moiety into the products. The thermodynamically unstable fluorinated E&#8208;allylation products with aryl ketone hydrazones were obtained for the first time, while the di&#8208;alkyl ketone hydrazones yielded the monofluorinated products with branched selectivity under similar reaction conditions. With aldehyde hydrazones, two kinds of pyrazoles were obtained via a defluorinative allylation/annulation cascade, in which different carbon atoms of gem&#8208;F2CPs could be incorporated into the pyrazole rings regiospecifically. DFT calculations revealed that the divergent selectivity was kinetically controlled and the final C&#8722;C bond formation proceeded through a 7&#8208;membered TS.

The first metal&#8208;catalyzed oxidative alkynylations of primary alcohols or aldehydes to form &#945;,&#946;&#8208;acetylenic ketones (ynones) are described. Deuterium labelling studies corroborate a novel reaction mechanism in which alkyne hydroruthenation forms a transient vinylruthenium complex that deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form the active alkynylruthenium nucleophile.

Divergent total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B have been accomplished in 16&#8211;20 steps from a known epoxide via a rapid construction of a common core intermediate. The aza&#8208;adamantane backbone of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B was furnished via a tandem deprotection/reduction/keto amine&#8208;carbinolamine tautomerization, and the (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B backbone was assembled through an N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig aminocyclization from the same intermediate.







Abstract
The daphnezomine A&#8208;type subfamily of Daphniphyllum alkaloids structurally features a unique aza&#8208;adamantane core skeleton and anticipates efficient strategies for completing their syntheses to thoroughly investigate their biological activities. Herein, divergent total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B have been accomplished in 16&#8211;20 steps from a known epoxide via rapid construction of a common core intermediate. The present work features a Ti&#8208;mediated radical cyclization to establish the azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system, an intramolecular Heck reaction to install the bridgehead all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, a tandem deprotection/reduction/keto amine&#8208;carbinolamine tautomerization to furnish the aza&#8208;adamantane backbone, and an NIS&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig aminocyclization to assemble the (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B backbone.

         <title>Low Bandgap 2D Perovskite Single Crystal with Anomalous&#8208;large Charges/ions Collection Ratio for Ultra&#8208;sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of Cu2+ ions cross&#8208;linking the layers of 2D perovskite can not only reduce the perovskite band gap, but can also selectively improve the charge carriers&#8217; transport along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and suppress the ions migration effectively. The [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 device can reach a record charges/ions collection ratio of 1.69&#215;1018&#177;4.7&#8201;%&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s, and exhibit an excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances.







Abstract
The low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention due to their improved moisture stability, reduced defects, and suppressed ions migration in many optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, X&#8208;ray detectors, and so on. However, they are still limited by their large band gap and short charge carriers&#8217; diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate that the introduction of metal ions into organic interlayers of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite by cross&#8208;linking the copper paddle&#8208;wheel cluster&#8208;based lead bromide ([Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4) perovskite single crystals with coordination bonds can not only significantly reduce the perovskite band gap to 0.96&#8197;eV to boost the X&#8208;ray induced charge carriers, but can also selectively improve the charge carriers&#8217; transport along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and blocking the ions motion paths. The [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 single&#8208;crystal device can reach a record charges/ions collection ratio of 1.69&#215;1018&#177;4.7&#8201;%&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s, and exhibit a large sensitivity of 1.14&#215;105&#177;7%&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the lowest detectable dose rate of 56&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 under 120&#8197;keV X&#8208;rays irradiation. In addition, [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 single&#8208;crystal detector exposed to the air without any encapsulation shows excellent X&#8208;ray imaging capability with long&#8208;term operational stability without any attenuation of 120&#8197;days.

         <title>Strong, Supertough and Self&#8208;Healing Biomimetic Layered Nanocomposites Enabled by Reversible Interfacial Polymer Chain Sliding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultratough layered nanocomposite is prepared by constructing reversible interfacial chain sliding between sulfonated graphene nanosheets and polyurethane layers based on the ring molecules sliding on the linear polymer chains to release stresses. The resulting laminates exhibit strong strength, supertoughness, ultrahigh stretchability and self&#8208;healing ability, which far surpass most reported synthetic and natural laminate materials.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress in ultrastrong mechanical laminate materials, the simultaneous achievement of toughness, stretchability and self&#8208;healing properties in biomimetic layered nanocomposites remains a great challenge due to the intrinsic limitations of their hard essences and lack of effective stress transfer at the organic&#8208;inorganic fragile boundary. Here, an ultratough nanocomposite laminate is prepared by constructing chain&#8208;sliding cross&#8208;linking at the interface between sulfonated graphene nanosheets and polyurethane layers based on the ring molecules sliding on the linear polymer chains to release stresses. Unlike traditional supramolecular bonding toughening with limited sliding spacing, our strategy enables interfacial molecular chains reversible slippage when the inorganic nanosheets bear stretching force, providing sufficient interlayer spatial distance for relative sliding to dissipate more energy. The resulting laminates exhibit strong strength (22.33&#8197;MPa), supertoughness (219.08&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), ultrahigh stretchability (&gt;1900&#8201;%) and self&#8208;healing ability (99.7&#8201;%), which far surpass most of reported synthetic and natural laminate materials. Moreover, the fabricated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electronic skin shows excellent flexibility, sensitivity and healability for human physiological signals monitoring. This strategy breaks through the challenge that traditional layered nanocomposites are intrinsically stiff and opens up the functional application of layered nanocomposites in flexible devices.

This strategy breaks through the challenge that traditional layered nanocomposites are intrinsically stiff and opens up the functional application of layered nanocomposites in flexible devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Adhesives with Extended Tolerance to Extreme Conditions via Water&#8208;Modulated Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids and phenols has been demonstrated to be a general approach to develop new functional supramolecular adhesives capable of adapting to various extreme conditions in a controlled manner. Multiple noncovalent interactions in the two&#8208;component systems are balanced upon the participation of water, thereby expanding the tolerance range of the resulting adhesives to aqueous and ultracold environments.







Abstract
Development of supramolecular adhesives with strong tolerance to extreme conditions has emerged as an important research area. In this study, by balancing supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding interactions, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, we designed and prepared a series of two&#8208;component supramolecular adhesives derived from small organic molecules. Highly efficient interfacial adhesion with maximum adhesion strength of &#8776;10.0&#8197;MPa was realized on various surfaces in air, organic solvents, or liquid nitrogen. Owing to balanced supramolecular interactions, water participation prolonged and increased the tolerance of the adhesives in extreme environments. We demonstrate that the combination of imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids and phenols can be applied for various interfacial adhesions, thereby aiding the development of next&#8208;generation adhesives capable of adapting to various extreme conditions in a controlled manner.

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Arylpyrroles via Atroposelective Diyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization enables the efficient synthesis of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8722;H insertion of vinyl cations. This method gives the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers and the first atroposelective diyne cyclization.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryls widely exist in natural products and pharmaceuticals and are used as chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis. Compared to the well&#8208;established axially chiral 6&#8208;membered biaryl skeletons, examples of 5&#8208;membered biaryls have been quite scarce, and mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers have not been reported. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization for the construction of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8722;H insertion of vinyl cations. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers, but also constitutes the first example of atroposelective diyne cyclization and the first atropisomer construction via vinyl cations. Theoretical calculations further support the mechanism of vinyl cation&#8208;involved cyclization and elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization through Cationic Vacancy Defects in Bi4Ti3O12 for Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer mechanism of cation vacancies during molecular oxygen activation is discussed. Cationic vacancy defects can induce electron spin polarization, increase the number of spin&#8208;down photogenerated electrons, and reduce the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs.







Abstract
Molecular oxygen (O2) activation technology is of great significance in environmental purification due to its eco&#8208;friendly operation and cost&#8208;effective nature. However, the activation of O2 is limited by spin&#8208;forbidden transitions, and efficient molecular oxygen activation depends on electronic behavior and surface adsorption. Herein, we prepared cationic defect&#8208;rich Bi4Ti3O12 (BTO&#8208;MV2) catalysts containing Ti vacancies (VTi) for O2 activation in water purification. The VTi on BTO nanosheets can induce electron spin polarization, increasing the number of spin&#8208;down photogenerated electrons and reducing the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs. An active surface VTi is also formed, serving as a center for adsorbing O2 and extracting electrons, effectively generating &#8901;OH, O2&#8901;&#8722; and 1O2. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by BTO&#8208;MV2 is 3.3&#8197;times faster than BTO, indicating a satisfactory prospect for practical application. This work provides an efficient pathway to activate molecular oxygen by constructing new active sites through cationic vacancy modification technology.

         <title>A Route to Stabilize Uranium(II) and Uranium(I) Synthons in Multimetallic Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Low valent uranium can be stabilized via an unprecedented mechanism involving intramolecular ligand migration: the two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron reduction of the oxo&#8208;bridged UIV/UIV complex, [{(Ph3SiO)3(DME)U}2(O)], yields formal &#8220;UII&#8221;/UIV and &#8220;UI&#8221;/UIV complexes, via ligand migration and formation of uranium&#8208;arene &#948;&#8208;bond interactions, that can transfer up to three electrons to substrates by restoring the original ligand arrangement.







Abstract
Herein, we report the redox reactivity of a multimetallic uranium complex supported by triphenylsiloxide (&#8722;OSiPh3) ligands, where we show that low valent synthons can be stabilized via an unprecedented mechanism involving intramolecular ligand migration. The two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron reduction of the oxo&#8208;bridged diuranium(IV) complex [{(Ph3SiO)3(DME)U}2(&#956;&#8208;O)], 4, yields the formal &#8220;UII/UIV&#8221;, 5, and &#8220;UI/UIV&#8221;, 6, complexes via ligand migration and formation of uranium&#8208;arene &#948;&#8208;bond interactions. Remarkably, complex 5 effects the two&#8208;electron reductive coupling of pyridine affording complex 7, which demonstrates that the electron&#8208;transfer is accompanied by ligand migration, restoring the original ligand arrangement found in 4. This work provides a new method for controlling the redox reactivity in molecular complexes of unstable, low&#8208;valent metal centers, and can lead to the further development of f&#8208;elements redox reactivity.

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane via Regulating Methyl Intermediates over Metal/ZnO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO has been investigated for photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane, among which Au/ZnO exhibited a C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 83&#8201;% selectivity. Photogenerated methyl active groups can be selectively coupled on Au but tend to be over&#8208;oxidized into CO2 on other transition metals mainly because of the difference in *CH3&#8208;metal interaction.







Abstract
Methane conversion to higher hydrocarbons requires harsh reaction conditions due to high energy barriers associated with C&#8722;H bond activation. Herein, we report a systematic investigation of photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO photocatalysts. A 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Au/ZnO delivered a remarkable C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (83&#8201;% C2&#8208;C4 selectivity) under light irradiation with excellent photostability over two days. The metal type and its interaction with ZnO strongly influence the selectivity toward C&#8722;C coupling products. Photogenerated Zn+&#8208;O&#8722; sites enable CH4 activation to methyl intermediates (*CH3) migrating onto adjacent metal nanoparticles. The nature of the *CH3&#8208;metal interaction controls the OCM products. In the case of Au, strong d&#8208;&#963; orbital hybridization reduces metal&#8208;C&#8722;H bond angles and steric hindrance, thereby enabling efficient methyl coupling. Findings indicate the d&#8208;&#963; center may be a suitable descriptor for predicting product selectivity during OCM over metal/ZnO photocatalysts.

         <title>Protein Oligomer Engineering: A New Frontier for Studying Protein Structure, Function, and Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview classifies protein oligomers according to toxicity, biological function, and application as well as summarizes frontier methods for engineering protein oligomers. From the analysis of the advantages and deficits of each methodology, we highlight protein grafting as a promising and robust method for future oligomer engineering with the combination of AI technologies.







Abstract
Prevalent in nature, protein oligomers play critical roles both physiologically and pathologically. The multimeric nature and conformational transiency of protein oligomers greatly complicate a more detailed glimpse into the molecular structure as well as function. In this minireview, the oligomers are classified and described on the basis of biological function, toxicity, and application. We also define the bottlenecks in recent oligomer studies and further review numerous frontier methods for engineering protein oligomers. Progress is being made on many fronts for a wide variety of applications, and protein grafting is highlighted as a promising and robust method for oligomer engineering. These advances collectively allow the engineering and design of stabilized oligomers that bring us one step closer to understanding their biological functions, toxicity, and a wide range of applications.

         <title>Decoupled Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decoupled artificial photosynthesis (DAP) strides one step closer to natural photosynthesis (NP) thanks to a photoelectrochemical energy transduction process. In this review, we elaborate how DAP evolves from NP and traditional artificial photosynthesis (AP), summarize recent advances of AP and DAP, and discuss current challenges and future developments of DAP.







Abstract
Natural photosynthesis (NP) generates oxygen and carbohydrates from water and CO2 utilizing solar energy to nourish lives and balance CO2 levels. Following nature, artificial photosynthesis (AP), typically, overall water or CO2 splitting, produces fuels and chemicals from renewable energy. However, hydrogen evolution or CO2 reduction is inherently coupled with kinetically sluggish water oxidation, lowering efficiencies and raising safety concerns. Decoupled systems have thus emerged. In this review, we elaborate how decoupled artificial photosynthesis (DAP) evolves from NP and AP and unveil their distinct photoelectrochemical mechanisms in energy capture, transduction and conversion. Advances of AP and DAP are summarized in terms of photochemical (PC), photoelectrochemical (PEC), and photovoltaic&#8208;electrochemical (PV&#8208;EC) catalysis based on material and device design. The energy transduction process of DAP is emphasized. Challenges and perspectives on future researches are also presented.

         <title>Ammonium Ion Batteries: Material, Electrochemistry and Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries have shown great potential due to their unique advantages including their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics in low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. Compared with the common metal cations batteries AIBs offer great advantages of favorable sustainability and fast diffusion kinetics through hydrogen bonding in different electrode materials.







Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) have recently attracted increasing attention in the field of aqueous batteries owing to their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics. The NH4+ storage mechanism is quite different from that of spherical metal ions (e.g. Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH4+ and host materials. Although many materials have been proposed as electrode materials for AIBs, their performances hardly meet the requirement of future electrochemical energy storage devices. It is thus urgent to design and exploit advanced materials for AIBs. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research on AIBs. The insights into the basic configuration, operating mechanism and recent progress of electrode materials and corresponding electrolytes for AIBs have been comprehensively outlined. The electrode materials are classified and compared according to different NH4+ storage behaviour in the structure. The challenges, design strategies and perspectives are also discussed for the future development of AIBs.

         <title>Optochemical Control of mRNA Translation in Eukaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optochemically controlled biomolecules are a rapidly growing field that holds enormous promise for biological and therapeutic research. The growing need for therapeutic oligonucleotides and the recent success of mRNA as a therapeutic modality highlight the requirement for highly precise spatial and temporal regulation of nucleic acid activities at the post&#8208;transcriptional level.







Abstract
A major stage in the expression of genes is the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), and the regulation of this process is essential for protein production in cells. How tightly controlled gene expression can be spatially and temporally, is particularly evident in polar cells and embryonic development. We need tools to dissect these complex processes, if we wish to understand the underlying links, especially the difficulties brought on by malfunction. External bioorthogonal triggers are very helpful in this area, if they let us precisely control where and when a process is started. Equipping nucleic acids with light&#8208;responsive groups has proven to be an effective approach to examine the dynamic regulatory route of mRNA translation in living cells. In this review, we present an overview of the most recent methods for optochemically controlling translation, focusing on cis&#8208;acting technologies.

         <title>Inherently Emissive Puromycin Analogues for Live Cell Labelling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently emissive puromycin analogues can fluorescently tag newly synthesized proteins in live&#8208;cells without the need for further chemical treatments.







Abstract
Puromycin derivatives containing an emissive thieno[3,4&#8208;d]&#8208;pyrimidine core, modified with azetidine and 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine as Me2N surrogates, exhibit translation inhibition and bactericidal activity similar to the natural antibiotic. The analogues are capable of cellular puromycylation of nascent peptides, generating emissive products without any follow&#8208;up chemistry. The 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine&#8208;containing analogue is shown to fluorescently label newly translated peptides and be visualized in both live and fixed HEK293T cells and rat hippocampal neurons.

         <title>Photoenzymatic Hydrosulfonylation for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydrosulfonylation has been developed. An engineered OYE1 enzyme enabled the generation of a series of &#946;&#8208;chiral sulfonyl compounds in high yields (up to 92&#8201;%) with excellent e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Chiral sulfones are recurrent motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive molecules. Although chemical methods have been developed to afford &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208; chiral sulfones, these protocols rely heavily on the pre&#8208;synthesis of structurally complicated starting materials and chiral metal complexes. Herein, we described a photoenzymatic approach for the radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydrosulfonylation. Engineered variants of ene reductases provide efficient biocatalysts for this transformation, enabling to achieve a series of &#946;&#8208;chiral sulfonyl compounds with high yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and excellent e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).

         <title>Passive Gate&#8208;Tunable Kinetic Photovoltage along Semiconductor&#8208;Water Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching on/off the kinetic photovoltage, an in&#8208;plane voltage in the semiconductor driven by the moving boundaries of electrical double layer between the irradiated and dark regions, is achieved by applying a bias across the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The study extends the principle of the solid&#8208;state field effect transistor to the solid&#8211;liquid system and may lead to novel design concepts for optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Moving boundaries of electric double layer at solid&#8211;liquid interface enables unprecedented persistent energy conversion and provokes a kinetic photovoltaic effect by moving an illumination region along the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. Here, we report a transistor&#8208;inspired gate modulation of kinetic photovoltage by applying a bias at the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. The kinetic photovoltage of both p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type silicon samples can be facilely switched on/off, stemming from the electrical&#8208;field&#8208;modulated surface band bending. In contrast to the function of solid&#8208;state transistors relying on external sources, passive gate modulation of the kinetic photovoltage is achieved simply by introducing a counter electrode with materials of desired electrochemical potential. This architecture provides the ability to modulate the kinetic photovoltage over three orders of magnitude and opens up a new way for self&#8208;powered optoelectronic logic devices.

         <title>Unveiling the Critical Role of Ion Coordination Configuration of Ether Electrolytes for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ether solvent (1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane, DMP) is used for the configuration of the electrochemical behavior of electrolytes in lithium metal batteries. The six&#8208;membered Li+&#8208;chelating ring greatly improves the oxidation stability of the ether&#8208;based electrolyte compared to the conventional five&#8208;membered chelate ring. The cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase enriched in LiF effectively protects the nickel&#8208;rich cathode from corrosion by electrolyte side reactions.







Abstract
Albeit ethers are favorable electrolyte solvents for lithium (Li) metal anode, their inferior oxidation stability (&lt;4.0&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) is problematic for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Studies of ether electrolytes have been focusing on the archetype glyme structure with ethylene oxide moieties. Herein, we unveil the crucial effect of ion coordination configuration on oxidation stability by varying the ether backbone structure. The designed 1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane (DMP, C3) forms a unique six&#8208;membered chelating complex with Li+, whose stronger solvating ability suppresses oxidation side reactions. In addition, the favored hydrogen transfer reaction between C3 and anion induces a dramatic enrichment of LiF (a total atomic ratio of 76.7&#8201;%) on the cathode surface. As a result, the C3&#8208;based electrolyte enables greatly improved cycling of nickel&#8208;rich cathodes under 4.7&#8197;V. This study offers fundamental insights into rational electrolyte design for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>An Artificial In Vitro Metabolism to Angiopterlactone B Inspired by Traditional Retrosynthesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades, combining the selectivity of biological systems with the elegance of chemical synthesis, offer an exceptional opportunity for the preparation of complex molecular structures. By integrating native and abiotic enzyme modules in a metabolism&#8208;like network, a five&#8208;enzyme cascade coupled with a carbonate&#8208;induced dimerization step yielded the tricyclic natural product angiopterlactone B in a two&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Nature's way to construct highly complex molecular entities as part of biosynthetic pathways is unmatched by any chemical synthesis. Yet, relying on a cascade of native enzymatic transformations to achieve a certain target structure, biosynthesis is also significantly limited in its scope. In this study, non&#8208;natural biocatalytic modules, a peroxidase&#8208;mediated Achmatowicz rearrangement and a dehydrogenase&#8208;catalyzed borrowing&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;type isomerization were successfully incorporated into an artificial metabolism, combining the benefits of traditional retrosynthesis with the elegance and efficacy of biosynthetic networks. In a highly streamlined process, the total synthesis of tricyclic angiopterlactone B was achieved in two steps operating entirely in an aqueous environment while relying mainly on enzymes as key reaction mediators.

         <title>A Traceless Chiral Shift Reagent Based on Nonbonding Interactions with Single&#8208;Handed Helical Poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifiable separation of the NMR signals of enantiomers of a broad range of chiral compounds including ethers, ketones, esters, haloalkanes, and alkanes, is possible by using a single&#8208;handed helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing simple chiral alkoxymethyl side chains as a chiral shift reagent. The short spin&#8208;spin relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold enables the proton signals of the chiral shift reagent to be eliminated from the spectra.







Abstract
A single&#8208;handed poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) (PQX) has been found to serve as a new type of chiral shift reagent (CSR) for determining the enantiomeric ratio by NMR spectroscopy. Even though there is no specific binding site in the PQX, its nonbonding interaction with chiral analytes leads to a significant shift of the NMR chemical shift, allowing quantification of the enantiomeric ratio. The new type of CSR has the advantages of a wide scope of analytes including ethers, haloalkanes, and alkanes, easy tunability of the degree of chemical shifts by measurement temperature, and erasability of proton signals of CSR because of the short spin&#8208;spin (T2) relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Autonomous Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reentrant phase transitions (sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol) are known to exist in natural and artificial chemical systems. In the past decade, chemical fuels have been used to tune reentrant phase transitions. Here a chemically fueled double reentrant phase transition is presented, where two distinct hydrogels (i.e. from aldehyde&#8208; and imine&#8208;based gelators) form transiently and in sequential order. This results in an autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transition.







Abstract
Complex non&#8208;equilibrium phase behaviors are a hallmark of natural self&#8208;assembling systems. Here we show how intricate phase transitions can be achieved through a chemically fueled reaction cycle to yield autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transitions. A relay of chemical transformations based on thiazinane metathesis leads to two consecutive transient gelations in a closed system. Within seconds of fuel addition to deactivated thiazinane monomers, an imine&#8208;based hydrogel forms that consists of fibrillar microspheres. This gel quickly loses its mechanical strength and forms a solution, from which a second aldehyde&#8208;based gel nucleates and remains stable for over one day. Overall, our reaction cycle gives rise to two consecutive re&#8208;entrant phase transitions without any experimental intervention.

         <title>A Coordination Polymer of Vaska's Complex as a Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Reductive Formation of Enamines from Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material is synthesized using a tetratopic phosphine linker and Vaska's complex. This crystalline, IrI&#8208;containing material behaves similarly to Vaska's complex, binding dioxygen reversibly and can also be used as a recyclable, heterogeneous catalyst for the reductive formation of enamines from amides.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LVMOFs) and related materials have gained interest due to their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. However, of the few LVMOFs that have been reported, none have shown catalytic activity. Herein, a low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material constructed from phosphine linkers and IrI nodes is reported. This material is effectively a crystalline, insoluble analogue of Vaska's complex. As such, the material reversibly binds O2 and catalyzes the reductive formation of enamines from amides.

         <title>An Artificial Single Molecular Channel Showing High Chloride Transport Selectivity and pH&#8208;Responsive Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial anion channel with chloride selectivity comparable to that of natural chloride channel (ClC) proteins was achieved by rational engineering of the central active region of an hourglass&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule structure. By incorporating terminal pH&#8208;sensitive groups, our artificial anion channel also mimicked the pH&#8208;responsive feature of natural ClC proteins.







Abstract
Inspired by the unique structure and function of the natural chloride channel (ClC) selectivity filter, we present herein the design of a ClC&#8208;type single channel molecule. This channel displays high ion transport activity with half&#8208;maximal effective concentration, EC50, of 0.10&#8197;&#956;M, or 0.075&#8197;mol&#8201;% (channel molecule to lipid ratio), as determined by fluorescent analysis using lucigenin&#8208;encapsulated vesicles. Planar bilayer lipid membrane conductance measurements indicated an excellent Cl&#8722;/K+ selectivity with a permeability ratio P
/P
 up to 12.31, which is comparable with the chloride selectivity of natural ClC proteins. Moreover, high anion/anion selectivity (P
/P
=66.21) and pH&#8208;dependent conductance and ion selectivity of the channel molecule were revealed. The ClC&#8208;like transport behavior is contributed by the cooperation of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in the central macrocyclic skeleton, and by the existence of pH&#8208;responsive terminal phenylalanine residues.

         <title>Diphosphoryl&#8208;functionalized Polyoxometalates: Structurally and Electronically Tunable Hybrid Molecular Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a new class of hybrid diphosphoryl Wells&#8211;Dawson polyoxometalate (POM) is described. The covalent tethering of diphosphoryl compounds to the inorganic cluster gives redox&#8208;active materials with enhanced hydrolytic stability compared to the corresponding phosphonate analogues. These readily modifiable precursors provide a platform for structural and electronic modulation of the POM, enabling the rational design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation hybrid Wells&#8211;Dawson POMs.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of hybrid Wells&#8211;Dawson polyoxometalate (POM) containing a diphosphoryl group (P2O6X) of the general formula [P2W17O57(P2O6X)]6&#8722; (X=O, NH, or CR1R2). Modifying the bridging unit X was found to impact the redox potentials of the POM. The ease with which a range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized diphosphonic acids (X=CR1R2) can be prepared provides possibilities to access diverse functionalized hybrid POMs. Compared to existing phosphonate hybrid Wells&#8211;Dawson POMs, diphosphoryl&#8208;substituted POMs offer a wider tunable redox window and enhanced hydrolytic stability. This study provides a basis for the rational design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation hybrid Wells&#8211;Dawson POMs.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Organoradical Boron Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct C&#8722;H borylation of the radical substrate via iridium catalysis was achieved for the first time, leading to air&#8208;stable organoradical boron reagents, which can smoothly work in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction as a versatile building block for constructing useful open&#8208;shell molecules with retention of the carbon radical center.







Abstract
Both organic radicals and organoboron reagents have been broadly investigated, but the combination of them via direct C&#8722;H borylation as organic radical building blocks has never been achieved. Herein, a series of organoradical boron reagents, such as TTM&#8208;Bpin and TTM&#8208;BOH, were synthesized through the key step of C&#8722;H borylation of substrate TTM&#8208;H ((2,6&#8208;dichlorophenyl) bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl) radical for the first time. They are air stable enough to be stored in the solid state for several months under dark conditions, and fully investigated through single crystal analysis, EPR and DFT calculations. Furthermore, they can smoothly work in the standard Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction with retention of the carbon radical center. Meanwhile, these radical species bearing different boron units display fluorescent character and are potentially applied for the collective synthesis of luminescent organic radicals, as well as other functionalized open&#8208;shell materials.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Enables Polymer Hydrogels with pH&#8208;Induced Reversible Dynamic Responsive Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by pH&#8208;induced alteration of hydrogen bonds, when placed in an acid solution, the transparent PAN hydrogel quickly becomes opaque and then gradually regains its transparency; while after being switched into DI water, the same dynamic response of fast transparency drop followed by spontaneous slow recovery is recreated.







Abstract
Poly(acrylic acid&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) (PAN) hydrogels containing multiple hydrogen bonds can exhibit pH&#8208;induced reversible dynamic responsive behaviors. When placing a transparent hydrogel in an acid bath, as hydrogen bonds between comonomer units involving protonated COOH groups are formed faster than water diffusion, a nonequilibrium light&#8208;scattering state is formed to turn the hydrogel opaque, while as the swelling equilibrium is reached over time, the hydrogel regains its transparency. Likewise, when the transparent, hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrogel is subsequently immersed in DI water, faster water absorption occurs in where more COOH groups are deprotonated, which also generates a light&#8208;scattering state leading to opacity, while the transparency is slowly recovered after equilibrium. Using such two&#8208;way dynamic transparency evolution, a PAN&#8208;based hydrogel material is prepared to demonstrate a dynamic memory system for information memorizing&#8208;forgetting and recalling&#8208;forgetting.

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization and Allylic Amination for Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Polynorbornenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selenium catalyzed method for C&#8722;H activation and allylic amination of polynorbornene. Ultimately, our method achieves high and tunable degrees of functionalization, yielding materials with tunable thermal properties.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) via direct C&#8722;H functionalization is a powerful synthetic strategy to convert polymer feed&#8208;stocks into value&#8208;added products. We found that a metal&#8208;free, Se&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H amination provided an efficient method for PPM of polynorbornenes (PNBs) produced via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. Inherent to the mechanism of the allylic amination, PPM on PNBs preserved the alkene functional groups along the polymer backbone, while also avoiding transposition of the double bonds. Amination using a series of aryl sulfonamides led to good control over the degree of functionalization, access to a range of functionalities, and tunable thermal properties from the resulting polymers.

         <title>Manipulating Coulombic Efficiency of Cathodes in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Anion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically investigated how anions manipulate the coulombic efficiency of cathodes of zinc batteries for conversion and intercalation chemistry. It was found that the electronic properties of anions, including charge density and its distribution, can tune reactions of the conversion&#8208;type cathode (e.g. iodine, I2) and the intercalation&#8208;type cathode (e.g. vanadium pentoxide, V2O5), leading to significant coulombic efficiency differences.







Abstract
Electrolyte environments, including cations, anions, and solvents are critical for the performance delivery of cathodes of batteries. Most works focused on interactions between cations and cathode materials, in contrast, there is a lack of in&#8208;depth research on the correlation between anions and cathodes. Here, we systematically investigated how anions manipulate the coulombic efficiency (CE) of cathodes of zinc batteries. We take intercalation&#8208;type V2O5 and conversion&#8208;type I2 cathodes as typical cases for profound studies. It was found that electronic properties of anions, including charge density and its distribution, can tune conversion or intercalation reactions, leading to significant CE differences. Using operando visual Raman microscopy and theoretical simulations, we confirm that competitive coordination between anions and I&#8722; can regulate CEs by modulating polyiodide diffusion rates in Zn&#8722;I2 cells. In Zn&#8722;V2O5 cells, anion&#8208;tuned solvation structures vastly affect CEs through varying Zn2+ intercalation kinetics. Conversion I2 cathode achieves a 99&#8201;% CE with highly electron&#8208;donating anions, while anions with preferable charge structures that interact strongly with Zn2+ afford an intercalation V2O5 a nearly 100&#8201;% CE. Understanding the mechanism of anion&#8208;governed CEs will help us evaluate compatibility of electrolytes with electrodes, thus providing a guideline for anion selection and electrolyte design for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;cycling zinc batteries.

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Dehydrogenative Coupling of Aldehydes with C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>

An NHC&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular dehydrogenative coupling of aldehyde with ether, amine or benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is disclosed via metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free radical pathways.







Abstract
The development of catalyst&#8208;controlled methods for direct functionalization of two distinct C&#8722;H bonds represents an appealing approach for C&#8722;C formations in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe an organocatalytic approach for straightforward acylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds employing readily available aldehyde as &#8220;acyl source&#8221; involving dehydrogenative coupling of aldehydes with ether, amine, or benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The developed method affords a broad range of ketones under mild conditions. Mechanistically, simple ortho&#8208;cyanoiodobenzene is essential in the oxidative radical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis to give a ketyl radical and C(sp3) radical through a rarely explored intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer pathway, rendering the acylative C&#8722;C formations in high efficiency under a metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free catalytic conditions. Moreover, the prepared products show promising anti&#8208;bacterial activities that shall encourage further investigations on novel agrochemical development.

Mechanistically, simple &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-cyanoiodobenzene is essential in the oxidative radical N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis to give a ketyl radical and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) radical through a rarely explored intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer pathway, rendering the acylative C&#8722;C formations in high efficiency under a metal- and light-free catalytic conditions. Moreover, the prepared products show promising anti-bacterial activities that shall encourage further investigations on novel agrochemical development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP)&#8208;Based Straight&#8208;Shaped Diphosphine Ligands
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a method for the diphosphination of [1.1.1]propellane using visible light. Two sets of conditions were found, one using blue LED irradiation in the presence of an Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst and the other only using white LEDs. Both conditions efficiently promote radical diphosphination reactions of [1.1.1]propellane with a phosphine oxide and a chlorophosphine to afford (un)symmetrical diphosphinated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives.







Abstract
[1.1.1]Propellane, which is structurally simple and compact, exhibits promising potential for the synthesis of disubstituted straight&#8208;shaped bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) compounds by manipulation of its highly reactive internal C&#8722;C bond. BCPs are considered to be isosteres of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted benzenes, which have found broad applications in the areas of functional molecules and drug discovery. The internal C&#8722;C single bond of [1.1.1]propellane is regarded as a charge&#8208;shift bond, which can be readily cleaved by radical means to construct BCPs. We herein report a novel synthetic method for (un)symmetric diphosphines based on the BCP motif, which can be interpreted as isosteres of 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)benzenes. The obtained BCP&#8208;diphosphine derivatives were used to generate a straight&#8208;shaped Au complex and an Eu&#8208;based coordination polymer.

         <title>Phenazine&#8208;based Compound Realizing Separate Hydrogen and Oxygen Production in Electrolytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Phenazine&#8208;based electrode is used as a solid&#8208;state redox mediator to decouple the H2 and O2 production in acidic water electrolysis, realizing a membrane&#8208;free hydrogen production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a sustainable approach for hydrogen production. However, conventional water electrolysis may suffer from gas mixing, and the different kinetics between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will limit the direct use of unstable renewable energies, leading to increased cost of H2 production. Herein, a novel phenazine&#8208;based compound is synthesized to develop the solid&#8208;state redox mediator associated water splititng process, and thus decoupling the H2 and O2 production in acid solution without the use of membrane. Excitingly, this organic redox mediator exhibits high specific capacity (290&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (186&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (3000&#8197;cycles) due to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic structure and the fast kinetics of H+ storage/release process. Furthermore, a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis architecture driven by solar energy is achieved, demonstrating high&#8208;purity H2 production at different times.

         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;F bond of acyl fluorides can be cleaved and added across tethered alkenes in the presence of a cationic rhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate catalyst. This 1,2&#8208;carbofluorination reaction offers a powerful method for the synthesis of tertiary alkyl fluorides. Mechanistic studies indicate that the concerted action of a rhodium cation and a tetrafluoroborate anion is key for the success of this catalytic cleavage and formation of C&#8722;F bonds.

Abstract
The asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;vulgarisins&#8197;A&#8211;E, which share a rare and highly oxygenated [5&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;5] tetracyclic core structure that were isolated from P. vulgaris Linn., have been described for the first time in a divergent manner. Key transformations include: 1) a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation to forge the A ring bearing desired stereochemistry at C14; 2) a one&#8208;pot borylation/conjugate addition process for creation of the C1&#8722;C11 bond; 3) a Wolff ring contraction to assemble the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane subunit (CD rings); and 4) a stereocontrolled pinacol cyclization for construction of the central B ring of the natural products.

         <title>A Fused [5]Helicene Dimer with a Figure&#8208;Eight Topology: Synthesis, Chiral Resolution, and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 23, June 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by a Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of a vinyl ether has led to the synthesis of a fused [5]helicene dimer with a figure&#8208;eight geometry, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The fully conjugated electronic structure and D2 symmetry results in the isolated enantiomers showing persistent chirality and large dissymmetric factors.







Abstract
Chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons are promising chiroptical materials; their synthesis, however, remains a big challenge. Herein, we report the facile synthesis and chiral resolution of a double&#8208;stranded figure&#8208;eight carbon nanobelt 1 in which two [5]helicene units are fused together.

&lt;p&gt;A Suzuki coupling-mediated macrocyclization followed by a Bi(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed cyclization of a vinyl ether has led to the synthesis of a fused [5]helicene dimer with a figure-eight geometry, as confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The fully conjugated electronic structure and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry results in the isolated enantiomers showing persistent chirality and large dissymmetric factors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral shape-persistent molecular nanocarbons are promising chiroptical materials; their synthesis, however, remains a big challenge. Herein, we report the facile synthesis and chiral resolution of a double-stranded figure-eight carbon nanobelt &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in which two [5]helicene units are fused together. Two synthetic routes were developed, and, in particular, a strategy involving Suzuki coupling-mediated macrocyclization followed by Bi(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ether turned out to be the most efficient. The structure of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The isolated (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)- enantiomers show persistent chiroptical properties with relatively large dissymmetric factors (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;|=5.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|=1.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which can be explained by the effective electron delocalization along the fully conjugated belt and the unique &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits local aromatic character with a dominant structure containing eight Clar's aromatic sextet rings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&#8220;Our team had a big challenge: how do we simulate Gleevec dissociation that would take millions of years with ordinary MD simulations, within a more practical few days or weeks? &#8230; We made the whole protocol robust and automatic, and released it as open&#8208;source software which can now be used by others in the scientific community."&#8221; Find out more about the Tiwary&#8211;Seeliger collaboration for predictive pharmacodynamics.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Tiwary group, University of Maryland, College Park (USA) and the Seeliger group, Stony Brook University, New York (USA). They recently published an article on the previously made observation through in&#8208;cell screening that the blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec has the same binding affinity, yet different dissociation kinetics against wild&#8208;type and N368S&#8208;mutated Abl kinase. Through all&#8208;atom enhanced molecular dynamics simulations guided by statistical mechanics and information theory, they were able to explain the mechanistic basis of this perplexing observation. Their work has ramifications for how pharmaceutical drugs might experience kinetic resistance due to mutations. &#8220;Protein Flexibility and Dissociation Pathway Differentiation Can Explain Onset of Resistance Mutations in Kinases&#8221;, M. Shekhar, Z. Smith, M.&#8197;A. Seeliger, P. Tiwary, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2022, e202200983; Angew. Chem. 2022, e202200983.

         <title>Exploring the Strain Effect in Single Particle Electrochemistry using Pd Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the surface strain of heterogeneous catalysts are recognized as a powerful strategy for tailoring their catalytic activity. However, a clear understanding of the strain effect in electrocatalysis at single&#8208;particle resolution is still lacking. Here, we explore the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of single Pd octahedra and icosahedra with the same surface bounded {111} crystal facets and similar sizes using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). It is revealed that tensely strained Pd icosahedra display significantly superior HER electrocatalytic activity. The estimated turnover frequency at &#8211;0.87 V vs RHE on Pd icosahedra is about two times higher than that on Pd octahedra. Our single&#8208;particle electrochemistry study using SECCM at Pd nanocrystals ambiguously highlights the importance of tensile strain on electrocatalytic activity and may offer new strategy for understanding the fundamental relationship between surface strain and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl Difluoride (EDSF) for SuFEx Click Chemistry: Synthesis of SuFExable 1,1&#8208;Bissulfonylfluoride Substituted Cyclobutene Hubs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;bis(fluorosulfonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, a bench&#8208;stable precursor to ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl difluoride (EDSF). The novel SuFEx reagent, EDSF, is demonstrated in the preparation of 26 unique 1,1&#8208;bissulfonylfluoride substituted cyclobutenes via a cycloaddition reaction. The regioselective click cycloaddition reaction is rapid, straightforward, and highly efficient, enabling the generation of highly functionalized 4&#8208;membered ring (4MR) carbocycles. These carbocycles are both valuable structural motifs found in numerous bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant small molecules. Additionally, we showcase diversification of the novel cyclobutene cores through selective Cs2CO3&#8208;activated SuFEx click chemistry between a single S&#8211;F group and aryl alcohol, yielding the corresponding sulfonate ester products with high efficiency.

The novel SuFEx reagent, EDSF, is demonstrated in the preparation of 26 unique 1,1-bissulfonylfluoride substituted cyclobutenes via a cycloaddition reaction. The regioselective click cycloaddition reaction is rapid, straightforward, and highly efficient, enabling the generation of highly functionalized 4-membered ring (4MR) carbocycles. These carbocycles are both valuable structural motifs found in numerous bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant small molecules. Additionally, we showcase diversification of the novel cyclobutene cores through selective Cs2CO3-activated SuFEx click chemistry between a single S&#8211;F group and aryl alcohol, yielding the corresponding sulfonate ester products with high efficiency. Finally, density functional theory calculations offer mechanistic &#160;insights about the reaction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis via Modulating the Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) into the KOH electrolyte enables the improvement of the selectivity and activity of H2O2 electrosynthesis. The hydrogen bonds formed between DMSO and water molecules can reduce the activity of water dissociation to active H* species. The suitable H* supply environment improves the selectivity of H2O2 via suppressing 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction.







Abstract
Designing highly efficient and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis remains challenging. Inhibiting the competitive side reaction, 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction to H2O, is essential for highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis. Instead of hindering excessive hydrogenation of H2O2 via catalyst modification, we discover that adding a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), to the KOH electrolyte enables simultaneous improvement of the selectivity and activity of H2O2 electrosynthesis. Spectral characterization and molecular simulation confirm that the formation of hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface can reduce the activity of water dissociation into active H* species. The suitable H* supply environment hinders excessive hydrogenation of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thus improving the selectivity of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR and achieving over 90&#8201;% selectivity of H2O2. This work highlights the importance of regulating the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond environment by organic molecules as a means of boosting electrochemical performance in aqueous electrosynthesis and beyond.

         <title>Bioorthogonally Assisted Phototherapy: Recent Advances and Prospects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototherapeutic approaches combined with bioorthogonal chemistry are expected to significantly improve the spatiotemporal precision of targeted therapies. As a result, related bioorthogonally assisted phototherapy research has recently intensified. This minireview briefly discusses the latest developments in the state of the art.







Abstract
Photoresponsive materials offer excellent spatiotemporal control over biological processes and the emerging phototherapeutic methods are expected to have significant effects on targeted cancer therapies. Recent examples show that combination of photoactivatable approaches with bioorthogonal chemistry enhances the precision of targeted phototherapies and profound implications are foreseen particularly in the treatment of disperse/diffuse tumors. The extra level of on&#8208;target selectivity and improved spatial/temporal control considerably intensified related bioorthogonally assisted phototherapy research. The anticipated growth of further developments in the field justifies the timeliness of a brief summary of the state of the art.

         <title>Geometric Isomerisation of Bifunctional Alkenyl Fluoride Linchpins: Stereodivergence in Amide and Polyene Bioisostere Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenyl fluorides are valuable amide bioisosteres, but emulating endergonic isomerisation by &#936;[CF=CH] mimicry remains challenging. Herein we report an energy transfer catalysis platform to enable the isomerisation of fluorinated &#946;&#8208;borylacrylate linchpins with an inexpensive sensitiser (up to E/Z 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 in 1&#8197;h). The ambiphilic nature of the products enables facile functionalisation at both termini, and this is demonstrated in a target synthesis.







Abstract
Amide groups are pervasive across the chemical space continuum, where their structural and pharmacological importance, juxtaposed with the hydrolytic vulnerabilities, continues to fuel bioisostere development. Alkenyl fluorides have a venerable history as effective mimics (&#936;[CF=CH]) owing to the planarity of the motif and intrinsic polarity of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bond. However, emulating the s&#8208;cis to the s&#8208;trans isomerisation of a peptide bond with fluoro&#8208;alkene surrogates remains challenging, and current synthetic solutions only enable access to a single configuration. Through the design of an ambiphilic linchpin based on a fluorinated &#946;&#8208;borylacrylate, it has been possible to leverage energy transfer catalysis to affect this unprecedented isomerisation process: this provides geometrically&#8208;programmable building blocks that can be functionalised at either terminus. Irradiation at &#955;max=402&#8197;nm with inexpensive thioxanthone as a photocatalyst enables rapid, effective isomerisation of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted species (up to E/Z 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 in 1&#8197;h), providing a stereodivergent platform for small molecule amide and polyene isostere discovery. Application of the methodology in target synthesis and initial laser spectroscopic studies are disclosed together with crystallographic analyses of representative products.

         <title>Spiroligomer&#8208;Based Macrocycles for Atomically Precise Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular peptidomimetic macrocycles were synthesized by cyclizing highly structured spiroligomers. They were assembled into nanofilms with atomically precise pores defined by their programmable three&#8208;dimensional structures. This study demonstrates the size and shape&#8208;dependent molecular sieving with macrocycle membranes. The structural stability and diversity of spiroligomer&#8208;based macrocycles make them promising candidates for various applications.







Abstract
Here, we report a new class of peptidomimetic macrocycles with well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional structures and low conformational flexibility. They are assembled from fused&#8208;ring spiro&#8208;ladder oligomers (spiroligomers) by modular solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance confirms their shape persistency. Triangular macrocycles of tunable sizes assemble into membranes with atomically precise pores, which exhibit size and shape&#8208;dependent molecular sieving towards a series of structurally similar compounds. The exceptional structural diversity and stability of spiroligomer&#8208;based macrocycles will be explored for more applications.

         <title>BN&#8208;Butafulvenes and Their Application in the Synthesis of Highly Substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BN&#8208;butafulvenes have been synthesized from the reaction of bis(alkynyl)boranes with an uranacyclopropene complex. On the other hand, DMAP&#8208;coordinated BN&#8208;butafulvenes underwent structural rearrangement under thermal conditions, affording 1,2,4,6&#8208;multisubstituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalene products.







Abstract
BN&#8208;butafulvenes, mono&#8208;BN isosteres of butafulvene and highly strained isomers of azaborines and B&#8208;amino boroles, have been synthesized via hydrolysis of the urana&#8208;borabicyclic complexes obtained from the reactions of bis(alkynyl)boranes with an uranacyclopropene complex. Their 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) adducts can further isomerize to 1,2,4,6&#8208;multisubstituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes. Both NMR reaction monitoring and theoretical calculations point to a reaction mechanism involving dearomative insertion of DMAP followed by two consecutive 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shifts. The photophysical studies of the highly substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes reveal a notable redshift in both the UV/Vis absorption and emission spectra. The (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations corroborate the experimental data, suggesting that the strong &#960;&#8208;donating amino substitution at the 1&#8208; and/or 6&#8208;positions destabilizes the HOMO, and thus leading to a notable decrease of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap.

Their 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) adducts can further isomerize to 1,2,4,6-multisubstituted BN-9,1-naphthalenes. Both NMR reaction monitoring and theoretical calculations point to a reaction mechanism involving dearomative insertion of DMAP followed by two consecutive 1,2-hydrogen shifts. The photophysical studies of the highly substituted BN-9,1-naphthalenes reveal a notable redshift in both the UV/Vis absorption and emission spectra. The (TD)-DFT calculations corroborate the experimental data, suggesting that the strong &#960;-donating amino substitution at the 1- and/or 6-positions destabilizes the HOMO, and thus leading to a notable decrease of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Interfacial Adsorption&#8208;Intercalation Pseudocapacitive Storage Limit to Enabling All&#8208;Climate, High Energy/Power Density and Durable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The application of transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) for zinc&#8208;ion batteries is mainly limited by the sluggish storage kinetics. This report presents an integrated modulation to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics&#8208;enhanced porous VSe2&#8722;x&#8901;n&#8201;H2O host for all&#8208;climate, high energy/power density and durable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. An interfacial adsorption and intercalation pseudocapacitive storage mechanism was also uncovered.







Abstract
Sluggish storage kinetics and insufficient performance are the major challenges that restrict the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) applied for zinc ion storage, especially at the extreme temperature conditions. Herein, a multiscale interface structure&#8208;integrated modulation concept was presented, to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics&#8208;enhanced porous VSe2&#8722;x&#8901;n&#8201;H2O host. Theory research indicated that the co&#8208;modulation of H2O intercalation and selenium vacancy enables enhancing the interfacial zinc ion capture ability and decreasing the zinc ion diffusion barrier. Moreover, an interfacial adsorption&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitive storage mechanism was uncovered. Such cathode displayed remarkable storage performance at the wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C) in aqueous and solid electrolytes. In particular, it can retain a high specific capacity of 173&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 5000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, as well as a high energy density of 290&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a power density of 15.8&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at room temperature. Unexpectedly, a remarkably energy density of 465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and power density of 21.26&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C also can be achieved, as well as 258&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 10.8&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work realizes a conceptual breakthrough for extending the interfacial storage limit of layered TMDs to construct all&#8208;climate high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enhanced CO Adsorption by Modulating the Electron Density Distribution of Graphite&#8208;Copper Porphyrin Sorbents with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the current methodology depending on the mechanical deformation of photochromic units, the nondeforming photo&#8208;responsiveness of the sorbent is exploited in this study, via the change of electron density distribution at stable excited states. The CO adsorption capability can be dramatically photo&#8208;gained over the sorbent with an ultra&#8208;low specific surface area.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;responsive adsorption has emerged as a vibrant area, but its current methodology is limited by the well&#8208;defined photochromic units and their molecular deformation driven by photo&#8208;stimuli. Herein, a methodology of nondeforming photo&#8208;responsiveness is successfully exploited. With the exploiting agent of Cu&#8208;TCPP framework assembled on the graphite and strongly interacted with it, the sorbent generates two kinds of adsorption sites, over which the electron density distribution of the graphite layer can be modulated at the c&#8208;axis direction, which can further evolve due to photo&#8208;stimulated excited states. The excited states are stable enough to meet the timescale of microscopic adsorption equilibrium. Independent of the ultra&#8208;low specific surface area of the sorbent (20&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), the CO adsorption capability can be improved from 0.50&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the ground state to 1.24&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar) with the visible light radiation, rather than the photothermal desorption.

         <title>Construction of Co4 Atomic Clusters to Enable Fe&#8208;N4 Motifs with Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N4 configurations are highly needed owing to the high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the limited intrinsic activity and dissatisfactory durability have significantly restrained the practical application of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Here, we demonstrate that constructing adjacent metal atomic clusters (ACs) is effective in boosting the ORR performance and stability of Fe&#8208;N4 catalysts. The integration of Fe&#8208;N4 configurations with highly uniform Co4 ACs on the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Co4@/Fe1@NC) is realized through a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained&#8221; strategy using Co4 molecular clusters and Fe(acac)3 implanted carbon precursors. The as&#8208;developed Co4@/Fe1@NC catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.835 V vs. RHE in acidic media and a high peak power density of 840 mW cm&#8722;2 in a H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell test. First&#8208;principles calculations further clarify the ORR catalytic mechanism on the identified Fe&#8208;N4 that modified with Co4 ACs. This work provides a viable strategy for precisely establishing atomically dispersed polymetallic centers catalysts for efficient energy&#8208;related catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazole linkages as photoactivated fuels for light&#8208;regulated photothermal/photocatalytic propulsion of versatile polymer nanoplatforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal motors with multimode propulsion have attracted considerable attention because of enhanced transportability. It is a great challenge to fabricate colloidal motors powered by a single engine for multimode synergistic propulsion. Herein, we report on Janus versatile polymer nanoplatforms integrating various functionalities via tetrazole linkages for light&#8208;regulated multimode synergistic propulsion in the liquid. The presence of tetrazole linkages in the polymers endows the nanoparticles with various photoresponsive capabilities. A sole energy source (ultraviolet or visible light) simultaneously activates photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the tetrazole&#8208;containing polymer phase at one side of asymmetric nanoparticles for converting light energy into photothermal/photocatalytic propulsion independent of the surrounding chemical medium. The photoactivated locomotion using tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels highly corresponds to light wavelengths, light powers and tetrazole contents. The tetrazole linkages capable of incorporating various functionalities to the polymer nanoparticles allow on&#8208;demand customizing of the colloidal motors, showing great potential in bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Selective Oxidation of Aromatic Alkanes by Double Cobalt Active Sites over Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;rich Mesoporous Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of an efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of hydrocarbon to functional compounds remains a challenge. Herein, mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4&#8208;350) showed excellent catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes, especially for oxidation of ethylbenzene with a conversion of 42% and selectivity of 90% for acetophenone at 120 oC. Notably, mCo3O4 presented a unique catalytic path of direct oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones. Density functional theory calculations revealed that oxygen vacancies in mCo3O4 activate around Co atoms, causing electronic state change from Co3+(Oh) &#8594; Co2+(Oh). Co2+(Oh) has great attraction to ethylbenzene, and weak interaction with O2, which provide insufficient O2 for gradual oxidation of phenylethanol to acetophenone. Combined with high energy barrier for forming phenylethanol, the direct oxidation path from ethylbenzene to acetophenone is kinetically favorable on mCo3O4, sharply contrasted to non&#8208;selective oxidation of ethylbenzene on commercial Co3O4.</dc:description>

Density functional theory calculations revealed that oxygen vacancies in mCo3O4 activate around Co atoms, causing electronic state change from Co3+(Oh) &#8594; Co2+(Oh). Co2+(Oh) has great attraction to ethylbenzene, and weak interaction with O2, which provide insufficient O2 for gradual oxidation of phenylethanol to acetophenone. Combined with high energy barrier for forming phenylethanol, the direct oxidation path from ethylbenzene to acetophenone is kinetically favorable on mCo3O4, sharply contrasted to non-selective oxidation of ethylbenzene on commercial Co3O4.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia Using Tiara&#8208;like Phenylethanethiolated Nickel Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atom&#8208;precise nickel&#8208;thiolate clusters activate dinitrogen electrochemically and selectively transform it to ammonia with 25&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. A combined approach based on experimental results and theoretical calculations shed light on the mechanism of this electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction.







Abstract
The fixing of N2 to NH3 is challenging due to the inertness of the N&#8801;N bond. Commercially, ammonia production depends on the energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch (H&#8722;B) process, which emits CO2 while using fossil fuels as the sources of hydrogen and energy. An alternative method for NH3 production is the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process as it is powered by renewable energy sources. Here, we report a tiara&#8208;like nickel&#8208;thiolate cluster, [Ni6(PET)12] (where, PET=2&#8208;phenylethanethiol)] as an efficient electro&#8208;catalyst for the electrochemical NRR at ambient conditions. Ammonia (NH3: 16.2&#177;0.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was the only nitrogenous product over the potential of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc with a Faradaic efficiency of 25%&#177;1.7. Based on theoretical calculations, NRR by [Ni6(PET)12] proceeds through both the distal and alternating pathways with an onset potential of &#8722;1.84&#8197;V vs. RHE (i.e., &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc) which corroborates with the experimental findings.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Mimics Transmembrane Electron Transport Proteins for Enhanced Microbial Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacing bacteria as biocatalysts with an electrode provides the basis for emerging bioelectrochemical systems that enable sustainable energy interconversion between electrical and chemical energy. Electron transfer rates at the abiotic&#8208;biotic interface are, however, often limited by poor electrical contacts and the intrinsically insulating cell membranes. Herein, we report the first example of an n&#8208;type redox&#8208;active conjugated oligoelectrolyte, namely COE&#8208;NDI, which spontaneously intercalates into cell membranes and mimics the function of endogenous transmembrane electron transport proteins. The incorporation of COE&#8208;NDI into Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 cells amplifies current uptake from the electrode by 4&#8208;fold, resulting in the enhanced bio&#8208;electroreduction of fumarate to succinate. Moreover, COE&#8208;NDI can serve as a &#8220;protein prosthetic&#8221; to rescue current uptake in non&#8208;electrogenic knockout mutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycation&#8208;Regulated Electrolyte and Interfacial Electric Fields for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycation additive is introduced to simultaneously regulate the electric fields of electrolyte and Zn/electrolyte interface, which improves Zn2+ migration behaviors and guides dominant Zn (002) deposition, thereby facilitating homogeneous Zn nucleation and growth concomitantly, and blocking the parasitic side reactions derived from water.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries but suffers from disreputable dendrite growth, grievous hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a polycation additive, polydiallyl dimethylammonium chloride (PDD), is introduced to achieve long&#8208;term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, the PDD can simultaneously regulate the electric fields of electrolyte and Zn/electrolyte interface to improve Zn2+ migration behaviors and guide dominant Zn (002) deposition, which is veritably detected by Zeta potential, Kelvin probe force microscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy. Moreover, PDD also creates a positive charge&#8208;rich protective outer layer and a N&#8208;rich hybrid inner layer, which accelerates the Zn2+ desolvation during plating process and blocks the direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode. Thereby, the reversibility and long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes are substantially improved, as certified by a higher average coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% for Zn||Cu cells and 22 times longer life for Zn||Zn cells compared with that of PDD&#8208;free electrolyte.

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues with Optimized Crystal Plane Orientation and Low Crystal Defects toward 450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost Fe&#8208;based Prussian blue analogue with increased redox potential and high energy density is reported for safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing potassium into the framework and regulating the crystal phase orientation. The unconventional and highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution is also identified, and preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism are analyzed through theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for alkali&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the high water and vacancy content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large&#8208;scale application. Herein, a facile &#8220;potassium&#8208;ions assisted&#8221; strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs exhibit increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to &#8776;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is at the same level of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution and redox&#8208;active pairs were identified by multiple in situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations. We believe these results could inspire the design of safe with high energy density.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia in Strong Acid Conditions with Fe2M&#8208;Trinuclear&#8208;Cluster Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, direct, electrocatalytic ammonia production from nitrate in a strong acid environment is possible by using the efficient electron proton conduction capability of the dinitrogen ligand and the metal active site in an Fe&#8208;based trinuclear cluster metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF).







Abstract
Nitrate&#8208;containing industrial wastewater poses a serious threat to the global food security and public health safety. As compared to the traditional microbial denitrification, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction shows better sustainability with ultrahigh energy efficiency and the production of high&#8208;value ammonia (NH3). However, nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater from most industrial processes, such as mining, metallurgy, and petrochemical engineering, is generally acidic, which contradicts the typical neutral/alkaline working conditions for both denitrifying bacteria and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inorganic electrocatalysts, leading to the demand for pre&#8208;neutralization and the problematic hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER) competition and catalyst dissolution. Here, we report a series of Fe2M (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) trinuclear cluster metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that enable the highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonium under strong acidic conditions with excellent stability. In pH=1 electrolyte, the Fe2Co&#8208;MOF demonstrates the NH3 yield rate of 20653.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1site with 90.55&#8201;% NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency (FE), 98.5&#8201;% NH3&#8208;selectivity and up to 75&#8197;hr of electrocatalytic stability. Additionally, successful nitrate reduction in high&#8208;acidic conditions directly produce the ammonium sulfate as nitrogen fertilizer, avoiding the subsequent aqueous ammonia extraction and preventing the ammonia spillage loss. This series of cluster&#8208;based MOF structures provide new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance nitrate reduction catalysts under environmentally&#8208;relevant wastewater conditions.

However, nitrate-containing wastewater from most industrial processes, such as mining, metallurgy, and petrochemical engineering, is generally acidic, which contradicts the typical neutral/alkaline working conditions for both denitrifying bacteria and the state-of-the-art inorganic electrocatalysts, leading to the demand for pre-neutralization and the problematic hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER) competition and catalyst dissolution. Here, we report a series of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) trinuclear cluster metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that enable the highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonium under strong acidic conditions with excellent stability. In pH=1 electrolyte, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co-MOF demonstrates the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 20653.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;site&lt;/sub&gt; with 90.55&#8201;% NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Faradaic efficiency (FE), 98.5&#8201;% NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-selectivity and up to 75&#8197;hr of electrocatalytic stability. Additionally, successful nitrate reduction in high-acidic conditions directly produce the ammonium sulfate as nitrogen fertilizer, avoiding the subsequent aqueous ammonia extraction and preventing the ammonia spillage loss. This series of cluster-based MOF structures provide new insights into the design principles of high-performance nitrate reduction catalysts under environmentally-relevant wastewater conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Developing Insoluble Polyoxometalate Clusters to Bridge Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Water Oxidation Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cobalt(II)&#8208;containing polyoxometalate (POM) cluster&#8208;based solid catalysts were synthesized with different counter&#8208;cations and applied to photocatalytic water oxidation. Candidates in the series bridge homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts by offering activity comparable to the parent homogeneous catalyst and good recyclability.







Abstract
Cluster catalysts are attractive for their atomically precise structures, defined compositions, tunable coordination environments, uniform active sites, and their ability to transfer multiple electrons, but they suffer from poor stability and recyclability. Here, we report a general approach to the direct insolubilization of a water soluble polyoxometalate (POM) [{(B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PW9O34)Co3(OH)(H2O)2(O3PC(O)&#8208;(C3H6NH3)PO3)}2Co]14&#8722; (Co7) and formation of a series of POM&#8208;based solid catalysts with the counter&#8208;cations Ag+, Cs+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Y3+, and Ce3+. They exhibit improved catalytic activities for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation following the trend CsCo7&gt;SrCo7&gt;AgCo7&gt;CeIIICo7&gt;BaCo7&gt;YCo7&gt;PbCo7. While CsCo7 exhibits mainly homogeneous catalysis, the others are predominantly heterogeneous catalysts. An optimal oxygen yield of 41.3&#8201;% and a high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 30.6&#8201;% for SrCo7 is obtained, which is comparable to that of the parent homogeneous POM. Band gap structures, UV/Vis spectra, and real&#8208;time laser flash photolysis experiments collectively suggest that easier electron transfer from the solid POM catalyst to the photosensitizer promotes photocatalytic water oxidation performance. These solid POM catalysts exhibit good stability, which is directly confirmed by a combination of Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, five cycles of tests, and poisoning experiments.

         <title>Tuning Local Charge Distribution in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Enhanced Photocatalytic Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported to regulate local charge distributions and intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions in multivariate covalent organic frameworks (COFs). By fine&#8208;tuning the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions, a COF with a record&#8208;high uranium extraction efficiency of 8.02&#8197;mg/g/day in natural seawater under visible light was realized.







Abstract
Optimizing the electronic structure of covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts is essential for maximizing photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report an isoreticular family of multivariate COFs containing chromenoquinoline rings in the COF structure and electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups in the pores. Intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions in the COFs allowed tuning of local charge distributions and charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. By optimizing the optoelectronic properties of the COFs, a photocatalytic uranium extraction efficiency of 8.02&#8197;mg/g/day was achieved using a nitro&#8208;functionalized multicomponent COF in natural seawater, exceeding the performance of all COFs reported to date. Results demonstrate an effective design strategy towards high&#8208;activity COF photocatalysts with intramolecular D&#8208;A structures not easily accessible using traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Modeling the Enzyme Specificity by Molecular Cages through Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous coordination cages with Zn&#8208;, Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;metal clusters exhibited different electronic structures which dictated the reactive oxygen species evolution. Three photoreactions were achieved by the three cages, respectively, because of the distinct charge transfer and energy transfer pathways. This work demonstrated a rare case that a supramolecular photocatalyst exhibited reaction specificity.







Abstract
Mimicking the active site and the substrate binding cavity of the enzyme to achieve specificity in catalytic reactions is an essential challenge. Herein, porous coordination cages (PCCs) with intrinsic cavities and tunable metal centers have proved the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating pathways as evidenced by multiple photo&#8208;induced oxidations. Remarkably, in the presence of the Zn4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center, PCC converted dioxygen molecules from triplet to singlet excitons, whereas the Ni4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center promoted the efficient dissociation of electrons and holes to conduct electron transfer towards substrates. Accordingly, the distinct ROS generation behavior of PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Zn and PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Ni enables the conversion of O2 to 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;, respectively. In contrast, the Co4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center combined the 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; together to generate carbonyl radicals, which in turn reacted with the oxygen molecules. Harnessing the three oxygen activation pathways, PCC&#8208;6&#8208;M (M=Zn/Ni/Co) display specific catalytic activities in thioanisole oxidation (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Zn), benzylamine coupling (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Ni), and aldehyde autoxidation (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Co). This work not only provides fundamental insights into the regulation of ROS generation by a supramolecular catalyst but also demonstrates a rare example of achieving reaction specificity through mimicking natural enzymes by PCCs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Benzothiophenes at C4 by Activation as their Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiophenes are key structures in materials and medicines and methods for their selective C&#8722;H functionalization are highly prized. Activation of benzothiophenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at C3 as their S&#8208;oxides enables formal C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling with phenols to access C4 arylated benzothiophenes. Computational studies suggest the intermediacy of a &#960;&#8208;complex between the benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation.







Abstract
Benzothiophenes, activated by oxidation to the corresponding S&#8208;oxides, undergo C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H&#8208;type coupling with phenols to give C4 arylation products. While an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C3 of the benzothiophene is important, the process operates without a directing group and a metal catalyst, thus rendering it compatible with sensitive functionalities&#8212;e.g. halides and formyl groups. Quantum chemical calculations suggest a formal stepwise mechanism involving heterolytic cleavage of an aryloxysulfur species to give a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation. Subsequent addition of the phenoxonium cation to the C4 position of the benzothiophene is favored over the addition to C3; Fukui functions predict that the major regioisomer is formed at the more electron&#8208;rich position between C3 and C4. Varied selective manipulation of the benzothiophene products showcase the synthetic utility of the metal&#8208;free arylation process.

Varied selective manipulation of the benzothiophene products showcase the synthetic utility of the metal-free arylation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Aerobic&#8208;Hydrophobic Janus Interface on Partially Carbonized Iron Heterostructure Promotes Bifunctional Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerobic&#8208;hydrophobic Janus interface is constructed by introducing fluorinated modification on porous carbon nanofibers embedded with partially carbonized iron heterojunctions (Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F). The Janus structure can keep the internal Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F away from water infiltration and endow N2 molecule&#8208;concentrating effect, resulting in the formation of a robust &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;gas&#8221; state micro&#8208;domain around catalyst surface. Such microdomains can suppress competing water splitting reactions and enhance nitrogen fixation.







Abstract
Competition from hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and low solubility of N2 in aqueous systems limited the selectivity and activity on nitrogen fixation reaction. Herein, we design an aerobic&#8208;hydrophobic Janus structure by introducing fluorinated modification on porous carbon nanofibers embedded with partially carbonized iron heterojunctions (Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F). The simulations prove that the Janus structure can keep the internal Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F away from water infiltration and endow a N2 molecular&#8208;concentrating effect, suppressing the competing reactions and overcoming the mass&#8208;transfer limitations to build a robust &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;gas&#8221; state micro&#8208;domain around the catalyst surface. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, the Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for nitrogen fixation (NH3 yield rate up to 29.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and Faraday efficiency (FE) up to 27.8&#8201;% in nitrogen reduction reaction; NO3&#8722; yield rate up to 15.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and FE up to 3.4&#8201;% in nitrogen oxidation reaction).

         <title>Carboxylation of Acetylene without Salt Waste: Green Synthesis of C4 Chemicals Enabled by a CO2&#8208;Pressure Induced Acidity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof of concept for a salt waste free carboxylation of acetylene was achieved with the help of a CO2&#8208;pressure dependent pH&#8208;switch. The base can be regenerated for another reaction cycle without loss of activity. This concept enables the synthesis of C4&#8208;platform chemicals such as dimethyl succinate from biogas (CH4+CO2) and hydrogen. Thermodynamic predictions with ePC&#8208;SAFT allowed to model the acidity switch and reaction conditions.







Abstract
The inherent formation of salt waste in C&#8722;H carboxylations is a key obstacle precluding the utilization of CO2 as C1 building block in the industrial synthesis of base chemicals. This challenge is addressed in a circular process for the production of the C4 base chemical dimethyl succinate from CO2 and acetylene. At moderate CO2 pressures, acetylene is doubly carboxylated in the presence of cesium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the C&#8722;C triple bond stabilizes the product against decarboxylation. By increasing the CO2 pressure to 70&#8197;bar, the medium is reversibly acidified, allowing an esterification of the succinate salt with methanol. The cesium base and the hydrogenation catalyst are regenerated and can be reused. This provides the proof of concept for a salt&#8208;free route to C4 chemicals from biogas (CH4/CO2). The origin of this reversible acidity switch and the critical roles of the cesium base and the NMP/MeOH solvents were elucidated by thermodynamic modeling.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformations: Stepwise CO2 Insertions into Bridging Hydrides of [(NHC)CuH]2 Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic studies of substrate insertion into dimeric [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes with two bridging hydrides have been shown to require dimer dissociation to generate transient, highly reactive (NHC)Cu&#8208;H monomers in solution. Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformations, we discovered a new pathway that undergoes stepwise insertion of CO2 into [(NHC)CuH]2 without complete dissociation of the dimer. The first CO2 insertion into dimeric [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 produced a dicopper formate&#8208;hydride [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(u&#8208;1,3&#8208;O2CH)(u&#8208;H). A second CO2 insertion produced a dicopper bis&#8208;formate [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(u&#8208;1,3&#8208;O2CH)(u&#8208;1,1&#8208;O2CH), containing two different bonding modes of the bridging formate. These dicopper formate complexes are inaccessible from solution reactions since the dicopper core ruptures to monomeric complexes in the presence of polar and nonpolar solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterated TEKPol Biradicals and the Spin&#8208;Diffusion Barrier in MAS DNP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy is considerably enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In DNP polarization is transferred from unpaired electrons of a polarizing agent to nearby proton spins. In solids, this transfer is followed by the transport of hyperpolarization to the bulk via 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion. The efficiency of these steps is critical to obtain high sensitivity gains, but the pathways for polarization transfer in the region near the unpaired electron spins are unclear. Here we report a series of seven deuterated and one fluorinated TEKPol biradicals to probe the effect of deprotonation on MAS DNP at 9.4 T. The experimental results are interpreted with numerical simulations, and our findings support that strong hyperfine couplings to nearby protons determine high transfer rates across the spin diffusion barrier to achieve short build&#8208;up times and high enhancements. Specifically, 1H DNP build&#8208;up times increase substantially with TEKPol isotopologues that have fewer hydrogen atoms in the phenyl rings, suggesting that these protons play a crucial role transferring the polarization to the bulk. Based on this new understanding, we have designed a new biradical, NaphPol, which yields significantly increased NMR sensitivity, making it the best performing DNP polarizing agent in organic solvents to date.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT, involved in the biosynthesis of lincomycin A, is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic incorporation of rare amino acid L&#8208;ergothioneine (EGT) into secondary metabolites. Here, we show the structure and function analyses of LmbT. Our in vitro analysis of LmbT revealed that the enzyme shows promiscuous substrate specificity toward nitrogenous bases moiety to generate unnatural nucleotide diphosphates (NDP)&#8208;D&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;lincosamide. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of LmbT apo and complex structure with substrates indicated that the large conformational changes of the active site occurs upon binding of substrates and EGT is strictly recognized by the salt bridge and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with Arg260 and Trp101, respectively. The complex structure of LmbT with substrates and the docking model with EGT&#8208;S&#8208;conjugated lincosamide, as well as the structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis analysis revealed the intimate structural details of the LmbT&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8208;like S&#8208;glycosylation reaction with EGT.</dc:description>

         <title>Radio&#8208;Pharmaceutical Molecule with Quantitative Imaging for Cancer Synergistic Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective and widely applied cancer treatment strategy in clinic. However, it usually suffers from radioresistance of tumor cells and severs side effects of excessive radiation dose. Therefore, it is highly significant to improve radiotherapeutic performance and monitor real&#8208;time tumor response, achieving precise and safe RT. Herein, an X&#8208;ray responsive radio&#8208;pharmaceutical molecule containing chemical radiosensitizers of diselenide and nitroimidazole (BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN) is reported. BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN exhibits enhanced radiotherapeutic effect via a multifaceted mechanisms and self&#8208;monitoring ROS levels in tumors during RT. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the diselenide produces high levels of ROS, leading to enhanced DNA damage of cancer cell. Afterwards, the nitroimidazole in the molecule inhibits the damaged DNA repair, offering a synergetic radiosensitization effect of cancer. Moreover, the probe shows low and high NIR&#8208;II fluorescence ratios in the absence and presence of ROS, which is suitable for precise and quantitative monitoring of ROS during sensitized RT. The integrated system is successfully applied for radiosensitization and the early prediction of in vitro and in vivo RT efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on SnS2: Main Product&#160;Switch from Hydrogen to Formate by Pulsed Potential Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin disulfide (SnS2) is a promising candidate for electrosynthesis of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate while the low activity and selectivity remain a great challenge. Herein, we report the potentiostatic and pulsed potential CO2RR performance of SnS2 nanosheets (NSs) with tunable S&#8208;vacancy and exposure of Sn&#8208;atoms or S&#8208;atoms prepared controllably by calcination of SnS2 at different temperatures under the H2/Ar atmosphere. The catalytic activity of S&#8208;vacancy SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) is improved 1.8 times, but it exhibits an exclusive hydrogen evolution with about 100% FE under all potentials investigated in the static conditions. The theoretical calculations reveal that the adsorption of *H on the Vs&#8208;SnS2 surface is energetically more favorable than the carbonaceous intermediates, resulting in active site coverage that hinders the carbon intermediates from being adsorbed. Fortunately, the main product can be switched from hydrogen to formate by applying pulsed potential electrolysis benefiting from in situ formed partially oxidized SnS2&#8208;x&#160;with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to hydrogen. This work highlights not only the Vs&#8208;SnS2 NSs lead to exclusively H2 formation, but also provides insights into the systematic design of highly selective CO2 reduction catalysts reconstructed by pulsed potential electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Transition Engineering of Host Perovskite toward Optimal Exsolution&#8208;facilitated Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;situ exsolution technique of nanoparticles has brought new opportunities for the utilization of perovskite&#8208;based catalysts in solid oxide cells. However, the lack of control over the structural evolution of host perovskites during the promotion of exsolution has restricted the architectural exploitation of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskites. In this study, we strategically broke the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between promoted exsolution and suppressed phase transition via B&#8208;site supplement, thus broadening the scope of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskite materials. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an illustrative case study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity and stability of perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles (P&#8208;eNs) can be selectively enhanced by regulating the explicit phase of host perovskites, accentuating the critical role of the architectures of perovskite scaffold in catalytic reactions occurring on P&#8208;eNs. The concept demonstrated could potentially pave the way for designing the advanced exsolution&#8208;facilitated P&#8208;eNs materials and unveiling a wide range of catalytic chemistry taking place on P&#8208;eNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically&#8208;Hindered Molecular p&#8208;Dopants Promote Integer Charge Transfer in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular p&#8208;dopants designed to undergo electron transfer with organic semiconductors are typically planar molecules with high electron affinity. However, their planarity can promote the formation of ground&#8208;state charge transfer complexes with the semiconductor host and results in fractional instead of integer charge transfer, which is highly detrimental to doping efficiency. Here, we show this process can be readily overcome by targeted dopant design exploiting steric hindrance. To this end, we synthesize and characterize the remarkably stable p&#8208;dopant 2,2&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;(cyclopropane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triylidene)tris(2&#8208;(perfluorophenyl)acetonitrile) comprising pendant functional groups that sterically shield its central core while retaining high electron affinity. Finally, we demonstrate it outperforms a planar dopant of identical electron affinity and increases the thin film conductivity by up to an order of magnitude. We believe exploiting steric hindrance represents a promising design strategy towards molecular dopants of enhanced doping efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Orderly&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembly of Organic Fluorophores for Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging utilizing traditional organic fluorophores is extensively applied in both cellular and in vivo studies. However, it faces significant obstacles, such as low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) and spurious positive/negative signals, primarily due to the facile diffusion of these fluorophores. To cope with this challenge, orderly self&#8208;assembled functionalized organic fluorophores have gained significant attention in the past decades. These fluorophores can create nanoaggregates via a well&#8208;ordered self&#8208;assembly process, thus prolonging their residency time within cells and in vivo settings. The development of self&#8208;assembled&#8208;based fluorophores is an emerging field, and as such, in this review, we present a summary of the progress and challenges of self&#8208;assembly fluorophores, focusing on their development history, self&#8208;assembly mechanisms, and biomedical applications. We hope that the insights provided herein will assist scientists in further developing functionalized organic fluorophores for in situ imaging, sensing, and therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Random Island Nucleation in the Electrochemical Roughening on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical roughening of platinum upon oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles, leads to nano&#8208;island growth that surprisingly show an almost perfect hexagonal arrangement. The non&#8208;random nucleation of these islands is due to special, preferential nuclei sites that a priori do not exist. Precursors of the oxidation, given by the so&#8208;called place&#8208;exchange atoms, form a network of triangles or disordered spoke wheels, in which the nucleation takes place.







Abstract
Many chemical surface systems develop ordered nano&#8208;islands during repeated reaction and restoration. Platinum is used in electrochemical energy applications, like fuel cells and electrolysers, although it is scarce, expensive, and degrades. During oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles, simulating device operation, nucleation and growth of nano&#8208;islands occurs that eventually enhances the dissolution. Preventing nucleation would be the most effective solution. However, little is known about the atomic details of the nucleation; a process almost impossible to observe. Here, we analyze the nuclei&#8208;distance distribution mapping out the underlying atomic mechanism: a rarely observed, non&#8208;random nucleation takes place. Special, preferential nucleation sites that a priori do not exist, develop initially via a precursor and eventually form a semi&#8208;ordered Pt&#8208;oxide structure. This precursor mechanism seems to be general, possibly explaining also the nano&#8208;island formation on other surfaces/reactions.

     alt="Non-Random Island Nucleation in the Electrochemical Roughening on Pt(111)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical roughening of platinum upon oxidation-reduction cycles, leads to nano-island growth that surprisingly show an almost perfect hexagonal arrangement. The non-random nucleation of these islands is due to special, preferential nuclei sites that a priori do not exist. Precursors of the oxidation, given by the so-called place-exchange atoms, form a network of triangles or disordered spoke wheels, in which the nucleation takes place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many chemical surface systems develop ordered nano-islands during repeated reaction and restoration. Platinum is used in electrochemical energy applications, like fuel cells and electrolysers, although it is scarce, expensive, and degrades. During oxidation-reduction cycles, simulating device operation, nucleation and growth of nano-islands occurs that eventually enhances the dissolution. Preventing nucleation would be the most effective solution. However, little is known about the atomic details of the nucleation; a process almost impossible to observe. Here, we analyze the nuclei-distance distribution mapping out the underlying atomic mechanism: a rarely observed, non-random nucleation takes place. Special, preferential nucleation sites that &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; do not exist, develop initially via a precursor and eventually form a semi-ordered Pt-oxide structure. This precursor mechanism seems to be general, possibly explaining also the nano-island formation on other surfaces/reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis&#8212;Controlling the Competition between Monomeric versus Dimeric Reaction Pathways Enhances Stereoselectivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even sterically demanding chiral phosphoric acids can form highly active catalyst dimers with stereoselectivities inverse to monomers. Both pathways are separable by adjusting temperature and catalyst loading. Significantly enhanced ee values up to 99&#8201;% result from the monomeric and complete inversion up to &#8722;98&#8201;% from the dimeric pathway.







Abstract
Chiral phosphoric acids (CPA) have become a privileged catalyst type in organocatalysis, but the selection of the optimum catalyst is still challenging. So far hidden competing reaction pathways may limit the maximum stereoselectivities and the potential of prediction models. In CPA&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of imines, we identified for many systems two reaction pathways with inverse stereoselectivity, featuring as active catalyst either one CPA or a hydrogen bond bridged dimer. NMR measurements and DFT calculations revealed the dimeric intermediate and a stronger substrate activation via cooperativity. Both pathways are separable: Low temperatures and high catalysts loadings favor the dimeric pathway (ee up to &#8722;98&#8201;%), while low temperatures with reduced catalyst loading favor the monomeric pathway and give significantly enhanced ee (92&#8211;99&#8201;% ee; prior 68&#8211;86&#8201;% at higher temperatures). Thus, a broad impact is expected on CPA catalysis regarding reaction optimization and prediction.

         <title>Insight into Iron Leaching from an Ascorbate&#8208;Oxidase&#8208;like Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Nanozyme and Oxygen Reduction Selectivity
</title>

         <dc:description>
Fe leaching from an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom nanozyme mimicking ascorbate (H2A) oxidase was observed in mild biological media. Beyond Fe&#8208;Nx sites for well&#8208;known 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction (ORR) via bound iron&#8208;oxo species, 40&#8201;% of &#8220;silent&#8221; N&#8722;C sites on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C were activated for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR via free O2&#8901;&#8722; by H2A oxidation, providing a new ORR pathway to regulate the distinct anti&#8208; and pro&#8208;oxidant functions of ascorbate oxidation for various biomedical applications.







Abstract
Ascorbate (H2A) is a well&#8208;known antioxidant to protect cellular components from free radical damage and has also emerged as a pro&#8208;oxidant in cancer therapies. However, such &#8220;contradictory&#8221; mechanisms underlying H2A oxidation are not well understood. Herein, we report Fe leaching during catalytic H2A oxidation using an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C nanozyme as a ferritin mimic and its influence on the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the heterogeneity, the Fe&#8208;Nx sites in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C primarily catalyzed H2A oxidation and 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR via an iron&#8208;oxo intermediate. Nonetheless, trace O2&#8901;&#8722; produced by marginal N&#8722;C sites through 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR accumulated and attacked Fe&#8208;Nx sites, leading to the linear leakage of unstable Fe ions up to 420&#8197;ppb when the H2A concentration increased to 2&#8197;mM. As a result, a substantial fraction (ca. 40&#8201;%) of the N&#8722;C sites on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C were activated, and a new 2+2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR path was finally enabled, along with Fenton&#8208;type H2A oxidation. Consequently, after Fe ions diffused into the bulk solution, the ORR at the N&#8722;C sites stopped at H2O2 production, which was the origin of the pro&#8208;oxidant effect of H2A.

         <title>Regioselective Formal &#946;&#8208;Allylation of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formal Tsuji&#8211;Trost &#946;&#8208;allylation of various carbonyl compounds with different allylic electrophiles is reported. Reactions proceed through initial silyl enol ether formation and subsequent cooperative photoredox/nickel catalysis.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction between carbonyl compounds and allylic precursors has been widely used in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. As the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond is far more acidic than the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, carbonyl compounds undergo highly regioselective allylation at the &#945;&#8208;position and their &#946;&#8208;allylation is therefore highly challenging. This innate &#945;&#8208;reactivity conversely hampers diversity, especially if the corresponding &#946;&#8208;allylation product is targeted. Herein, we present a formal intermolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;C bond formation reaction of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with different allyl electrophiles through cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis. &#946;&#8208;Selectivity is achieved via initial transformation of the aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding silyl enol ethers. The overall transformation features mild conditions, excellent regioselectivity, wide functional group tolerance and high reaction efficiency. The introduced facile and regioselective &#946;&#8208;allylation of carbonyl compounds proceeding through cooperative catalysis allows the preparation of valuable building blocks that are difficult to access from aldehydes and ketones using existing methodology.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Assisted Microfluidic Platform Enables Single&#8208;Cell Metabolite Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic platform integrating metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing immobilized enzymes is reported. The platform could not only offer over 99&#8201;% single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency but also dynamically monitor the single&#8208;cell state by profiling the cellular metabolites glucose and extracellular lactate, thus allowing the evaluation of cell tumorigenic potential in unprocessed whole blood.







Abstract
Colonization of cancer cells at secondary sites, a decisive step in tumor metastasis, is strongly dependent on the formation of metastatic microenvironments regulated by intrinsic single&#8208;cell metabolism traits. Herein, we report a single&#8208;cell microfluidic platform for high&#8208;throughput dynamic monitoring of tumor cell metabolites to evaluate tumor malignancy. This microfluidic device empowers efficient isolation of single cells (&gt;99&#8201;%) in a squashed state similar to tumor extravasation, and employs enzyme&#8208;packaged metal&#8211;organic frameworks to catalyze tumor cell metabolites for visualization. The microfluidic evaluation was confirmed by in vivo assays, suggesting that the platform allowed predicting the tumorigenicity of captured tumor cells and screening metabolic inhibitors as anti&#8208;metastatic drugs. Furthermore, the platform efficiently detected various aggressive cancer cells in unprocessed whole blood samples with high sensitivity, showing potential for clinical application.

         <title>Multi&#8208;stage Transformations of a Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Perturbing Crystals to Glass&#8208;Forming Liquids that Re&#8208;Crystallize at High Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
The first MOF glass composed of metal&#8208;carboxylate cluster building units is vitrified by multi&#8208;stage transformations: The crystalline MOF is amorphized by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration, goes through a glass transition to enter a super&#8208;cooled liquid state, and recrystallizes into the initial structure. These multi&#8208;stage transformations are a rare example of high&#8208;temperature coordinative recognition and self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Glassy and liquid state metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging type of materials subjected to intense research for their rich physical and chemical properties. In this report, we obtained the first glassy MOF that involves metal&#8208;carboxylate cluster building units via multi&#8208;stage structural transformations. This MOF is composed of linear [Mn3(COO)6] node and flexible pyridyl&#8208;ethenylbenzoic linker. The crystalline MOF was first perturbed by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration to give an amorphous state, which can go through a glass transition at 505&#8197;K into a super&#8208;cooled liquid. The super&#8208;cooled liquid state is stable through a wide temperature range of 40&#8197;K and has the largest fragility index of 105, giving a broad processing window. Remarkably, the super&#8208;cooled liquid can not only be quenched into glass, but also recrystallize into the initial MOF when heated to a higher temperature above 558&#8197;K. The mechanism of the multi&#8208;stage structural transformations was studied by systematic characterizations of in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, calorimetry, rheological, spectroscopic and pair&#8208;distribution function analysis. These multi&#8208;stage transformations not only represent a rare example of high temperature coordinative recognition and self&#8208;assembly, but also provide new MOF processing strategy through crystal&#8208;amorphous&#8208;liquid&#8208;crystal transformations.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Labeling of Hydroxyindoles with Chemoselectivity (PhotoCLIC) for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed bioconjugation reaction, PhotoCLIC, has been developed for chemoselective attachment of aromatic amines onto a 5&#8208;hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) residue site&#8208;specifically preinstalled in a full&#8208;length protein using genetic code expansion technology. PhotoCLIC has a wide substrate scope and is compatible with the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition to enable site&#8208;specific dual&#8208;labeling of target proteins







Abstract
We have developed a novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed bioconjugation reaction, PhotoCLIC, that enables chemoselective attachment of diverse aromatic amine reagents onto a site&#8208;specifically installed 5&#8208;hydroxytryptophan residue (5HTP) on full&#8208;length proteins of varied complexity. The reaction uses catalytic amounts of methylene blue and blue/red light&#8208;emitting diodes (455/650&#8197;nm) for rapid site&#8208;specific protein bioconjugation. Characterization of the PhotoCLIC product reveals a unique structure formed likely through a singlet oxygen&#8208;dependent modification of 5HTP. PhotoCLIC has a wide substrate scope and its compatibility with strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click reaction, enables site&#8208;specific dual&#8208;labeling of a target protein.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Mediated Tumor Energy Remodeling for Sensitizing Mild Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform based on copper sulfide (ADT@CuSNDs) that is able to remodel the tumor energy via hydrogen sulfide (H2S) mediation was developed to sensitize the tumor to mild photothermal therapy (mPTT). ADT@CuSNDs could sustainably deliver H2S to tumor sites, disrupt the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibit ATP generation, and reduce heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) overexpression, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic outcome.







Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of tumors requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to maintain therapeutic resistance, posing a major challenge for photothermal therapy (PTT). Although raising the temperature helps in tumor ablation, it frequently leads to severe side effects. Therefore, improving the therapeutic response and promoting healing are critical considerations in the development of PTT. Here, we proposed a gas&#8208;mediated energy remodeling strategy to improve mild PTT efficacy while minimizing side effects. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved drug&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor was developed to provide a sustained supply of H2S to tumor sites, serving as an adjuvant to PTT. This approach proved to be highly effective in disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibiting ATP generation, and reducing the overexpression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which ultimately amplified the therapeutic outcome. With the ability to reverse tumor thermotolerance, this strategy delivered a greatly potent antitumor response, achieving complete tumor ablation in a single treatment while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. Thus, it holds great promise to be a universal solution for overcoming the limitations of PTT and may serve as a valuable paradigm for the future clinical translation of photothermal nanoagents.

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of H2O2 and Formate by Co&#8208;Electrolysis of Water and CO2 over Bifunctional Zn/SnO2 Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate was constructed with the bifunctional electrocatalysts of Zn/SnO2 nanodots, achieving high selectivities and excellent productivities at large current densities. The role of the Zn dopant was revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and (quasi)&#8208;in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and formate are important chemicals used in various chemical manufacturing industries. One promising approach for the simultaneous production of these chemicals is coupling anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation with cathodic CO2 reduction in an electrolyzer using nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an innovative hybrid electrosynthesis strategy using Zn&#8208;doped SnO2 (Zn/SnO2) nanodots as bifunctional redox electrocatalysts to achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 80.6&#8201;% and 92.2&#8201;% for H2O2 and formate coproduction, respectively, along with excellent stability for at least 60&#8197;h at a current density of &#8776;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, including operando attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), isotope labeling mass spectrometry (MS)/1H NMR and quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discovered that the Zn dopant facilitates the coupling of *OH intermediates to promote H2O2 production and optimizes the adsorption of *OCHO intermediates to accelerate formate formation. Our findings offer new insights into designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8208;based pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate feedstocks.

         <title>Frenkel Defect&#8208;modulated Anti&#8208;thermal Quenching Luminescence in Lanthanide&#8208;doped Sc2(WO4)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon heating, deviation from intrinsic to extrinsic position of partial WO42&#8722; in Sc2(WO4)3:Ln forms Frenkel defect, which serves as energy reservoir and back&#8208;transfers the stored excitation energy to Ln3+ so that thermally enhanced downshifting and upconversion luminescence at record&#8208;high working temperature of 500 and 1073&#8197;K are obtained, respectively.







Abstract
Although large amount of effort has been invested in combating thermal quenching that severely degrades the performance of luminescent materials particularly at high temperatures, not much affirmative progress has been realized. Herein, we demonstrate that the Frenkel defect formed via controlled annealing of Sc2(WO4)3:Ln (Ln=Yb, Er, Eu, Tb, Sm), can work as energy reservoir and back&#8208;transfer the stored excitation energy to Ln3+ upon heating. Therefore, except routine anti&#8208;thermal quenching, thermally enhanced 415&#8208;fold downshifting and 405&#8208;fold upconversion luminescence are even obtained in Sc2(WO4)3:Yb/Er, which has set a record of both the Yb3+&#8208;Er3+ energy transfer efficiency (&gt;85&#8201;%) and the working temperature at 500 and 1073&#8197;K, respectively. Moreover, this design strategy is extendable to other hosts possessing Frenkel defect, and modulation of which directly determines whether enhanced or decreased luminescence can be obtained. This discovery has paved new avenues to reliable generation of high&#8208;temperature luminescence.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(WO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Ln forms Frenkel defect, which serves as energy reservoir and back-transfers the stored excitation energy to Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; so that thermally enhanced downshifting and upconversion luminescence at record-high working temperature of 500 and 1073&#8197;K are obtained, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although large amount of effort has been invested in combating thermal quenching that severely degrades the performance of luminescent materials particularly at high temperatures, not much affirmative progress has been realized. Herein, we demonstrate that the Frenkel defect formed via controlled annealing of Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(WO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Ln (Ln=Yb, Er, Eu, Tb, Sm), can work as energy reservoir and back-transfer the stored excitation energy to Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; upon heating. Therefore, except routine anti-thermal quenching, thermally enhanced 415-fold downshifting and 405-fold upconversion luminescence are even obtained in Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(WO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Yb/Er, which has set a record of both the Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; energy transfer efficiency (&amp;gt;85&#8201;%) and the working temperature at 500 and 1073&#8197;K, respectively. Moreover, this design strategy is extendable to other hosts possessing Frenkel defect, and modulation of which directly determines whether enhanced or decreased luminescence can be obtained. This discovery has paved new avenues to reliable generation of high-temperature luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8722;N Biaryl Atropisomers through Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation with Acrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H alkylation reaction is described. A series of structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole and pyrrole&#8208;pyrrole N&#8722;N atropisomers were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). This reaction features perfect atom economy, wide substrate scope, and multifunctionalized products allowing diverse transformations.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers is an emerging area but remains underexplored. The development of efficient synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers is in great demand. Herein, the construction of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers through iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H alkylation is reported for the first time. In the presence of readily available Ir precursor and Xyl&#8208;BINAP, a variety of axially chiral molecules based on indole&#8208;pyrrole skeleton were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, N&#8722;N bispyrrole atropisomers could also be synthesized in excellent yields and enantioselectivity. This method features perfect atom economy, wide substrate scope, and multifunctionalized products allowing diverse transformations.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance Building&#8208;Block&#8208;Based Electroluminescent Material: Lengthening Emission Maximum and Shortening Delayed Fluorescence Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unique strategy was proposed to develop multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter (m&#8208;DBCz) by arranging two MR&#8208;building blocks under the slipping&#8208;repeat mode in multiple resonance skeleton. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing m&#8208;DBCz as emitter exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with high color purity, external quantum efficiency of 36.3&#8201;% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off at ultra&#8208;high brightness.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are considered a class of organic materials with exceptional electronic and optical properties, which make them promising for the applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we improved, synthesized, and characterized a multiple&#8208;resonance type emitter based on the assembly of MR&#8208;building blocks (MR&#8208;BBs). By optimizing the geometric arrangement of MR&#8208;BBs, we were able to generate narrowband emission in the longer wavelength region and shorten the delayed excited&#8208;state lifetime, resulting in improved emission efficiency compared to the parent molecule. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule, m&#8208;DBCz, exhibited narrowband yellowish&#8208;green TADF emission with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 32&#8197;nm and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.04&#8197;eV. The OLED developed using m&#8208;DBCz as the emitter demonstrated electroluminescence at 548&#8197;nm and achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.9&#8201;%. Further optimization of the device resulted in a high external quantum efficiency of 36.3&#8201;% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE values of 30.1&#8201;% and 27.7&#8201;% obtained even at high luminance levels of 50&#8201;000 and 100&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These results demonstrate the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF materials for applications on ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs.

         <title>Regulated High&#8208;Spin State and Constrained Charge Behavior of Active Cobalt Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are developed by assembling definite cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers with different electronic effects. The resulting COFs have high&#8208;spin state active cobalt sites, they constrain charge behaviors and give efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
A novel type of covalent organic frameworks has been developed by assembling definite cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers that have varying electronic effects. This innovative approach has resulted in an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, which is understood by a combination of in situ spectroelectrochemistry and the bond order theorem. The strong interaction between the electron&#8208;donating carbon nanotubes and the electron&#8208;accepting linker mitigates the trend of charge loss at cobalt sites, while inducing the generation of high spin state. This enhances the adsorption strength and electron transfer between the cobalt center and reactants/intermediates, leading to an improved oxygen reduction capability. This work not only presents an effective strategy for developing efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts through reticular chemistry, but also provides valuable insights into regulating the electronic configuration and charge behavior of active sites in designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Current Capable and Non&#8208;Flammable Protic Organic Electrolyte for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protic amide solvent N&#8208;methyl formamide (NMF) is adopted to prepare a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte for Zn anodes, resulting in an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high coulombic efficiency of 99.57&#8201;%, wide electrochemical window (&#8776;3.43&#8197;V), and outstanding durability up to 10.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which might accelerate the development of safe and long cycle&#8208;life rechargeable zinc batteries (RZBs).







Abstract
Rechargeable Zinc batteries (RZBs) are considered a potent competitor for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices, due to their multiple advantages. Nevertheless, traditional aqueous electrolytes may cause serious hazards to long&#8208;term battery cycling through fast capacity fading and poor Coulombic efficiency (CE), which happens due to complex reaction kinetics in aqueous systems. Herein, we proposed the novel adoption of the protic amide solvent, N&#8208;methyl formamide (NMF) as a Zinc battery electrolyte, which possesses a high dielectric constant and high flash point to promote fast kinetics and battery safety simultaneously. Dendrite&#8208;free and granular Zn deposition in Zn&#8208;NMF electrolyte assures ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high CE of 99.57&#8201;%, wide electrochemical window (&#8776;3.43&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn), and outstanding durability up to 10.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the efficient performance of the protic non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte, which will open new opportunities to promote safe and energy&#8208;dense RZBs.

         <dc:description>
A class of stereoisomeric &#945;&#8208;cyano triaryl[3]radialenes was reported, showing state&#8208;dependent light absorption &amp; photoluminescence properties and electron transfer&#8208;driven photoelectromagnetic responsiveness for multimodal information technologies. Specifically, we discussed the special modulation effects of cyano groups on these stereoisomeric radialenes, which may lead to novel design strategy for solid&#8208;state molecular materials.







Abstract
[3]Radialene has a peculiar topology and cross&#8208;conjugation system, representing a unique molecular scaffold in organic materials. Herein, we report a special class of stereoisomeric &#945;&#8208;cyano triaryl[3]radialenes (CTRs) that show concentration&#8208;caused quenching in solution but emit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced luminescence in the crystalline state. Clustering of multiple cyano groups and their through&#8208;space interactions with the [3]radialene ring significantly extend &#960;&#8208;electron communication meanwhile rigidifying the propeller conformation multivalently, thus playing a key role behind the state&#8208;dependent luminescence. These radialenes with a substantial electron affinity undergo a reversible electron transfer transition to anionic radicals with good stability, showing switching of photoabsorption, photoluminescence and electron spin resonance (ESR) signal. We also established proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of CTRs for multimodal information encryption and chemical sensing.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Derived from a Preorganized Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe dual&#8208;atom catalysts with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration were fabricated through the one&#8208;step carbonization of a preorganized covalent organic framework, which exhibited high oxygen reduction activity due to the enhanced adsorption of *OOH, and adjustable d&#8208;band center.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DAC) are deemed as promising electrocatalysts due to the abundant active sites and adjustable electronic structure, but the fabrication of well&#8208;defined DAC is still full of challenges. Herein, bonded Fe dual&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe2DAC) with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration were developed through one&#8208;step carbonization of a preorganized covalent organic framework with bimetallic Fe chelation sites (Fe2COF). The transition from Fe2COF to Fe2DAC involved the dissociation of the nanoparticles and the capture of atoms by carbon defects. Benefitting from the optimized d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of OOH* intermediates, Fe2DAC exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.898&#8197;V vs. RHE. This work will guide more fabrication of dual&#8208;atom and even cluster catalysts from preorganized COF in the future.

         <title>Functional Nanopores Enabled with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scope of biological and synthetic nanopores can be structurally and functionally expanded by chemical modification with DNA as well as the creation of entirely DNA&#8208;based nanopores for applications in sensing, biological research, and synthetic biology.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;spanning nanopores are used in label&#8208;free single&#8208;molecule sensing and next&#8208;generation portable nucleic acid sequencing, and as powerful research tools in biology, biophysics, and synthetic biology. Naturally occurring protein and peptide pores, as well as synthetic inorganic nanopores, are used in these applications, with their limitations. The structural and functional repertoire of nanopores can be considerably expanded by functionalising existing pores with DNA strands and by creating an entirely new class of nanopores with DNA nanotechnology. This review outlines progress in this area of functional DNA nanopores and outlines developments to open up new applications.

         <title>Interfacial Ti&#8722;S Bond Modulated S&#8208;Scheme MOF/Covalent Triazine Framework Nanosheet Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction built up from titanium&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;902) @thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine framework (CTF&#8208;Th) nanosheets was prepared. It has controllable interfacial oxygen vacancies (OVs). This heterojunction demonstrates high efficiency in photocatalytic C3&#8208;acylation of indoles with a yield 8.2&#8197;times larger than pristine CTF&#8208;Th or MOF&#8208;902. The reaction could be applied to a range of substrates.







Abstract
Constructing photocatalyst systems to functionalize the inert C&#8722;H bonds has attracted extensive research interest. However, purposeful modulation of interfacial charge transfer in heterostructures remains a challenge, as it usually suffers from sluggish kinetics. Reported herein is an easy strategy to construct the heteroatom&#8208;induced interface for developing the titanium&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;902) @ thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;Th) nanosheets S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with controllable oxygen vacancies (OVs). Specifically, Ti atoms were first anchored onto the heteroatom site of CTF&#8208;Th nanosheets, and then grown into MOF&#8208;902 via an interfacial Ti&#8722;S linkage, generating OVs. Using in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the enhanced interfacial charge separation and transfer induced by moderate OVs in the pre&#8208;designed S&#8208;scheme nanosheets was validated. The heterostructures exhibited an improved efficiency in photocatalytic C3&#8208;acylation of indoles under mild conditions with a yield 8.2&#8197;times larger than pristine CTF&#8208;Th or MOF&#8208;902 and enabled an extended scope of substrates (15&#8197;examples). This performance is superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalyst and can be retained, without significant loss, after 12&#8197;consecutive cycles.

         <title>A Supported Catalyst that Enables the Synthesis of Colorless CO2&#8208;Polyols with Ultra&#8208;Low Molecular Weight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for constructing a supported catalyst featuring immobilization&#8208;enhanced proton tolerance for the synthesis of colorless ULMW CO2&#8208;polyols is proposed. The key design feature lies in the loading of aluminum aminoporphyrins on swellable Merrifield resin to afford the multiple cooperativity of porphyrins in the supported catalysts.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight (ULMW) CO2&#8208;polyols with well&#8208;defined hydroxyl end groups represent useful soft segments for the preparation of high&#8208;performance polyurethane foams. However, owing to the poor proton tolerance of catalysts towards CO2/epoxide telomerization, it remains challenging to synthesize ULMW yet colorless CO2&#8208;polyols. Herein, we propose an immobilization strategy of constructing supported catalysts by chemical anchoring of aluminum porphyrin on Merrifield resin. The resulting supported catalyst displays both extremely high proton tolerance (&#8776;8000&#8197;times the equivalents of metal centers) and independence of cocatalyst, affording CO2&#8208;polyols with ULMW (580&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and high polymer selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). Moreover, the ULMW CO2&#8208;polyols with various architectures (tri&#8208;, quadra&#8208;, and hexa&#8208;arm) can be obtained, suggesting the wide proton universality of supported catalysts. Notably, benefiting from the heterogeneous nature of the supported catalyst, colorless products can be facilely achieved by simple filtration. The present strategy provides a platform for the synthesis of colorless ULMW polyols derived from not only CO2/epoxides, but also lactone, anhydrides etc. or their combinations.

         <title>Dimerization of a Reactive Azaacene Diradical: Synthesis of a Covalent Azaacene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two series of regioisomeric dicyanomethylene substituted dithienodiazatetracenes with formal para&#8208; or ortho&#8208; quinodimethane subunitswere synthesized and characterized. Whereas the para&#8208;isomers (p&#8208;n, diradical index y0=0.01) are stable and isolable, the ortho&#8208;isomer (are quinoidal and closed&#8208;shell species, the elusive ortho&#8208;isomer (o&#8208;1, y0=0.98) dimerizes into a covalent azaacene cage. Four elongated &#963;&#8208;CC bonds are formed and the former triisopropylsilyl(TIPS)&#8208;ethynylene groups transformed into cumulene&#8208;units. The azaacene cage dimer (o&#8208;1)2 was characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis and temperature&#8208;dependent infrared (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, solid state), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopies (solution) indicating reformation of o&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Illustrating the Fate of Methyl Radical in Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation over Ag&#8208;ZnO by in situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis has emerged as an ideal method for the direct activation and conversion of methane under mild conditions. In this reaction, methyl radical (&#8226;CH3) was deemed a key intermediate that affected the yields and selectivity of the products. However, direct observation of &#8226;CH3 and other intermediates is still challenging. Here, a rectangular photocatalytic reactor coupled with in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR&#8208;PIMS) was developed to detect reactive intermediates within several hundred microseconds during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8208;ZnO. Gas phase &#8226;CH3 generated by photogenerated holes (O&#8208;) was directly observed, and its formation was demonstrated to be significantly enhanced by coadsorbed oxygen molecules. Methoxy radical (CH3O&#8226;) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were confirmed to be key C1 intermediates in photocatalytic methane overoxidation to CO2. The gas&#8208;phase self&#8208;coupling reaction of &#8226;CH3 contributes to the formation of ethane, which indicates the key role of &#8226;CH3 desorption in the highly selective synthesis of ethane. Based on the observed intermediates, the reaction network initiated from &#8226;CH3 of photocatalytic methane oxidation could be clearly illustrated, which is helpful for studying the photocatalytic methane conversion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Annulative &#960;&#8208;Extension by Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Ketone&#8208;Directed C&#8211;H Activation: Rapid Access to Pyrenes and Related PAHs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Annulative &#960;&#8208;extension (APEX) reaction has become a powerful tool for the precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as nanographene, graphene, and other PAHs possessing unique structure. Herein, an APEX reaction has been realized at the masked bay&#8208;region for the efficient and rapid synthesis of valuable PAH, pyrene, bearing substitutions at the most challenging K&#8208;region. Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed ketone&#8208;directed C&#8211;H activation at the peri&#8208;position of a naphthyl&#8208;derived ketone, alkyne&#8208;insertion, intramolecular nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl&#8208;group, dehydration, and aromatization steps occurred in one&#8208;pot to effectuate the protocol. Employing this strategy, a two&#8208;fold APEX reaction on enantiopure BINOL&#8208;derived ketones provided access to axially&#8208;chiral bipyrene derivatives. The detailed DFT study to support proposed mechanism, and synthesis of helical PAHs like dipyrenothiophene and dipyrenofuran are other highlights of the present study.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyketide Synthase&#8208;Mediated O&#8208;Methyloxime Formation in the Biosynthesis of the Oximidine Anti&#8208;cancer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are modular megaenzymes that employ unusual catalytic domains to assemble diverse bioactive natural products. One such PKS is responsible for the biosynthesis of the oximidine anticancer agents,&#160;oxime&#8208;substituted benzolactone enamides that inhibit vacuolar H+&#8208;ATPases. Here, we describe the identification of the oximidine gene cluster in Pseudomonas baetica and the characterization of four novel oximidine variants, including a structurally simpler intermediate that retains potent anticancer activity. Using a combination of in vivo, in vitro and computational approaches, we experimentally elucidate the oximidine biosynthetic pathway and reveal an unprecedented mechanism for O&#8209;methyloxime formation. We show that this process involves a specialized monooxygenase and methyltransferase domain and provide insight into their activity, mechanism and specificity. Our findings expand the catalytic capabilities of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and identify potential strategies for the production of novel oximidine analogues.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine catalysis is powerful for C&#8722;H bond functionalization of carbonyl compounds in chemical synthesis. For an &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of ketone, directing groups are also required to guide the reaction selectivity. Represented herein is the first &#945;&#8208;alkylation of cyclic ketones in the absence of amine catalyst and directing group.1H NMR, XPS, EPR studies and DFT calculation indicate that an &#945;&#8208;carbon radical intermediate is formed through direct and selective activation of inert &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond of ketones chelating on the surface of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) catalyst, which is essential to weaken the C&#8211;H bond. As examplified, the activation platform using CdSe QDs as sole photocatalyst executes &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of cyclic ketones with alkenes under visible light irradiation. Without amine catalyst and directing group, the high step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy transformation under redox&#8208;neutral condition opens a new way for &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of ketone in carbonyl chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Formal (4+1) Carbocyclization of Chalcones with Internal Alkynes via Rhodium(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization of chalcones with internal alkynes is reported, generating biologically important 3,3&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;indanones along with reusable aromatic aldehydes. This transformation features unique (4+1) reaction mode, excellent regioselectivity in alkyne insertion, broad substrate scope, allows for the construction of quaternary carbon centers, and is scalable. Steric hindrance from substrate and ligand probably controls the chemoselectivity of this carbocyclization. Importantly, this discovery enables a practical two&#8208;step protocol switching the overall reaction of acetophenones with internal alkynes from a (3+2) to a (4+1) annulation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) structures of an unusual 13/11&#8208;helix (alternating i,i+1 {NH&#8208;&#8208;O=C} and i,i+3 {C=O&#8208;&#8208;H&#8212;N} H&#8208;bonds) formed by a heteromeric 1:1 sequence of &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;amino acids, and demonstrate the application of this framework towards catalysis. Whilst intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) are the clear driver of helix formation in this system, we also observe an apolar interaction between the ethyl residue of one &#948;&#8208;amino acid and the cyclohexyl group of the next &#948;&#8208;residue in the sequence that seems to stabilize one type of helix over another. To the best of our knowledge this type of additional stabilization leading to a specific helical preference has not been observed before. Critically, the helix type realized places the &#945;&#8208;residue functionalities in positions proximal enough to engage in bifunctional catalysis as demonstrated in the application of our system as a minimalist aldolase mimic.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated&#160;Ion/Electron&#8208;Conducting Interphase Enables Stable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ions Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Zinc (Zn) is considered as&#160;a remarkably promising&#160;anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries&#160;due&#160;to its&#160;high volumetric capacity and low redox potential. Unfortunately, dendritic&#160;growth and severe side reactions&#160;destabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, and ultimately reduce&#160;the electrochemical performance.&#160;Here, an artificial protective layer (APL) with&#160;a&#160;regulated&#160;ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase is constructed on the Zn&#8208;metal anode to provide&#160;excellent interfacial stability in high&#8208;rate&#160;cycling. The superior ionic and moderate electronic conductivity of the&#160;APL derives from the co&#8208;embedding of MXene and Zn(CF3SO3)2&#160;salts into the polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel, which enables&#160;a synergistic effect of local current density reduction during plating and ion transport acceleration during stripping for Zn anode.&#160;Furthermore, the high Young&#8217;s modulus of the&#160;protective layer and dendrite&#8208;free deposition morphology during cycling&#160;suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions&#160;(2.5&#160;mmol h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) and passivation. As a result, in symmetrical cell tests, the modified battery&#160;presents a stable life of&#160;over 2000 cycles at ultra&#8208;high current density of 20 mA cm&#8722;2.&#160;This research presents a new&#160;insight into the formation and regulation of stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface for the&#160;Zn&#8208;metal anode.</dc:description>

         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Mediated Profiling of Viral RNA at Single Nucleotide Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mass pathogen screening is critical to preventing the outbreaks and spread of infectious diseases. The large&#8208;scale epidemic of COVID&#8208;19 and the rapid mutation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) virus have put forward new requirements for virus detection and identification techniques. Here, we report a CRISPR&#8208;based Amplification&#8208;free Viral RNA Electrical Detection platform (CAVRED) for the rapid detection and identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants. A series of CRISPR RNA assays were designed to amplify the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system's ability to discriminate between mutant and wild RNA genomes with a single&#8208;nucleotide difference. The identified viral RNA information was converted into readable electrical signals through field&#8208;effect transistor biosensors for the achievement of highly sensitive detection of single&#8208;base mutations. CAVRED can detect the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus genome as low as 1 cp/&#181;L within 20 mins without amplification, and this value is comparable to the detection limit of real&#8208;time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Based on the excellent RNA mutation detection ability, an 8&#8208;in&#8208;1 CAVRED array was constructed and realized the rapid identification of 40 simulated throat swab samples of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants with a 95.0% accuracy. The advantages of accuracy, sensitivity, and fast speed of CAVRED promise its application in rapid and large&#8208;scale epidemic screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of the Ionic Organic Nonlinear Optical Material NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4] with Ultrawide Band Gap and Moderate Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic organic crystals containing organic planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated units has become one of the hot spots as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although this type of ionic organic NLO crystals commonly have remarkable second harmonic generation (SHG) responses, they also suffer from overlarge birefringences and relatively small band gaps that be hardly beyond 6.2 eV. Herein, a &#64258;exible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8208; unit was theoretically revealed, showing great potential for designing NLO crystals with balanced optical properties. Accordingly, through the reasonable NLO&#8208;favourable layered design, a new ionic organic material, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], was successfully obtained. As expected, it achieves not only a large SHG effect (4&#215;KDP), but also a suitable birefringence (0.06@546 nm) and an ultrawide band gap (&gt;6.5 eV). This study provides a new &#64258;exible &#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO&#8208;active unit, contributing to design more ionic organic NLO materials with excellent balanced optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>CoN1O2 Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation and Selective Cobalt(IV)=O Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co sites with a N1O2 coordination pocket were constructed on the surface of Mn3O4 to overcome the difficulties in CoIV=O generation during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Nitrogen in the asymmetric configuration induces significant electronic delocalization at the Co sites, thus facilitating PMS adsorption, dissociation, and subsequent CoIV=O formation. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX).







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo (HVMO) species are powerful non&#8208;radical reactive species that enhance advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) due to their long half&#8208;lives and high selectivity towards recalcitrant water pollutants with electron&#8208;donating groups. However, high&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;oxo (CoIV=O) generation is challenging in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs because the high 3d&#8208;orbital occupancy of cobalt would disfavor its binding with a terminal oxygen ligand. Herein, we propose a strategy to construct isolated Co sites with unique N1O2 coordination on the Mn3O4 surface. The asymmetric N1O2 configuration is able to accept electrons from the Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in significant electronic delocalization at Co sites for promoted PMS adsorption, dissociation and subsequent generation of CoIV=O species. CoN1O2/Mn3O4 exhibits high intrinsic activity in PMS activation and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation, highly outperforming its counterpart with a CoO3 configuration, carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with CoN4 configuration, and commercial cobalt oxides. CoIV=O species effectively oxidize the target contaminants via oxygen atom transfer to produce low&#8208;toxicity intermediates. These findings could advance the mechanistic understanding of PMS activation at the molecular level and guide the rational design of efficient environmental catalysts.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Modulated Metal Tetrathiafulvalene Octacarboxylate Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three similar MOFs were constructed with Zn2+/Mn2+/Cd2+ and a new tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;octacarboxylate&#8208;based ligand (o&#8208;H8TTFOB), possessing excellent electrochemical performance as anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The slight difference in the structures introduced by adjusting the radius of the metal ions leads to a change in the coordination environment, which results in the highest reversible specific capacity of 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Zn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB.







Abstract
Modulation of the ligands and coordination environment of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been an effective and relatively unexplored avenue for improving the anode performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). In this study, three MOFs are synthesized, namely, M4(o&#8208;TTFOB)(bpm)2(H2O)2 (where M is Mn, Zn, and Cd; o&#8208;H8TTFOB is ortho&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene octabenzoate; and bpm is 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrimidine), based on a new ligand o&#8208;H8TTFOB with two adjacent carboxylates on one phenyl, which allows us to establish the impact of metal coordination on the performance of these MOFs as anode materials in LIBs. Mn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB and Zn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB, with two more uncoordinated oxygen atoms from o&#8208;TTFOB8&#8722;, show higher reversible specific capacities of 1249&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after full activation. In contrast, Cd&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB shows a reversible capacity of 448&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the same condition due to the lack of uncoordinated oxygen atoms. Crystal structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry measurements of the half&#8208;cell configurations, and density functional theory calculations have been performed to explain the lithium storage mechanism, diffusion kinetics, and structure&#8208;function relationship. This study demonstrates the advantages of MOFs with high designability in the fabrication of LIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Three similar MOFs were constructed with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and a new tetrathiafulvalene-octacarboxylate-based ligand (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;TTFOB), possessing excellent electrochemical performance as anode in lithium-ion batteries. The slight difference in the structures introduced by adjusting the radius of the metal ions leads to a change in the coordination environment, which results in the highest reversible specific capacity of 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in Zn-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-TTFOB.

         <title>Unveiling Atom Migration Abilities Affected Anode Performance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of &#8220;atomic migration&#8221; is proposed to explain phase separation and poor reaction reversibility in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Instead of standing still, the atoms can migrate dynamically in carbon layers during discharge, which is tracked by in situ transmission electron microscopy. The atomic migration&#8208;induced irreversible reaction that leads to a low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid degradation of electrode performance is unraveled.







Abstract
In sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) is commonly induced by irreversible phase conversion and difficult desodiation, especially on transition metal compounds (TMCs). Yet the underlying physicochemical mechanism of poor reaction reversibility is still a controversial issue. Herein, by using in situ transmission electron microscopy and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, we demonstrate the irreversible conversion of NiCoP@C is caused by the rapid migration of P in carbon layer and preferential formation of isolated Na3P during discharge. By modifying the carbon coating layer, the migration of Ni/Co/P atoms is inhibited, thus the improvement of ICE and cycle stability is realized. The inhibiting of fast atom migration which induces component separation and rapid performance degradation might be applied to a wide range of electrode materials, and guides the development of advanced SIBs.

         <title>Modern Strategies for Carbon Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of carbon isotope labeling has recently explored new alternative avenues for better dealing with the hurdles of radiochemistry. This review focuses on the emerging opportunities provided by carbon isotope exchange (CIE) technologies. By dramatically reducing the number of steps and radioactive waste generated in preparation of tracers, CIE has great potential for accelerating clinical development of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
In contrast to stable and natural abundant carbon&#8208;12, the synthesis of organic molecules with carbon (radio)isotopes must be conceived and optimized in order to navigate through the hurdles of radiochemical requirements, such as high costs of the starting materials, harsh conditions and radioactive waste generation. In addition, it must initiate from the small cohort of available C&#8208;labeled building blocks. For long time, multi&#8208;step approaches have represented the sole available patterns. On the other side, the development of chemical reactions based on the reversible cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds might offer new opportunities and reshape retrosynthetic analysis in radiosynthesis. This review aims to provide a short survey on the recently emerged carbon isotope exchange technologies that provide effective opportunity for late&#8208;stage labeling. At present, such strategies have relied on the use of primary and easily accessible radiolabeled C1&#8208;building blocks, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and cyanides, while the activation principles have been based on thermal, photocatalytic, metal&#8208;catalyzed and biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Significant Acceleration of Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface of Microdroplets
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency in microdroplets is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding bulk phase reaction. The acceleration is essentially related to an intrinsic strong electric field at the abundant air&#8208;water interface that can promote the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is largely constrained by the sluggish mass transfer and fast combination of photogenerated charge carriers. Herein, we find that the photocatalytic CO2RR efficiency at the abundant gas&#8208;liquid interface provided by microdroplets is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding bulk phase reaction. Even in the absence of sacrificial agents, the production rates of HCOOH over WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.33H2O mediated by microdroplets reaches 2536&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 (vs. 13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in bulk phase), which is significantly superior to the previously reported photocatalytic CO2RR in bulk phase reaction condition. Beyond the efficient delivery of CO2 to photocatalyst surfaces within microdroplets, we reveal that the strong electric field at the gas&#8208;liquid interface of microdroplets essentially promotes the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. This study provides a deep understanding of ultrafast reaction kinetics promoted by the gas&#8208;liquid interface of microdroplets and a novel way of addressing the low efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to fuel.

         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl halides with sulfoximines (as ammonia surrogates) was realized by employing a chiral anionic N,N,N&#8208;ligand with a long spreading side arm under mild conditions. An array of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids could be furnished with good efficiency (up to 95&#8201;% yield) and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl halides with ammonia offers a rapid avenue to chiral unnatural &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids. However, the construction of chiral C&#8722;N bonds between tertiary&#8208;carbon electrophiles and nitrogen nucleophiles presented a great challenge owing to steric congestion. We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl halides with sulfoximines (as ammonia surrogates) under mild conditions by employing a chiral anionic N,N,N&#8208;ligand with a long spreading side arm. An array of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid derivatives were obtained with good efficiency and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of the strategy has been showcased by the elaboration of the coupling products into different chiral &#945;&#8208;fully substituted amine building blocks.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization by the Use of Acylammonium Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional approach to peptide cyclization involving the use of acyl ammonium species was developed. Rapid and epimerization/dimerization&#8208;free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides was possible, including a difficult cyclization reaction involving N&#8208;methyl amide bond formation. The approach is characterized by ease of purification of the products, high productivity, and high reaction mass efficiencies.







Abstract
Although cyclic peptides have become increasingly important as drugs, the most conventional peptide cyclization method using moderately active coupling agents suffers from a lot of waste and high cost as well as long reaction times and burdensome purification. Herein, we report an unconventional approach to peptide cyclization that uses acylammonium species generated from inexpensive and less wasteful Me2NBn and ClCO2i&#8208;Pr. Using this approach, we observed the desired rapid activation of the C&#8208;terminus of cyclization precursors by an acylammonium ion for rapid and epimerization/dimerization&#8208;free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides, including a difficult cyclization involving N&#8208;methyl amide bond formation. The ease of purification, productivities, and reaction mass efficiencies of our approach were significantly superior to those in previous reports. We synthesized a previously reported versicotide D analogue, and our data indicated that its assigned stereostructure should be revised.

         <title>Observing Confined Local Oxygen&#8208;induced Reversible Thiol/Disulfide Cycle with a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under the protein confinmentwas monitored in real&#8208;time using a mutant aerolysin nanopore. Experiments combined with kinetic calculations revealed that confined local O2 can lead to proton&#8208;involved, oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide bond cleavage. The negatively charged neighboring microenvironment facilitates disulfide bond cleavage, which plays a vital role in redox signaling and reactions.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds play an important role in thiol&#8208;based redox regulation. However, owing to the lack of analytical tools, little is known about how local O2 mediates the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under protein confinement. In this study, a protein&#8208;nanopore inside a glove box is used to control local O2 for single&#8208;molecule reaction, as well as a single&#8208;molecule sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle. The results demonstrate that the local O2 molecules in protein nanopores could facilitate the redox cycle of disulfide formation and cleavage by promoting a higher fraction of effective reactant collisions owing to nanoconfinement. Further kinetic calculations indicate that the negatively charged residues near reactive sites facilitate proton&#8208;involved oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide cleavage under protein confinement. The unexpectedly strong oxidation ability of confined local O2 may play an essential role in cellular redox signaling and enzyme reactions.

         <title>Enhanced Carrier Diffusion Enables Efficient Back&#8208;Contact Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced charge carrier diffusion in perovskite thin films is demonstrated to significantly improve the efficiency of back&#8208;contact perovskite photovoltaics. The addition of guanidine thiocyanate induces a preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation of the perovskite films which exhibit increased carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 7.5&#8197;&#956;m. Back&#8208;contact devices using such films display improved efficiencies reaching 11.2&#8201;%, a 3&#8208;fold increase in performance. #SolarCells @MonashUni







Abstract
Back&#8208;contact architectures offer a promising route to improve the record efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by eliminating parasitic light absorption. However, the performance of back&#8208;contact PSCs is limited by inadequate carrier diffusion in perovskite. Here, we report that perovskite films with a preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation show improved carrier dynamic properties. With the addition of guanidine thiocyanate, the films exhibit carrier lifetimes and mobilities increased by 3&#8211;5&#8197;times, leading to diffusion lengths exceeding 7&#8197;&#956;m. The enhanced carrier diffusion results from substantial suppression of nonradiative recombination and improves charge collection. Devices using such films achieve reproducible efficiencies reaching 11.2&#8201;%, among the best performances for back&#8208;contact PSCs. Our findings demonstrate the impact of carrier dynamics on back&#8208;contact PSCs and provide the basis for a new route to high&#8208;performance back&#8208;contact perovskite optoelectronic devices at low cost.

         <title>Alkali Metal Dihydropyridines in Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysis of Imines: Amide Basicity versus Hydride Surrogacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When it comes to catalytic transfer hydrogenation of imines to amines using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene as the hydrogen source, the 2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridyl complexes of the heavyweight alkali metals potassium, rubidium and caesium pack the greater power over their lightweight lithium and sodium rivals with, in best cases, near quantitative yields in minutes and reactions run at room temperature.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of a representative set of imines, both aldimines and ketimines, to amines has been studied using transfer hydrogenation from 1,4&#8208;dicyclohexadiene. Unusually, this has been achieved using s&#8208;block pre&#8208;catalysts, namely 1&#8208;metallo&#8208;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 2&#8208;tBuC5H5NM, M(tBuDHP), where M=Li&#8211;Cs. Reactions have been monitored in C6D6 and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;d8 (THF&#8208;d8). A definite trend is observed in catalyst efficiency with the heavier alkali metal tBuDHPs outperforming the lighter congeners. In general, Cs(tBuDHP) is the optimal pre&#8208;catalyst with, in the best cases, reactions producing quantitative yields of amines in minutes at room temperature using 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst. Supporting the experimental study, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have also been carried out which reveal that Cs has a pathway with a significantly lower rate determining step than the Li congener. In the postulated initiation pathways DHP can act as either a base or as a surrogate hydride.

         <title>Aqueous Processable Two&#8208;Dimensional Triazine Polymers with Superior Photocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile noncovalent functionalization strategy is developed for large&#8208;scale preparation of aqueous processable high&#8208;quality semiconducting 2D triazine polymers. In their Research Article (e202301865), Yuxi Xu and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the obtained crystalline ultrathin 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can not only be assembled into ultralight and mechanically strong macroscopic porous aerogels, but also introduce a new surface molecule doping effect to significantly improve the photocatalytic water splitting activity.

         <title>Atroposelective Silylation of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diols by a Chiral Counteranion Directed Desymmetrization Enhanced by a Subsequent Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective silylation of biaryl diols is achieved with a silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;like silicon electrophile paired with a List&#8208;type imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi). The initial enantioinduction of the desymmetrization is further enhanced by a downstream kinetic resolution that kinetically selects the monosilylated minor enantiomer to form the corresponding bissilylated diol (see Scheme; TBS=tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl).







Abstract
A desymmetrizing silylation of aromatic diols is reported. The previously unknown asymmetric silyl ether formation of phenol derivatives is achieved by applying List's counteranion directed silylation technique. A silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;like silicon electrophile generated from an allylic silane paired with an imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) enables enantioselective discrimination of achiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diols. The enantioselectivity of that desymmetrization is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, converting the monosilylated minor enantiomer into the corresponding, again achiral bissilylated diol.

         <title>Enhancing Carrier Transport via &#963;&#8208;Linkage Length Modulation in D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A Semiconductors for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A organic photocatalysts (imidazole&#8208;alkyl&#8208;perylene diimide, denoted as IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDI) are presented with different &#963;&#8208;linkage lengths and high crystallinity. Through tuning &#963;&#8208;linkage length, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance is finely controlled, and the carrier transport rate and photocatalytic performance of materials is improved. The use of an ethyl&#8208;linkage can shorten the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance most significantly to yield the best photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Carrier transport is an equally decisive factor as carrier separation for elevating photocatalytic efficiency. However, limited by indefinite structures and low crystallinities, studies on enhancing carrier transport of organic photocatalysts are still in their infancy. Here, we develop an &#963;&#8208;linkage length modulation strategy to enhance carrier transport in imidazole&#8208;alkyl&#8208;perylene diimide (IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDI, corresponding to D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A) photocatalysts by controlling &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance. Ethyl&#8208;linkage can shorten &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (3.19&#8197;&#197;) the most among IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDIs (where alkyl=none, ethyl, and n&#8208;propyl) via minimizing steric hindrance between D and A moieties, which leads to the fastest carrier transport rates. Thereby, IMZ&#8208;ethyl&#8208;PDI exhibits remarkable enhancement in phenol degradation with 32&#8208;fold higher rates than IMZ&#8208;PDI, as well as the oxygen evolution rate (271&#8208;fold increased). In microchannel reactors, IMZ&#8208;ethyl&#8208;PDI also presents 81.5&#8201;% phenol removal with high&#8208;flux surface hydraulic loading (44.73&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1). Our findings provide a promising molecular design guideline for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts and elucidate crucial internal carrier transport mechanisms.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Self&#8208;sorting in Molecular and Polymeric Architectures Enabled by Spiroborate Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiroborate metathesis has been demonstrated using a small molecule model reaction involving spiroborate&#8208;linked well&#8208;defined polymeric and molecular architectures. The spiroborate bond exchange driven by dynamic covalent self&#8208;sorting led to scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer through formation of a molecular cage, with all structures unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting is commonly observed in complex reaction systems, which has been utilized to guide the formation of single major by&#8208;design molecules. However, most studies have been focused on non&#8208;covalent systems, and using self&#8208;sorting to achieve covalently bonded architectures is still relatively less explored. Herein, we first demonstrated the dynamic nature of spiroborate linkage and systematically studied the self&#8208;sorting behavior observed in the transformation between spiroborate&#8208;linked well&#8208;defined polymeric and molecular architectures, which is enabled by spiroborate bond exchange. The scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer led to the formation of a molecular cage, whose structures are all unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The results indicate that the molecular cage is the thermodynamically favored product in this multi&#8208;component reaction system. This work represents the first example of a 1D polymeric architecture transforming into a shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage, driven by dynamic covalent self&#8208;sorting. This study will further guide the design of spiroborate&#8208;based materials and open the possibilities for the development of novel complex yet responsive dynamic covalent molecular or polymeric systems.

         <title>Tailoring *H Intermediate Coverage on the CuAl2O4/CuO Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;mediated strategy paves a way for enhancing ethanol production from CO2&#160;electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202302096), Xu Xiang, Jing He and co&#8208;workers unveil that the increased *H coverage on a layered precursor&#8208;derived Cu&#8208;based catalyst favors hydrogenation of *HCCOH to *HCCHOH and prioritizes the ethanol pathway, enabling highly efficient and durable production of ethanol. Such a strategy could be of potential use in *H&#8208;involved reduction reactions.

&lt;p&gt;An active hydrogen (*H)-mediated strategy paves a way for enhancing ethanol production from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;electroreduction. In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202302096"&gt;e202302096&lt;/a&gt;), Xu Xiang, Jing He and co-workers unveil that the increased *H coverage on a layered precursor-derived Cu-based catalyst favors hydrogenation of *HCCOH to *HCCHOH and prioritizes the ethanol pathway, enabling highly efficient and durable production of ethanol. Such a strategy could be of potential use in *H-involved reduction reactions.

         <title>A Kinetically Stabilized Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Triangulene Cation: Stable and NIR Fluorescent Diradical Cation with Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated as the stable diradical with a triplet ground state that exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission. As was the case for a triangulene derivative we previously synthesized, the triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was experimentally confirmed by magnetic measurements. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative is highly stable even in solution under air and exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation. Breaking the alternancy symmetry of triplet alternant hydrocarbon diradicals by a nitrogen cation would therefore be an effective strategy to create stable diradicals possessing magnetic properties similar to the parent hydrocarbons but with different electrochemical and photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular oxime formation by a trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modular trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are enzymatic assembly lines that biosynthesize complex polyketide natural products. Relative to their better studied cis&#8208;AT counterparts, the trans&#8208;AT PKSs introduce remarkable chemical diversity into their polyketide products. A notable example is the lobatamide A PKS, which incorporates a methylated oxime. Here we demonstrate biochemically that this functionality is installed on&#8208;line by an unusual oxygenase&#8208;containing bimodule. Furthermore, analysis of the oxygenase crystal structure coupled with site&#8208;directed mutagenesis allows us to propose a model for catalysis, as well as identifying key protein&#8208;protein interactions that support this chemistry. Overall, our work adds oxime&#8208;forming machinery to the biomolecular toolbox available for trans&#8208;AT PKS engineering, opening the way to introducing such masked aldehyde functionalities into diverse polyketides.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Gradient Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Crystal Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are ordered supramolecular solid structures, however, nothing much explored as centimeter&#8208;scale self&#8208;standing films. The fabrication of such crystals comprising self&#8208;supported films is challenging due to the limited flexibility and interaction of the crystals, and therefore studies on 2D macrostructures of HOFs are limited to external supports. Herein, we introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF film on an in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed COP&#8208;film (Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF). The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network. The kinetic&#8208;controlled Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF showed enhanced proton conductivity (0.83 &#181;S cm&#8208;1) compared to its rapid kinetic analogue, Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;COP (0.21 &#181;S cm&#8208;1), which signifies the advantage of bonding&#8208;engineering in the same system.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazole Diversification of Amino Acids and Peptides via Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaddition with Aryldiazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective structural modification of amino acids and peptides is a central strategy in organic chemistry, chemical biology but also in pharmacology and material science. In this context, the formation of tetrazole rings, known to possess significant therapeutic properties, would expand the chemical space of unnatural amino acids but has received less attention. In this study, we demonstrated that the classic unimolecular Wolff rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;derived diazoketones could be replaced by a faster intermolecular cycloaddition reaction with aryldiazonium salts under identical practical conditions. This strategy provides an efficient synthetic platform that could transform proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of unprecedented tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives with preservation of the stereocenters. Density functional theory studies shed some light on the reaction mechanism and provided information regarding the origins of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Furthermore, this diazo&#8208;cycloaddition protocol was applied to construct tetrazole&#8208;modified peptidomimetics and drug&#8208;like amino acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;bound formates are main reaction intermediates during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over Cu/ZrO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu/ZrO2 is a promising catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Reaction pathways involving formates or hydroxycarbonyls have been proposed. We show here that three different types of formates can be observed under reaction conditions at 220 &#176;C and 3 bar, one being located on metallic Cu and two others being bound to ZrO2. The surface concentrations of formates were determined through calibration curves and their reactivity measured during chemical transient experiments. The Cu&#8208;bound formate represented only about 7% of surface formates, but exhibited a higher reactivity and was found to be the only formate that could account for all the production of methanol. Copper is thus not there only to activate H2, but also bears other crucial intermediates. This work reemphasizes that fully quantitative IR analyses and transient methods are required to unravel the role of surface species.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Cytotrienin A: Late&#8208;stage Installation of C11 Side Chain onto the Macrolactam Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytotrienin A, an ansamycin&#8208;class antibiotic, exhibits potent apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity and has attracted much attention as a lead compound for anticancer drugs. Herein, we report a new asymmetric synthetic route to cytotrienin A, employing an unexplored approach involving the late&#8208;stage installation of a C11 side chain onto the macrolactam core. In this strategy, we utilized the redox properties of hydroquinone and installed a side chain on the sterically hindered C11 hydroxyl group via the traceless Staudinger reaction. This study also demonstrated that the boron&#8208;Wittig/iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling sequence was effective for the concise and selective construction of the (E,E,E)&#8208;conjugated triene moiety. The developed route opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of the side chains of these ansamycin antibiotics and the preparation of other synthetic analogs and chemical probes for further biological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali Chloride Adducts of Acyclic Acylaluminum: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two acyclic acylaluminums and one cyclic acylaluminum dimer were synthesized by reaction of the recently reported Al&#8208;anion with acyl chloride. The reaction of the acylaluminums with TMSOTf and DMAP gave a ring&#8208;expanded iminium&#8208;substituted aluminate and a 2&#8208;C&#8722;H cleaved product. In the reaction of acylaluminums toward C=O and C=N bonds, acyclic acylaluminums reacted as an acyl nucleophile, while the cycilc dimer showed no reactivity. Amide&#8208;bond forming ligation using acyclic acylaluminums and hydroxylamines was further demonstrated. Throughout the study, acyclic acylaluminums exhibited higher reactivity than that of the cyclic dimer.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two acyclic acylaluminums and one cyclic acylaluminum dimer were synthesized by reaction of the recently reported Al-anion with acyl chloride. The reaction of the acylaluminums with TMSOTf and DMAP gave a ring-expanded iminium-substituted aluminate and a 2-C&#8722;H cleaved product. In the reaction of acylaluminums toward C=O and C=N bonds, acyclic acylaluminums reacted as an acyl nucleophile, while the cycilc dimer showed no reactivity.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biscyclopropanes Using Alkynes as Dicarbene Equivalents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral biscyclopropanes are an important skeleton in many bioactive molecules. However, there are few routes to synthesize these molecules with high stereoselectivity due to the nature of multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report the first example of Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of bicyclopropanes with alkynes as dicarbene equivalents. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8208;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8208;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed in excellent stereoselectivity. This protocol features high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol was also extended to the cascaded cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation with excellent stereoselectivities. In these processes, both sp&#8208;carbons of alkyne were converted into stereogenic sp3&#8208;carbons. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cooperative weak hydrogen bonds between the substrates and the dirhodium catalyst may play key roles in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Azoheteroarene and Diazocine Molecular Photoswitches: Self&#8208;Assembly, Responsive Materials and Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic units tethered with an azo (&#8208;N=N&#8208;) functionality comprise a unique class of compounds, known as molecular photoswitches, exhibiting a reversible transformation between their E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers in response to photo&#8208;irradiation. Photoswitches have been explored extensively in the recent past to prepare dynamic self&#8208;assembled materials, optoelectronic devices, responsive biomaterials, and more. Most of such materials involve azobenzenes as the molecular photoswitch and to date, SciFinder lists more than 7000 articles and 1000 patents. Subsequently, a great deal of effort has been invested to improve the photo&#8208;isomerization efficiency and related mesoscopic properties of azobenzenes. Recently, azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes, such as arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines, and diazocines, have emerged as second generation molecular photoswitches beyond conventional azobenzenes. These photoswitches offer distinct photoswitching behavior and responsive properties which make them highly promising candidates for multifaceted applications ranging from photoresponsive materials to photopharmacophores. In this mini&#8208;review, we introduce the structural refinement and photoresponsive properties of azoheteroarenes and diazocines and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art on utilizing these photoswitches as responsive building blocks in supramolecular assembly, material science and photopharmacology, highlighting their versatile photochemical behavior, enhanced functionality, and latest applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of 3&#8208;Substituted Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Racemic 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles were successfully converted into enantiomerically pure or enriched material (up to 99% ee) upon irradiation at &#955; = 366 nm in the presence of a chiral benzo&#173;phenone catalyst (10 mol%). The photochemical deracemization process allows to edit predictably the stereogenic center at carbon atom C3. Light energy compensates for the associated loss of entropy and enables the decoupling of potentially reversible reactions, i.e. a hydrogen atom transfer to (photochemical) and from (thermal) the carbonyl group of the catalyst. The major enantiomer is continuously enriched in several catalytic cycles. The obtained oxindoles were shown to be valuable intermediates for further transformations which proceeded with complete retention at the stereogenic center.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface area determination of anisotropic polymersomes by amphiphilic molecular probe loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface area of anisotropic polymeric assemblies is a critical parameter concerning their properties. However, it is still a grand challenge for traditional techniques to determine the surface area. Here, a molecular probe loading (MPL) method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method uses an amphiphilic molecular probe, comprising hydrophobic pyrene as the anchor and hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol (EG4) as the float. The surface area of spherical polymersomes determined by dynamic light scattering is quantitatively correlated with the loading amount of probes, allowing the calculation of the average separation distance between the loaded probes. With the separation distance, we successfully determine the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes by measuring the loading amount. We envision that the MPL method will assist in the real&#8208;time surface area characterization, enabling the customization of functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling phosphoproteome landscape in circulating extracellular vesicles from microliters of biofluids through functionally tunable paramagnetic separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many biological processes are regulated through dynamic protein phosphorylation. Monitoring disease&#8208;relevant phosphorylation events in circulating biofluids is highly appealing but also technically challenging. We introduce here a functionally tunable material and a strategy, extracellular vesicles to phosphoproteins (EVTOP), which achieves one&#8208;pot EV isolation, extraction and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides, with only trace amount of starting biofluids. EVs are efficiently isolated by magnetic beads functionalized with Ti(IV) ions and a membrane&#8208;penetrating peptide, octa&#8208;arginine R8+, which also provide the hydrophilic surface to retain EV proteins during lysis. Subsequent on&#8208;bead digestion concurrently converts EVTOP to Ti(IV) ion&#8208;only surface for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analyses. The streamlined, ultra&#8208;sensitive platform enabled us to quantify 500 unique EV phosphopeptides with only a few &#956;L of plasma and over 1,200 phosphopeptides with 100 &#956;L of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We explored its clinical application of monitoring the outcome of chemotherapy of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients with small volume of CSF, presenting a powerful tool for broad clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Communication Mechanism in Poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s under External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helix inversion in chiral dynamic helical polymers is usually achieved by conformational changes at the pendant groups induced through external stimuli. Herein, a different mechanism of helix inversion in poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented, based on the activation/deactivation of supramolecular interactions. We prepared poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s (PAEPAs) in which the pendant groups are conformationally locked chiral allenes. Therefore, their substituents are placed in specific spatial orientations. As a result, the screw sense of a PAEPA is fixed by the allenyl substituent with the optimal size/distance relationship to the backbone. This helical sense command can be surpassed by supramolecular interactions between another substituent on the allene and appropriate external stimuli, such as amines. So, a helix inversion occurs through a novel axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism, opening a new scenario for taming the helices of chiral dynamic helical polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Electrodeposition of Potassium&#8208;bridged Molecular Vanadium Oxides: A New Approach Towards Multi&#8208;Electron Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular metal oxides, so&#8208;called polyoxometalates (POMs), have shown outstanding performance as catalyst and lately attracted interest as materials in energy conversion and storage systems due to their capability of storing and exchanging multiple electrons. Here, we report the first example of redox&#8208;driven reversible electrodeposition of molecular vanadium oxide clusters, leading to the formation of thin films. The detailed investigation of the deposition mechanism reveals that the reversibility is dependent on the reduction potential. Correlating electrochemical quartz microbalance studies with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data gave insight into the redox chemistry and oxidation states of vanadium in the deposited films in dependence on the potential window. A multi&#8208;electron reduction of the polyoxovanadate cluster, which facilitates the K+ cation assisted reversible formation of potassium vanadium oxide thin films was confirmed. At anodic potentials, re&#8208;oxidation of the polyoxovanadate and complete stripping of the thin film is observed for films deposited at potentials more positive than &#8208;500 mV vs. Ag/Ag+, while electrodeposition at more negative cathodic potential reduces the electrochemical reversibility of the process and increases the stripping overpotential. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the electrochemical performance of the deposited films for potential use in potassium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular metal oxides, so-called polyoxometalates (POMs), have shown outstanding performance as catalyst and lately attracted interest as materials in energy conversion and storage systems due to their capability of storing and exchanging multiple electrons. Here, we report the first example of redox-driven reversible electrodeposition of molecular vanadium oxide clusters, leading to the formation of thin films. The detailed investigation of the deposition mechanism reveals that the reversibility is dependent on the reduction potential. Correlating electrochemical quartz microbalance studies with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data gave insight into the redox chemistry and oxidation states of vanadium in the deposited films in dependence on the potential window. A multi-electron reduction of the polyoxovanadate cluster, which facilitates the K+ cation assisted reversible formation of potassium vanadium oxide thin films was confirmed. At anodic potentials, re-oxidation of the polyoxovanadate and complete stripping of the thin film is observed for films deposited at potentials more positive than -500 mV vs. Ag/Ag+, while electrodeposition at more negative cathodic potential reduces the electrochemical reversibility of the process and increases the stripping overpotential. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the electrochemical performance of the deposited films for potential use in potassium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the Structures of Intermediate Fragments during Stepwise Dissociation of Monolayer&#8208;Protected Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fragmentation dynamics of ligated coinage metal clusters reflects their structural and bonding properties. So far methodological challenges limited probing structures of the fragments. Herein, we resolve the geometric structures of the primary fragments of [Ag29L12]3&#8208;, i.e. [Ag24L9]2&#8208;, [Ag19L6]&#8208; and [Ag5L3]&#8208; (L is 1,3&#8208;benzene dithiolate). For this, we used trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry to determine collision cross sections of the fragments and compared them to structures calculated by density functional theory. We also report that following two sequential [Ag5L3]&#8208; elimination steps, further dissociation of [Ag19L6]&#8208; also involves a new channel of Ag2 loss and Ag&#8208;S and C&#8208;S bond cleavages. This reflects a competition between retaining the electronic stability of 8e&#8208; superatom cluster cores and increasing steric strain of ligands and staples. These results are also of potential interest for future soft&#8208;landing deposition studies aimed at probing catalytic behavior of Ag clusters on supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging the Footprint of Nanoscale Electrochemical Reactions for Assessing Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work proposes a novel method for measuring the intrinsic activity of single metal&#8208;based nanoparticles towards water reduction in neutral media at industrially relevant current densities. Instead of using gas nanobubbles as proxy, the method uses optical microscopy to track the local footprint of the reaction through the precipitation of metal hydroxide, which is associated to the local pH increase during electrocatalysis. The results show the electrocatalytic activities of different types of metal nanoparticles and bifunctionnal core&#8208;shell nanostructures made of Ni and Pt, and demonstrate the importance of metal hydroxide nano&#8208;shells in enhancing electrocatalysis. This method should be generalizable to any electrocatalytic reaction involving pH changes such as nitrate or CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Soft Porosity and Electrical Properties of Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;Insulating Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;stone, two&#8208;bird method to integrate the soft porosity and electrical properties of distinct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into a single material involves the design of conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating MOF (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructures that allow for direct electrical control. Herein, we report the synthesis of cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures using a seeded layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method, in which the sorptive iMOF core is combined with chemiresistive cMOF shells. The resulting cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures exhibit enhanced selective sorption of CO2 compared to the pristine iMOF (298 K, 1 bar, SCO2/H2 from 15.4 of ZIF&#8208;7 to 43.2&#8211;152.8). This enhancement is attributed to the porous interface formed by the hybridization of both frameworks at the molecular level. Furthermore, owing to the flexible structure of the iMOF core, the cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures with semiconductive soft porous interfaces demonstrated high flexibility in sensing and electrical &#8220;shape memory&#8221; toward acetone and CO2. This behavior was observed through the guest&#8208;induced structural changes of the iMOF core, as revealed by the operando synchrotron grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Periodically arranging coordination&#8208;distinct actinides into one crystalline architecture is intriguing but of great synthetic challenge. We report a rare example of a heterobimetallic actinide metal&#8208;organic framework (An&#8208;MOF) by a unique reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy. A thorium MOF (SCU&#8208;16) with the largest unit cell among all Th&#8208;MOFs was prepared as the precursor, then the uranyl was precisely embedded into the MOF precursor under oxidation condition. Single crystal of the resulting thorium&#8208;uranium MOF (SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U) shows that a uranyl&#8208;specific site was in situ induced by the formate&#8208;to&#8208;carbonate oxidation reaction. The heterobimetallic SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U exhibits multifunction catalysis properties derived from two distinct actinides. The strategy proposed here offers a new avenue to create mixed&#8208;actinide functional material with unique architecture and versatile functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Disc&#8208;like Silver Nanocluster Ag93 Built with Bicapped Hexagonal Prismatic Ag15 and Ino Decahedral Ag13 Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of alkynyl&#8208;silver and phosphine&#8208;silver precursors with a weak reducing reagent Ph2SiH2 led to the formation of a novel silver nanocluster [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R = 4&#8208;CH3OC6H4), which is the largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters. This disc&#8208;shaped cluster has a Ag69 kernel consisting of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 wrapped by six Ino decahedral through edge&#8208;sharing. This is the first time to observe that Ino decahedra can be used as building blocks to assemble a cluster of clusters. Moreover, the central silver atom has a coordination number of 14, which is the highest in metal nanoclusters. This work provides a diverse metal packing pattern in metal nanoclusters, which is helpful for the understanding of metal cluster assembling mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Modification of a Bacterial Siderophore by a Competitor in Dual&#8208;Species Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical communication between competing bacteria in multi&#8208;species environments often enables both species to adapt and survive, and perhaps even thrive. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are two bacterial pathogens found in natural biofilms, especially in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where recent studies showed that there is often cooperation between the two species, leading to increased disease severity and antibiotic resistance. However, the mechanisms behind this cooperation are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed co&#8208;cultured biofilms in various settings, and we applied untargeted mass spectrometry&#8208;based metabolomics analyses, combined with synthetic validation of candidate compounds. We unexpectedly discovered that S. aureus can convert pyochelin into pyochelin methyl ester, an analogue of pyochelin with reduced affinity for iron (III). This conversion allows S. aureus to coexist more readily with P. aeruginosa and unveils a mechanism underlying the formation of robust dual&#8208;species biofilms.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Electron&#8208;Transfer Events in [Fe4Co4] Cubes via a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Approach: The Impact of Elastic Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engineering of intermolecular interaction is challenging but critical for magnetically switchable molecules. Here, we prepared two cyanide&#8208;bridged {Fe4Co4} cube complexes via the alkynyl&#8208; and alcohol&#8208;functionalized trispyrazoyl capping ligands. The alkynyl&#8208;functionalized 1 exhibited a reversible thermal&#8208;induced incomplete metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) behavior at around 220 K, while the mixed alkynyl/alcohol&#8208;functionalized cube of 2 showed a complete and abrupt MMET behavior at 232 K, and remarkably, both showed a long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;induced metastable state near 200 K. The crystallographic study demonstrated that the incomplete transition of 1 was likely due to the possible elastic frustration originating from the competition between the anion&#8208;propagated elastic interactions and inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl &amp; CH/alkynyl interactions, whereas the latter are eliminated in 2 as a result of the partial substitution by the alcohol&#8208;functionalized ligands. Additionally, the introduction of chemically distinguishable cobalt centers within the cube unit of 2 did not lead to a two&#8208;step but a one&#8208;step transition, possibly because of the strong ferroelastic intramolecular interaction through the cyanide bridges.</dc:description>

         <title>About Perfluoropolyhedranes, Their Electron&#8208;Accepting Ability and Questionable Supramolecular Hosting Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyhedral molecules appeal for their eye&#8208;catching architecture and distinctive chemistry. Perfluorination of such, often greatly strained compounds, is a momentous challenge. It drastically changes electron distribution, structure and properties. Notably, small high&#8208;symmetry perfluoropolyhedranes feature a centrally located, star&#8208;shaped low&#8208;energy unoccupied molecular orbital that can host an extra electron within the polyhedral frame, thus producing a radical anion, without loss of symmetry. This predicted electron&#8208;hosting capacity was definitely established for perfluorocubane, the first perfluorinated Platonic polyhedrane to be isolated pure. Hosting atoms, molecules or ions in such &#8220;cage&#8221; structures is, however, all but forthright, when not illusionary, offering no easy access to supramolecular constructs. While adamantane and cubane have fostered numerous applications in materials science, medicine and biology, specific uses for their perfluorinated counterparts remain to be established. Some aspects of highly fluorinated carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes or graphite, are briefly mentioned for context.</dc:description>

         <title>New Radical Route and Insight for Highly Efficient Benzimidazoles Synthesis Integrated with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzimidazoles are a versatile class of scaffolds with important biological activities, whereas their synthesis in a lower&#8208;cost and more efficient manner remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new radical route for the high&#8208;performance photoredox coupling of alcohols and diamines to synthesize benzimidazoles along with stoichiometric hydrogen (H2) over Pd&#8208;decorated ultrathin ZnO nanosheets (Pd/ZnO NSs). Mechanistic study reveals the unique advantage of ZnO NSs over other supports and particularly that the features of Pd nanoparticles in facilitating the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols and adsorbing subsequently&#8208;generated C&#8722;centered radicals hold the key to turning on the reaction. This work highlights a new insight into radical&#8208;induced efficient benzimidazoles synthesis pairing with H2 evolution by rationally designing semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizable Supraparticles Constructed from Catechol&#8208;Terminated Molecular Building Blocks with Controllable Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal supraparticles integrated with multicomponent primary particles, come with emerging or synergetic functionalities. However, achieving functional customization of supraparticles remains a great challenge due to the limited option of building blocks with tailorability and functional extensibility. Herein, we developed a universal approach to construct customizable supraparticles with desired properties from molecular building blocks obtained by the covalent conjugation of catechol groups with a series of orthogonal functional groups. These catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks can assemble into primary particles driven by various intermolecular interactions (i.e., metal&#8208;organic coordination, host&#8208;guest, and hydrophobic interaction), and then further assemble into supraparticles governed by catechol&#8208;mediated interfacial interactions. Our strategy enables supraparticles with diverse functionalities, such as dual&#8208;pH responsiveness, light&#8208;controllable permeability, and non&#8208;invasive fluorescence labeling of living cells. The ease with which these supraparticles can be fabricated, and the ability to tailor their chemical and physical properties through the choice of metals and orthogonal functional groups used, should enable a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Kernelled AgCu Nanoclusters with Golden Ratio Geometry and Promising Photothermal Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters have recently attracted extensive interest from the scientific community. However, unlike carbon&#8208;based materials and metal nanocrystals, they rarely exhibit a sheet kernel structure, probably owing to the instability caused by the high exposure of metal atoms (particularly in the relatively less noble Ag or Cu nanoclusters) in such a structure. Herein, we synthesized a novel AgCu nanocluster with a sandwich&#8208;like kernel (diameter = ~0.9 nm and length = ~0.25 nm) by introducing the furfuryl mercaptan ligand (FUR) and the alloying strategy. Interestingly, the kernel consists of a centered silver atom and two planar Ag10 pentacle units with completely mirrored symmetry after a rotation of 36 degrees. The two Ag10 pentacles and some extended structures show an unreported golden ratio geometry, and the two inner five&#8208;membered rings and the centered Ag atom form an unanticipated full&#8208;metal ferrocene&#8208;like structure. The featured kernel structure causes the dominant radial direction transition of excitation electrons, as determined via time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which affords the protruding absorption at 612 nm and contributes to the promising photothermal conversion efficiency of 67.6% of the as&#8208;obtained nanocluster, having important implications for structure&#8208;property correlation and the development of nanocluser&#8208;based photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Tough Thermoplastic Elastomers by Leveraging Rigid&#8211;Flexible Supramolecular Segment Interplays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular interactions facilitate the development of tough multifunctional thermoplastic elastomers. However, the fundamental principles that govern supramolecular toughening are barely understood, and the rational design to achieve the desired high toughness remains daunting. Herein, we report a simple and robust method for toughening thermoplastic elastomers by rationally tailoring hard&#8211;soft phase separation structures containing rigid and flexible supramolecular segments. The introduced functional segments with distinct structural rigidities provide mismatched supramolecular interactions to efficiently tune the energy dissipation and bear an external load. The optimal supramolecular elastomer containing aromatic amide and acylsemicarbazide moieties demonstrates a record toughness (1.2 GJ m&#8722;3), extraordinary crack tolerance (fracture energy 282.5 kJ m&#8722;2), an ultrahigh true stress at break (2.3 GPa), good elasticity, healing ability, recyclability, and impact resistance. The toughening mechanism is validated by testing various elastomers, confirming the potential for designing and developing super&#8208;tough supramolecular materials with promising applications in aerospace and electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence of a Uranium&#8208;Paddlewheel Node in a Catecholate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between uranium and non&#8208;innocent organic species are an essential component of fundamental uranium redox chemistry. However, they have seldom been explored in the context of multidimensional, porous materials. Uranium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a new angle to study these interactions, as these self&#8208;assembled species stabilize uranium species through immobilization by organic linkers within a crystalline framework, while potentially providing a method for adjusting metal oxidation state through coordination of non&#8208;innocent linkers. We report the synthesis of the MOF NU&#8208;1700, assembled from U4+&#8208;paddlewheel nodes and catecholate&#8208;based linkers. We propose this highly unusual structure, which contains two U4+ in a paddlewheel built from four linkers &#8211; a first among uranium materials &#8211; as a result of extensive characterization via powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), sorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in addition to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Flytraps Held Together by Pt&#8210;Pt Intermetallic Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8210;metal bonds have rarely been explored as active elements in supramolecular assemblies despite their unique potential to introduce responsive behavior. In this report, a dynamic molecular container composed of two cyclometalated Pt units is constructed using Pt&#8210;Pt bonds. This molecule &#8212; the flytrap &#8212; has a flexible jaw composed of two [18]crown&#8208;6 ethers that can adapt their shape to bind large inorganic cations with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity. Along with the spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of the flytrap, we report its photochemical assembly, which allows the capture of ions and their transport from solution to the solid state. In addition, we have been able to recycle the flytrap to regenerate its starting material due to the reversible nature of the Pt&#8210;Pt bond. We believe that other molecular containers and materials for harvesting valuable substrates from solution could be assembled using the advances presented here.</dc:description>

         <title>General Autofluorescence Method to Characterize Polymerization Progress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An autofluorescence technique to characterize polymerization progress in real time/in line was developed, which functioned in the absence of typical fluorogenic groups on the monomer or polymer. The monomer dicyclopentadiene and polymer polydicyclopentadiene&#160;are hydrocarbons that lack traditional functional groups for fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the autofluorescence of formulations containing this monomer and polymer during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was harnessed for reaction monitoring. The methods fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and here&#8208;developed fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) characterized polymerization progress in these native systems&#8212;without requiring exogenous fluorophore. (Auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery changes during polymerization correlated linearly to degree of cure, providing a quantitative link with reaction progress. These changing signals also provided relative rates of background polymerization, enabling comparison of 10 different catalyst&#8211;inhibitor&#8208;stabilized formulations. Multiple&#8208;well analysis demonstrated suitability for future high&#8208;throughput evaluation of formulations for thermosets. The central concept of the combined autofluorescence and FLRAP/FRAP method may be extendable to monitoring other polymerization reactions previously overlooked for lack of an obvious fluorescence handle.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Polycondensation for Bio&#8208;based Adaptable and Degradable Phenolic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing sustainable materials with tunable mechanical properties, intrinsic degradability, and recyclability from renewable biomass through a mild process has become vital in polymer science. Traditional phenolic resins are generally considered to be not degradable or recyclable. Here we report the design and synthesis of linear and network structured phenolic polymers using facile polycondensation between natural aldehyde&#8208;bearing phenolic compounds and polymercaptans. Linear phenolic products are amorphous with Tg between &#8208;9 oC and&#160;12 oC. Cross&#8208;linked networks from vanillin and its di&#8208;functional derivative exhibited excellent mechanical strength between 6&#8208;64 MPa. The connecting dithioacetals are associatively adaptable strong bonds and susceptible to degradation in oxidative conditions to regenerate vanillin. These results highlight the potential of biobased sustainable phenolic polymers with recyclability and selective degradation, as a complement to the traditional phenol&#8208;formaldehyde resins.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nitride Additive: A Drop&#8208;in Solution for Lithium/Garnet Wetting in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powder&#8208;form Mg3N2 offers a drop&#8208;in solution to improve lithium metal anode/garnet oxide electrolyte wetting and to suppress dynamic de&#8208;wetting in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting can be applied to the design and processing of other solid&#8208;state materials and devices.







Abstract
Garnet oxides such as Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) are promising solid electrolyte materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries because of high ionic conductivity, low electronic leakage, and wide electrochemical stability window. While LLZTO has been frequently discussed to be stable against lithium metal anode, it is challenging to achieve and maintain good solid&#8208;on&#8208;solid wetting at the metal/ceramic interface in both processing and extended electrochemical cycling. Here we address the challenge by a powder&#8208;form magnesium nitride additive, which reacts with the lithium metal anode to produce well&#8208;dispersed lithium nitride. The in situ formed lithium nitride promotes reactive wetting at the Li/LLZTO interface, which lowers interfacial resistance, increases critical current density (CCD), and improves cycling stability of the electrochemical cells. The additive recipe has been diversified to titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, tantalum nitride, and niobium nitride, thus supporting the general concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting. Such a design can be extended to other solid&#8208;state devices for better functioning and extended cycle life.

         <title>Cluster Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Containing Copper Iodine Cube with 100&#8201;% Exciton Utilization Using Host&#8208;Cluster Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster light&#8208;emitting diode (CLED) with a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% was demonstrated. Its emissive layer consisted of redox&#8208;active Cu4I4 cluster and thermally activated delayed fluorescence host, which complementarily provided internal and external reverse intersystem crossing channels for 100&#8201;% triplet conversion, 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant.







Abstract
Clusters combine the advantages of organic molecules and inorganic nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for optoelectronic applications. Nonetheless, recently emerged cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes require further excited state optimization of cluster emitters, especially to reduce population of the cluster&#8208;centered triplet quenching state (3CC). Here we report that redox&#8208;active ligands enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) of Cu4I4 cluster for triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet conversion, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host can provide an external RISC channel. It indicates that the complementarity between TADF host and cluster in RISC transitions gives rise to 100&#8201;% triplet conversion efficiency and complete singlet exciton convergence, rendering 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant. We achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield of 99&#8201;% and a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;%.

         <title>Hyperpolarized 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy of Urine Samples at Natural Abundance by Quantitative Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization provides a rich and resolved 13C metabolic profile on urine samples at natural abundance while retaining precious quantitative information using a standard addition workflow.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) offers an ensemble of methods that remarkably address the sensitivity issues of conventional NMR. Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (d&#8208;DNP) provides a unique and general way to detect 13C&#8197;NMR signals with a sensitivity enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The expanding application scope of d&#8208;DNP now encompasses the analysis of complex mixtures at natural 13C abundance. However, the application of d&#8208;DNP in this area has been limited to metabolite extracts. Here, we report the first d&#8208;DNP&#8208;enhanced 13C&#8197;NMR analysis of a biofluid &#8208;urine&#8208; at natural abundance, offering unprecedented resolution and sensitivity for this challenging type of sample. We also show that accurate quantitative information on multiple targeted metabolites can be retrieved through a standard addition procedure.

         <title>Piezochromism in Dynamic Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching chromophores are prepared. For first time they are used to study piezochromism under mechanical stimuli by the diamond anvil cell technique.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials with pressure&#8208;dependent photoluminescence tuning properties are important in many fields, such as mechanical sensors, security papers, and storage devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) with structural dynamics and tunable photophysical properties, are suitable for designing piezochromic materials, but there are few related studies. Herein, we report two dynamic three&#8208;dimensional COFs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophores, termed JUC&#8208;635 and JUC&#8208;636 (JUC=Jilin University China), and for the first time, study their piezochromic behavior by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the various luminescent groups, JUC&#8208;635 has completely different solvatochromism and molecular aggregation behavior in the solvents. More importantly, JUC&#8208;635 with AIE effect exhibits a sustained fluorescence upon pressure increase (&#8776;3&#8197;GPa), and reversible sensitivity with high&#8208;contrast emission differences (&#916;&#955;em=187&#8197;nm) up to 12&#8197;GPa, superior to other CPMs reported so far. Therefore, this study will open a new gate to expand the potential applications of COFs as exceptional piezochromic materials in pressure sensing, barcoding, and signal switching.

         <title>Solar Hydrocarbons: Single&#8208;Step, Atmospheric&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of C2&#8722;C4 Alkanes and Alkenes from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At atmospheric pressure, solar&#8208;energy&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step CO2 hydrogenation to C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons is realized with considerable activity. The photothermal effect of light plays an essential role in the distinct selectivity to hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstration bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.







Abstract
Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) spinel has been found to produce C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons in a single&#8208;step, ambient&#8208;pressure, photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 with a rate of 1.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, selectivity of 29.8&#8201;% and conversion yield of 12.9&#8201;%. On stream the CoFe2O4 reconstructs to a CoFe&#8722;CoFe2O4 alloy&#8208;spinel nanocomposite which facilitates the light&#8208;assisted transformation of CO2 to CO and hydrogenation of the CO to C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstrator bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.

         <title>Linear Adsorption Enables NO Selective Electroreduction to Hydroxylamine on Single Co Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) were reported for the selective electroreduction of NO to NH2OH and NH3 by regulating the adsorption configuration of NO. The linear adsorption of NO on Co SACs could maintain the N&#8722;O bond in the hydrogenation process to generate NH2OH, while the bridge adsorption of NO on Co NPs would weaken the N&#8722;O bond, leading to the breaking of the N&#8722;O bond to produce ammonia.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH), a vital industrial feedstock, is presently synthesized under harsh conditions with serious environmental and energy concerns. Electrocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) reduction is attractive for the production of hydroxylamine under ambient conditions. However, hydroxylamine selectivity is limited by the competitive reaction of ammonia production. Herein, we regulate the adsorption configuration of NO by adjusting the atomic structure of catalysts to control the product selectivity. Co single&#8208;atom catalysts show state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH2OH selectivity from NO electroreduction under neutral conditions (FE
: 81.3&#8201;%), while Co nanoparticles are inclined to generate ammonia (FE
: 92.3&#8201;%). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical simulations unveil that linear adsorption of NO on isolated Co sites enables hydroxylamine formation and bridge adsorption of NO on adjacent Co sites induces the production of ammonia.

         <title>Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Acylation of Arenes by Switching from Ionic&#8208; to Radical&#8208;Type Chemistry Using NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent benzoylation of 2&#8208;methoxynaphthalene with benzoyl fluoride is presented using either Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type chemistry to give selectively the 1&#8208;isomer or cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis to afford the 4&#8208;isomer exclusively. Along with arenes, regiodivergent aroylation also works for heteroarenes.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation reaction, which belongs to the class of electrophilic aromatic substitutions is a highly valuable and versatile reaction in synthesis. Regioselectivity is predictable and determined by electronic as well as steric factors of the (hetero)arene substrate. Herein, a radical approach for the acylation of arenes and heteroarenes is presented. C&#8722;H acylation is achieved through mild cooperative photoredox/NHC radical catalysis with the cross&#8208;coupling of an arene radical cation with an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical as a key step. As compared to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation, a regiodivergent outcome is observed upon switching from the ionic to the radical mode. In these divergent reactions, aroyl fluorides act as the acylation reagents in both the ionic as well as the radical process.

         <title>The Influence of Regiochemistry on the Performance of Organic Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiophenes functionalised in the 3&#8208;position are ubiquitous building blocks for the design and synthesis of organic semiconductors. Their non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature has long been used as a powerful synthetic design tool exemplified by the vastly different properties of regiorandom and regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) owing to the repulsive head&#8208;to&#8208;head interactions between neighbouring side chains in the regiorandom polymer. The renewed interest in highly electron&#8208;rich 3&#8208;alkoxythiophene based polymers for bioelectronic applications opens up new considerations around the regiochemistry of these systems as both the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail and head&#8208;to&#8208;head couplings adopt near&#8208;planar conformations due to attractive intramolecular S&#8208;O interactions. To understand how this increased flexibility in the molecular design can be used advantageously, we explore in detail the geometrical and electronic effects that influence the optical, electrochemical, structural, and electrical properties of a series of six polythiophene derivatives with varying regiochemistry and comonomer composition. We show how the interplay between conformational disorder, backbone coplanarity and polaron distribution affects the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction.&#160;Ultimately, we use these findings to identify a new conformationally restricted&#160;polythiophene derivative for p&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistor applications with performance on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mixed conductors evidenced by a &#956;C* product of 267 F V&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the Dynamics of the Human Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor Reveals Insights into the Energy Landscape of the Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G protein&#8208;coupled receptors initiate signal transduction in response to ligand binding. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), the focus of this study, binds the 28 residue peptide ghrelin. While structures of GHSR in different states of activation are available, dynamics within each state have not been investigated in depth. We analyze long molecular dynamics simulation trajectories using &#8220;detec&#173;tors&#8221; to compare dynamics of the apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound states yield&#173;ing timescale&#8208;specific amplitudes of motion. We identify differ&#173;ences in dynamics between apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound GHSR in the extracellular loop 2 and transmembrane helices 5&#8208;7. NMR of the GHSR histidine residues reveals chemical shift differences in these regions. We eva&#173;luate timescale specific correlation of motions between residues of ghre&#173;lin and GHSR, where binding yields a high degree of correlation for the first 8 ghrelin residues, but less correlation for the helical end. Finally, we investigate the traverse of GHSR over a rugged energy land&#173;scape via principal component analysis.Insert abstract text here.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Bipolar Polyimide Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Durable Aluminium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging rechargeable aluminium batteries (RABs) offer a sustainable option for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies with low cost and exemplary safety. However, the development of RABs is restricted by the limited availability of high&#8208;performance cathode materials. Herein, we report two polyimide two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) cathodes with redox&#8208;bipolar capability in RAB. The optimal 2D&#8208;COF electrode achieves a high specific capacity of 132 mAh g&#8722;1. Notably, the electrode presents long&#8208;term cycling stability (with negligible ~0.0007% capacity decay per cycle), outperforming early reported organic RAB cathodes. 2D&#8208;COFs integrate n&#8208;type imide and p&#8208;type triazine active centres into the periodic porous polymer skeleton. With multiple characterizations, we elucidate the unique Faradic reaction of the 2D&#8208;COF electrode, which involves AlCl2+ and AlCl4&#8722; dual&#8208;ions as charge carriers. This work paves the avenue toward novel organic cathodes in RABs.</dc:description>
