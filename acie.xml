         <title>Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes: Synthesis, Structures, and Ring Reconstruction via Atom Transfer under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monoazadichalcogenasumanenes was synthesized that are deep &#960;&#8208;bowls with the bowl&#8208;depth reaching up to 0.95&#8197;&#197;, and thus exceeding that of corannulene. They undergo ring reconstruction under acidic conditions, as a result of protonation&#8208;induced chalcogen atom transfer.







Abstract
Buckybowls have unique properties that can be tailored by embedding main&#8208;group elements into their &#960;&#8208;scaffolds. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed for producing monoazadichalcogenasumanenes (4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, 7&#8201;a/7&#8201;b) derived from sumanene by replacing its three benzylic carbons with one nitrogen and two chalcogen atoms (S for 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, Se for 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, Te for 7&#8201;a/7&#8201;b). Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes are deeper &#960;&#8208;bowls than trichalcogensumanenes as the C&#8722;N bond is much shorter than C&#8722;X (X=S, Se, Te). The bowl&#8208;depth of 4&#8201;b (0.95&#8197;&#197;) is greater than that of corannulene (0.85&#8197;&#197;). The nitrogen atom donates electron density to the entire &#960;&#8208;system that makes monoazadichalcogenasumanenes electron&#8208;rich. They undergo ring reconstruction of chalcogenophene ring via transferring a chalcogen atom from one molecule to another under acidic conditions. The nitrogen and chalcogen atoms play crucial role on this reaction.

         <title>Hydrazone and Oxime Olefination via Ruthenium Alkylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefination of carbon&#8211;heteroatom double bonds is a powerful approach to access highly functionalized olefins. An approach is reported here that uses air&#8208;stable and commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes to promote C=N/olefin ring closure. The enabling strategy for this reaction is the use of hydrazones and oximes as readily accessible substrates that preferentially react with ruthenium alkylidenes, even in the presence of carbonyl groups.







Abstract
We describe the development of an efficient method for the olefination of hydrazones and oximes. The key design approach that enables this transformation is tuning of the energy/polarity of C=N &#960;&#8208;bonds by employing heteroatom functionalities (NR2, OR). The resulting hydrazones or oximes facilitate olefination with ruthenium alkylidenes. Through this approach, we show that air&#8208;stable, commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes provide access to functionalized alkenes (20 examples) in ring&#8208;closing reactions with yields up to 88&#8201;%.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Electron Density Study of the Chemical Bonding Origin of Glass Formation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical bonding difference between the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni MOF and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni was investigated by 25&#8197;K X&#8208;ray electron density analysis, and multi&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography establishing the correlation between chemical bonding and meltability in MOFs. Then systematic tuning of the thermal stability with Co doping was demonstrated in a series of CoxZn1&#8722;x&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x=0.3&#8211;0.003) MOF solid solutions.







Abstract
Glass&#8208;forming metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have novel applications, but the origin of their peculiar melting behavior is unclear. Here, we report synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction electron densities of two zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni. Electron density analysis shows that the Zn&#8722;N bonds are more ionic than the Co&#8722;N bonds, which have distinct covalent features. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectra reveal the onset of significant imidazolate bond weakening in Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni above 673&#8197;K. Melting can be controlled by tuning the metal&#8211;ligand and imidazole bonding strength as shown from thermal analysis of nine solid&#8208;solution CoxZn1&#8722;x&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x=0.3 to 0.003) MOFs, and a mere 4&#8201;% Co&#8208;doping into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni results in thermal decomposition instead of melting. The present findings demonstrate the key role of the metal&#8211;ligand bonds and imidazolate bonds in controlling the delicate balance between melting and decomposition processes in this class of ZIF compounds.

         <title>Asymmetric Redox Allylic Alkylation to Access 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Oxindoles Enabled by Ni/NHC Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and nickel cooperative catalysis enables asymmetric redox allylic alkylation to access 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The feasibility of cooperative catalysis between chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and nickel in asymmetric reactions has been demonstrated convincingly. The high efficiency of this catalytic system enables the asymmetric allylic alkylation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with allylic carbonates and [3+3] annulation with racemic vinyl epoxides to provide straightforward access to highly enantioenriched 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles. The great practicality of this method in organic synthesis has been showcased by facile product modification and enantioselective synthesis of the key building block to access (&#8722;)&#8208;debromoflustramine B.

The thorough characterization of aqueous stable bidentate chelate systems with Ti4+ including speciation, DFT, and structural characterization of key complexes is reported. Hexadentate analogs of the high&#8208;performing bidentate chelators were also assessed and were assessed for the potential use in kit&#8208;based PET imaging with 45Ti4+.







Abstract
Despite its prevalence in the environment, the chemistry of the Ti4+ ion has long been relegated to organic solutions or hydrolyzed TiO2 polymorphs. A knowledge gap in stabilizing molecular Ti4+ species in aqueous environments has prevented the use of this ion for various applications such as radioimaging, design of water&#8208;compatible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and aqueous&#8208;phase catalysis applications. Herein, we show a thorough thermodynamic screening of bidentate chelators with Ti4+ in aqueous solution, as well as computational and structural analyses of key compounds. In addition, the hexadentate analogues of catechol (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol) and deferiprone (3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;pyridone), TREN&#8208;CAM and THPMe respectively, were assessed for chelation of the 45Ti isotope (t1/2=3.08&#8197;h, &#946;+=85&#8201;%, E&#946;+=439&#8197;keV) towards positron emission tomography (PET) imaging applications. Both were found to have excellent capacity for kit&#8208;formulation, and [45Ti]Ti&#8208;TREN&#8208;CAM was found to have remarkable stability in vivo.

         <title>Light&#8208;Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvester Using Photoactive Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework membrane has been fabricated by a facile cathodic deposition method. The high ion selectivity and permeability endow the MOF membrane with a great performance in osmotic energy harvesting, and this performance can be further improved by the photoactive porphyrin ligands upon light irradiation.







Abstract
High ion selectivity and permeability, as two contradictory aspects for the membrane design, highly hamper the development of osmotic energy harvesting technologies. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra&#8208;small and high&#8208;density pores and functional surface groups show great promise in tackling these problems. Here, we propose a facile and mild cathodic deposition method to directly prepare crack&#8208;free porphyrin MOF membranes on a porous anodic aluminum oxide for osmotic energy harvesting. The abundant carboxyl groups of the functionalized porphyrin ligands together with the nanoporous structure endows the MOF membrane with high cation selectivity and ion permeability, thus a large output power density of 6.26&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 is achieved. The photoactive porphyrin ligands further lead to an improvement of the power density to 7.74&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 upon light irradiation. This work provides a promising strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance osmotic energy harvesting systems.

         <title>Cooperative Assembly of 2D&#8208;MOF Nanoplatelets into Hierarchical Carpets and Tubular Superstructures for Advanced Air Filtration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, DUT&#8208;134(Cu), nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble into carpet&#8208;like mesocrystals offering enhanced accessibility of open metal sites for air&#8208;filtration applications.







Abstract
Clean air is an indispensable prerequisite for human health. The capture of small toxic molecules requires the development of advanced materials for air filtration. Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials offer highly accessible surface areas but for real&#8208;world applications their assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical mesostructures is essential. DUT&#8208;134(Cu) ([Cu2(dttc)2]n, dttc=dithieno[3,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate]) is a metal&#8211;organic framework forming platelet&#8208;shaped particles, that can be organized into complex structures, such as millimeter large free&#8208;standing layers (carpets) and tubes. The structured material demonstrates enhanced accessibility of open metal sites and significantly enhanced H2S adsorption capacity in gas filtering tests compared with traditional bulk analogues.

         <title>Aromaticity and Extrusion of Benzenoids Linked to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;: Clar Has the Answer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clar has the answer! Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextets justify the reason why the linked system of [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and benzenoid drives to extrusion in the case of naphthalene or anthracene, but not for benzene, pyrene or perylene.







Abstract
Benzene and pyrene can be synthetically linked to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; keeping their aromaticity. In contrast, naphthalene and anthracene are extruded in the same reaction. We have proven that extrusion is only favorable if the number of Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextets remains constant. Thus, Clar has the answer to whether an attached polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; is extruded or not.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate Catalyzes the Dehydrocoupling of Phenylphosphine Borane to High Molar Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphosphinoboranes are an emerging class of p&#8208;block element&#8208;based polymers. To date, their synthesis with high molecular weights was reserved for catalysts featuring transition metals. Calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is introduced as the first transition metal&#8208;free catalytic system for the dehydropolymerization of phenylphosphine borane. Initial mechanistic investigations indicate metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity of the aluminate.







Abstract
High molar weight polyphosphinoboranes represent materials with auspicious properties, but their preparation requires transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Here, calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is shown to induce the dehydropolymerization of phosphine boranes to high molar mass polyphosphinoboranes (up to Mn=43&#8201;000&#8197;Da). Combined GPC and 31P DOSY NMR spectroscopic analyses, quantum chemical computations, and stoichiometric reactions disclose a P&#8722;H bond activation by the cooperative action of the square&#8208;planar aluminate and the electron&#8208;rich ligand framework. This first transition metal&#8208;free catalyst for P&#8722;B dehydrocoupling overcomes the problem of residual d&#8208;block metal impurities in the resulting polymers that might interfere with the reproducibility of the properties for this emerging class of inorganic materials.

         <title>Mediating Oxidation of Thioethers with Iodine&#8212;A Mild and Versatile Pathway to Trigger the Formation of Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for the formation of peptide hydrogels utilizing a mediating redox reaction based on the oxidation of thioethers with iodine is presented. Protons generated during oxidation trigger the efficient hydrogelation of peptides from alkaline precursor solutions.







Abstract
The development of redox&#8208;triggerable peptide hydrogels poses fundamental challenges, since the highly specific peptide architectures required inevitably limit the versatility of such materials. A powerful, yet rarely applied approach to bypass those barriers is the application of a mediating redox reaction to gradually decrease the pH during hydrogel formation. We report a versatile strategy to trigger the formation of peptide hydrogels from readily accessible acid&#8208;triggerable gelators by generating protons by oxidation of thioethers with triiodide. Adding thiodiglycol as a readily available thioether auxiliary to the basic precursor solution of a peptide gelator efficiently yielded hydrogels after mixing with triiodide, as studied in detail for Nap&#8208;FF and demonstrated for other peptides. Furthermore, incorporation of the thioether moiety in the gelator backbone via the amino acid methionine, as shown for the tailormade Nap&#8208;FMDM peptide, reduces the number of required additives.

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Mediated Ion Specific Effects Enable Salt Tolerance of a Pore&#8208;Forming Marine Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) preferentially permeate prokaryotic membranes via electrostatic binding and membrane remodeling.&#160;Such action is drastically suppressed by high salt due to increased electrostatic screening, thus it is puzzling how marine AMPs can possibly work.&#160;We examine as a model system piscidin&#8208;1, a histidine&#8208;rich marine AMP, and show that ion&#8208;histidine interactions play unanticipated roles in membrane remodeling at high salt: Histidines can simultaneously hydrogen&#8208;bond to a phosphate and coordinate with an alkali metal ion to neutralize phosphate charge, thereby facilitating multidentate bonds to lipid headgroups in order to generate saddle&#8208;splay curvature, a prerequisite to pore&#8208;formation. A comparison among Na  +  , K  +  , and Cs  +  &#160;indicates that histidine&#8208;mediated salt tolerance is ion specific. We conclude that histidine plays a unique role in enabling protein/peptide&#8208;membrane interactions that occur in marine or other high&#8208;salt environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Expeditious Synthesis of Diblock Copolymers with Different Morphologies by Lewis Pair Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis pair polymerization has demonstrated its uniuqe advantages and powerful capability in polymer synthesis. Here we employ strong nucleophilic  N  &#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) and bulky organoaluminum to construct frustrated Lewis pair, which can realize the compounded sequence control copolymerization (CSC) and self&#8208;assembly the mixture of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate and fluoride&#8208;functionalized methacrylate into diblock copolymers (di&#8208;BCPs) nano&#8208;assemblies through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly in one&#8208;pot, single&#8208;step manner within minutes. These di&#8208;BCPs were characterized by  1H and  13C NMR, GPC, DSC, and TEM. By utilizing appropriate solvophilic block and solvophobic block, such Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy enables the expeditious, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of di&#8208;BCP nanoparticles with different morphologies, including spheres, worms, vesicles, and even fibers, thus suggesting the great application potential of such method in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Enlightening the &#8220;Spirit Molecule&#8221;:&#160;Photomodulation of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor by a Light&#8208;Controllable N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical psychedelics are a group of hallucinogens which trigger non&#8208;ordinary states of consciousness through activation of the 5&#8208;HT  2A  receptor (5&#8208;HT  2A  R) in the brain. However, the exact mechanism of how 5&#8208;HT  2A  R agonism alters perception remains elusive. When studying receptor signaling, tools which work at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the receptor are exceptionally useful. To create such a tool, we designed a set of photoswitchable ligands based on the classical psychedelic  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyltryptamine (DMT). By incorporation of the DMT&#8208;indole ring into the photoswitchable system, we obtained red&#8208;shifted ligands which can be operated with visible light. Among these azo&#8208;DMTs, compound  2h  (&#8220;Photo&#8208;DMT&#8221;) stands out as its  cis  isomer exhibits DMT like activity while the  trans  isomer acts as weak partial agonist. Such a  cis  &#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5&#8208;HT  2A  R signaling.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating electrofluorochromism phenomena at the molecular level is essential for understanding and improving the performance of optoelectronic devices. Here we report the strongly charge&#8208;state&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) of vanadyl phthalocyanine. We describe vibrationally resolved absorption and laser&#8208;induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of samples comprising both the neutral molecule (VOPc  &#8226;  , a stable radical) and its cation isolated in 5 K neon matrices. Ionization of the essentially non&#8208;emissive VOPc  &#8226;  forms a high&#8208;spin diradical cation (VOPc  +&#8226;&#8226;  ) which shows profound PL in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. This has implications for future NIR&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;optical devices based on this commonly available chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Partners in Asymmetric Catalysis Copolymerization: Highly Enantioselective and Controllable at Enhanced Temperatures and Low Loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent enantioselectivity, activity and no transesterification side reactions were achieved in the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxides and anhydrides at low catalyst loadings or/and enhanced temperatures via intramolecularly bimetallic and multichiral synergistic catalysis.







Abstract
Asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide and anhydride is a powerful strategy for preparing various isotactic polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers. However, the previous binary systems suffered from slow rates at low loadings, poor enantioselectivities and transesterification reactions at enhanced temperatures. Herein, we report novel dinuclear aluminium complexes with multiple chiralities and ammonium salts anchored on ligand frameworks. These bifunctional catalysts exhibit high activities and enantioselectivities for epoxides/anhydrides copolymerizations at harsh conditions via intramolecularly synergistic catalysis, affording polyesters with unprecedented molecular weights and narrow distributions. Notably, no transesterification reactions were observed, significantly different from the binary catalyst/cocatalyst pairs. This study represents a rare example regarding temperature&#8208;independent asymmetric induction for preparing chiral polymers from achiral monomers.

         <title>Synthesis of FeIII and FeIV Cyanide Complexes Using Hypervalent Iodine Reagents as Cyano&#8208;Transfer One&#8208;Electron Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyano &#955;3&#8208;iodanes react with iron(II) and iron(III) complexes as cyano&#8208;transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants. This approach enables the straightforward synthesis of iron(III) and iron(IV) cyanide complexes, which have been thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer and NMR spectroscopies and computational methods.







Abstract
We disclose a new reactivity mode for electrophilic cyano &#955;3&#8208;iodanes as group transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants to synthesize FeIII and FeIV cyanide complexes. The inherent thermal instability of high&#8208;valent FeIV compounds without &#960;&#8208;donor ligands (such as oxido (O2&#8722;), imido (RN2&#8722;) or nitrido (N3&#8722;)) makes their isolation and structural characterization a very challenging task. We report the synthesis of an FeIV cyanide complex [(N3N&#8242;)FeCN] (4) by two consecutive single electron transfer (SET) processes from FeII precursor [(N3N&#8242;)FeLi(THF)] (1) with cyanobenziodoxolone (CBX). The FeIV complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N3N&#8242;)FeIII] (3) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of FeII with 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(1H)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of FeIII cyanide complex [(N3N&#8242;)FeIII(CN)(Li)(THF)3] (2&#8208;LiTHF). Complexes 4 and 2&#8208;LiTHF have been structurally characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their electronic structure has been examined by M&#246;ssbauer, EPR spectroscopy, and computational analyses.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd(0) catalysts featuring phosphorous&#8208;based monodentate ligands can detour the reactivity of carbonyl&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) from standard (3+2) cycloadditions towards tandem cycloisomerization / cross&#8208;coupling processes. This new reactivity lies on the formation of key &#960;&#8208;allyl oxapalladacyclic intermediates, which are subsequently trapped with external nucleophilic partners, instead of undergoing canonical C&#8208;O reductive eliminations. Importantly, the use of imine&#8208;tethered ACP&#8217;s is also feasible. Therefore, the method provides a straightforward and stereoselective entry to a wide variety of highly functionalized cyclic alcohols and amines.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although bowl&#8208;shaped N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic

hydrocarbons (PAHs) can achieve excellent electron&#8208;donating ability,

their application for optoelectronics is hampered by typically low

photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). To address this issue,

we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of curved and

fully conjugated nitrogen&#8208;doped PAHs. Through structural

modifications to the electron&#8208;accepting moiety, we are able to switch

the mechanism of luminescence between TADF and RTP, and to tune

the overall PLQY in the range from 9% to 86%. As a proof of concept,

we constructed solid&#8208;state OLED devices which has not been

explored so far in the context of concave N&#8208;doped systems being

TADF/RTP emitters. The best&#8208;performing dye, possessing peripheral

trifluoromethyl group adjacent to phenazine acceptor, exhibits yellow

to orange emission with a maximum external EL quantum efficiency

(EQE) of 12%, which is the highest EQE in an curved D&#8208;A embedded

N&#8208;PAH to date.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thirteen palladium&#8208;ligand assemblies with different structures and topologies were investigated for the ability to bind lithium ions. In one case, the addition of LiBF4 resulted in a profound structural rearrangement, converting a dincluclear [Pd2L4]2 complex into a low&#8208;symmetry [Pd4L8]8+ assembly with two binding pockets for solvated LiBF4 ion pairs. The rearrangement could only be induced by Li+, indicating highly specific host&#8208;guest interaction.

         <title>Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Bearing Macrocyclic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand: Improved Stability and Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of sterically hindered C&#8211;C double bonds via catalytic olefin metathesis is considered a very challenging task for Ru catalysts. This limitation led to the development of specialised catalysts bearing sterically reduced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that are very active in such transformations, yet significantly less stable as compared to general purpose catalysts. To decrease the small&#8208;size NHC catalysts susceptibility to decomposition, a new NHC ligand was designed, in which two sterically reduced aryl arms were tied together by a C&#8208;8 alkene chain. The installation of this macrocyclic ligand on the ruthenium centre led to the formation of an olefin metathesis catalyst (trans&#8208;Ru6). Interestingly, this complex undergoes transformation into an isomer bearing two Cl ligands in the cis arrangement (cis&#8208;Ru6). These two isomeric complexes exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Diverse Chemiluminescent Dioxetane&#8208;Luminophores through Convergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores was developed. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible.







Abstract
Adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane luminophores are an important class of chemiluminescent molecular probes for diagnostics and imaging. We have developed a new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. In a following simple step, the dioxetane is obtained by oxidation of the enolether precursor with singlet&#8208;oxygen. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible. Such a late&#8208;stage derivatization strategy simplifies the rapid exploration of novel luminogenic molecular structures in a library format and simplifies the synthesis of known dioxetane luminophores. We expect that this new synthetic strategy will be particularly useful in the design and synthesis of yet unexplored dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1&#8208;CuO Catalyst for Boosting Acetone Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly active single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and identifying their intrinsic active sites in oxidizing industrial hazardous hydrocarbons are challenging prospects. Tuning the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs) is valid for modulating the catalytic performance of SACs. Herein, we propose that the EMSIs modulation of a Pt1&#8208;CuO SAC significantly promotes its activity in acetone oxidation. This EMSI is determined to promote the charge redistribution through the unified Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Cu moieties, which modulates the d&#8208;band structure of atomic Pt sites, and strengthens the adsorption and activation of reactants. The positively charged Pt atoms are superior for activating acetone at low temperatures, then the stretched Cu&#8722;O bonds in&#8208;turn facilitate the activation of lattice oxygens to participate in the followed oxidation. We strongly consider that this work will guide researchers to engineer efficient SACs in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation Using Silyl&#8208;Bipyridine Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NNSi pincer ligands served as suitable ligands for iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based ligand was shown to be an excellent one. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2 was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.







Abstract
New ligands for the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aliphatic compounds were established. In sharp contrast to 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 6&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives bearing a hydrosilylmethyl group (which would give a thermally stable NNSi pincer complex) served as suitable ligands for the reaction. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand was shown to be an excellent ligand, and various aliphatic compounds were efficiently converted to the corresponding borylated products using the Ir/NNSi pincer catalyst system. The NNSi pincer ligand showed unique selectivity and enabled the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation using pinacolborane [H&#8722;B(pin)] instead of B2(pin)2. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2 was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.

         <title>syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Chiral Terminal Allylic Alcohols with a Titanium Salalen Catalyst and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of chiral secondary allylic alcohols, one substrate enantiomer is predominantly converted to the anti&#8208;epoxy alcohol. We herein report the first highly syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of terminal allylic alcohols using a titanium salalen complex as catalyst, at room temperature, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. With enantiopure terminal allylic alcohols as substrates, the epoxy alcohols were obtained with up to 98 % yield and up to &gt; 99:1 dr (syn). Catalyst loadings as low as&#160;1 mol % can be applied without eroding the syn&#8208;diastereoselectivity. Modification of the allylic alcohol to an ether does not affect the diastereoselectivity either [&gt; 99:1 dr (syn)]. Inverting the catalyst configuration leads to the anti&#8208;product, albeit at lower dr (ca. 20:1). The synthetic potential is demonstrated by a short, gram&#8208;scale preparation of a tetrahydrofuran building block with three stereo&#172;centers, involving two titanium salalen catalyzed epoxidation steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of a Hydrido&#8208; and Imido&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear Ytterbium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido and imido complexes are of versatile reactivity, and many such complexes have been synthesized. However, no example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands has been reported. Herein, we report the first rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands, namely hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex. The complex was synthesized via an unprecedented redox reaction of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido complex with azido compound. DFT calculation indicated that the N  2  release from azido compound in the presence of ytterbium(II) is a kinetically facile process because of the synergistic effects of the two metal centers. The reactivity of the hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex was also explored, which showed the redox, addition and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendrite issues for Zn anodes in  a  flexible cell configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key application of aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;based batteries (RZBs) is flexible and wearable energy storage devices (FESDs). Current studies and optimizations of Zn anodes have not considered the special flexible working modes. In this study, we present the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curve areas. The correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells is proposed. Interface contact of hydrogel electrolytes when working in a bending mode is another key factor affecting cell lifespan. After detailed analysis, the ideal cell configuration is to apply hydrogel electrolytes with suitable chemistry, satisfactory mechanical properties, and high adhesivity. Based on the criteria, a water in salt (WIS) hydrogel is proposed to satisfy those criteria and demonstrate highly stable cell performance. This work has provided a brand&#8208;new perspective toward Zn anode research and is a good starting point to propel the development of FESDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Adaptive Capillarity Enabling Densified 3D Printing for&#160;Ultra&#8208;High Areal and Volumetric Energy Density&#160;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endowing supercapacitors with higher energy density is of great practical significance but remains extremely challenging.&#160;In this work, an innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for the first time.&#160;The printable ink formulated with pyrrole surface&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide renders the printed electrodes excellent surface tension regulability to the subsequent capillary densification, creating an intensely condensed electrode with well&#8208;maintained structural integrity.&#160;Furthermore, simultaneous in&#8208;situ nitrogen doping and hierarchical micro&#8208;meso porosity are readily realized upon post&#8208;carbonization, encouraging enhanced capacitance and fast reaction dynamics.&#160;As a result, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Thermal Expansion in Supramolecular Halogen&#8208;Bonded Mixed Cocrystals through Synthetic Feed and Dynamic Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over thermal expansion (TE) behaviors in solid materials is often accomplished by modifying the molecules or intermolecular interactions within the solid. Here, we use a mixed cocrystal approach and incorporate molecules with similar chemical structures, but distinct functionalities. Development of mixed cocrystals is at a nascent stage, and here we describe the first mixed cocrystals sustained by one&#8208;dimensional halogen bonds. Within each mixed cocrystal, the halogen&#8208;bond donor is fixed, while the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor site contains two molecules in a variable ratio. X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates isostructurality across the series, and SEM&#8208;EDS shows equal distribution of heavy atoms and similar atomic compositions across all mixed cocrystals. The acceptor molecules differ in their ability to undergo dynamic motion in the solid state. The synthetic equivalents of motion capable and incapable molecules were systematically varied to yield direct tunabililty in TE behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite&#8208;Based Heterojunction Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With fascinating photophysical properties and strong potential to utilize solar energy, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a prominent feature within photocatalysis research. However, the effectiveness of single MHP photocatalysts is relatively poor. The introduction of a second component to form a heterojunction represents a well&#8208;established route to accelerate carrier migration and boost reaction rates, thus increasing the photoactivity. Recently, there have been several scientific advances related to the design of MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, including Schottky, type&#8208;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. In this Review, we systematically discuss and critically appraise recent developments in MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysis. In addition, the techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are evaluated and we conclude by briefly outlining the ongoing challenges and future directions for promising photocatalysts based on MHP heterojunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Mediated Biosynthesis of Semiconductor Nanocrystals for Photocatalytic NAD(P)H Regeneration and Chiral Amine Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of predesigned bioengineered proteins for self&#8208;grown nanomaterials is a promising strategy that opens new scientific directions for biotic&#8208;abiotic nano&#8208;bio hybrid configurations. The unique properties of nanomaterials can alter the original biological paradigm to allow novel metabolic routes or new activation triggers. In this work, we present a synthetic methodology for self&#8208;grown cadmium sulfide quantum dots in a 12&#8208;mer bioengineered stable protein 1 under ambient conditions. The sized controlled crystalline QDs are characterized and utilized for NADPH regeneration that is in turn used for the activation of the imine reductase enzyme. The presented nano&#8208;bio hybrid system enables the production of a single enantiomeric product that is required for the pharmaceutical industry. Our designed system presents superior activity and can continuously operate for at least 22hrs with 82% conversion efficiency. The obtained results may lay the foundations for future nano&#8208;bio hybrid systems that can operate both  in vitro  and  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>BN&#8208;Anthracene for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Optoelectronic Materials through Periphery Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable synthetic accomplishments in creating diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with B&#8208;N bonds (BN&#8208;PAHs), their optoelectronic applications have been less exploited. Herein, we report the achievement of high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on existing BN&#8208;PAHs through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Tetraphenyl&#8208; and diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracenes (TPBNA and DPBNA, respectively) are designed and synthesized. DPBNA exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.3 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, significantly outperforming TPBNA and all the reported BN&#8208;PAHs. Remarkably, this is the first BN&#8208;PAH with mobility over 1 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , which is a benchmark value for practical applications as compared with amorphous silicon. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance phototransistors based on DPBNA are also demonstrated, implying the high potential of BN&#8208;PAHs for optoelectronic applications when the &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy is implemented.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas on organic synthesis and is regarded as one of the key concepts to minimize the ecologic and economic footprint of organic synthesis. The ubiquity and low reactivity of C&#8211;H bonds in organic molecules however poses several challenges, which in turn often necessitates harsh reaction conditions to achieve this goal and it is highly desirable to achieve C&#8211;H functionalization reactions under mild conditions. Recently, several reports uncovered a conceptually new approach towards C&#8211;H functionalization, where a single transition metal complex can be used as both photosensitizer and catalyst to promote C&#8211;H bond functionalization in the absence of an exogeneous photosensitizer. In this minireview, we will provide an overview on recent achievements in C&#8211;H functionalization reactions with an emphasis on the photochemical modulation of the reaction mechanism using such catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>The Orbital Origins of Chemical Bonding in Ge&#8722;Sb&#8722;Te Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncovering the peculiar chemical bonding of phase&#8208;change materials is essential to understand their unique physical properties. For the first time ever, Richard Dronskowski et&#8197;al. analyze in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115778) the wavefunctions of these rather covalent materials in terms of interacting atomic orbitals, mirroring independent analyses of their projected force constants. All these materials breaking the octet rule clearly evidence electron&#8208;rich multicenter interactions, similar yet different from the molecular case.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide Production via Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A game of two halves: Direct ammonia oxidation unlocks a pathway towards affordable and efficient production of nitrous oxide, a highly promising agent for selective oxidation reactions, but necessitates the development of suitable catalysts. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200772), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between Au nanoparticles and CeO2 support results in a material with unprecedented levels of N2O selectivity and productivity, far surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of N&#8208;Propargylamides and Their Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;controlled polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated acetylenes is a challenging subject. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117234), Tsuyoshi Taniguchi, Katsuhiro Maeda et&#8197;al. report that unique heptaaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;hexatrienylrhodium(I) complexes induce living polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated acetylenes such as N&#8208;propargylamides. This method enables controlling molecular weights of the resultant polymers and the synthesis of telechelic polymers and block copolymers based on poly(N&#8208;propargylamide)s.

         <title>Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Photothermal Immunotherapy Based on a Versatile NIR&#8208;II Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has captured extensive attention given the mutually strengthening therapeutic outcomes towards both original tumor and abscopal tumor. Herein, a versatile theranostic agent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission tendency, namely TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ, is elaborately designed and prepared by recommending benzo[c]thiophene unit as a building block, and allows to simultaneously possess fluorescence imaging (FLI) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), and thermal tumoricidal functions. Further experiments validate that TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) can not only remarkably destroy primary tumor but also enhance the immunogenicity for further suppressing the growth of tumor in the distant sites. Furthermore, PTT combining programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibody prominently prevent the metastasis and recurrence of cancer by potentiating the effect of immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Chiral Cyclic and Acyclic gem&#8208;Difluoromethylenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem  &#8208;Difluoromethylene moieties are attractive in medicinal chemistry due to their ability to mimic other more ubiquitous functional groups. Thus, effective asymmetric methods for their construction are highly desirable, especially for the industrial production of chiral drugs. Using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and  gem  &#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones, we were able to easily access chiral 1,3&#8208;dioxanes that contain a tetrasubstituted difluoroalkyl stereogenic center in cyclic and acyclic skeletons. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was developed to provide the products in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity. Strikingly, the  gem  &#8208;difluoro substitution pattern promotes the reaction, and pentafluoroethylketone, an  &#945;  ,  &#945;  &#8208;difluorinated  &#946;  &#8208;ketoester, and a  &#946;  &#8208;ketosulfone are suitable substrates for this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Transmetalation between Copper and Palladium Nanoparticle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;mediated phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu to the Pd surface affords a novel mechanism for transmetalation, enabling wavelength&#8208;tunable cross&#8208;coupling and homo&#8208;coupling reaction pathway control. C&#8208;C bond forming Sonogashira coupling and Glaser coupling reactions in O2 atmosphere are efficiently driven by visible light over heterogeneous Cu and Pd nanoparticles as a mixed catalyst without base or other additives. The reaction pathway can be controlled by switching the excitation wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (400&#8211;500 nm) give the Glaser homo&#8208;coupling diyne, whereas longer wavelength irradiation (500&#8211;940 nm) significantly increases the degree of cross&#8208;coupling Sonogashira coupling products. The ratio of the activated intermediates of alkyne to the iodobenzene is wavelength dependent and this regulates transmetalation. This wavelength&#8208;tunable reaction pathway is a novel way to optimize the product selectivity in important organic syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Zeolitic Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel zeolite&#8208;like materials with large channel windows and high stability is of importance but remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a 3D covalent organic framework with zeolitic network, namely the zeolitic organic framework (ZOF). By combining two kinds of tetrahedral building blocks with fixed or relatively free bond angles, ZOF&#8208;1 with the zeolitic  crb  net has been successfully synthesized. Its structure was determined by the single&#8208;crystal 3D electron diffraction technique. Remarkably, ZOF&#8208;1 shows high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16 &#197;), and excellent specific surface area (~ 2785 m  2  /g), which is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks. This study thus opens a new avenue to construct zeolite&#8208;like materials with pure organic frameworks and will promote their potential applications in adsorption and catalysis for macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Cyanine J&#8208;type Aggregate Nanoparticles with Enhanced Photosensitization for Mitochondria&#8208;targeting Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanines have been widely used as the photosensitizers (PSs) in biomedical field, but controlling their molecular aggregates in nanoparticles (NPs) remains a major challenge. Moreover, the impact of aggregate behaviors of cyanines on the photosensitization is still unclear. Herein, the first anionic cyanine PSs based on tricyanofuran end group have been designed by achieving supramolecular J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs via counterion engineering. Our results indicate that J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs can not only bring significantly red&#8208;shifted emission, negatively charged surface, and high photostability, but also enable a significant increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency by 5&#8208;fold compared to that in the nonaggregate state, providing strong experimental evidence for the superiority of J&#8208;aggregates in enhancing photosensitization. Thus, combined with the mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, the J&#8208;type aggregate NPs show remarkable  in vivo  antitumor phototheranostic efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Conjugation Attenuates the Quenching of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters by Photocyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we expose how the antagonistic relationship between solid&#8208;state luminescence and photocyclization of oligoaryl alkenes chromophores is modulated by the conjugation length of their alkenyl backbones. Heptaaryl cycloheptatriene molecular rotors exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics. We show that their emission is turned off upon breaking the conjugation of the cycloheptatriene by epoxide formation. While this modification is deleterious to photoluminescence, it enables formation of extended polycyclic frameworks by Mallory reactions. We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid&#8208;state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid-state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermolecular Carbosilylation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins with C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp) Bond Formation Involving Silylium&#8208;Ion Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regioselective addition of alkynylsilanes across unactivated terminal alkenes is reported. The reaction is initiated by capture of a sterically unhindered silylium ion by a silylated phenylacetylene derivative to form a bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocation. This in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated key intermediate is virtually the actual catalyst that maintains the catalytic cycle by a series of electrophilic addition reactions of silylium ions and &#946;&#8208;silicon&#8208;stabilized carbocations. The computed reaction mechanism is fully consistent with the experimental findings. This unprecedented two&#8208;component carbosilylation establishes a C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp) bond and a C(sp3)&#8211;Si bond in atom&#8208;economic fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Monooxygenation of Phenols: Evidence for a Mononuclear Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three Cu(I) salts with the very weakly coordinating anion [Al(pftb)4]&#8208; (pftb = OC(CF3)3) including the unique, linear [Cu(NEt3)2]+&#8208;cation were synthesized and examined as catalysts for the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (DTBP&#8208;H) as well as, in case of the most active catalyst, five additional different monophenols served as substrates. The activities of these Cu(I) salts towards monooxygenation of DTBP&#8208;H were compared to those of [Cu(CH3CN)4]X salts with &#8220;classic&#8221; anions ([BF4]&#8208;, [OTf]&#8208;, [PF6]&#8208;), revealing an anion effect on the activity of the catalyst and a ligand effect on the reaction rate. A drastic acceleration of the reaction rate was obtained by employing Cu(II)&#8208;semiquinone complexes as catalysts, indicating that formation of a Cu(II) complex precedes the actual catalytic cycle. This and further observations indicate that the oxygenation of monophenols in the title system does not follow a dinuclear, but a mononuclear pathway analogous to that of topaquinone cofactor biosynthesis in amine oxidase.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Sensitized by a Chromium(III) Complex via an Underexplored Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) mainly relies on precious metal complexes thanks to their high intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiencies, excited state energies, and lifetimes, while complexes of abundant first&#8208;row transition metals were only rarely utilized and with often moderate UC quantum yields. [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ (bpmp = 2,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)pyridine) containing earth&#8208;abundant chromium possesses an absorption band suitable for green light excitation, a doublet excited state energy matching the triplet energy of 9,10&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), a close to millisecond excited state lifetime, and high photostability. Combined ISC and doublet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from excited [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ to DPA gives 3DPA with close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield. TTA of 3DPA furnishes green&#8208;to&#8208;blue UC with a quantum yield of 12.0% (close to the theoretical maximum). Sterically less&#8208;hindered anthracenes undergo a [4+4] cycloaddition with [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ and green light.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Construction of Biomimetic Nanosensors for Electrochemical Monitoring of Intracellular Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile and large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalyst modified nanowires provides an innovative perspective for simple and stable construction of functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. Such nanosensors enable the sensitive and selective detection of diverse biomolecules, and for the first time achieve real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells.







Abstract
The current strategies for nanoelectrode functionalization usually involve sophisticated modification procedures, uncontrollable and unstable modifier assembly, as well as a limited variety of modifiers. To address this issue, we propose a versatile strategy for large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalysts (BMCs) modified nanowires (NWs) to construct functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. This design protocol employs an easy, controllable and stable assembly of diverse BMCs&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composites on conductive NWs. The intrinsic catalytic activity of BMCs combined with outstanding electron transfer ability of conductive polymer enables the nanosensors to sensitively and selectively detect various biomolecules. Further application of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine functionalized nanosensors achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells for the first time.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Degradable Vinylic Polymer&#8208;Based Latexes via Aqueous Radical Emulsion Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulsion copolymerization of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) with either styrene, n&#8208;butyl acrylate or a mixture of both was carried out in water using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. Stable waterborne particles of vinylic polymers (blue) bearing cleavable thioester units (red) along the chains were obtained. The polymer chains were degraded to oligomers using a strong base (1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) or isopropylamine.







Abstract
Aqueous emulsion copolymerizations of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) were performed with n&#8208;butyl acrylate (BA), styrene (S) and a combination of both. In all cases, stable latexes were obtained in less than two hours under conventional conditions; that is in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) used as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. A limited solubility of DOT in BA was observed compared to S, yielding to a more homogeneous integration of DOT units in the PS latex. In both cases, the copolymer could be easily degraded under basic conditions. Emulsion terpolymerization between DOT, BA and S allowed us to produce stable latexes not only composed of degradable chains but also featuring a broad range of glass transition temperatures.

Automated probing of temperature effects on glycosyl donor activation helped to unravel the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship. Temperature adjustments halved the amount of building block required for a model glycan synthesis.







Abstract
Glycosidic bond formation is a continual challenge for practitioners. Aiming to enhance the reproducibility and efficiency of oligosaccharide synthesis, we studied the relationship between glycosyl donor activation and reaction temperature. A novel semi&#8208;automated assay revealed diverse responses of members of a panel of thioglycosides to activation at various temperatures. The patterns of protecting groups and the thiol aglycon combine to cause remarkable differences in temperature sensitivity among glycosyl donor building blocks. We introduce the concept of donor activation temperature to capture experimental insights, reasoning that glycosylations performed below this reference temperature evade deleterious side reactions. Activation temperatures enable a simplified temperature treatment and facilitate optimization of glycosyl donor usage. Isothermal glycosylation below the activation temperature halved the equivalents of building block required in comparison to the standard &#8220;ramp&#8221; regime used in solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis to&#8208;date.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorescent Block Copolymer Micelles with Responsive Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The encapsulation of Schiff base&#8208;like zinc(II) complexes into micelles derived from polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) diblock copolymers that offer coordination sites was investigated. Incorporation and ligation results in strongly emissive micelles with enhanced quantum yields and thermal stability compared to the neat complex in pyridine. The responsivity towards medium and acidity was utilized to design a turn&#8208;on emission sensor material upon micelle formation.







Abstract
Responsive fluorescent materials offer a high potential for sensing and (bio&#8208;)imaging applications. To investigate new concepts for such materials and to broaden their applicability, the previously reported non&#8208;fluorescent zinc(II) complex [Zn(L)] that shows coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission was encapsulated into a family of non&#8208;fluorescent polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles leading to brightly emissive materials. Coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission upon incorporation and ligation of the [Zn(L)] in the P4VP core outperform parent [Zn(L)] in pyridine solution with respect to lifetimes, quantum yields, and temperature resistance. The quantum yield can be easily tuned by tailoring the selectivity of the employed solvent or solvent mixture and, thus, the tendency of the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP diblock copolymers to self&#8208;assemble into micelles. A medium&#8208;dependent off&#8211;on sensor upon micelle formation could be established by suppression of non&#8208;micelle&#8208;borne emission background pertinent to chloroform through controlled acidification indicating an additional pH&#8208;dependent process.

         <title>Multifunctional Wearable Silver Nanowire Decorated Leather Nanocomposites for Joule Heating, Electromagnetic Interference Shielding and Piezoresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with integrated capabilities of Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via a facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The resultant AgNW/leather nanocomposites show promising application potentials for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence, etc.







Abstract
Multifunctional wearable electronic devices based on natural materials are highly desirable for versatile applications of energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence. Herein, multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with hierarchical structures for integrated visual Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via the facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The AgNWs penetrate the micro&#8208;nanoporous structures in the corium side of leather constructing highly&#8208;efficient conductive networks. The resultant flexible and mechanically strong AgNW/leather nanocomposites exhibit extremely low sheet resistance of 0.8&#8197;&#937;/sq, superior visual Joule heating temperatures up to 108&#8201;&#176;C at low supplied voltage of 2.0&#8197;V due to efficient energy conversion, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of &#8776;55&#8197;dB and outstanding piezoresistive sensing ability in human motion detection. This work demonstrates the fabrication of multifunctional AgNW/leather nanocomposites for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence, etc.

         <title>A TMEDA&#8211;Iron Adduct Reaction Manifold in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Historically, the role of TMEDA in iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling has been disputed due to a lack of insight into the iron species present during catalysis. In this report, low&#8208;temperature synthesis, freeze&#8208;trapped 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical&#8208;quenched GC analysis were utilized to identify highly reactive and selective TMEDA&#8208;ligated iron species responsible for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling catalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we expand the current molecular&#8208;level understanding of one of the most important and effective additives in iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). Focusing on relevant phenyl and ethyl Grignard reagents and slow nucleophile addition protocols commonly used in effective catalytic systems, TMEDA&#8208;iron(II)&#8208;aryl intermediates are identified via in situ spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and detailed reaction studies to be a part of an iron(II)/(III)/(I) reaction cycle where radical recombination with FePhBr(TMEDA) (2Ph) results in selective product formation in high yield. These results differ from prior studies with mesityl Grignard reagent, where poor product selectivity and low catalytic performance can be attributed to homoleptic iron&#8211;ate species. Overall, this study represents a critical advance in how amine additives such as TMEDA can modulate selectivity and reactivity of organoiron species in cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Logical Analysis of Multiple Single&#8208;Nucleotide&#8208;Polymorphisms with Programmable DNA Molecular Computation for Clinical Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general DNA computational strategy for automatically correlating detected single nucleotide mutation (including insertions, deletions and SNPs) based information to phenotypic outcomes by integration of multiplexed sensing and logical analysis is reported.







Abstract
Analyzing complex single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) combinations in the genome is important for research and clinical applications, given that different SNP combinations can generate different phenotypic consequences. Recent works have shown that DNA&#8208;based molecular computing is powerful for simultaneously sensing and analyzing complex molecular information. Here, we designed a switching circuit&#8208;based DNA computational scheme that can integrate the sensing of multiple SNPs and simultaneously perform logical analysis of the detected SNP information to directly report clinical outcomes. As a demonstration, we successfully achieved automatic and accurate identification of 21 different blood group genotypes from 83 clinical blood samples with 100&#8201;% accuracy compared to sequencing data in a more rapid manner (3&#8197;hours). Our method enables a new mode of automatic and logical sensing and analyzing subtle molecular information for clinical diagnosis, as well as guiding personalized medication.

         <title>Encoding Enantiomeric Molecular Chiralities on Graphene Basal Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral graphene is directly prepared by transferring the chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto the graphene basal plane through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction followed by thermal fusion. The chiral graphene is characterized using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy as well as spectroscopic techniques and demonstrated to be useful as electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition.







Abstract
Graphene has demonstrated broad applications due to its prominent properties. Its molecular structure makes graphene achiral. Here, we propose a direct way to prepare chiral graphene by transferring chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto graphene basal plane through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction followed by thermal fusion. Using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy, we estimated an areal coverage of the molecular imprints (chiral regions) up to 64&#8201;% on the basal plane of graphene (grown by chemical vapor deposition). The high concentration of molecular imprints in their single layer points to a close packing of the deposited amino acid molecules prior to &#8220;thermal fusion&#8221;. Such &#8220;molecular chirality&#8208;encoded graphene&#8221; was tested as an electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition. The chirality&#8208;encoded graphene might find use for other chirality&#8208;related studies and the encoding procedure might be extended to other two&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Drastic Events and Gradual Change Define the Structure of an Active Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Alumina Catalyst for Methanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the high performance of the extensively used copper&#8208;zinc&#8208;alumina (CZA) catalyst for methanol synthesis is still unknown. How the catalyst is treated before use strongly determines its ultimate performance. Here, using combined operando X&#8208;ray methods the evolution of the industrial CZA catalysts is followed and key events that define the final structure are identified.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;zinc&#8208;alumina (CZA) catalyst is one of the most important catalysts. Nevertheless, understanding of the complex CZA structure is still limited and hampers further optimization. Critical to the production of a highly active and stable catalyst are optimal start&#8208;up procedures in hydrogen. Here, by employing operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, we follow how the industrial CZA precursor evolves into the working catalyst. Two major events in the activation drastically alter the copper&#8208; and zinc&#8208;containing components in the CZA catalyst and define the final working catalyst structure: the reduction of the starting copper(II) oxide, and the ripening and re&#8208;oxidation of zinc oxide upon the switch to catalytic conditions. These drastic events are also accompanied by other gradual, structural changes. Understanding what happens during these events is key to develop tailored start&#8208;up protocols that are aimed at maximal longevity and activity of the catalysts.

         <title>Macrocyclic Polyoxometalates: Selective Polyanion Binding and Ultrahigh Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion templation using polyoxometalates can be a very effective approach to construct large macrocycles that have unique solid&#8208;state and solution properties. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle selectively binds the Preyssler polyanion in solution. It forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8211;guest complex that shows ultrahigh solid&#8208;state proton conductivities (1.7&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 368&#8197;K and 90&#8201;% RH) thanks to the presence of an extended hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
The rational development of an anion templation strategy for the construction of macrocycles has been historically limited to small anions, but large polyoxoanions can offer unmatched structural diversity and ample binding sites. Here we report the formation of a {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle by using the Preyssler anion, [NaP5W30O110]14&#8722; ({P5W30}), as a supramolecular template. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle displays selective anion binding behavior in solution. In the solid state, the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8211;guest complex, {P5W30}2&#8834;{Mo22Fe8}, transports protons more effectively, through an extended hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, than a related 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex where the guest is completely encapsulated. The results highlight the great potential this anion templation approach has in producing macrocyclic systems for selective anion recognition and proton conduction purposes.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework (COF) Derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Unraveling Fundamental Kinetic and Structural Parameters of the Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) is an efficient catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO, yet methods to evaluate the number of active Ni sites on the surface and turnover frequency remained elusive. Herein, a set of COF&#8208;derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C candidates is synthesized and a comprehensive analysis is undertaken to quantify the active Ni sites, addressing the relation between synthesis parameters, apparent reactivity, active site density, and turnover frequency.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a potential approach to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals using electricity as feedstock. Abundant and affordable catalyst materials are needed to upscale this process in a sustainable manner. Nickel&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) is an efficient catalyst for CO2 reduction to CO, and the single&#8208;site Ni&#8722;Nx motif is believed to be the active site. However, critical metrics for its catalytic activity, such as active site density and intrinsic turnover frequency, so far lack systematic discussion. In this work, we prepared a set of covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, for which the Ni&#8722;Nx content could be adjusted by the pyrolysis temperature. The combination of high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure evidenced the presence of Ni single&#8208;sites, and quantitative X&#8208;ray photoemission addressed the relation between active site density and turnover frequency.

         <title>Crystallization&#8208;Driven Controlled Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Assemblies from Chromophore&#8208;Appended Poly(L&#8208;lactide)s: Highly Efficient Energy Transfer on a 2D Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of poly(L&#8208;lactides) (PLLAs) end&#8208;capped with distinct dipolar chromophores enable their controlled two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies with programmed shape, size and emission. Co&#8208;crystallization and sequential &#8220;living&#8221; CDSA between donor&#8208; and acceptor&#8208;dye&#8208;capped PLLAs yielded diamond&#8208;shaped co&#8208;platelets and segmented block co&#8208;platelets with efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer on the 2D surface.







Abstract
A rational approach towards precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of poly(L&#8208;lactides) (PLLAs), end&#8208;capped with dipolar dyes like merocyanine (MC) or naphthalene monoimide (NMI) and hydrophobic pyrene (PY) or benzene (Bn) is described.

     alt="Crystallization-Driven Controlled Two-Dimensional (2D) Assemblies from Chromophore-Appended Poly(L-lactide)s: Highly Efficient Energy Transfer on a 2D Surface"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) of poly(L-lactides) (PLLAs) end-capped with distinct dipolar chromophores enable their controlled two-dimensional (2D) assemblies with programmed shape, size and emission. Co-crystallization and sequential &#8220;living&#8221; CDSA between donor- and acceptor-dye-capped PLLAs yielded diamond-shaped co-platelets and segmented block co-platelets with efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer on the 2D surface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rational approach towards precision two-dimensional (2D) assemblies by crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) of poly(L-lactides) (PLLAs), end-capped with dipolar dyes like merocyanine (MC) or naphthalene monoimide (NMI) and hydrophobic pyrene (PY) or benzene (Bn) is described. PLLA chains crystallize into diamond-shaped platelets in isopropanol, which forces the terminal dyes to assemble into a 2D array on the platelet surface by either dipolar interactions or &#960;-stacking and exhibit tunable emission. Dipolar dyes play a critical role in imparting colloidal stability and structural uniformity to the 2D crystals, which is partly compromised for hydrophobic ones. Co-crystallization between NMI- and PY-labeled PLLAs yields similar diamond-shaped co-platelets with highly efficient (&#8776;80&#8201;%) F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer on the 2D surface. Further, the &#8220;living&#8221; CDSA method confers enlarged, segmented block co-platelets using one of the homopolymers as &#8220;seed&#8221; and the other as &#8220;unimer&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks via a Polycondensation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 3D crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were synthesized by a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach by using Td symmetrical tetrahedral amidine hydrochloride and aldehyde. The 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and have moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%), and excellent thermal and chemical stability.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is still considered as a great challenge due to the less reversible covalent bonds of triazine linkages. The research studies of crystalline CTFs to date have been limited to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystalline CTFs have never been reported before. Herein we report the design and synthesis of two 3D crystalline CTFs, termed 3D CTF&#8208;TPM and 3D CTF&#8208;TPA through a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach. The targeted 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and show moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%). Moreover, these 3D CTFs exhibit ultrastability in the presence of boiling water, strong acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (1&#8197;M NaOH). This contribution represents the first report of 3D crystalline CTFs, which not only extends their structural diversity but also offers a synthetic strategy and structural basis for expanding practical applications of CTF materials.

         <title>A Metallofullertube of Ce2@C100 with a Carbon Nanotube Segment: Synthesis, Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps was synthesized and characterized. Notably, Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 shows high single&#8208;molecule conductivity and unique supramolecular assembly.







Abstract
Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end&#8208;capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100, which has a tubular C100 cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and spherical Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80, their structure&#8211;property relationship has been compared by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single&#8208;molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 was up to eight times larger than that of Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80. Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and a [12]CPP nanohoop was investigated, and theoretical calculations revealed that metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 adopted a &#8220;standing&#8221; configuration in the cavity of [12]CPP. These results demonstrate the special nature of this kind of metallofullertube.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalyst: Marked ORR Activity in Acidic Media without the Contribution from Metal Sites?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;doped hollow and hierarchically porous carbon nanocage catalyst having a noncovalently bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich layered heterostructure exhibits excellent ORR performance in both alkaline and acidic media without significant contributions by negligble amounts of Fe (0&#8211;0.08&#8197;wt.%) owing to the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer and accelerated electron/mass transfer in the hierarchically porous structure.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be the most promising substitutes for benchmark Pt/C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report that N&#8208;doped carbon materials with trace amounts of iron (0&#8211;0.08&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) show excellent ORR activity and durability comparable and even superior to those of Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic media without significant contribution by the metal sites. Such an N&#8208;doped carbon (denoted as N&#8208;HPCs) features a hollow and hierarchically porous architecture, and more importantly, a noncovalently bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich heterostructure providing the active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation owing to the efficient electron transfer between the layers. The primary Zn&#8208;air battery using N&#8208;HPCs as the cathode delivers a much higher power density of 158&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the maximum power density in the H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell reaches 486&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is comparable to and even better than those using conventional Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts at cathodes.

         <title>Structural Basis for Chaperone&#8208;Independent Ubiquitination of Tau Protein by Its E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based structural investigation of the Tau&#8211;CHIP complex revealed a multi&#8208;domain, dynamic interaction that explains the origin of the multiple&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau operated by CHIP, as well as the ability of this ligase to modify Tau in the absence of chaperones.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau protein found in Alzheimer's disease filaments hints at the failed attempt of neurons to remove early toxic species. The ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of Tau is regulated in vivo by the E3 ligase CHIP, a quality controller of the cell proteome dedicated to target misfolded proteins for degradation. In our study, by using site&#8208;resolved NMR, biochemical and computational methods, we elucidate the structural determinants underlying the molecular recognition between the ligase and its intrinsically disordered substrate. We reveal a multi&#8208;domain dynamic interaction that explains how CHIP can direct ubiquitination of Tau at multiple sites even in the absence of chaperones, including its typical partner Hsp70/Hsc70. Our findings thus provide mechanistic insight into the chaperone&#8208;independent engagement of a disordered protein by its E3 ligase.

&lt;p&gt;An NMR-based structural investigation of the Tau&#8211;CHIP complex revealed a multi-domain, dynamic interaction that explains the origin of the multiple-site ubiquitination of Tau operated by CHIP, as well as the ability of this ligase to modify Tau in the absence of chaperones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi-site ubiquitination of Tau protein found in Alzheimer's disease filaments hints at the failed attempt of neurons to remove early toxic species. The ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Tau is regulated in vivo by the E3 ligase CHIP, a quality controller of the cell proteome dedicated to target misfolded proteins for degradation. In our study, by using site-resolved NMR, biochemical and computational methods, we elucidate the structural determinants underlying the molecular recognition between the ligase and its intrinsically disordered substrate. We reveal a multi-domain dynamic interaction that explains how CHIP can direct ubiquitination of Tau at multiple sites even in the absence of chaperones, including its typical partner Hsp70/Hsc70. Our findings thus provide mechanistic insight into the chaperone-independent engagement of a disordered protein by its E3 ligase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Targeted Delivery of an Immune Stimulant that Selectively Reactivates Exhausted CAR T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chronic exposure of CAR T cells to tumor antigens can lead to CAR T cell exhaustion and tumor expansion. To reverse this exhaustion, we have developed two orthogonal strategies to target a potent TLR7 agonist specifically to exhausted CAR T cells. We demonstrate here that both strategies rejuvenate exhausted CAR T cells, leading to dramatic reduction in T cell exhaustion markers (PD&#8208;1+Tim&#8208;3+) and shrinkage of CAR T cell resistant tumors.







Abstract
Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have demonstrated significant promise in suppressing hematopoietic cancers, their applications in treating solid tumors have been limited by onset of CAR T cell exhaustion that accompanies continuous CAR T cell exposure to tumor antigen. To address this limitation, we have exploited the abilities of recently designed universal CARs to bind fluorescein and internalize a fluorescein&#8208;TLR7 agonist conjugate by CAR&#8208;mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate here that anti&#8208;fluorescein CAR&#8208;mediated uptake of a fluorescein&#8208;TLR7&#8208;3 conjugate can reactivate exhausted CAR T cells, leading to dramatic reduction in T cell exhaustion markers (PD&#8208;1+Tim&#8208;3+) and shrinkage of otherwise resistant tumors without inducing systemic activation of the immune system. We conclude that CAR T cell exhaustion can be reversed by administration of a CAR&#8208;targeted TLR7 agonist, thereby enabling the CAR T cells to successfully treat solid tumors without incurring the systemic toxicity that commonly accompanies administration of nontargeted TLR7 agonists.

         <title>Control of Hot Carrier Relaxation in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Using Damping Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model for the damping of the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling in all&#8208;inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) was proposed by considering the mechanical resistance of the ligands. Correspondingly the hot carrier cooling process was slowed down by 3&#8208;fold in CsPbBr3 PeNCs by tuning the rigidity of the layer of organic capping ligands.







Abstract
In photon&#8208;conversion processes, rapid cooling of photo&#8208;induced hot carriers is a dominant energy loss channel. We herein report a 3&#8208;fold reduced hot carrier cooling rate in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals capped with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane shell in comparison to single alkyl&#8208;chain oleylamine ligands. Relaxation of hot charge carriers depends on the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling (CPC) process as an important channel to dissipate energies in nanostructured perovskite materials. The CPC strengths in the two samples were measured through cryogenic photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements. The effect of organic ligands on the CPC in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is elucidated based on a damped oscillation model. This supplements the conventional polaron&#8208;based CPC model, by involving a damping effect on the CPC from the resistance of the ligands against nanocrystal lattice vibrations. The model also accounts for the observed linear temperature&#8208;dependence of the CPC strength. Our work enables predictions about the effect of the ligands on the performance of perovskite nanocrystals in future applications.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Tuned Molecular Packing Allows Concurrently Boosted Photoacoustic Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process to enhance the NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of an organic semiconducting nanoparticle concurrently by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times, respectively, is described by tuning the molecular packing in the aggregated state of NPs, which provides a new strategy to develop multi&#8208;modal phototheranostic materials for more capable clinical applications.







Abstract
It is generally considered that photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) cannot be enhanced concurrently, as they are dependent on competitive photophysical processes at the single&#8208;molecule level. Herein, we reveal that BDTR9&#8208;OC8 and BDTR9&#8208;C8, which have identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones but are substituted by side chains of different rigidity, show distinct phototheranostic properties in the aggregated state. The NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of BDTR9&#8208;C8 nanoparticles are enhanced by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times compared with BDTR9&#8208;OC8 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations and GIWAXS analysis revealed that BDTR9&#8208;C8 with rigid side chains shows a relative amorphous condensed state, which will benefit the efficient transportation of photo&#8208;generated excitons and phonons, subsequently enhancing the FLI and PAI signals. Besides, both nanoparticles exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency due to their strong light&#8208;harvesting capability and are considered effective photothermal therapy materials. This work provides an illuminating strategy for material design in the future.

         <title>Protein Ligation and Labeling Enabled by a C&#8208;Terminal Tetracysteine Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy, based on the regioselective S&#8208;cyanylation and hydrazinolysis at a C&#8208;terminal tetracysteine fusion tag, affording the expressed protein &#945;&#8208;hydrazides is reported. It overcomes some of the major limitations of present expressed protein ligation techniques, and thus significantly complements the chemical protein synthesis toolbox.







Abstract
The hydrazinolysis of S&#8208;cyanylated peptide provides an alternative way to afford protein &#945;&#8208;hydrazide, a key reagent used in native chemical ligation (NCL), without the aid of any inteins or enzymes. The currently used non&#8208;selective S&#8208;cyanylation, however, allows no other cysteine in the protein besides the one at the cleavage site. Herein, we report a regioselective S&#8208;cyanylation and hydrazinolysis strategy achieved via the fusion of a tetracysteine tag to the C&#8208;terminal of the protein of interest. We term it tetracysteine enabled protein ligation (TCEPL). While highly selective, the strategy is applicable for proteins expressed as inclusion bodies, and this was showcased by the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of an iron&#8208;sulfur protein rubredoxin and the catalytic and hinge domains of matrix metalloprotease&#8208;14 (MMP&#8208;14) containing 207&#8197;amino acid residues. Furthermore, the TCEPL strategy was exploited for protein C&#8208;terminal labeling with amino reagents bearing a variety of functional groups, demonstrating its versatility and generality.

         <title>Interfacial Manganese&#8208;Doping in CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets by Employing a Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>

An immiscible bi&#8208;phasic post&#8208;synthetic strategy for MnX2 (X=Br, Cl) doping in CsPbX3 perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is reported. The shuttle role of the electron&#8208;donor oleylamine at the water&#8211;hexane interface is the underlying reason for the MnX2 transport from the polar to nonpolar phase and its delivery to the NPls. Moreover, the halide anion plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn2+ for the perovskite crystal structure.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;doping in cesium lead halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is of particular importance where strong quantum confinement plays a significant role towards the exciton&#8211;dopant coupling. In this work, we report an immiscible bi&#8208;phasic strategy for post&#8208;synthetic Mn&#8208;doping of CsPbX3 (X=Br, Cl) NPls. A systematic study shows that electron&#8208;donating oleylamine acts as a shuttle ligand to transport MnX2 through the water&#8211;hexane interface and deliver it to the NPls. The halide anion also plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn2+ and thus fulfilling the octahedral factor required for the formation of perovskite crystals. By varying the thickness of parent NPls, we can tune the dopant incorporation and, consequently, the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process in doped NPls. Time&#8208;resolved optical measurements offer a detailed insight into the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process. This new approach for post&#8208;synthetic cation doping paves a way towards exploring the cation exchange process in several other halide perovskites at the polar&#8211;nonpolar interface.

         <title>Mechanism of Spatial and Temporal Control in Precision Cyclic Vinyl Polymer Synthesis by Lewis Pair Polymerization</title>

Spatiotemporal control in cyclic polymer synthesis: Lewis pair polymerization controls where and when cyclization takes place to afford precision cyclic vinyl homo and block copolymers.







Abstract
In typical cyclic polymer synthesis via ring&#8208;closure, chain growth and cyclization events are competing with each other, thus affording cyclic polymers with uncontrolled molecular weight or ring size and high dispersity. Here we uncover a mechanism by which Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) operates on polar vinyl monomers that allows the control of where and when cyclization takes place, thereby achieving spatial and temporal control to afford precision cyclic vinyl polymers or block copolymers with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity (&#8776;1.03). A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that cyclization occurs only after all monomers have been consumed (when) via conjugate addition of the propagating chain end to the specific site of the initiating chain end (where), allowing the cyclic polymer formation steps to be regulated and executed with precision in space and time.

         <title>A Nuclear&#8208;Targeted AIE Photosensitizer for Enzyme Inhibition and Photosensitization in Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with AIE characteristics was developed. MeTPAE can not only interact with HDACs to inhibit cell proliferation, but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment. The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent photodynamic therapy (PDT) anti&#8208;tumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.







Abstract
The nucleus is considered the ideal target for anti&#8208;tumor therapy because DNA and some enzymes in the nucleus are the main causes of cell canceration and malignant proliferation. However, nuclear target drugs with good biosafety and high efficiency in cancer treatment are rare. Herein, a nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics was developed based on a triphenylamine structure skeleton. MeTPAE can not only interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to inhibit cell proliferation but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment (PDT). The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent PDT anti&#8208;tumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclophenacene&#8208; and Chiral&#8208;Type Cyclophenylene&#8208;Naphthylene Belts</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a [20]cyclophenacene&#8208;type cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene (CPN) belt and the enantioselective synthesis of chiral&#8208;type CPN belts have been achieved by the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of naphthalene&#8208;embedded cyclic polyynes. However, the synthesis of a depth&#8208;expanded CPN belt was unsuccessful. Theoretical calculations clarified that the reactivity depends on the stability of the transition state which is subject to ring strain.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a [20]cyclophenacene&#8208;type cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene (CPN) belt and the enantioselective synthesis of chiral&#8208;type CPN belts (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) by the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of naphthalene&#8208;embedded cyclic polyynes. The synthesis of a depth&#8208;expanded CPN belt was also attempted, but the final intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition was unsuccessful. Theoretical calculations clarified that the reactivity depends on the stability of the transition state in the initial oxidative cycloaddition step which is subject to molecular strain. The cylindrical structures of these CPN belts were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. As a result of &#960;&#8208;extension through the introduction of naphthalenes in the chiral&#8208;type CPN belts, the anisotropy dissymmetry factors of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence are amplified compared with the corresponding zigzag&#8208;type chiral cyclophenylene belts.

         <title>Advancing the Development of Recyclable Aromatic Polyesters by Functionalization and Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploitation of epoxides as building blocks enabled the preparation of a series of recyclable aromatic polyesters with functionalizable moieties, which has driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access of value&#8208;added materials. Stereocomplexed polymers were formed with enhanced thermal stability and crystallinity, and random copolymers displayed polyolefin&#8208;like mechanical performance.







Abstract
The development of innovative synthetic polymer systems to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. In this contribution, we prepared a class of aromatic cyclic esters (M1&#8211;M5) from thiosalicylic acid and epoxides by facile one&#8208;pot synthesis. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of Ms afforded aromatic polyesters P(M)s with high molecular weights and narrow dispersities. The physical and mechanical properties of P(M)s can be modulated by stereocomplexation and regulation of the side&#8208;chain flexibility of the polymers, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance properties such as high thermal stability and crystallinity (Tm up to 209&#8201;&#176;C), as well as polyolefin&#8208;like high mechanical strength, ductility, and toughness. Furthermore, the functionalizable moieties of P(M)s have driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access to value&#8208;added materials. More importantly, the P(M)s were able to selectively depolymerize into monomers in excellent yields, thus establishing its circular life cycle.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Coal&#8208;Bed Methane Purification with Record CH4/N2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>

A family of nickel&#8208;based coordination networks with different pore environments was synthesized. These porous materials could be used for coal&#8208;bed methane purification with exceptional separation performance.







Abstract
The enrichment and purification of coal&#8208;bed methane provides a source of energy and helps offset global warming. In this work, we demonstrate a strategy involving the regulation of the pore size and pore chemistry to promote the separation of CH4/N2 mixtures in four nickel&#8208;based coordination networks, named Ni(ina)2, Ni(3&#8208;ain)2, Ni(2&#8208;ain)2, and Ni(pba)2, (where ina=isonicotinic acid, 3&#8208;ain=3&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, 2&#8208;ain=2&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, and pba=4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzoic acid). Among them, Ni(ina)2 and Ni(3&#8208;ain)2 can effectively separate CH4 from N2 with top&#8208;performing performance because of the suitable pore size (&#8776;0.6 and 0.5&#8197;nm) and pore environment. Explicitly, Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest ever reported CH4/N2 selectivity of 15.8 and excellent CH4 uptake (40.8&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) at ambient conditions, thus setting new benchmarks for all reported MOFs and traditional adsorbents. The exceptional CH4/N2 separation performance of Ni(ina)2 is confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Under different CH4/N2 ratios, Ni(ina)2 selectively extracts methane from the gaseous blend and produces a high purity of CH4 (99&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations and CH4&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal structure analysis provide critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. Ni(ina)2 and Ni(3&#8208;ain)2 can form rich intermolecular interactions with methane, indicating a strong adsorption affinity between pore walls and CH4 molecules. Importantly, Ni(ina)2 has good thermal and moisture stability and can easily be scaled up at a low cost ($25 per kilogram), which will be valuable for potential industrial applications. Overall, this work provides a powerful approach for the selective adsorption of CH4 from coal&#8208;bed methane.

         <title>Light&#8208;Powered Ion Pumping in a Cation&#8208;Selective Conducting Polymer Membrane</title>

         <dc:description>
An electrochemically fabricated conducting polymer membrane composed of polystyrene sulfonate anion doped polypyrrole matrices exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport. The asymmetric visible irradiation drove the cationic transport against a concentration gradient attributed to the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field, demonstrating an ion&#8208;pumping effect.







Abstract
The simulation of the ion pumping against a proton gradient energized by light in photosynthesis is of significant importance for the energy conversion in a non&#8208;biological environment. Herein, we report light&#8208;powered ion pumping in a polystyrene sulfonate anion (PSS) doped polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer membrane (PSS&#8208;PPy) with a symmetric geometry. This PSS&#8208;PPy conducting polymer membrane exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport attributed to the negatively charged PSS groups. An asymmetric visible irradiation on one side of the PSS&#8208;PPy membrane induces a built&#8208;in electric field across the membrane due to the intrinsic photoelectronic property of PPy, which drives the cationic transport against the concentration gradient, demonstrating an ion&#8208;pumping effect. This work is a prototype that uses a geometry&#8208;symmetric conducting polymer membrane as a light&#8208;powered artificial ion pump for active ion transport, which exhibits potential applications in nanofluidic energy conversion.

         <title>Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Acylation of Amides and Cascade Cyclization via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides was developed, and also combined with a cascade cyclization. Over 120 functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic investigations shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under environmentally benign catalytic conditions remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an organocatalytic remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides and cascade cyclization through a radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene as the catalyst. Notably, a diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates, including simple linear aliphatic carbamates and ortho&#8208;alkyl benzamides, can be successfully applied to this organocatalytic system. With the established protocol, over 120 examples of functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were easily synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. The robustness and generality of the organocatalytic strategy were further highlighted by the successful acylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules. Then, the asymmetric control of the radical reaction was attempted and proven feasible by using a newly designed chiral thiazolium catalyst, and moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at the current stage. Preliminary mechanistic investigations including several control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

         <title>Switchable Polymerization Organocatalysis: From Monomer Mixtures to Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled block polymers from the monomer mixture comprising O&#8208;carboxyanhydride (OCA) and epoxide has been realized using a Lewis&#8208;pair organocatalyst. The experimental and computational results highlighted the pivotal roles played by the high polymerizability of the OCA monomer for guaranteeing the exquisite sequence selectivity and the synergistic decarboxylation for facilitating the smooth transformation of the chain end from carbonate to alkoxide during the switching period.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot production of sequence&#8208;controlled block copolymer from mixed monomers is a crucial but rarely reached goal. Using a switchable Lewis&#8208;pair organocatalyst, we have accomplished sequence&#8208;selective polymerization from a mixture of O&#8208;carboxyanhydride (OCA) and epoxide. Polymerization of the OCA monomer occurs first and exclusively because of its exceedingly high polymerizability. When OCA is fully consumed, alternating copolymerization of epoxide and CO2 liberated in OCA polymerization is triggered from the termini of the first block. The two polymerizations thus occur in tandem, both in chemoselective fashion, so that a sequence&#8208;controlled block polymer with up to 99&#8201;% CO2 conversion is furnished in this one&#8208;pot protocol. Calculations and experimental results demonstrate a chemoselective and cooperative mechanism, where the high polymerizability of the OCA monomers guarantees exquisite sequence selectivity and the cooperative decarboxylation partly arose from the stabilization effect by triethylborane, which facilitates the smooth transformation of the chain end from carbonate to alkoxide.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Promoted Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Aliphatic Ketoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and efficient nickel&#8211;phosphine complex has been discovered for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic ketoacids. A proton promoted the activation of C=O bonds and controlled the stereoselectivity through hydrogen bonds to obtain the corresponding products in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A robust and highly active homogeneous chiral nickel&#8211;phosphine complex for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;ketoacids has been discovered. The hydrogenation could proceed smoothly in the presence of 0.0133&#8197;mol% catalyst loading (S/C=7500). The coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of Ni(OTf)2 with (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE were explored by 1H NMR and HRMS. The mechanistic studies revealed that a proton promoted the activation of the substrate C=O bond and controlled the stereoselectivity through hydrogen bonds. A series of chiral &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;alkyl substituted lactones were obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, this catalytic system also demonstrated that levulinic acid produced from a biomass feedstock was converted into chiral &#947;&#8208;valerolactone without loss of ee value.

         <title>Local Symmetry Breaking Suppresses Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The globally rock&#8208;salt material AgSbSe2 is found to be locally distorted due to the off&#8208;centering of Sb atoms driven by a stereochemically active 5s2 lone pair of electrons. This local off&#8208;centering plays an important role in suppressing the thermal propagation, resulting in ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in AgSbSe2.







Abstract
Understanding the correlations of both the local and global structures with lattice dynamics is critical for achieving low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) in crystalline materials. Herein, we demonstrate local cationic off&#8208;centring within the global rock&#8208;salt structure of AgSbSe2 by using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis and unravel the origin of its ultralow &#954;lat&#8776;0.4&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The cations are locally off&#8208;centered along the crystallographic 
 direction by about &#8776;0.2&#8197;&#197;, which averages out as the rock&#8208;salt structure on the global scale. Phonon dispersion obtained by density functional theory (DFT) shows weak instabilities that cause local off&#8208;centering distortions within an anharmonic double&#8208;well potential. The local structural distortion arises from the stereochemically active 5s2 lone pairs of Sb. Our findings open an avenue for understanding how the local structure influences the phonon transport and facilitates the design of next&#8208;generation crystalline materials with tailored thermal properties.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ON&#8208;OFF Switchable Hydrogenation Using a Molecular Shuttle Based on a [2]Rotaxane with a Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand has been applied to the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides. The hydrogenation can be switched ON/OFF efficiently by adjusting the movement of the rotaxane wheels with acid/base. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the formation of inactive RhIII&#8208;hydride species might be the reason for shutdown of the reaction.







Abstract
A novel pH&#8208;responsive molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand has been designed and synthesized. In the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides, ON/OFF&#8208;switchable catalysis was accomplished with high ON/OFF ratios by adjusting the movements of the rotaxane wheels located at the catalyst terminals with acid/base. Mechanistic studies using NMR spectroscopy and quasi in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that RhIII&#8208;hydride species are possibly formed in a H2 atmosphere when the catalyst is in the OFF state. During the reaction, a heterolytic activation of dihydrogen occurs by the interlocked rotaxane dibenzylamine and RhI catalytic center acting as a frustrated Lewis pair. Subsequent homolytic splitting of dihydrogen with the newly formed RhI&#8208;hydride species generates RhIII&#8208;hydride species. These findings show that a substrate&#8208;selective hydrogenation can be achieved by using the OFF&#8208;state catalyst.

         <title>Pure Boric Acid Does Not Show Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For over 100&#8197;years, boric acid (BA) has been known to serve as an excellent glass matrix for luminescent chromophores. However, in contrast to a recent report, pure BA does NOT display RTP when excited at 280&#8197;nm, and it is demonstrated experimentally that it does not absorb at &#955;&gt;200&#8197;nm. Theoretical studies further reveal that pure BA cannot absorb at &#955;&gt;175&#8197;nm. Thus, an impurity must be responsible for the apparent RTP in the previous report.







Abstract
Boric acid (BA) has been used as a transparent glass matrix for optical materials for over 100&#8197;years. However, recently, apparent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from BA (crystalline and powder states) was reported (Zheng et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9500) when irradiated at 280&#8197;nm under ambient conditions. We suspected that RTP from their BA sample was induced by an unidentified impurity. Our experimental results show that pure BA synthesized from B(OMe)3 does not luminesce in the solid state when irradiated at 250&#8211;400&#8197;nm, while commercial BA indeed (faintly) luminesces. Our theoretical calculations show that neither individual BA molecules nor aggregates would absorb light at &gt;175&#8197;nm, and we observe no absorption of solid pure BA experimentally at &gt;200&#8197;nm. Therefore, it is not possible for pure BA to be excited at &gt;250&#8197;nm even in the solid state. Thus, pure BA does not display RTP, whereas trace impurities can induce RTP.

An NHC&#8208;organocatalyzed remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides is developed based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer strategy. As reported in the Research Article by Jun&#8208;Long Li et&#8197;al. (e202116629), over 120 functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones were synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. Mechanistic investigations, including control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies, shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

A naphthalene&#8208;embedded conjugated nanobelt is an excellent design for achieving the synthesis of cyclophenacene&#8208;type and chiral&#8208;type carbon nanobelts. A cationic rhodium complex catalyst is a powerful tool for the (asymmetric) synthesis of these analogues, as reported by Ken Tanaka and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202200800). In the picture, the three blue belts in the foreground and the rhodium complex in the back represent the cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene belts and the key catalyst, respectively.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Based Functional Materials: Important Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses recent developments in the basic knowledge, mechanisms, and CO2 utilization strategies regarding the use of functional materials based on covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse active sites as catalysts. Insight is provided into the challenges and prospects of COF&#8208;based catalysts for the design of the next&#8208;generation photo&#8208;/electrocatalysts for the utilization of CO2.







Abstract
As hot topics in the chemical conversion of CO2, the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and use of CO2 as a supporter for energy storage have shown great potential for the utilization of CO2. However, many obstacles still exist on the road to realizing highly efficient chemical CO2 conversion, such as inefficient uptake/activation of CO2 and mass transport in catalysts. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a kind of porous material, have been widely explored as catalysts for the chemical conversion of CO2 owing to their unique features. In particular, COF&#8208;based functional materials containing diverse active sites (such as single metal sites, metal nanoparticles, and metal oxides) offer great potential for realizing CO2 conversion and energy storage. This Minireview discusses recent breakthroughs in the basic knowledge, mechanisms, and pathways of chemical CO2 conversion strategies that use COF&#8208;based functional catalysts. In addition, the challenges and prospects of COF&#8208;based functional catalysts for the efficient utilization of CO2 are also introduced.

In particular, COF-based functional materials containing diverse active sites (such as single metal sites, metal nanoparticles, and metal oxides) offer great potential for realizing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and energy storage. This Minireview discusses recent breakthroughs in the basic knowledge, mechanisms, and pathways of chemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion strategies that use COF-based functional catalysts. In addition, the challenges and prospects of COF-based functional catalysts for the efficient utilization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are also introduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Semisynthesis of Lipidated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipidation is a co&#8208; and post&#8208;translational modification that is known to influence the structure, function, and localization of peptides and proteins. This Review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of modern synthetic and semisynthetic methods for the generation of homogeneously lipidated proteins that have underpinned the study of the effects of lipid modifications on protein structure and function with unprecedented precision.







Abstract
Lipidation is a ubiquitous modification of peptides and proteins that can occur either co&#8208; or post&#8208;translationally. An array of different lipid classes can adorn proteins and has been shown to influence a number of crucial biological activities, including the regulation of signaling, cell&#8211;cell adhesion events, and the anchoring of proteins to lipid rafts and phospholipid membranes. Whereas nature employs a range of enzymes to install lipid modifications onto proteins, the use of these for the chemoenzymatic generation of lipidated proteins is often inefficient or impractical. An alternative is to harness the power of modern synthetic and semisynthetic technologies to access lipid&#8208;modified proteins in a pure and homogeneously modified form. This Review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of lipidation and ligation chemistry and their implementation in the synthesis and semisynthesis of homogeneous lipidated proteins that have enabled the influence of these modifications on protein structure and function to be uncovered.

         <title>Green Carbon Science: Efficient Carbon Resource Processing, Utilization, and Recycling towards Carbon Neutrality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient utilization and recycling of carbon resources, which contain mainly the elements C, H, and O, is an effective way to minimize CO2 emission. In this Minireview, green carbon science is discussed in combination with related fields, including petroleum refining and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials from coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics.







Abstract
Green carbon science is defined as the &#8220;study and optimization of the transformation of carbon&#8208;containing compounds and the relevant processes involved in the entire carbon cycle from carbon resource processing, carbon energy utilization, CO2 fixation, and carbon recycling to utilize carbon resources efficiently and minimize the net CO2 emission.&#8221;[1] Green carbon science is related closely to carbon neutrality, and relevant fields have developed quickly in the last decade. In this Minireview, we propose the concept of carbon energy index, and the recent progress in petroleum refining, and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials using coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics is highlighted in combination with green carbon science. An outlook for these important fields is provided in the final section.

         <title>Crystalline Neutral Diboron Analogues of Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isoelectronic cyclopropane analogues, namely NHC&#8208;stabilized diboriranes is described. Featuring van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry and highly strained B2C rings, the diborirane derivatives readily undergo ring&#8208;opening and oxidative functionalization, demonstrating potential for future applications in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Although Schleyer's computations in 1979 predicted that the ground state of the parent diborirane features a planar&#8208;tetracoordinate carbon atom (anti van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry), this work demonstrates that substitution of C coupled with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) coordination provides access to isolable diborirane derivatives 3 and 4 with van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry. Species 3 and 4 are isoelectronic with cyclopropane and the highly strained B2C rings feature 2c&#8211;2e bent &#963; bonds. Consequently, the B&#8722;B and B&#8722;C bonds in 3 are cleaved in the presence of hydride, proton, and chalcogens. The former two reactions gave NHC&#8208;coordinated fluorenyldihydridoborane 5 and dichlorofluorenylborane 6, respectively, whereas the latter transformations afforded novel thiaborirane 8 and selenaborirane 9. In addition, transfer hydrogenation of 3 with ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3) led to the formation of (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane 7 via selective cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. These reactivities show potential for their future application in organic synthesis.

         <title>Microscopic Mechanism of the Heat&#8208;Induced Blueshift in Phosphors and a Logarithmic Energy Dependence on the Nearest Dopant&#8211;Vacancy Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A logarithmic relation governing the structures of phosphors was revealed together with an electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanism explaining the heat&#8208;induced blueshift (HIB) phenomenon by using a high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles approach. The results shed new light on understanding the general structure problems of defect&#8208;containing systems, and the heat&#8208;induced phenomena of phosphors.







Abstract
Heat&#8208;induced blueshift (HIB) observed in many luminescent materials is a puzzling phenomenon that has remained unexplained for decades. By using the high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations and energy&#8208;screening techniques, we generated a number of model structures for five phosphors, RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+, Na[Li3SiO4]:Eu2+, K[Li3SiO4]:Eu2+, Sr[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+, and Ca[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+. Our analyses suggest, to a first approximation, a logarithmic energy dependence on the nearest distance between the dopant and the metal&#8208;cation vacancy. By identifying the 
 transition energies from the electronic structures calculated for the screened model structures, we show that the vibration of the Eu2+ ion lying in an asymmetric and anharmonic potential well couples with the electronic states, leading to their HIB phenomena.

         <title>Simultaneous Counting of Molecules in the Halo and Dense&#8208;Core of Nanovesicles by Regulating Dynamics of Vesicle Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doublet spikes induced by chaotropes (SCN&#8722;) are recorded from chromaffin vesicles opening during vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC). The 1st and 2nd peaks correspond to the oxidization of molecules from the halo and dense&#8208;core, respectively, allowing a molecular count to be obtained independently in these two nanoscopic compartments. The vesicles can be classified into three groups including NDCVs, immature large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs), and mature LDCVs.







Abstract
We report the discovery that in the presence of chaotropic anions (SCN&#8722;) the opening of nanometer biological vesicles at an electrified interface often becomes a two&#8208;step process (around 30&#8201;% doublet peaks). We have then used this to independently count molecules in each subvesicular compartment, the halo and protein dense&#8208;core, and the fraction of catecholamine binding to the dense&#8208;core is 68&#8201;%. Moreover, we differentiated two distinct populations of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) and quantified their content, which might correspond to immature (43&#8201;%) and mature (30&#8201;%) LDCVs, to reveal differences in their biogenesis. We speculate this is caused by an increase in the electrostatic attraction between protonated catecholamine and the negatively charged dense&#8208;core following adsorption of SCN&#8722;.

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Helicenes by a Tailored Chiral Benzo[ghi]perylene Trisimide &#960;&#8208;Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes are bound by a newly designed chiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold composed of a perylene trisimide, BINOL and terphenyl subunits. The superb enantiodifferentiation is observable by the naked eye due to the exciplex&#8208;type emission of the homochiral complex.







Abstract
Enantioselective molecular recognition of chiral molecules that lack specific interaction sites for hydrogen bonding or Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions remains challenging. Here we introduce the concept of tailored chiral &#960;&#8208;surfaces toward the maximization of shape complementarity. As we demonstrate for helicenes it is indeed possible by pure van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions (&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions) to accomplish enantioselective binding. This is shown for a novel benzo[ghi]perylene trisimide (BPTI) receptor whose &#960;&#8208;scaffold is contorted into a chiral plane by functionalization with 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL). Complexation experiments of enantiopure (P)&#8208;BPTI with (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;[6]helicene afforded binding constants of 10&#8201;700&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 550&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively, thereby demonstrating the pronounced enantiodifferentiation by the homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold of the BPTI host. The enantioselective recognition is even observable by the naked eye due to a specific exciplex&#8208;type emission originating from the interacting homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffolds of electron&#8208;rich [6]helicene and electron&#8208;poor BPTI.

Abstract
Synthesis of versatile &#946; tert&#8208;boryl amides is accomplished by conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes and carbamoyl chloride electrophiles. This reaction can be accomplished in an enantioselective fashion using a palladium catalyst in combination with MandyPhos. The addition of water results in enhanced chemoselectivity for the conjunctive coupling product relative to the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling product. Transformations of the reaction products were examined as well as application to the synthesis of (+)&#8208;adalinine.

         <title>A Calix[3]acridan&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Cocrystal Exhibiting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials has been developed, which has led to the convenient synthesis of a new kind of macrocycle, namely calix[3]acridan. The host&#8211;guest cocrystal formed from calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70&#8201;% as a result of intense intermolecular charge transfer (ICT).







Abstract
A supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials through host&#8211;guest charge transfer interactions was proposed. Consequently, a new class of macrocycle namely calix[3]acridan was conveniently synthesized in 90&#8201;% yield. The host&#8211;guest cocrystal formed by calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF properties due to intense intermolecular charge transfer interactions. Moreover, the spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital resulted in a very small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap of 0.014&#8197;eV and hence guaranteed an efficient reverse intersystem crossing for TADF. Especially, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70&#8201;% was achieved, and it represents the highest value among the reported intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor TADF materials.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair in Zeolite Cages for Alkane Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H&#8722;H bond in H2 and C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes (n&#8805;3) can be activated by a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) in zeolites. The FLP consisting of the hydrocarbon pool species (polymethylbenzenium, Lewis acid) and deprotonated zeolites (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;, Lewis base) is the common steady state of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions.







Abstract
The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) concept in homogeneous catalysis was extended to heterogeneous catalysis via the supramolecular system of FLP between deprotonated zeolite framework oxygens and confined carbocations in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions. In this FLP, the polymethylbenzenium (PMB+) functioned as the Lewis acid to accept an electron pair, and the deprotonated framework oxygen site acted as the Lewis base to donate an electron pair. This FLP theoretically demonstrated the ability to undergo H2 heterolysis and alkanes dehydrogenation, and this was further confirmed by gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometer (GC&#8208;MS) catalytic experiments inside FLP&#8208;containing chabazite zeolites. All these findings not only bring new recognition to the carbocation chemistry in zeolite cages but also put forward a new reaction pathway as one part of MTO reactions.

         <title>Supported Lanthanum Borohydride Catalyzes CH Borylation Inside Zeolite Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylation of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), catalyzed by a zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanum borohydride, provides the first demonstration of a promising alternative to late&#8208;metal catalysts. High turnovers and yields are achieved by selective grafting of lanthanum at Br&#248;nsted acid sites and limiting HBpin degradation. C&#8722;H bond activation, likely via the &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism, is probably the turnover limiting step.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanide La(BH4)x&#8208;HY30 catalyzes C&#8722;H borylation of benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), providing a complementary approach to precious, late transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylations. The reactive catalytic species are generated from La grafted at the Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in micropores of the zeolite, whereas silanoate&#8208; and aluminoate&#8208;grafted sites are inactive under the reaction conditions. During typical catalytic borylations, conversion to phenyl pinacolborane (PhBpin) is zero&#8208;order in HBpin concentration. A turnover number (TON) of 167 is accessed by capping external silanols, selectively grafting at BAS sites, and adding HBpin slowly to the reaction.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of [3]Radialenes via [1+1+1] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [1+1+1] cycloaddition reaction has been achieved on the Ag(111) surface to afford the aza[3]radialenes. The chlorine substituents in the isocyanides ensured the selectivity and orientational order of the products via the steric hindrance&#8208;directed molecular assembly.







Abstract
[3]Radialenes are the smallest carbocyclic structures with unusual topologies and cross&#8208;conjugated &#960;&#8208;electronic structures. Here, we report a novel [1+1+1] cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of aza[3]radialenes on the Ag(111) surface, where the steric hindrance of the chlorine substituents guides the selective and orientational assembling of the isocyanide precursors. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we determined the atomic structure of the produced aza[3]radialenes. Furthermore, two reaction pathways including synergistic and stepwise are proposed based on density functional theory calculations, which reveal the role of the chlorine substituents in the activation of the isocyano groups via electrostatic interaction.

         <title>NHC Catalysis for Umpolung Pyridinium Alkylation via Deoxy&#8208;Breslow Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC deoxy&#8208;Breslow catalysis offers new umpolung possibilities for electron&#8208;poor arene rings. NHC organocatalysis is largely restricted to aldehydes, with other electrophiles proving difficult to harness. It is shown that a pyridinium system can react successfully with an NHC, enabling intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formation with a Michael acceptor through a deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediate.







Abstract
Umpolung N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis of non&#8208;aldehyde substrates offers new pathways for C&#8722;C bond formation, but has proven challenging to develop in terms of viable substrate classes. Here, we demonstrate that pyridinium ions can undergo NHC addition and subsequent intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formation through a deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediate. The alkylation demonstrates, for the first time, that deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediates are viable for catalytic umpolung of areniums.

         <title>Reactive Extrusion Printing for Simultaneous Crystallization&#8208;Deposition of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable fabrication methods for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films are crucial for integrating this class of materials with applications. Reactive extrusion printing (REP) co&#8208;delivers reactive inks that rapidly form micron&#8208;thick interconnected nanoparticulate films of Cu3btc2 (HKUST&#8208;1) on&#8208;demand and on&#8208;location.







Abstract
Reactive extrusion printing (REP) is demonstrated as an approach to simultaneously crystallize and deposit films of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cu3btc2 (btc=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate), also known as HKUST&#8208;1. The technique co&#8208;delivers inks of the copper(II) acetate and H3btc starting materials directly on&#8208;surface and on&#8208;location for rapid nucleation into films at room temperature. The films were analyzed using PXRD, profilometry, SEM and thermal analysis techniques and confirmed high&#8208;quality Cu3btc2 films are produced in low&#8208;dispersity interconnected nanoparticulate form. The porosity was examined using gas adsorption which showed REP gives Cu3btc2 films with open interconnected pore structures, demonstrating the method bestows features that traditional synthesis does not. REP is a technique that opens the field to time&#8208;efficient large&#8208;scale fabrication of MOF interfaces and should find use in a wide variety of coating application settings.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Imprinting of the Helical Organization in Liquid&#8208;Crystal Networks Using Achiral Monomers and Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method has been developed to make cholesteric liquid&#8208;crystal networks from achiral monomers by irradiation with circularly polarized light. This approach allows simultaneous control over the photoalignment of the mesogens and the photopolymerization of the network.







Abstract
Control over molecular motion is facilitated in materials with highly ordered nanoscale structures. Here we report on the fabrication of cholesteric liquid&#8208;crystal networks by circularly polarized light irradiation, without the need for chiral dopant or plasticizer. The polymer network is obtained by photopolymerization of a smectic achiral diacrylate mesogen consisting of an azobenzene core and discrete oligodimethylsiloxane tails. The synchronous helical photoalignment and photopolymerization originate from the cooperative movement of the mesogens ordered in well&#8208;defined responsive structures, together with the flexibility of the oligodimethylsiloxane blocks. The resulting thin films show excellent thermal stability and light&#8208;induced memory features with reversible responses. Additionally, we demonstrate the fabrication of photo&#8208;patterned films of liquid&#8208;crystal networks with opposite helical senses. These findings provide a new method to make light&#8208;controllable chiroptical materials with exciting applications in optics and photonics.

         <title>Access to a Labile Monomeric Magnesium Radical by Ball&#8208;Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ball&#8208;milling of a magnesium iodide precursor with K/KI gave a mononuclear Mg radical which is stabilized by a CAAC ligand. Although stable in the crystalline state, the complex decomposed rapidly in solution. According to calculations and EPR spectroscopy, most of the spin density is localized on the CAAC ligand.







Abstract
In order to isolate a monometallic Mg radical, the precursor (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (1) was prepared (Am=tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, CAAC=cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene). Reduction of a solution of 1 in toluene with the reducing agent K/KI led to formation of a deep purple complex that rapidly decomposed. Ball&#8208;milling of 1 with K/KI gave the low&#8208;valent MgI complex (Am)Mg&#8901;(CAAC) (2) which after rapid extraction with pentane and crystallization was isolated in 15&#8201;% yield. Although a benzene solution of 2 decomposes rapidly to give Mg(Am)2 (3) and unidentified products, the radical is stable in the solid state. Its crystal structure shows planar trigonal coordination at Mg. The extremely short Mg&#8722;C distance of 2.056(2)&#8197;&#197; indicates strong Mg&#8722;CAAC bonding. Calculations and EPR measurements show that most of the spin density is in a &#960;* orbital located at the C&#8722;N bond in CAAC, leading to significant C&#8722;N bond elongation. This is supported by calculated NPA charges in 2: Mg +1.73, CAAC &#8722;0.82. Similar metal&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer was calculated for M0(CAAC)2 and [MI(CAAC)2+] (M=Be, Mg, Ca) complexes in which the metal charges range from +1.50 to +1.70. Although the spin density of the radical is mainly located at the CAAC ligand, complex 2 reacts as a low&#8208;valent MgI complex: reaction with a I2 solution in toluene gave (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (1) as the major product.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Stiffening of Hydrogel Networks with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's So Clearly Visible: Hydrogels can be formed by exclusively visible&#8208;light irradiation with two colours of light, with each colour allowing mechanical stiffening of the gel independent of the order in which each colour is applied. Driven by mild [2+2] cycloadditions with halochromic properties, the photoreactivity of the reactions in water can be controlled by a photoacid generator.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce the wavelength&#8208;orthogonal crosslinking of hydrogel networks using two red&#8208;shifted chromophores, i.e. acrylpyerene (AP, &#955;activation=410&#8211;490&#8197;nm) and styrylpyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazine (SPP, &#955;activation=400&#8211;550&#8197;nm), able to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition in the visible&#8208;light regime. The photoreactivity of the SPP moiety is pH&#8208;dependent, whereby an acidic environment inhibits the cycloaddition. By employing a spiropyran&#8208;based photoacid generator with suitable absorption wavelength, we are able to restrict the activation wavelength of the SPP moiety to the green light region (&#955;activation=520&#8211;550&#8197;nm), enabling wavelength&#8208;orthogonal activation of the AP group. Our wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photochemical system was successfully applied in the design of hydrogels whose stiffness can be tuned independently by either green or blue light.

         <dc:description>Simultaneous control over the configuration of multiple stereocenters is accomplished by numerous catalytic methods, providing a reliable basis for the synthesis of stereochemically complex targets in isomerically defined form. In contrast, addressing the configurations of multiple stereogenic axes with diastereodivergent catalyst control is thus far only possible by stepwise approaches. Herein we now describe that all four stereoisomers of atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems are directly tractable by assembling a central aromatic unit of teraryls through an arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation. By using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalysts, the four feasible reaction pathways are differentiated from identical substrates under defined basic conditions without preactivation, thus enabling complete stereodivergence with enantioselectivities of up to 99:1 e.r.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of 1,4&#8208;diamines via Cascade Hydroamination of Methylene Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the widespread existence of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines in bioactive molecules and their applications in asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of such structures from readily accessible substrates remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydroamination protocol to construct a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields with excellent enatioselectivities (up to 95% yield and up to &#65310;99% ee). The use of two hydroxylamine esters containing different functionalized amino groups allowed us to increase the complexity of the final 1,4&#8208;diamine structures. The desired products could be easily transformed into chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines and chiral NH  2  &#8208;Terfenadine. Mechanistic study demonstrates that this reaction proceeds through hydroamination ring&#8208;opening and cascade hydroamination sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of [3]&#8208;Ladderanol through Late&#8208;Stage Organocatalytic Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ladderane phospholipids, with their unusual ladder&#8208;like arrangement of concatenated cyclobutane rings, represent an architecturally unique class of natural products. However, despite their fascinating structure and other necessary impetus, only a few synthetic studies of these molecules have been reported so far. We have now devised a concise total synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol, a component of ladderane phospholipids, using an organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing formal C(sp2)&#8210;H alkylation. Our synthetic strategy rests on the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality, thus allowing facile access to both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue. This is the first time a desymmetrization strategy is applied to the synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol. The scope of this desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8210;H alkylation of meso&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;fused cyclohexenediones is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Halogen and Halogen&#8208;&#960; Interactions Enabled Reversible Photo&#8208;oligomerization of Conjugated Dienones: Visible Light Triggered Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of reversible oligomer/polymers is fascinating both from the perspective of the fundamental understanding as well as their applications, ranging from biomedical to self&#8208;healing smart materials. On the other hand, the reactions that occur in single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion offer great details of the structure, geometry and stereochemistry of the product. However, SCSC [2+2] oligomerization is rather difficult and rare. Further, till date there are no reports for a reversible [2+2] oligomerization in SCSC fashion. In this work, four halogen substituted acrylic dienone molecules were deliberately designed and their ability to participate in [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in solid state was studied under visible light. Despite of having the required alignment of double bonds of dienes in all four crystal structures, they found to exhibit variable reactivities given the differences in their weak intermolecular interactions such as halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen, halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions. Notably, one of these materials exhibits reversible oligomerization in SCSC manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitc Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Employing pure water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen donor to initiate chemical reactions that involve a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step is fascinating but challenging due to its large H&#8208;O bond dissociation energy (BDE  H&#8208;O  = 5.1 eV). Many approaches have been explored to stimulate water for hydrogenative reactions, but the efficiency and productivity still require significant enhancement. Here, we show that the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8208;OH) only requires 2.25 eV to activate H&#8208;O bonds in water, enabling abstraction of hydrogen atoms  via  dehydrogenation of pure water into hydrogen peroxide under visible light irradiation. The gCN&#8208;OH presents a stable catalytic performance for hydrogenative N&#8208;N coupling, pinacol&#8208;type coupling and dehalogenative C&#8208;C coupling, all with high yield and efficiency, even under solar radiation, featuring extensive impacts in using renewable energy for a cleaner process in dye, electronic, and pharmaceutical industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Under&#8208;5&#8208;Minute Immunoblot Assays by Vortex Fluidic Device Acceleration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlocking the potential of personalized medicine in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings requires a new generation of biomarker and proteomic assays. Ideally, assays could inexpensively perform hundreds of quantitative protein measurements in parallel at the bedsides of patients. This goal greatly exceeds current capabilities. Furthermore, biomarker assays are often challenging to translate from benchtop to clinic due to difficulties achieving and assessing the necessary selectivity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, we developed an efficient (&lt;5 min), robust (comparatively lower CVs), and inexpensive (decreasing reagent use and cost by &gt;70%) immunoassay method. Specifically, the immunoblot membrane is dotted with the sample and then developed in a vortex fluidic device (VFD) reactor. All assay steps &#8211; blocking, binding, and washing &#8211; leverage the unique thin&#8208;film microfluidics of the VFD. The approach can accelerate direct, indirect, and sandwich immunoblot assays. The applications demonstrated include assays relevant to both the laboratory and the clinic.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Cage Activation of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite a renaissance in the activation of carborane cages in the past decades, oxidative cage functionalizations generally require stoichiometric amounts of toxic chemical oxidants. In contrast, electrochemical functionalizations enable resource&#8208;economical cage activation.







Abstract
Carboranes are boron&#8211;carbon molecular clusters that possess unique properties, such as their icosahedron geometry, high boron content, and delocalized three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity. These features render carboranes valuable building blocks for applications in supramolecular design, nanomaterials, optoelectronics, organometallic coordination chemistry, and as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents. Despite tremendous progress in this field, stoichiometric chemical redox reagents are largely required for the oxidative activation of carborane cages. In this context, electrosyntheses represent an alternative strategy for more sustainable molecular syntheses. It is only in recent few years that considerable progress has been made in electrochemical cage functionalization of carboranes, which are summarized in this Minireview. We anticipate that electrocatalysis will serve as an increasingly powerful stimulus within the current renaissance of carborane electrochemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Potential Cathodes with Nitrogen Active Centres for Quasi&#8208;Solid Proton&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly proposed 2,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene bis((ethylsulfonyl)amide) (HDC) can deliver a high working potential and stable cycle performance over 2000&#8197;cycles in a stainless&#8208;steel case based on a nitrogen active centre.







Abstract
Although proton&#8208;ion batteries have received considerable attention owing to their reliability, safety, toxin&#8208;free nature, and low cost, their development remains in the early stages because of lacking proper electrolytes and cathodes for facilitating a high output voltage and stable cycle performance. We present a novel cathode based on active nitrogen centre, which provides a flat discharge plateau at 1&#8197;V with a capacity of 115&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent stability. Moreover, a quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte was developed to overcome the issue of corrosion, broaden the potential window of the electrolyte, and prevent the active material from dissolving. While using the unique as&#8208;developed electrolyte, the newly designed cathode retained 89.67&#8201;% of its original capacity after 2000&#8197;cycles. Finally, we demonstrated the excellent cycle performance of the as&#8208;developed metal&#8208;free, flexible, soft&#8208;packed battery. Notably, even when a portion of the battery was cut off, it continued to function normally.

         <title>4&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Butyric Acid&#8208;Assisted In Situ Passivation Strategy for Superstable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite CsPbX3 Quantum Dots in Polar Media</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CsPbX3 (CPX) QDs via in situ crystallization with synergistic effects of BBA and OLA in polar solvent is proposed. The results not only provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents but also shed more light on their surface chemistry.







Abstract
A crucial challenge is to develop an in situ passivation treatment strategy for CsPbX3 (CPX, X=Cl, Br, and I) quantum dots (QDs) and simultaneously retain their luminous efficiency and wavelength. Here, a facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CPX QDs via in situ crystallization with the synergistic effect of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyric acid (BBA) and oleylamine (OLA) in polar solvents including aqueous solution and a possible fundamental mechanism are proposed. Monodispersed CsPbBr3 (CPB) QDs obtained in water show high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 86.4&#8201;% and their PL features of CPB QDs have no significant change after being dispersed in aqueous solution for 96&#8197;h, which implies the structure of CPB QDs is unchanged. The results provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents and shed more light on their surface chemistry.

         <title>Organic Branched Heterostructures with Optical Interconnects for Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronic functions remains challenging. Optical interconnections based on organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) have been synthesized through a sequential self&#8208;assembly process. The accurate spatial organization has been applied to the generation of 2D barcodes.







Abstract
Optical interconnects exhibit superior potential in the precise regulation of photon transmission for organic photonic circuits. However, the rational design of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronics remains challenging. Herein, we designed organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) with accurate spatial organization for optical interconnection. Notably, the precise regulation of OBHs has been controllably achieved including the trunk morphologies and the branched microwire number. Significantly, these as&#8208;prepared OBHs inherently exhibit the multichannel coupling outputs and the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide characteristics, leading to various outcoupling signals with tunable intensity and emission colors. The optical interconnects are realized due to the occurrence of exciton conversion and photon propagation between branch and trunk at the heterojunction, benefiting the application possibilities of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) optical barcodes.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder for Efficient and Stable Sn&#8208;Pb Alloyed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sn&#8208;Pb alloyed perovskites have drawn considerable attention because of their appropriate bandgap for both single&#8208;junction and multi&#8208;junction tandem photovoltaics, but the easy&#8208;formation of energy disorder still limits their practical applications. Here, we report that the combination of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;(methylsulfinyl) benzene (BBMS) and SnF  2  greatly reduced the Urbach energy of perovskite films, and largely restrained the oxidation of Sn  2+  . With the help of density functional theory calculations, we clarified the interactions between BBMS and perovskite was responsible for the improvements. As a result, a high efficiency of &gt; 22% was obtained for the Sn&#8208;Pb alloy&#8208;based solar cells treated by BBMS and SnF  2  . More importantly, the BBMS&#8208;treated device demonstrated outstanding stability, retaining 98% of its original efficiency after heating at 60 &#176;C for 2660 h under N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Sequencing of Uniform Multifunctional Oligoesters via Random Chain Cleavages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;defined polymers have been the object of many fascinating studies that focus on their implementation in both material and life science applications. In parallel, iterative synthetic methodologies have become more efficient, whereas the structure elucidation of these molecules is generally dependent on MS/MS analysis. Here, we report an alternative, simple strategy for the determination of the monomer order of uniform oligo(thioether ester)s. This approach, which relies on random cleavages of ester units within the macromolecular backbone  via  a basic treatment, enables the swift characterization of these macromolecules without the need for MS/MS. Consequently, this method can be used for decoding any information stored within the primary structure of oligoesters by means of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8208;MS. Finally, we speculate that a range of structurally diverse backbones could be susceptible towards this approach, which could promptly expand the library of chemically sequenceable macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation of Azinium Ions with Allylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic allylations of pyridinium and quinolinium ions with allylboronates are reported. Transmetalation of the allylboronate with gold produces nucleophilic allylgold(I) species that add to the 4&#8208;position of the azinium ion with complete regioselectivity to give functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines and 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic allylations of pyridinium and quinolinium ions with various allyl pinacolboronates are reported. The reactions are completely selective with respect to the site of the azinium ion that is attacked, to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines and 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Evidence suggests that the reactions proceed through nucleophilic allylgold(I) intermediates formed by transmetalation from allylboronates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insight.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric &#946;&#8208;Oxygen Elimination**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is reported. The reaction design utilizes the symmetry of meso&#8208;ketene acetal substrates and proceeds in the presence of a chiral zirconocene catalyst. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination, the application in diol and amino alcohol synthesis, and a DFT&#8208;supported stereochemical analysis are presented.







Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination reaction is reported in the form of a zirconium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric opening of meso&#8208;ketene acetals. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is demonstrated. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, at low catalyst loadings, and produces chiral monoprotected cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols in good yield and enantiomeric excess. The combination with a Mitsunobu reaction or a one&#8208;pot hydroboration/Suzuki reaction sequence then gives access to additional diol and aminoalcohol building blocks. A stereochemical analysis supported by DFT calculations reveals that a high selectivity in the hydrozirconation step is also important for achieving high enantioselectivity, although it does not constitute the asymmetric step. This insight is crucial for the future development of related asymmetric &#946;&#8208;elimination reactions.

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective coupling of readily available bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8208;OH) with various halides is reported, which offers expedient approaches to a wide range of cyclobutanone and  &#946;  ,  &#947;  &#8208;enone skeletons via single or double C&#8208;C activation. The chemistry shows a broad substrate scope in terms of both the range of BCP&#8208;OH and halides including a series of natural product derivatives.

         <title>Digitizing Chemical Synthesis in 3D Printed Reactionware</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines reactions as building blocks with 3D printed reactor hardware or reactionware is presented. This practical approach allows the synthetic chemist to encode the unit operations allowing a digital blueprint to be built of the entire process.







Abstract
Chemistry digitization requires an unambiguous link between experiments and the code used to generate the experimental conditions and outcomes, yet this process is not standardized, limiting the portability of any chemical code. What is needed is a universal approach to aid this process using a well&#8208;defined standard that is composed of syntheses that are employed in modular hardware. Herein we present a new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines process chemistry principles with 3D printed reactionware. This approach outlines the process for transforming unit operations into digitized hardware and well&#8208;defined instructions that ensure effective synthesis. To demonstrate this, we outline the process for digitizing 3 MIDA boronate building blocks, an ester hydrolysis, a Wittig olefination, a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction, and synthesis of the drug sulfanilamide.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of primary anilines via sustainable methods remains a challenge in organic synthesis.  We report  a photocatalytic protocol for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl bromides with sodium azide using a photocatalyst powder consisting of nickel(II) deposited on mesoporous carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CN  x  )  . This heterogeneous photocatalyst contains a high surface area with a visible light&#8208;absorbing and adaptive &#8216;built&#8208;in&#8217; solid&#8208;state ligand for the integrated catalytic Ni site. The method displays a high functional group tolerance, requires mild reaction conditions, and benefits from easy recovery and reuse of the photocatalyst powder. Thereby, it overcomes  the need of complex ligand scaffolds required in homogeneous catalysis, precious metals and elevated temperatures/pressures in existing protocols  of primary anilines synthesis. The reported heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CN  x  holds potential for applications in the academic and industrial synthesis of anilines and exploration of other photocatalytic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustained Release of a Synthetic Autoinducing Peptide Mimetic Blocks Bacterial Communication and Virulence In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is significant interest in approaches to the treatment of bacterial infections that block virulence without creating selective pressures that lead to resistance. Here, we report the development of an &#8216;anti&#8208;virulence&#8217; strategy that exploits the activity of potent synthetic inhibitors of quorum sensing (QS) in  Staphylococcus aureus  . We identify peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of QS that are resistant to sequestration or degradation by components of murine tissue and demonstrate that encapsulation of a lead inhibitor in degradable polymer microparticles provides materials that substantially inhibit QS  in vitro.  Using a murine abscess model, we show that this inhibitor attenuates methicillin&#8208;resistant  S. aureus  (MRSA) skin infections  in vivo  , and that sustained release of the inhibitor from microparticles significantly improved outcomes compared to mice that received a single&#8208;dose bolus.  Our results present an effective and modular approach to controlling bacterial virulence  in vivo  and could advance the development of new strategies for skin infection control.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platform for Stop&#8208;Flow Gradient Generation to Investigate Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microswimmers show positive and negative chemotaxis behavior in a microfluidic assay. A flow&#8208;based linear gradient is generated and the flow is stopped during the chemotaxis assay using a retroactive pressure loop.







Abstract
The ability of artificial microswimmers to respond to external stimuli and the mechanistical details of their origins belong to the most disputed challenges in interdisciplinary science. Therein, the creation of chemical gradients is technically challenging, because they quickly level out due to diffusion. Inspired by pivotal stopped flow experiments in chemical kinetics, we show that microfluidics gradient generation combined with a pressure feedback loop for precisely controlling the stop of the flows, can enable us to study mechanistical details of chemotaxis of artificial Janus micromotors, based on a catalytic reaction. We find that these copper Janus particles display a chemotactic motion along the concentration gradient in both, positive and negative direction and we demonstrate the mechanical reaction of the particles to unbalanced drag forces, explaining this behaviour.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Incorporated Mussel&#8208;Inspired Poly(Vinyl Alcohol)&#8208;Based Polymer Coating Offers Improved Antibacterial Activity and Cellular Mechanoresponse Manipulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal ion&#8208;triggered enhanced stiffness of poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based polymer coating incorporated with bioactive cobalt ions was designed. This surface coating platform not only exhibited durable and excellent antibacterial activity, but also manipulates cellular functions with enhanced mechanosensing that facilitates the cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating.







Abstract
Cobalt (CoII) ions have been an attractive candidate for the biomedical modification of orthopedic implants for decades. However, limited research has been performed into how immobilized CoII ions affect the physical properties of implant devices and how these changes regulate cellular behavior. In this study we modified biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) with terpyridine and catechol groups (PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA) to create a stable surface coating in which bioactive metal ions could be anchored, endowing the coating with improved broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as enhanced surface stiffness and cellular mechanoresponse manipulation. Strengthened by the addition of these metal ions, the coating elicited enhanced mechanosensing from adjacent cells, facilitating cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating. This dual&#8208;functional PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA/Co surface coating offers a promising approach for improving clinical implantation outcomes.

         <title>In Situ Halogen&#8208;Ion Leaching Regulates Multiple Sites on Tandem Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay of dual components in tandem catalysts is uncovered and utilized during the electrochemical reconstruction for promoting CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products. Taking AgI&#8722;CuO as a conceptual tandem catalyst, in situ iodine ions leaching from AgI restrain the entire reduction of CuO to acquire stable active Cu0/Cu+ species, thus achieving a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 68.9&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tandem catalysts can divide the reaction into distinct steps by local multiple sites and thus are attractive to trigger CO2RR to C2+ products. However, the evolution of catalysts generally exists during CO2RR, thus a closer investigation of the reconstitution, interplay, and active origin of dual components in tandem catalysts is warranted. Here, taking AgI&#8722;CuO as a conceptual tandem catalyst, we uncovered the interaction of two phases during the electrochemical reconstruction. Multiple operando techniques unraveled that in situ iodine ions leaching from AgI restrained the entire reduction of CuO to acquire stable active Cu0/Cu+ species during the CO2RR. This way, the residual iodine species of the Ag matrix accelerated CO generation and iodine&#8208;induced Cu0/Cu+ promotes C&#8722;C coupling. This self&#8208;adaptive dual&#8208;optimization endowed our catalysts with an excellent C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 68.9&#8201;%. Material operando changes in this work offer a new approach for manipulating active species towards enhancing C2+ products.

         <title>Micromechanically&#8208;Powered Rolling Locomotion of a Twisted&#8208;Crystal Optical&#8208;Waveguide Cavity as a Mobile Light Polarization Rotor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted organic crystals display rolling locomotion on a flat substrate when subjected to mechanical force using an atomic force microscope cantilever tip. These crystals are flexible and efficiently self&#8208;guide the fluorescence both in straight and bent geometries and act as optical cavities. Remarkably, twisted&#8208;crystal waveguides rotate the guided polarized optical modes direction as a function of the crystal's rolling motion.







Abstract
We demonstrate mechanically&#8208;powered rolling locomotion of a twisted&#8208;microcrystal optical&#8208;waveguide cavity on the substrate, rotating the output signal's linear&#8208;polarization. Self&#8208;assembly of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;(((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenol produces naturally twisted microcrystals. The strain between several intergrowing, orientationally mismatched nanocrystalline fibres dictates the pitch lengths of the twisted crystals. The crystals are flexible, perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The twisted crystals in their straight and bent geometries guide fluorescence along their body axes and display optical modes. Depending upon the degree of mechanical rolling locomotion, the crystal&#8208;waveguide cavity correspondingly rotates the output signal polarization. The presented twisted&#8208;crystal cavity with a combination of mechanical locomotion and photonic attributes unfolds a new dimension in mechanophotonics.

         <title>Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]: A Heteroanionic Nonlinear Optical Material Containing Planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and Heteroleptic [SnOSe3] Anionic Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic nonlinear optical material, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] has been synthesized. Its structure contains two different kinds of anionic groups: planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and heteroleptic [SnOSe3]. It exhibits promising properties including a large second harmonic generation (SHG) response (ca. 1&#215;AgGaS2), a wide band&#8208;gap (Eg) of 3.46&#8197;eV, a high laser damage threshold (LDT) of 240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as a wide transparent region.







Abstract
Inorganic heteroanionic materials are attracting increasing attention for exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials because they could better satisfy the necessary but conflicting properties of NLO crystals, e.g. large SHG response and wide band&#8208;gap. Up to now, the reports on heteroanionic NLO materials have mainly focused on ultraviolet or visible oxide&#8208;based fluoroborates, fluorophosphates, borate&#8208;phosphates and borate&#8208;iodates. However, chalcogenides containing different kinds of anionic groups have barely been reported. Herein, we have synthesized the first oxychalcogenide&#8208;carbonate, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] that contains two different kinds of anionic groups, [SnOSe3] and [CO3]. It crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group and exhibits fascinating NLO properties, including a large SHG response (&#8776;1&#215;AGS), sufficient birefringence (0.12 @1064&#8197;nm), wide band&#8208;gap (3.46&#8197;eV) and high laser damage threshold (240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). These make Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] a promising NLO crystal.

Herein, we have synthesized the first oxychalcogenide-carbonate, Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[SnOSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] that contains two different kinds of anionic groups, [SnOSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] and [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]. It crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group and exhibits fascinating NLO properties, including a large SHG response (&#8776;1&#215;AGS), sufficient birefringence (0.12 @1064&#8197;nm), wide band-gap (3.46&#8197;eV) and high laser damage threshold (240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). These make Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[SnOSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] a promising NLO crystal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Enzyme Activity by the Modulation of Covalent Interactions in the Confined Channels of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were utilized for the covalent immobilization of cytochrome c (Cyt c), offering protection for the Cyt c. The covalent interactions could induce the conformation changes of Cyt c giving a more accessible active site, and consequently enhanced activity.







Abstract
Controllable regulations on the enzyme conformation to optimize catalytic performance are highly desired for the immobilized biocatalysts yet remain challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess confined channels with finely tunable pore environment, offering a promising platform for enzyme encapsulation. Herein, we covalently immobilized the cytochrome c (Cyt c) in the size&#8208;matched channels of COFs with different contents of anchoring site, and significant enhancement of the stability and activity (&#8776;600&#8201;% relative activity compared with free enzyme) can be realized by optimizing the covalent interactions. Structural analyses on the immobilized Cyt c suggest that covalent bonding could induce conformational perturbation resulting in more accessible active sites. The effectiveness of the covalent interaction modulation together with the tailorable confined channels of COFs offers promise to develop high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.

         <title>Structural Insight of MOFs under Combined Mechanical and Adsorption Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new in situ pressure cell was designed that can follow materials under two combined stimuli: gas pressure and mechanical stress, providing structural insight into phase transformations of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The cell was used to gain direct evidence that mechanical stress can control MIL&#8208;53(Al) breathing behaviour with CO2, further paving the way for dynamic tuning of separation performance for compliant MOFs.







Abstract
External control over the pore size of flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently emerged as an intriguing concept, with possible applications to gas storage and separation. In this work we present a new pressure cell capable for the first time of monitoring through in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction an adsorbent powder under combined uniaxial applied mechanical stress (up to 1&#8197;GPa) and gas pressure (up to 20&#8197;bar). The combined stress&#8211;pressure clamp (CSPC) cell was successfully exploited to follow the evolution of the CO2 breathing behaviour of the prototypical complex breathing MIL&#8208;53(Al) system under mechanical compression obtaining structural evidence that this MOF can be maintained in its closed pore state upon compression, precluding its re&#8208;opening at high gas pressure (&gt;7&#8197;bar). This novel setup shows potential for the in&#8208;operando exploration of flexible systems, in equilibrium and flow configurations.

         <title>Aqueous Biphasic Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photosynthesis Cells for TEMPO&#8208;Based Oxidation of Glycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell for glycerol oxidation while producing H2 is presented. The redox&#8208;gel protects the photoanode from aqueous reaction conditions. The gel layer contained 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl and shuttles electrons between the photoexcited dye and glycerol at the biphasic interface. Employment of the redox&#8208;gel showed a 10&#8208;fold increase in glyceraldehyde production compared to the fully aqueous system.







Abstract
This work reports an aqueous dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) capable of oxidizing glycerol (an archetypical biobased compound) coupled with H2 production. We employed a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode sensitized with the high potential thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, encased in an acetonitrile&#8208;based redox&#8208;gel that protects the photoanode from degradation by aqueous electrolytes. The use of the gel creates a biphasic system with an interface at the organic (gel) electrode and aqueous anolyte. Embedded in the acetonitrile gel is 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), acting as both a redox&#8208;mediator and a catalyst for oxidative transformations. Upon oxidation of TEMPO by the photoexcited dye, the in situ generated TEMPO+ shuttles through the gel to the acetonitrile&#8211;aqueous interface, where it acts as an oxidant for the selective conversion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde. The introduction of the redox&#8208;gel layer affords a 10&#8208;fold increase in the conversion of glycerol compared to the purely aqueous system. Our redox&#8208;gel protected photoanode yielded a stable photocurrent over 48&#8197;hours of continuous operation, demonstrating that this DSPEC is compatible with alkaline aqueous reactions.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Molecules: Unveiling the Valence Tautomerism Phenomena in Bare Barbaralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two valence tautomers have been revealed in the supersonic expansion for an archetypal fluxional molecule phenyl&#8208;barbaralone, providing definite experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement in these shape&#8208;shifting systems.







Abstract
We report a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic study of an archetypical barbaralone, conclusively revealing the valence tautomerism phenomena for this bistable molecular system. The two distinct 1&#8208; and 5&#8208;substituted valence tautomers have been isolated in a supersonic expansion for the first time and successfully characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy. This work provides irrefutable experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement in barbaralones and highlights the use of rotational spectroscopy to analyze shape&#8208;shifting mixtures. Moreover, this observation opens the window toward the characterization of new fluxional systems in the isolation conditions of the gas phase and should serve as a reference point in the general understanding of valence tautomerism.

         <title>Molecular Catalysts for the Reductive Homocoupling of CO2 towards C2+ Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent progress in molecular catalysis of CO2 and CO homocoupling through thermochemical and electrochemical reductive approaches. Particular attention is paid to C&#8722;C coupling processes that generate multicarbon products. The current challenges in this rapidly growing field are described and perspectives for possible future developments are outlined.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into multicarbon (C2+) compounds by reductive homocoupling offers the possibility to transform renewable energy into chemical energy carriers and thereby create &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; fuels or other valuable products. Most available studies have employed heterogeneous metallic catalysts, but the use of molecular catalysts is still underexplored. However, several studies have already demonstrated the great potential of the molecular approach, namely, the possibility to gain a deep mechanistic understanding and a more precise control of the product selectivity. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in both the thermo&#8208; and electrochemical reductive homocoupling of CO2 toward C2+ products mediated by molecular catalysts. In addition, reductive CO homocoupling is discussed as a model for the further conversion of intermediates obtained from CO2 reduction, which may serve as a source of inspiration for developing novel molecular catalysts in the future.

&lt;p&gt;The conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into multicarbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) compounds by reductive homocoupling offers the possibility to transform renewable energy into chemical energy carriers and thereby create &#8220;carbon-neutral&#8221; fuels or other valuable products. Most available studies have employed heterogeneous metallic catalysts, but the use of molecular catalysts is still underexplored. However, several studies have already demonstrated the great potential of the molecular approach, namely, the possibility to gain a deep mechanistic understanding and a more precise control of the product selectivity. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in both the thermo- and electrochemical reductive homocoupling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; toward C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products mediated by molecular catalysts. In addition, reductive CO homocoupling is discussed as a model for the further conversion of intermediates obtained from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, which may serve as a source of inspiration for developing novel molecular catalysts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Studying the Key Intermediate of RNA Autohydrolysis by Cryogenic Gas&#8208;Phase Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA autohydrolysis is a generic phenomenon in solution and proceeds via a 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic nucleotide intermediate. Cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations show that the structure of c&#8208;fragments generated by the dissociation of RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase is equal to the key intermediate of RNA autohydrolysis. Furthermore, the data show that the nucleobase in cytidine phosphate readily tautomerizes in the gas phase.







Abstract
Over the course of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, mRNA&#8208;based vaccines have gained tremendous importance. The development and analysis of modified RNA molecules benefit from advanced mass spectrometry and require sufficient understanding of fragmentation processes. Analogous to the degradation of RNA in solution by autohydrolysis, backbone cleavage of RNA strands was equally observed in the gas phase; however, the fragmentation mechanism remained elusive. In this work, autohydrolysis&#8208;like intermediates were generated from isolated RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase and investigated using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets. Data from both experiment and density functional theory provide evidence for the formation of a five&#8208;membered cyclic phosphate intermediate and rule out linear or six&#8208;membered structures. Furthermore, the experiments show that another prominent condensed&#8208;phase reaction of RNA nucleotides can be induced in the gas phase: the tautomerization of cytosine. Both observed reactions are therefore highly universal and intrinsic properties of the investigated molecules.

         <title>Generation and Release of OH Radicals from the Reaction of H2O with O2 over Soot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by the reaction of H2O with O2 over soot was revealed, which indicates the airborne soot particles generated by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons may entail important catalytic oxidation capacity.







Abstract
OH radicals in the air maintain the oxidizing power of the troposphere. A conventional view is that particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere is a major sink of OH radicals, thereby lowering the oxidizing power of atmosphere in the event of high&#8208;level PM. By contrary, our joint experimental/theoretical study reveals a new mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by carbonaceous soot particles. We show that water and O2 react on carbonaceous surfaces and give rise to gaseous OH radicals under irradiation. With ample delocalized &#960; electrons, carbonaceous surfaces enable the easy desorption of hydroxyl groups to produce gaseous OH radicals, evidenced by direct observation of the steady generation of OH radicals on a carbonaceous surface. Our results reveal a new chemical mechanism for the production of OH radicals.

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of Secondary and Tertiary Fluorides from &#946;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Ketoacids**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of secondary and tertiary fluorides is performed by the pyruvate aldolase HpcH and its engineered variants, utilizing &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids as non&#8208;native donor substrates. Rationalization of beneficial mutations and optimization of reaction conditions allowed for the chemoenzymatic preparation of fluorinated synthons with relevance to bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Fluorine is a critical element for the design of bioactive compounds, driving advances in selective and sustainable fluorination. However, stereogenic tertiary fluorides pose a synthetic challenge and are thus present in only a few approved drugs (fluticasone, solithromycin, and sofosbuvir). The aldol reaction of fluorinated donors provides an atom&#8208;economical approach to asymmetric C&#8722;F motifs via C&#8722;C bond formation. We report that the type II pyruvate aldolase HpcH and engineered variants perform addition of &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids (including fluoropyruvate, &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketobutyrate, and &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketovalerate) to diverse aldehydes. The reactivity of HpcH towards these fluoro&#8208;donors grants access to enantiopure secondary or tertiary fluorides. In addition to representing the first synthesis of tertiary fluorides via biocatalytic carboligation, the afforded products could improve the diversity of fluorinated building blocks and enable the synthesis of fluorinated drug analogs.

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Molecular Nitrogen Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Liquid Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation is industrially realized by mass production of ammonia, the principal intermediate nitrogen source for N&#8208;containing organic molecules. Instead, direct C&#8208;N bond formation from dinitrogen (N  2  ) is of great interest but remains a grand challenge. Here, by virtue of unique plasma&#8208;liquid interactions, we developed an environmentally benign one&#8208;pot approach to directly coupling benzene and N  2  , two naturally abundant yet chemically inert molecules, into value&#8208;added arylamines. Under the optimal conditions, an amination yield of 45% was rapidly achieved, far better than the reported benzene amination efficiency using ammonia. A tentative reaction mechanism was proposed involving the long&#8208;lived N  2  (A  3  &#931;  u  +  )&#160;and N  2  +  species, as evidenced by the key intermediates detected. With a deeper mechanistic understanding and by further optimizing plasma reactor, it is promising to realize cost&#8208;effective electrical amination of benzene with N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Ratiometric Emission to Differentiate Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular weight has an important bearing on the properties of supramolecular polymers. However, the intuitive differentiation for the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers remains challenging. Given this situation, establishing a reliable relationship between fluorescence properties and molecular weight may be a promising strategy. Herein, we prepared a supramolecular monomer  M1  with aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission characteristics. With the increasing  M1  concentration (0.100 &#8208; 100 mM), the average degree of polymerization (DP  DOSY  ) rose from 1.00 to 293. Meanwhile, the color changed from dark blue to cyan, finally to yellow&#8208;green in the same concentration range. Hence, the intuitive relationship between DP  DOSY  and fluorescence colors was constructed, allowing the visual differentiation of molecular weight. Moreover, the fluorescence color could be regulated by introducing competitive molecule to induce the depolymerization of supramolecular polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Kilogram&#8208;Scale Preparation of Highly Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of crystalline porous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is essential to realize their broad industrial applications but remains a great challenge, which requires the fundamental understanding of the two&#8208;dimensional polymerization mechanism. Herein, we report a universal polyphosphoric acid (H  6  P  4  O  13  )&#8208;catalyzed nitrile trimerization route to synthesize a series of highly crystalline CTFs with high specific surface areas. This new strategy enables the cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale fabrication of crystalline CTFs at kilogram level for the first time. Through density functional theory calculation and detailed controlled experiments, we reveal that the polyphosphate acid show much higher catalytic activity for trimerization reaction than its analogues such as P  2  O  5  and H  3  PO  4  . Furthermore, the crystalline CTFs with regular porosity and abundant triazine groups exhibit ultrahigh removal efficiency of micropollutants, indicating its great potential in environment remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Doping Chemistry for Nickel&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model study has been performed on Group IIIA element (boron and aluminum) co&#8208;doped high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathode materials to understand competitive doping chemistry. A notable difference between the atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of the hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen, resulting in the formation of a B&#8208;rich surface and an Al&#8208;rich bulk.







Abstract
Chemical modification of electrode materials by heteroatom dopants is crucial for improving storage performance in rechargeable batteries. Electron configurations of different dopants significantly influence the chemical interactions inbetween and the chemical bonding with the host material, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We revealed competitive doping chemistry of Group IIIA elements (boron and aluminum) taking nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials as a model. A notable difference between the atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of the hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen. Density functional theory calculations reveal, Al is preferentially bonded to oxygen and vice versa, and shows a much lower diffusion barrier than BIII. In the case of Al&#8208;preoccupation, the bulk diffusion of BIII is hindered. In this way, a B&#8208;rich surface and Al&#8208;rich bulk is formed, which helps to synergistically stabilize the structural evolution and surface chemistry of the cathode.

         <title>Single Stabilizing Point Mutation Enables High&#8208;Resolution Co&#8208;Crystal Structures of the Adenosine A2A Receptor with Preladenant Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;stable adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) containing a single point mutation in the transmembrane regions was developed by imitating an allosteric Na+ through introduction of a basic amino acid residue. This allowed the determination of high&#8208;resolution co&#8208;crystal structures with newly designed PEGylated and fluorophore&#8208;labeled Preladenant derivatives, which belong to the most potent A2AAR antagonists endowed with outstanding selectivity.







Abstract
The G protein&#8208;coupled adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) is an important new (potential) drug target in immuno&#8208;oncology, and for neurodegenerative diseases. Preladenant and its derivatives belong to the most potent A2AAR antagonists displaying exceptional selectivity. While crystal structures of the human A2AAR have been solved, mostly using the A2A&#8208;StaR2 protein that bears 9 point mutations, co&#8208;crystallization with Preladenant derivatives has so far been elusive. We developed a new A2AAR construct harboring a single point mutation (S913.39K) which renders it extremely thermostable. This allowed the co&#8208;crystallization of two novel Preladenant derivatives, the polyethylene glycol&#8208;conjugated (PEGylated) PSB&#8208;2113, and the fluorophore&#8208;labeled PSB&#8208;2115. The obtained crystal structures (2.25&#8197;&#197; and 2.6&#8197;&#197; resolution) provide explanations for the high potency and selectivity of Preladenant derivatives. They represent the first crystal structures of a GPCR in complex with PEG&#8208; and fluorophore&#8208;conjugated ligands. The applied strategy is predicted to be applicable to further class A GPCRs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dienyl and Allyl Esters from Propargyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent catalysis is a vital chemical tool that allows efficient access to large collections of structurally diverse molecules from a common precursor but remains a challenge. We reported a catalyst&#8208;controlled, tunable, and predictable regiodivergency in transforming the internal aliphatic propargyl esters into diverse libraries of highly substituted 1,3&#8208;dienyl and allyl products by Pd&#8208;catalysis. Depending on the ligand employed, palladium catalyst can involve two typical approaches: electrophilic palladium catalysis and sequential oxidation additive&#8208;reductive elimination pathway. This regiodivergent protocol endows facile access to four regioisomers with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity from the common propargyl esters. In terms of synthetic utility, a notable feature of this protocol is amenable to structural diversification of bioactive relevant molecules, enabling rapid assembly of many useful structural analogs of pharmaceutical candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the High&#8208;Pressure Phase Behaviour of Highly Compressible Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks: From Discontinuous to Continuous Pore Closure by Linker Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the ratio of different imidazolate linkers modulates a high&#8208;pressure open&#8208;pore to closed&#8208;pore phase transition of a series of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) from first order to second order. The second&#8208;order phase transition allows finetuning the pore structure of the framework material by regulation of the mechanical pressure.







Abstract
The high&#8208;pressure behaviour of flexible zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) of the ZIF&#8208;62 family with the chemical composition M(im)2&#8722;x(bim)x is presented (M2+=Zn2+, Co2+; im&#8722;=imidazolate; bim&#8722;=benzimidazolate, 0.02&#8804;x&#8804;0.37). High&#8208;pressure powder X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that the materials contract reversibly from an open pore (op) to a closed pore (cp) phase under a hydrostatic pressure of up to 4000&#8197;bar. Sequentially increasing the bim&#8722; fraction (x) reinforces the framework, leading to an increased threshold pressure for the op&#8208;to&#8208;cp phase transition, while the total volume contraction across the transition decreases. Most importantly, the typical discontinuous op&#8208;to&#8208;cp transition (first order) changes to an unusual continuous transition (second order) for x&#8805;0.35. This allows finetuning of the void volume and the pore size of the material continuously by adjusting the pressure, thus opening new possibilities for MOFs in pressure&#8208;switchable devices, membranes, and actuators.

&lt;/sub&gt;(bim)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is presented (M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;=Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; im&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=imidazolate; bim&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=benzimidazolate, 0.02&#8804;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8804;0.37). High-pressure powder X-ray diffraction shows that the materials contract reversibly from an open pore (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;op&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) to a closed pore (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;cp&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) phase under a hydrostatic pressure of up to 4000&#8197;bar. Sequentially increasing the bim&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fraction (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) reinforces the framework, leading to an increased threshold pressure for the &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;op&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;cp&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; phase transition, while the total volume contraction across the transition decreases. Most importantly, the typical discontinuous &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;op&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;cp&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; transition (first order) changes to an unusual continuous transition (second order) for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8805;0.35. This allows finetuning of the void volume and the pore size of the material continuously by adjusting the pressure, thus opening new possibilities for MOFs in pressure-switchable devices, membranes, and actuators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Structure Changes of an Aromatic Amine Photoacid along the F&#246;rster Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids show a strong increase in acidity in the first electronic excited state, enabling real&#8208;time studies of proton transfer in acid&#8208;base reactions, proton transport in energy storage devices and biomolecular sensor protein systems. Several explanations have been proposed for what determines photoacidity, ranging from variations in solvation free energy to changes in electronic structure occurring along the four stages of the F&#246;rster cycle. Here we use picosecond nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy to monitor the electronic structure changes of the proton donating group in a protonated aromatic amine photoacid in solution upon photoexcitation and subsequent proton transfer dynamics. Probing core&#8208;to&#8208;valence transitions locally at the amine functional group and with orbital specificity, we clearly reveal pronounced electronic structure, dipole moment and energetic changes on the conjugate photobase side. This result paves the way for a detailed electronic structural characterization of the photoacidity phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Euglenatides, Potent Antiproliferative Cyclic Peptides Isolated from the Freshwater Photosynthetic Microalga Euglena gracilis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By limiting the nitrogen source to glutamic acid, we isolated cyclic peptides from  Euglena gracilis  containing asparagine and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids. Structure elucidation was accomplished through spectroscopic methods, mass spectrometry and chemical degradation. The euglenatides potently inhibit pathogenic fungi and cancer cell lines e.g., euglenatide B exhibiting IC  50  values of 4.3 mM in ketoconazole resistant  Aspergillus  fumigatus  and 0.29 mM in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. In an unprecedented convergence of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis between unicellular species and the metazoan kingdom, euglenatides bear resemblance to nemamides from  Caenorhabditis elegans  and inhibited both producing organisms  E. gracilis  and  C. elegans  . By molecular network analysis, we detected over forty euglenatide&#8208;like metabolites in  E. gracilis  ,  E. sanguinea  and  E. mutabilis  , suggesting an important biological role for these natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Affinity Purification of Long&#8208;Acting PASylated Proteins with Therapeutic Potential Using L&#8208;Prolinamide for Mild Elution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both insufficient plasma half&#8208;life (circulation for only few hours or less) and laborious downstream purification can be bottlenecks for biological drug development. We report a novel strategy for the efficient and gentle affinity purification of pharmacologically relevant proteins modified by PASylation for prolonged action&#160;  in vivo  . We previously described antibodies specific for Pro/Ala&#8208;rich sequences (PAS) covering a range of binding characteristics. Our approach relies on a chromatography matrix functionalized with a low&#8208;affinity PAS&#8208;specific antibody Fab fragment for specific adsorption of the PASylated protein from a macromolecular mixture. With the complete absence of hydrophobic/aromatic or ionic groups in the PAS sequence epitope, binding is mediated by Van der Waals contacts and distinct hydrogen bonds only. Surprisingly, selective competitive elution is achieved by application of the highly soluble and biologically inactive imino acid derivative L&#8208;prolinamide. Based on the specific but strongly dynamic biomolecular interaction, our procedure allows the direct one&#8208;step purification of PASylated proteins from a cell extract or culture supernatant while avoiding harsh elution conditions as they are often needed for conventional affinity chromatography.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of cost&#8208;effective and long&#8208;life rechargeable aluminium ion batteries (AIBs) shows promising prospects for sustainable energy storage applications. Here, we report a heteroatom &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer featuring synergistic C=O and C=N active centres as a new cathode material in AIBs using a low&#8208;cost AlCl  3  /urea electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the fused C=N sites in polymer not only benefit good &#960;&#8208;conjugation but also enhance the redox reactivity of C=O sites, which enables the polymer to accommodate four AlCl  2  (urea)  2  +  per repeating unit. By integrating the polymer with carbon nanotubes, the hybrid cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity and a long cycle life (295 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  and 85 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 1 A g  &#8208;1  over 4000 cycles). The achieved specific energy density of 413 Wh kg  &#8208;1  outperforms most Al&#8208;organic batteries reported to date. The synergistic redoxactive sites strategy sheds light on the rational design of organic electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclizations by Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsule Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular capsules enable the conversion of substrates inside a closed cavity, mimicking to some extent enzymatic catalysis. Chirality transfer from the molecular capsule onto the encapsulated substrate has been only studied in a few cases. Here we demonstrate that chirality transfer is possible inside a rather large molecular container of approximately 1400 &#197;  3  . Specifically, we present (1) the first examples of optically active hexameric resorcin[4]arene capsules, (2) their ability to enantioselectively catalyze tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclizations, and (3) the surprisingly high sensitivity of enantioselectivity on the structural modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Based Linear Nonalternant Nanoribbons with Bright Emission and Ambipolar Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly soluble linear non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons (NNR&#8208;1 to NNR&#8208;4) featuring pentagonal rings peri&#8208;fused onto repeating perylene units have been synthesized by a stepwise approach. The NNRs adopt a twisted nanoribbon structure and exhibit large molar extinction coefficients (up to 400860&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), high absolute quantum efficiencies (up to 82&#8201;%), and narrowed energy gaps (down to &#8776;1.7&#8197;eV) as well as excellent redox properties.







Abstract
Here we report stepwise solution&#8208;synthesis of linear nonalternant nanoribbons (NNRs), featuring pentagonal rings peri&#8208;fused onto the repeating perylene unit. The X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures demonstrated their &#960;&#8208;backbones as a twisted ribbon, with the longest crystalline length of the nanoribbon up to 3.9&#8197;nm. NNRs exhibited an orange to deep&#8208;red photoluminescence even under the room light, with absolute &#934;F up to 82&#8201;%, most likely due to ring&#8208;strain induced molecular stiffness. Benefiting from the enlarged size and the antiaromatic character of pentagons, all of NNRs possessed ambipolar redox properties, especially for longer nanoribbons showing multiple reversible reductions and oxidations. In addition, experimental and theoretical results indicated a ground state open&#8208;shell singlet diradicaloid for the dication of longer NNRs. Our studies reveal the intriguing nonalternant structures and physical properties of this type of nanoribbons, involving the striking effects of the multiple annulated pentagons, and also provide fundamental insights into their electronic structures.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Confined Indium Oxides for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction in a Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Flow Cell</title>

A robust carbon&#8208;covered indium oxide electrocatalyst demonstrates an enhanced and stable activity for the direct production of formic acid in a solid&#8208;state carbon dioxide electrolyzer.







Abstract
Developing robust electrocatalysts and advanced devices is important for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction toward the generation of valuable chemicals. We present herein a carbon&#8208;confined indium oxide electrocatalyst for stable and efficient CO2 reduction. The reductive corrosion of oxidative indium to the metallic state during electrolysis could be prevented by carbon protection, and the applied carbon layer also optimizes the reaction intermediate adsorption, which enables both high selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, the formate selectivity exceeds 90&#8201;% in a wide potential window from &#8722;0.8&#8197;V to &#8722;1.3&#8197;V vs. RHE. The continuous production of ca. 0.12&#8197;M pure formic acid solution is further demonstrated at a current density of 30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a solid&#8208;state electrolyte mediated reactor. This work provides significant concepts in the parallel development of electrocatalysts and devices for carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.

         <title>Engineering Highly Reduced Molybdenum Polyoxometalates via the Incorporation of d and f Block Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel types of highly reduced Mo polyoxometalates, the {Mo64} cube and {Mo70} star, are obtained through near&#8208;hydrothermal conditions with incorporations of nickel and lanthanide ions and possess a set of building blocks different to those present in Mo blues and browns. With a few of other rare structures, this group of polyoxomolybdates is redefined as Mo reds based on the major differences in building blocks and reduction degrees.







Abstract
The assembly of nanoscale polyoxometalate (POM) clusters has been dominated by the highly reduced icosahedral {Mo132} &#8220;browns&#8221; and the toroidal {Mo154} &#8220;blues&#8221; which are 45&#8201;% and 18&#8201;% reduced, respectively. We hypothesised that there is space for a greater diversity of structures in this immediate reduction zone. Here we show it is possible to make highly reduced mix&#8208;valence POMs by presenting new classes of polyoxomolybdates: [MoV52MoVI12H26O200]42&#8722; {Mo64} and [MoV40MoVI30H30O215]20&#8722; {Mo70}, 81&#8201;% and 57&#8201;% reduced, respectively. The {Mo64} cluster archetype has a super&#8208;cube structure and is composed of five different types of building blocks, each arranged in overlayed Archimedean or Platonic polyhedra. The {Mo70} cluster comprises five tripodal {MoV6} and five tetrahedral {MoV2MoVI2} building blocks alternatively linked to form a loop with a pentagonal star topology. We also show how the reaction yielding the {Mo64} super&#8208;cube can be used in the enrichment of lanthanides which exploit the differences in selectivity in the self&#8208;assembly of the polyoxometalates.

         <title>Enantioselective Seleno&#8208;Michael Addition Reactions Catalyzed by a Chiral Bifunctional N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene with Noncovalent Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Michael reaction is a conjugate addition and is one of the most powerful methods with which to prepare functional molecules with a &#946;&#8208;stereogenic center. Despite its success in the formation of various asymmetric carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, enantioselective seleno&#8208;Michael addition remains essentially unexplored. We report here a highly enantioselective Michael addition reaction of alkyl selenols to enones. This method conveniently introduces a Se atom to an electron&#8208;deficient double bond asymmetrically. A chiral bifunctional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/thiourea catalyst was developed as a key ingredient that delivers chiral &#946;&#8208;seleno ketones with remarkable selectivity. This new catalyst and its mode of action support broad applications in the catalytic activation of nucleophilic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Characterization and Theoretical Calculations Identify Partially Reduced ZnO1&#8208;x/Cu Interfaces for Methanol Synthesis from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active site of the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al  2  O  3  catalyst used in CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol has been debated for decades. Grand challenges remain in the characterization of structure, composition, and chemical state, both microscopically and spectroscopically, and complete theoretical calculations are limited when it comes to describing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst over the diverse range of structures that emerge under realistic conditions. Here a series of inverse model catalysts of ZnO on copper hydroxide were prepared where the size of ZnO was precisely tuned from atomically dispersed species to nanoparticles using atomic layer deposition. ZnO decoration boosted methanol formation to a rate of 877 g  MeOH  kg  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  with ~80% selectivity at 493 K. High pressure in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the atomically dispersed ZnO species are prone to aggregate at oxygen&#8208;deficient ZnO ensembles instead of forming CuZn metal alloys. By modeling various potential active structures, density functional theory calculations and microkinetic simulations revealed that ZnO/Cu interfaces with oxygen vacancies, rather than stoichiometric interfaces, were essential to catalytic activation.</dc:description>

By modeling various potential active structures, density functional theory calculations and microkinetic simulations revealed that ZnO/Cu interfaces with oxygen vacancies, rather than stoichiometric interfaces, were essential to catalytic activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning an Imine Reductase for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Azacycloalkylamines by Concise Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering</title>

         <dc:description>Although imine reductases (IREDs) are emerging as attractive reductive aminases (RedAms), their substrate scope is still narrow, and rational engineering is rare. Focusing on hydrogen bond reorganization and cavity expansion, a concise strategy combining rational cavity design, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST), and thermostability engineering was designed, that transformed the weakly active IR&#8208;G36 into a variant M5 with superior performance for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylamino&#8208;1&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine, with a 4193&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, a 16.2 &#8451; improvement in Tm, and a significant increase in the e.e. value from 78% (R) to &gt;99% (R). M5 exhibits broad substrate scope for the synthesis of diverse azacycloalkylamines, and the reaction was demonstrated on a hectogram&#8208;scale under industrially relevant conditions. Our study provides a compelling example of the preparation of versatile and efficient IREDs, with exciting opportunities in medicinal and process chemistry as well as synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A clear understanding of the acidic properties of bridging Si&#8208;OH&#8208;Al groups containing crystallographically different oxygen atoms in zeolites is a prerequisite for optimizing their performance as industrial solid catalysts and developing new acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, but presents many challenges.

We also report that the creation of a crystallographically particular type of bridging OH groups in zeolites and its concentration and acid strength can vary strongly with the content and spatial distribution of framework Al atoms, thus being synthetic in nature, which has been rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual pH&#8208; and Light&#8208;Responsive Spiropyrane&#8208;Based Surfactant: Investigations on Its Switching Behavior and Remote Control over Emulsion Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiropyrane&#8208;based cationic surfactant is presented. Its architecture renders the molecule dual&#8208;responsive, possessing thereby an unexpected switching behaviour: While photo&#8208;stimulation influences the surface&#8208;active behaviour of the compound under acidified conditions, no notable photo&#8208;responsiveness is observed at pH&#8208;values &gt;6.5. This effect is demonstrated by manipulating the integrity of an oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion.







Abstract
A cationic surfactant containing a spiropyrane unit is prepared exhibiting a dual&#8208;responsive adjustability of its surface&#8208;active characteristics. The switching mechanism of the system relies on the reversible conversion of the non&#8208;ionic spiropyrane (SP) to a zwitterionic merocyanine (MC) and can be controlled by adjusting the pH value and via light, resulting in a pH&#8208;dependent photoactivity: While the compound possesses a pronounced difference in surface activity between both forms under acidic conditions, this behavior is suppressed at a neutral pH level. The underlying switching processes are investigated in detail, and a thermodynamic explanation based on a combination of theoretical and experimental results is provided. This complex stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior enables remote&#8208;control of colloidal systems. To demonstrate its applicability, the surfactant is utilized for the pH&#8208;dependent manipulation of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maturation of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase involves synthesis of a CO, CN&#8208;, and dithiomethylamine (DTMA)&#8208;coordinated 2Fe subcluster that is inserted into HydA to make the active hydrogenase. This process requires three maturation enzymes: the radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzymes HydE and HydG, and the GTPase HydF. In vitro maturation with purified maturation enzymes has been possible only when clarified cell lysate was added, with the lysate presumably providing essential components for DTMA synthesis and delivery. Here we report maturation of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase using a fully defined system that includes components of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), but no cell lysate. Our results reveal for the first time an essential role for the aminomethyl&#8208;lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;protein of the GCS in hydrogenase maturation and the synthesis of the DTMA ligand of the H&#8208;cluster. In addition, we show that ammonia is the source of the bridgehead nitrogen of DTMA.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Synthesis Enabled Sulfur Atom Strategy for Polymerization&#8208;Enhanced and Two&#8208;Photon Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free thiol&#8211;yne click reaction facilely afforded photosensitizers by using the in situ formed sulfur &#8220;heavy atom effect&#8221; to enhance the intersystem crossing. Combined with aggregation&#8208;induced emission and polymerization effects, excellent photosensitizers can be obtained for two&#8208;photon excited photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Facile tailoring of photosensitizers (PSs) with advanced and synergetic properties is highly expected to broaden and deepen photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. Herein, a catalyst&#8208;free thiol&#8211;yne click reaction was employed to develop the sulfur atom&#8208;based PSs by using the in situ formed sulfur &#8220;heavy atom effect&#8221; to enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC), while such an effect can be remarkably magnified by the polymerization. The introduction of a tetraphenylpyrazine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) unit was also advantageous in PS design by suppressing their non&#8208;radiative decay to facilitate the ISC in the aggregated state. Besides, the resulting sulfur atom electron donor, together with a double&#8208;bond &#960; bridge and AIE electron acceptor, created a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecular system with good two&#8208;photon excitation properties. Combined with the high singlet oxygen generation efficiency, the fabricated polymer nanoparticles exhibited an excellent in vitro two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited PDT towards cancer cells, therefore possessing a huge potential for the deep&#8208;tissue disease therapy.

The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a most promising and efficient route to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), yet the lack of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts have restricted its practical application. Herein, an entropy&#8208;enhancement strategy has been employed to enable the low&#8208;cost perovskite oxide to effectively catalyze the electrosynthesis of H2O2. The optimized Pb(NiWMnNbZrTi)1/6O3 ceramic is available on a kilogram&#8208;scale and displays commendable ORR activity in alkaline media with high selectivity over 91&#8201;% across the wide potential range for H2O2 including an outstanding degradation property for organic dyes through the Fenton process. The exceptional performance of this perovskite oxide is attributed to the entropy stabilization&#8208;induced polymorphic transformation assuring the robust structural stability, decreased charge mobility as well as synergistic catalytic effects which we confirm using advanced in situ Raman, transient photovoltage, Rietveld refinement as well as finite elemental analysis.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Borylation of Pyridines with Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of a wide range of pyridines using pinacolborane was achieved through yttrium catalysis. Notably, the possible hydroboration side reaction was effectively suppressed by using the proper ligand/metal combination. The resultant 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates were subjected to further transformations such as a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling or the Chan&#8211;Lam amination.







Abstract
This work reports a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyridines at the ortho&#8208;position with pinacolborane enabled by an yttrocene catalyst. The reaction provides a new family of 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates with a broad substrate scope and high atom efficiency. The resultant boronates were able to undergo a variety of transformations, e.g., oxidation, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, Chan&#8211;Lam amination and etherification. Catalytic intermediates, including ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H metalated and borylated complexes, were isolated from stoichiometric experiments and confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Peptide Backbone Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Merocyanine Oligomers into Duplex Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of peptide backbone connected merocyanine oligomers leads to the formation of DNA&#8208;like duplex structures containing two, four, and six chromophores. Whether self&#8208;assembly or folding is preferred depends on the length of the oligomers, as well as the concentration and polarity of the solvents.







Abstract
The pseudopeptide backbone provided by N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;glycine oligomers with attached nucleobases has been widely utilized in peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as DNA mimics. Here we demonstrate the suitability of this backbone for the formation of structurally defined dye stacks. Toward this goal a series of peptide merocyanine (PMC) dye oligomers connected to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;glycine backbone were prepared through peptide synthesis. Our concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption studies show that under the control of dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, smaller&#8208;sized oligomers consisting of one, two or three dyes self&#8208;assemble into defined duplex structures containing two up to six chromophores. In contrast, upon further extension of the oligomer, the chosen peptide backbone cannot direct the formation of a defined duplex architecture anymore due to intramolecular aggregation between the dyes. For all aggregate species a moderate aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement is observed.

         <title>Widely Distributed Bifunctional Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Catalyze both Intramolecular C&#8722;C Bond Formation in cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr and Its Coupling with Nucleobases</title>

         <dc:description>
Bioinformatic analysis unveiled a widely distributed two&#8208;gene locus (gym) in actinobacteria. Reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathways and biochemical investigation led to the characterization of the cytochrome P450s GymBs as dual&#8208;functional oxidases, which catalyze both intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling reactions at different positions of cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr to generate novel tyrosine&#8208;based alkaloids.







Abstract
Tailoring enzymes are important modification biocatalysts in natural product biosynthesis. We report herein six orthologous two&#8208;gene clusters for mycocyclosin and guatyromycine biosynthesis. Expression of the cyclodipeptide synthase genes gymA1&#8211;gymA6 in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation of cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr as the major product. Reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathways in Streptomyces albus and biochemical investigation proved that the cytochrome P450 enzymes GymB1&#8211;GymB6 act as both intramolecular oxidases and intermolecular nucleobase transferases. They catalyze not only the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling within cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr, leading to mycocyclosin, but also its connection with guanine and hypoxanthine, and are thus responsible for the formation of tyrosine&#8208;containing guatyromycines, instead of the reported tryptophan&#8208;nucleobase adducts. Phylogenetic data suggest the presence of at least 47 GymB orthologues, indicating the occurrence of a widely distributed enzyme class.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of 2&#8208;Vinylbenzyl Alcohols with Chiral Boro&#8208;Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral boro&#8208;phosphates were developed from chiral phosphoric acids and Piers&#8217; borane via the release of H2. A highly enantioselective hydroalkoxylation of 2&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohols was further demonstrated, furnishing optically active 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives in high yields with up to 97&#8201;% ee. It is supposed that these boro&#8208;phosphates possibly interact with the substrates through O&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
Asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of alkenes represents a very important approach to access optically active cyclic ethers. It was found that B(C6F5)3 could catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohols with only 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading, affording the desired product in high yields. To accomplish the asymmetric reaction, a novel type of chiral boro&#8208;phosphates was developed by treating chiral phosphoric acid with Piers&#8217; borane, in which the oxygen atom of P=O and the boron atom act as Lewis base and acid centers, respectively. A highly enantioselective hydroalkoxylation was successfully realized to give optically active 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives in 78&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 60&#8211;97&#8201;% ee's, in which an activation of O&#8722;H bond of alcohols by the boro&#8208;phosphate species is hypothesized.

         <title>Chemoselective and Diastereoselective Intramolecular (3+2) Cycloadditions of Epoxy and Aziridinyl Enolsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in diastereoselective intramolecular stepwise (3+2) cycloadditions with acyclic dienes, outcompeting the (4+3) cycloaddition pathway almost exclusively. Computations reveal the factors behind this preference. Optically&#8208;enriched trans&#8208;hydrindanone cycloadducts can be generated.







Abstract
Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in highly chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular (3+2) cycloadditions with a range of dienes and olefins. With acyclic dienes, the (3+2) cycloaddition outcompetes the (4+3) pathway traditionally observed in this kind of system almost exclusively. With both conjugated dienes and isolated olefins, excellent diastereoselectivities are observed, and cycloadducts can be obtained in optically&#8208;enriched forms. Computational studies indicate that the stepwise (3+2) cycloaddition involves an activated epoxy/aziridinyl intermediate and the conformational flexibility of the intermediate determines the preference for (3+2) cycloadduct formation. Further transformations of the (3+2) cycloadducts produce densely functionalized trans&#8208;hydrindane scaffolds.

         <title>A Liquid Interfacial SERS Platform on a Nanoparticle Array Stabilized by Rigid Probes for the Quantification of Norepinephrine in Rat Brain Microdialysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high reproducibility liquid interfacial SERS platform was created for the accurate quantification of the variation of norepinephrine (NE) in rat brain microdialysis during stress. Rigid probe molecules efficiently fixed the interparticle gap, guaranteeing reproducible SERS analysis and selective recognition of NE. Using this powerful tool, it was discovered that the treatment of stress induced anxiety was regulated by c&#8208;fos.







Abstract
For the reliable determination of trace chemicals in the brain, we created a SERS platform based on a functionalized AuNPs array formed at a liquid/liquid interface in a uniform fashion over a large substrate area through ternary regulations for real&#8208;time quantification of trace norepinephrine (NE). The rigid molecule, 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;ylethynyl)&#8208;benzaldehyde (RP1) was designed and co&#8208;assembled at AuNPs with 4&#8208;mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) to chemically define NE via dual recognition. Meanwhile, the rigid structure assembly of RP1 and MPBA efficiently fixed the interparticle gap, guaranteeing reproducible SERS analysis. Furthermore, the Raman peak of C&#8801;C group in the silent region was taken as a response element to further improve the accuracy. Combined with microdialysis, this SERS platform was developed for in&#8208;the&#8208;field testing of NE in rat brain microdialysates following anxiety.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylacylation of Allenes Using Acylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of a C&#8722;Si bond in acylsilanes across allenes is reported. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, in which a silyl group binds to the central carbon of the allene, allowing for the straightforward access to functionalized alkenylsilane derivatives.







Abstract
We have developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of a C&#8722;Si bond of acylsilanes across a range of unactivated allenes. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, in which a silyl group binds to the central carbon of the allene, allowing for the straightforward access to functionalized alkenylsilane derivatives.

         <title>Bifunctional WC&#8208;Supported RuO2 Nanoparticles for Robust Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique 0D/2D WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11&#8197;wt.%) were constructed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, applying a cell voltage of 1.66&#8197;V to realize acidic overall water splitting (OWS) with excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
We report the strong catalyst&#8211;support interaction in WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2&#8208;WC NPs) anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11&#8197;wt.%), which significantly promotes the oxygen evolution reaction activity with a &#951;10 of 347&#8197;mV and a mass activity of 1430&#8197;A&#8201;gRu&#8722;1, eight&#8208;fold higher than that of commercial RuO2 (176&#8197;A&#8201;gRu&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong catalyst&#8211;support interaction between RuO2 and the WC support could optimize the surrounding electronic structure of Ru sites to reduce the reaction barrier. Considering the likewise excellent catalytic ability for hydrogen production, an acidic overall water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer with a good stability constructed by bifunctional RuO2&#8208;WC NPs only requires a cell voltage of 1.66&#8197;V to afford 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The unique 0D/2D nanoarchitectures rationally combining a WC support with precious metal oxides provides a promising strategy to tradeoff the high catalytic activity and low cost for acidic OWS applications.

         <title>Activating a [FeFe] Hydrogenase Mimic for Hydrogen Evolution under Visible Light**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precious metal&#8208;free photocatalyst PS&#8208;CAT consisting of a [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic was utilized in the scope of hydrogen generation under visible light. The dyad comprising a &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligothiophene as light absorber shows a remarkably high photocatalytic activity. In accordance with theory, operando EPR spectroscopy using BIH as sacrificial donor reveals the generation of an active [FeIFe0] species during the irradiation experiment.







Abstract
Inspired by the active center of the natural [FeFe] hydrogenases, we designed a compact and precious metal&#8208;free photosensitizer&#8208;catalyst dyad (PS&#8208;CAT) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. PS&#8208;CAT represents a prototype dyad comprising &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligothiophenes as light absorbers. PS&#8208;CAT and its interaction with the sacrificial donor 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazoline were studied by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical techniques and visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic investigations. Operando EPR spectroscopy revealed the formation of an active [FeIFe0] species&#8212;in accordance with theoretical calculations&#8212;presumably driving photocatalysis effectively (TON&#8776;210).

         <title>Cylindrical C96 Fullertubes: A Highly Active Metal&#8208;Free O2&#8208;Reduction Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen reduction electrocatalytic behavior of C60, C70 (spheroidal fullerenes), and C90, C96, and C100 (tubular fullerenes) is explored using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques. C96 (a metal&#8208;free catalyst) displayed remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with an onset potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a halfway potential of 0.75&#8197;V, which are close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C benchmark catalyst values.







Abstract
A new isolation protocol was recently reported for highly purified metallic Fullertubes D5h&#8208;C90, D3d&#8208;C96, and D5d&#8208;C100, which exhibit unique electronic features. Here, we report the oxygen reduction electrocatalytic behavior of C60, C70 (spheroidal fullerenes), and C90, C96, and C100 (tubular fullerenes) using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. C96 (a metal&#8208;free catalyst) displayed remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with an onset potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a halfway potential of 0.75&#8197;V, which are close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C benchmark catalyst values. We achieved an excellent power density of 0.75&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using C96 as a modified cathode in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell, comparable to other recently reported efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts. Combined band structure (experimentally calculated) and free&#8208;energy (DFT) investigations show that both favorable energy&#8208;level alignment active catalytic sites on the carbon cage are responsible for the superior activity of C96.

         <title>Nickel/Copper&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Benzylation of Aldimine Esters for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first asymmetric Ni/Cu cocatalyzed benzylation of aldimine esters is reported. A series of benzyl substituted &#945;&#8208;quaternary amino acids could be synthesized in high yield and with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 90% yield and 99% ee). The experimental and theoretical calculation results suggested that the strong electrophilicity of the  &#951;3&#8208;benzylnickel intermediate is crucial for the high reactivity, enabling the reaction under base&#8208;free conditions. Furthermore, this method has been applied to the synthesis of the cell adhesion inhibitor BIRT&#8208;377 analogues, and the key intermediate of NK1 receptor antagonist PD154075 and CCK&#8208;B receptor antagonist CI&#8208;988.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Aminocarbonylation of Ethers: Efficient Access to &#945;&#8208;Amide Substituted Ether Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethers are of central importance in the fields of biomass, energy, and organic chemistry. Herein, a novel cobalt&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative coupling of ethers with amines to construct &#945;&#8208;carbonylated ethers has been achieved. Remarkably, Alfuzosin, a medicine for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), can be synthesized by this process straightforwardly. Notably, this protocol presents the first example on the direct carbonylative reaction of ethers.</dc:description>
