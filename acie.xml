         <title>&#960;&#8208;Stacked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dendrimers for Highly Efficient White Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton. The dendritic structure and orthogonal configuration of teracridan not only make their outer acridan segments approaching to acceptor in close distance, but also fix donor and acceptor in face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment, leading to through&#8208;space charge transfer emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) effect. By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region. Solution&#8208;processed two&#8208;color white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on blue and yellow &#960;&#8208;stacked donor&#8208;acceptor dendrimers exhibit the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6% and maximum power efficiency of 58.9 lm W  &#8208;1  , representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency for all&#8208;TADF white OLEDs by solution process.</dc:description>

         <title>General Synthesis of Ordered Mesoporous Carbonaceous Hybrid Nanostructures with Molecularly Dispersed Polyoxometallates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100 %) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80 h).</dc:description>

         <title>Na&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B Bond in NaBH3&#8722;: Solving the Conundrum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifaceted bond: High level Valence Bond calculations show that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster is stabilized neither by a dative bond nor by a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond, but rather by a unique combination of three distinct components that are accurately quantified.







Abstract
Bonding in the recently synthesized NaBH3&#8722; cluster is investigated using the high level Valence Bond BOVB method. Contrary to earlier conclusions, the Na&#8722;B bond is found to be neither a genuine dative bond, nor a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond at equilibrium. It is rather revealed as a split and polarized weakly coupled electron&#8208;pair, which allows this cluster to be more effectively stabilized by a combination of (major) dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interaction and (secondary) resonant one&#8208;electron bonding mechanism. Our analysis of this unprecedented bonding situation extends to similar clusters, and the VB model unifies and articulates the previously published variegated views on this exotic &#8220;bond&#8221;.

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes catalyze a vast variety of reactions rendering the regulation of their activity a key method to control biological function. In this work, we report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for the coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis. Firstly, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin inhibiting its catalytic activity. With both ultrasound generating inertial cavitation (20 kHz) and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound (5 MHz), the specific interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved restoring the activity of thrombin to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Secondly, we expanded this approach to split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. Notably, the latter process is reversible and can be induced multiple times without apparent fatigue. We envision that this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach to regulate the activity of aptamer&#8208;guarded enzymes by ultrasound will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli and open further avenues in sonogenetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Telluroxane Bowls Connected by a Layer of Iodine Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenyltelluroxane clusters of the composition [{(PhTe)  19  O  24  }  2  I  18  (solv)] (  1  ) are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI  3  ]  2  or the oxidation of various phenyltellurium(II) compounds with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. The compounds consist of two half&#8208;spheres with a {(PhTe)  19  O  24  }  9+  network, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The spherical clusters can accommodate solvent molecules such as pyridine or methanol in the center of two rings formed by iodine atoms. The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}  3+  units of each half&#8208;sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)  18  ({Ca(H  2  O)  2  }O  24  }  2  I  16  ] (  2  ) and [{(PhTe)  18  ({Y(NO  3  )&#173;(H  2  O)}O  24  }  2  I  16  ] (  3  ). A crownether&#8208;like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H  2  O}  2  }  2+  and {Y(NO  3  )(H  2  O)}  2+  building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Self&#8208;Assembly Changes its Course: A Leap from Simple Polymers to 3D&#8197;Networks of Spherical Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discontinuous switch in the three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly between [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)], AgSbF6, and NC(CH2)xCN (x=1&#8211;10) from simple coordination polymers to polycationic host&#8211;guest assemblies connected by dinitrile linkers was discovered. In addition to diverse 1D&#8211;3D coordination polymers, two different types of host&#8211;guest complexes were obtained, embedded in a 3D&#8197;polymeric network.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly reactions of the polyphosphorus complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (A), a coinage metal salt AgSbF6, and flexible aliphatic dinitriles NC(CH2)xCN (x=1&#8211;10) yield 1D, 2D, and 3D coordination polymers.

&lt;p&gt;A discontinuous switch in the three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly between [Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)], AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and NC(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;CN (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=1&#8211;10) from simple coordination polymers to polycationic host&#8211;guest assemblies connected by dinitrile linkers was discovered. In addition to diverse 1D&#8211;3D coordination polymers, two different types of host&#8211;guest complexes were obtained, embedded in a 3D&#8197;polymeric network.

&lt;p&gt;One&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly reactions of the polyphosphorus complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;), a coinage metal salt AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and flexible aliphatic dinitriles NC(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;CN (x=1&#8211;10) yield 1D, 2D, and 3D coordination polymers. The seven&#8208;membered backbone of the dinitrile was experimentally found as the borderline for the self&#8208;assembly system furnishing products of different kinds. At x&amp;lt;7, various rather simple polymers are exclusively formed possessing either 0D or 1D Ag/&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; structural motifs connected by dinitrile spacers, while at x&#8805;7, the self&#8208;assembly switches to unprecedented extraordinary 3D&#8197;networks of nano&#8208;sized host&#8211;guest assemblies (SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)@[(&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;11+&lt;/sup&gt; (x=7) or (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;)@[(&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12+&lt;/sup&gt; (x=8&#8211;10) linked by dinitriles.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Bound Isolated Dimers in the Gas Phase: Observation of the Shortest Intermolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Distance via Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Head&#8208;on Collision: Isolated gas phase triphenylmethane based dimers containing dispersion energy donors form a head&#8208;to&#8208;head structure with an extremely short C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C distance with a collinear arrangement of atoms. This surprising result from molecular beam experiments indicates that it is London dispersion but not crystal packing, responsible for this peculiar structural arrangement.







Abstract
The triphenylmethane and all&#8208;meta tert&#8208;butyl triphenylmethane dimers, (TPM)2 and (T&#8201;tBuPM)2, respectively, were studied with ionization loss stimulated Raman spectroscopy in molecular beam experiments to resolve structure sensitive vibrations. This answers the question whether the recently reported linear head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement in (T&#8201;tBuPM)2 results from crystal packing or prevails also in the gas phase, and therefore must result from extraordinarily strong London dispersion (LD) interactions. Our study clearly demonstrates that the head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement is maintained even under isolated molecular beam conditions in the absence of crystal packing effects. The central Raman&#8208;active aliphatic C&#8722;D vibration of appropriately deuterated (T&#8201;tBuPM)2 associated with an unusually short C&#8722;D&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;D&#8722;C distance exhibits a strong blue&#8208;shift compared to the undisturbed case. As the LD stabilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups are absent in (TPM)2, it displays an approximately S6&#8208;symmetric tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement.

         <title>Recombinant Spider Silk Gels Derived from Aqueous&#8211;Organic Solvents as Depots for Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Apart from the fact that spider silk hydrogels can serve as drug depots for water&#8208;soluble drugs, recombinant spider silk proteins can also assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich structures in aqueous&#8211;organic binary systems. The organic&#8208;phase content of these non&#8208;toxic, biocompatible gels allows the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs for various applications.







Abstract
Hydrogels are widely used in various biomedical applications, as they cannot only serve as materials for biofabrication but also as depots for the administration of drugs. However, the possibilities of formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in hydrogels are rather limited. Herein, we assembled recombinant spider silk gels using a new processing route with aqueous&#8211;organic co&#8208;solvents, and the properties of these gels could be controlled by the choice of the co&#8208;solvent. The presence of the organic co&#8208;solvent further enabled the incorporation of hydrophobic drugs as exemplarily shown for 6&#8208;mercaptopurine. The developed gels showed shear&#8208;thinning behaviour and could be easily injected to serve, for example, as drug depots, and they could even be 3D printed to serve as scaffolds for biofabrication. With this new processing route, the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in spider silk&#8208;based depots is possible, circumventing common pharmaceutical solubility issues.

         <title>Massive Pressure Amplification by Stimulated Contraction of Mesoporous Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative Gas Adsorption is a unique counterintuitive phenomenon of responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks hitherto only observed below atmospheric pressure. Carbon dioxide stimulates contraction at high absolute pressure inducing massive pressure amplification exceeding 500&#8197;kPa.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate mesoporous frameworks interacting with carbon dioxide leading to stimulated structural contractions and massive out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pressure amplification well beyond ambient pressure. Carbon dioxide, a non&#8208;toxic and non&#8208;flammable working medium, is promising for the development of pressure&#8208;amplifying frameworks for pneumatic technologies and safety systems. The strong interaction of the fluid with the framework even contracts DUT&#8208;46, a framework hitherto considered as non&#8208;flexible. Synchrotron&#8208;based in&#8197;situ PXRD/adsorption experiments reveal the characteristic contraction pressure for DUT&#8208;49 pressure amplification in the range of 350&#8211;680&#8197;kPa. The stimulated framework contraction expels 1.1 to 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO2 leading to autonomous pressure amplification in a pneumatic demonstrator system up to 428&#8197;kPa. According to system level estimations even higher theoretical pressure amplification may be achieved between 535 and 1011&#8197;kPa.

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Emission from Off&#8208;Gases of Steel Industry by Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of a novel process is presented for the reduction of CO2 emissions occurring in the steel industry. The potential of using off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace for the dry reforming of the CH4 to valuable syngas is investigated theoretically and experimentally. A maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO2 and a CH4 conversion of 95&#8201;% was achieved at conditions relevant for the steel industry.







Abstract
In a novel process, CO2 and CH4 from the off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace are used in homogeneous reforming of those greenhouse gases to valuable syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO. Synthetic mixtures of the off&#8208;gases from those large apparatuses of steel industry are fed to a high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;pressure flow reactor at varying temperature, pressure, residence time, and mixing ratio of coke oven gas (COG) to blast furnace gas (BFG). In this study, a maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO2 and a CH4 conversion of 95&#8201;% could be achieved at 1350&#8201;&#176;C, 5.5&#8197;bar, and a COG/BFG ratio of 0.6. Significant carbonaceous deposits were formed but did not block the reactor tube in the operational time window allowing cyclic operation of the process. These measurements were based on prior thermodynamic analysis and kinetic predictions using an elementary&#8208;step reaction mechanism.

Synthetic mixtures of the off&#8208;gases from those large apparatuses of steel industry are fed to a high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;pressure flow reactor at varying temperature, pressure, residence time, and mixing ratio of coke oven gas (COG) to blast furnace gas (BFG). In this study, a maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion of 95&#8201;% could be achieved at 1350&#8201;&#176;C, 5.5&#8197;bar, and a COG/BFG ratio of 0.6. Significant carbonaceous deposits were formed but did not block the reactor tube in the operational time window allowing cyclic operation of the process. These measurements were based on prior thermodynamic analysis and kinetic predictions using an elementary&#8208;step reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Group 11 Borataalkene Complexes: Models for Alkene Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of neutral coinage&#8208;metal boryl complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]&#8722; containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The compounds are isoelectronic with alkene complexes, which are crucial intermediates in catalysis. Both the strength of binding and the propensity for deviation toward &#951;1 coordination are more favourable for Au over Ag and Cu.







Abstract
A series of linear late transition metal (M=Cu, Ag, Au and Zn) complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]&#8722; containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The [B=C]&#8722; moiety is isoelectronic with the C=C system of an alkene. Comparison across the series shows that in the solid&#8208;state, deviation between the &#951;2 and &#951;1 coordination mode occurs. A related zinc complex containing two [B=C]&#8722; ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the &#951;1 coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d10 complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the &#960;&#8208;system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the coordination mode and hence substrate activation.

         <title>Using the Mechanical Bond to Tune the Performance of a Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report rotaxanes containing a carbazole&#8208;containing TADF luminophore in which the mechanical bond improves key photophysical properties, including the photoluminescence quantum yield and the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest this is due to weak interactions between the axle and macrocycle, enforced by the mechanical bond.







Abstract
We report the characterization of rotaxanes based on a carbazole&#8208;benzophenone thermally activated delayed fluorescence luminophore. We find that the mechanical bond leads to an improvement in key photophysical properties of the emitter, notably an increase in photoluminescence quantum yield and a decrease in the energy difference between singlet and triplet states, as well as fine tuning of the emission wavelength, a feat that is difficult to achieve when using covalently bound substituents. Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest that this tuning of properties occurs due to weak interactions between the axle and the macrocycle that are enforced by the mechanical bond. This work highlights the benefits of using the mechanical bond to refine existing luminophores, providing a new avenue for emitter optimization that can ultimately increase the performance of these molecules.

         <title>New Aldehyde&#8208;Functional Methacrylic Water&#8208;Soluble Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer (AGEO5MA) was prepared by oxidation of GEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C. RAFT aqueous polymerization yielded PAGEO5MA homopolymer, which was oxidized using sub&#8208;stoichiometric periodate/cis&#8208;diol molar ratios to yield hydrophilic statistical copolymers with cis&#8208;diol and aldehyde groups. Three PGEO5MA&#8208;based diblock copolymers were converted into aldehyde&#8208;functional copolymers, which were derivatized with amino acids.







Abstract
Aldehyde groups enable facile conjugation to proteins, enzymes, oligonucleotides or fluorescent dyes, yet there are no literature examples of water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional vinyl monomers. We report the synthesis of a new hydrophilic cis&#8208;diol&#8208;based methacrylic monomer (GEO5MA) by transesterification of isopropylideneglycerol penta(ethylene glycol) using methyl methacrylate followed by acetone deprotection via acid hydrolysis. The corresponding water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer, AGEO5MA, is prepared by aqueous periodate oxidation of GEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C. RAFT polymerization of GEO5MA yields the water&#8208;soluble homopolymer, PGEO5MA. Aqueous periodate oxidation of the terminal cis&#8208;diol units on PGEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C affords a water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional homopolymer (PAGEO5MA). Moreover, a library of hydrophilic statistical copolymers bearing cis&#8208;diol and aldehyde groups was prepared using sub&#8208;stoichiometric periodate/cis&#8208;diol molar ratios. The aldehyde groups on PAGEO5MA homopolymer were reacted in turn with three amino acids to demonstrate synthetic utility.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning&#160;of Chiral Microenvironments within Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates for Enhanced Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the formation of an unexpected and unique family of multi&#8208;chiral helicates with self&#8208;amplifying enantioselectivity. Crystal structures show that these triple&#8208;stranded Zn  II  2  L  3  complexes are held together by subcomponent assembly of axially chiral diamine&#8208;functionalized 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenol ditopic with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and Zn(II). Specifically, the molecular helicity of the complexes can be controlled by the absolute configurations of the bimetallic vertices, which has been shown to be homoconfiguration (&#916;&#916;) or mesomeric configuration (&#916;&#923;), depending critically on the bulky groups and length of the spacers. Fascinatingly, in this system we can engineer the space&#8208;restricted multi&#8208;chiral microenvironments with varied polar and apolar moieties, which profoundly influence the binding affinities and chiral discrimination properties of the helicates, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35). This work reveals the transformation of single&#8208;molecule chirality to global multi&#8208;chirality within well&#8208;defined helicates and demonstrates their chiral discriminations are highly dependent on the superior microenvironments.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling catenation in Ge(I) chemistry through hemi&#8208;lability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach for constructing chains of group 14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8208;metal bonds that exploits hemi&#8208;labile ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) 'protecting groups' and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH&#173;&#173;2)2C6H&#173;3) &#8208; featuring hemi&#8208;labile NiPr2&#160;donors &#8208; yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4&#160;(2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4&#160;chain.&#160;2&#160;is the first example of a linear homo&#8208;catenated Ge(I) compound featuring unsupported E&#8210;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4&#160;and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2&#160;&#160;(4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2&#160;(5), respectively.&#160;The use of smaller&#160;N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8210;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2&#160;dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated Ge(I) centres.</dc:description>

The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) 'protecting groups' and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH&#173;&#173;2)2C6H&#173;3) &#8208; featuring hemi&#8208;labile NiPr2&#160;donors &#8208; yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4&#160;(2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4&#160;chain.&#160;2&#160;is the first example of a linear homo&#8208;catenated Ge(I) compound featuring unsupported E&#8210;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4&#160;and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2&#160;&#160;(4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2&#160;(5), respectively.&#160;The use of smaller&#160;N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8210;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2&#160;dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated Ge(I) centres.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low dimensional inorganic tin perovskite solar cells by a template growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x  with mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. Kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2  and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x. The film shows out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability and oxidation resistance. Solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8208;x  perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air. Low&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure provides a route for the development of high efficiency and stable tin halide perovskite solar cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene&#8208;Containing Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 15% Efficiency and High Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have achieved tremendous progress due to the recent advances of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs) and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached over 14%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still severely restricted by the lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption spectrum, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. Herein, a multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, namely PFY&#8208;3Se, based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer was designed and developed. Compared to its thiophene analog PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se possesses a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption (~30 nm), increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular aggregation and packing. When matched with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6 mA cm&#8208;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs field reported so far and much better than those of thiophene analogs (PCE=13.0%). More importantly, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties which is very helpful for realizing reproducible device performance. This is the first reported and also is very rare for the PSMAs so far which provides a potential candidate for efficient all&#8208;PSCs toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Assemblies of Thiophosphopeptides Instantly Target Golgi Apparatus and Selectively Kill Cancer Cells**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid dephosphorylation of a thiophosphopeptide via the enzymatic reaction generates a self&#8208;assembling thiopeptide that can target and accumulate at the Golgi apparatus for imaging Golgi and inhibiting cancer cells. This result illustrates a novel molecular platform for modulating functions resulted from enzymatic noncovalent synthesis.







Abstract
Changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S&#8208;phosphate to the C&#8208;terminal of a self&#8208;assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP&#8208;catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self&#8208;assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (HeLa) with the IC50 (about 3&#8197;&#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide.

         <title>(2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium: A Hexane&#8208;Soluble Reagent for Br/Na&#8208;Exchanges and Directed Metalations in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generation of sodium metal free, hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor in a continuous flow set&#8208;up was reported. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium proved to be a very useful sodium organometallic reagent and was used for in&#8208;line sodiations as well as Br/Na&#8208;exchange reactions. The arylsodiums were trapped with various electrophiles. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was reported.







Abstract
We report the on&#8208;demand generation of hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium (1) from 3&#8208;(chloromethyl)heptane (2) using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor under continuous flow conditions. Thus, the resulting solution of 1 is free of elemental sodium and therefore suited for a range of synthetic applications. This new procedure avoids the storage of an alkylsodium and limits the handling of metallic sodium to a minimum. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium (1) proved to be a very useful reagent and undergoes in&#8208;line Br/Na&#8208;exchanges as well as directed sodiations. The resulting arylsodium intermediates are subsequently trapped in batch with various electrophiles such as ketones, aldehydes, Weinreb&#8208;amides, imines, allyl bromides, disulfides and alkyl iodides. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was also reported.

         <title>Tricyanidoferrates(&#8211;IV) and Ruthenates(&#8211;IV) with Non&#8208;Innocent Cyanido&#160;Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, nearly trigonal&#8208;planar tricyanidometalate anions [Fe(CN)3]7&#8211;  and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8211;  were stabilized in LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] and  Ae3.5M(CN)3] (Ae  = Sr, Ba;  M  = Fe, Ru). They are the first examples of group 8 elements with the oxidation state of &#8211;IV. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by a solid&#8208;state route, single&#8208;crystals from alkali metal flux. While LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] crystallizes in  P  63/m  , the polar space group  P  63  with three&#8208;fold cell volume for  Ae3.5[M(CN)3] is confirmed by second harmonic generation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, nearly trigonal&#8208;planar tricyanidometalate anions [Fe(CN)3]7&#8211;  and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8211;  were stabilized in LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] and  Ae3.5M(CN)3] (Ae  = Sr, Ba;  M  = Fe, Ru). They are the first examples of group 8 elements with the oxidation state of &#8211;IV. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by a solid&#8208;state route, single&#8208;crystals from alkali metal flux. While LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] crystallizes in  P  63/m  , the polar space group  P  63  with three&#8208;fold cell volume for  Ae3.5[M(CN)3] is confirmed by second harmonic generation.

         <title>Can Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Work at Sub&#8208;Zero Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500 cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8 V at 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10oC. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assess the crucial role of tetrapyrrole flexibility in the CO ligation to distinct Ru&#8208;porphyrins supported on an atomistically well&#8208;defined Ag(111) substrate. Our systematic real space visualisation and manipulation experiments with scanning tunnelling microscopy directly probe the ligation, while bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray standing waves measurements characterise the geometry, X&#8208;ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy the electronic structure, and temperature programmed desorption the binding strength. Density functional theory calculations provide additional insight into the functional interface. We unambiguously demonstrate that the substituents regulate the interfacial conformational adaptability, either promoting or obstructing the uptake of axial CO adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>A modular in vitro platform for the production of terpenes and polyketides from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO  2  as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharma&#173;ceuticals, fragrances and food&#8208;additives. Here we developed a modular  in vitro  platform for the continuous conversion of CO  2  into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO  2  into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simul&#173;taneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29 enzymes in one pot, which opens the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO  2  &#8208;based chemicals in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Morphine&#8208;Family Alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;Thebainone&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deconstructive strategy involving the cleavage of relatively inert C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds to build more complex scaffolds enabled the total synthesis of morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A in 13 (and 14) steps from commercially available starting materials (see scheme). The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboacylation reaction was applied successfully to the construction of various polycyclic skeletons.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development of a deconstructive strategy for the first asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A, capitalizing on an enantioselective C&#8722;C bond activation and a C&#8722;O bond cleavage reaction. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#8220;cut&#8208;and&#8208;sew&#8221; transformation between sterically hindered trisubstituted alkenes and benzocyclobutenones allowed efficient construction of the fused A/B/C rings and the quaternary center of the natural product. The newly optimized conditions show broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 er). Taking advantage of boron&#8208;mediated ether bond cleavage, we completed the synthesis of the morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A by two complementary routes.

         <title>Freezing&#8208;Assisted Conjugation of Unmodified Diblock DNA to Hydrogel Nanoparticles and Monoliths for DNA and Hg2+ Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon freezing, unmodified diblock DNAs containing an A5 block react with acrylic monomers in a freezing radical polymerization condition. This allows covalent conjugation to hydrogel nanoparticles and monoliths with an efficiency comparable to acrydite&#8208;modified DNA.







Abstract
Acrydite&#8208;modified DNA is the most frequently used reagent to prepare DNA&#8208;functionalized hydrogels. Herein, we show that unmodified penta&#8208;adenine (A5) can reach up to 75&#8201;% conjugation efficiency in 8&#8197;h under a freezing polymerization condition in polyacrylamide hydrogels. DNA incorporation efficiency was reduced by forming duplex or other folded structures and by removing the freezing condition. By designing diblock DNA containing an A5 block, various functional DNA sequences were attached. Such hydrogels were designed for ultrasensitive DNA hybridization and Hg2+ detection, with detection limits of 50&#8197;pM and 10&#8197;nM, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of using unmodified DNA to replace acrydite&#8208;DNA. The same method worked for both gel nanoparticles and monoliths. This work revealed interesting reaction products by exploiting freezing and has provided a cost&#8208;effective way to attach DNA to hydrogels.

         <title>Polymorphism in Squaraine Dye Aggregates by Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway Differentiation: Panchromatic Tubular Dye Nanorods versus J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a newly synthesized bis(squaraine) dye was investigated revealing a supramolecular polymorphism dependent on the cooling rate. Fast cooling leads to helical nanorods, while slow cooling leads to more organized nanosheets.







Abstract
A bis(squaraine) dye equipped with alkyl and oligoethyleneglycol chains was synthesized by connecting two dicyanomethylene substituted squaraine dyes with a phenylene spacer unit. The aggregation behavior of this bis(squaraine) was investigated in non&#8208;polar toluene/tetrachloroethane (98:2) solvent mixture, which revealed competing cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathways into two supramolecular polymorphs with entirely different packing structures and UV/Vis/NIR absorption properties. The self&#8208;assembly pathway can be controlled by the cooling rate from a heated solution of the monomers. For both polymorphs, quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions between monomers and the respective aggregates can be established to derive thermodynamic parameters and insights into the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. AFM measurements revealed a nanosheet structure with a height of 2&#8197;nm for the thermodynamically more stable polymorph and a tubular nanorod structure with a helical pitch of 13&#8197;nm and a diameter of 5&#8197;nm for the kinetically favored polymorph. Together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements, packing models were derived: the thermodynamic polymorph consists of brick&#8208;work type nanosheets that exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands as typical for J&#8208;aggregates, while the nanorod polymorph consists of eight supramolecular polymer strands of the bis(squaraine) intertwined to form a chimney&#8208;type tubular structure. The absorption of this aggregate covers a large spectral range from 550 to 875&#8197;nm, which cannot be rationalized by the conventional exciton theory. By applying the Essential States Model and considering intermolecular charge transfer, the aggregate spectrum was adequately reproduced, revealing that the broad absorption spectrum is due to pronounced donor&#8208;acceptor overlap within the bis(squaraine) nanorods. The latter is also responsible for the pronounced bathochromic shift observed for the nanosheet structure as a result of the slip&#8208;stacked arranged squaraine chromophores.

&lt;p&gt;The self&#8208;assembly of a newly synthesized bis(squaraine) dye was investigated revealing a supramolecular polymorphism dependent on the cooling rate. Fast cooling leads to helical nanorods, while slow cooling leads to more organized nanosheets.

         <title>Adducts of the Parent Boraphosphaketene H2BPCO and their Decarbonylative Insertion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of Lewis base adducts of the parent boraphosphaketene (H2B&#8722;PCO) are prepared, and their dimerization, decarbonylation and use as synthons for phosphinidenes is explored, leading to a number of different B/P&#8208;containing heterocycles and transition&#8208;metal complexes thereof.







Abstract
The first examples of Lewis base adducts of the parent boraphosphaketene (H2B&#8208;PCO) and their cyclodimers are prepared. One of these adducts is shown to undergo mild decarbonylation and phosphinidene insertion into a B&#8722;C bond of a borole, forming very rare examples of 1,2&#8208;phosphaborinines, B/P isosteres of benzene. The strong donor properties of these 1,2&#8208;phosphaborinines are confirmed by the synthesis of their &#960;&#8197;complexes with the Group&#8197;6 metals.

         <title>Impact of electrostatic interaction on bulk morphology in efficient donor&#8208;acceptor photovoltaic blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a critical role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thereby determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. In this work, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. Our findings demonstrate that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. In addition, enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Our work proposes a molecular design strategy that can finely&#8208;tune the bulk morphology to achieve balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Base&#8211;Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8211;Enzyme Catalysis in Enantioselective Multistep One&#8208;Pot Syntheses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining organo&#8208;, bio&#8208;, and metal&#8208;catalyst for up to six synthetic steps allowed the one&#8208;pot production line towards (enantiopure) key building blocks for natural product synthesis as well as polymer science in gram&#8208;scale. The basis was set by an in&#8208;depth investigation of the initial steps of the sequence and investigating the central role of the organocatalyst {Org: 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)} as well as benzoic acid.







Abstract
Establishing one&#8208;pot, multi&#8208;step protocols combining different types of catalysts is one important goal for increasing efficiency in modern organic synthesis. In particular, the high potential of biocatalysts still needs to be harvested. Based on an in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of a new organocatalytic protocol employing two catalysts {1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO); benzoic acid (BzOH)}, a sequence was established providing starting materials for enzymatic refinement (ene reductase; alcohol dehydrogenase): A gram&#8208;scale access to a variety of enantiopure key building blocks for natural product syntheses was enabled utilizing up to six catalytic steps within the same reaction vessel.

         <title>Trifluorinated Tetralins via I(I)/I(III)&#8208;Catalysed Ring Expansion: Programming Conformation by [CH2CH2] &#8594; [CF2CHF] Isosterism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To expand the current portfolio of saturated, fluorinated carbocycles for drug discovery, a main&#8208;group catalysis&#8208;based synthesis of novel, trifluorinated tetralins is disclosed. Isosteric replacement of [CH2&#8722;CH2] by [CF2&#8722;CHF] removes the conformational degeneracy intrinsic to the parent tetralin, since the CH&#8722;F bond occupies a pseudo&#8208;axial orientation (&#963;C&#8722;H&#8594;&#963;C&#8722;F*). This provides pre&#8208;organised module for contemporary medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Saturated, fluorinated carbocycles are emerging as important modules for contemporary drug discovery. To expand the current portfolio, the synthesis of novel trifluorinated tetralins has been achieved. Fluorinated methyleneindanes serve as convenient precursors and undergo efficient difluorinative ring expansion with in situ generated p&#8208;TolIF2 (&gt;20 examples, up to &gt;95&#8201;%). A range of diverse substituents are tolerated under standard catalysis conditions and this is interrogated by Hammett analysis. X&#8208;ray analysis indicates a preference for the CH&#8722;F bond to occupy a pseudo&#8208;axial orientation, consistent with stabilising &#963;C&#8722;H&#8594;&#963;C&#8722;F* interactions. The replacement of the symmetric [CH2&#8722;CH2] motif by [CF2&#8722;CHF] removes the conformational degeneracy intrinsic to the parent tetralin scaffold leading to a predictable half&#8208;chair. The conformational behavior of this novel structural balance has been investigated by computational analysis and is consistent with stereoelectronic theory.

The first examples of 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanions are isolated. In addition to complete characterization via X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, the nucleophilic character of the boryl anions is supported by DFT calculations and probed experimentally via reactions with metal halides and diketones.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron reduction of carbene&#8208;supported 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorenes with excess KC8, Na, or Li&#8208;naphthalenide affords six N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208; or cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized borafluorene anions (3&#8211;8)&#8208;the first isolated and structurally authenticated examples of the elusive 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion. The electronic structure, bonding, and aromaticity of the boracyclic anions were comprehensively investigated via computational studies. Compounds 5 and 8 react with metal halides via salt elimination to give new B&#8208;E (E=Au, Se, Ge)&#8208;containing materials (9&#8211;12). Upon reaction with diketones, the carbene ligand cleanly dissociates from 5 or 8 to yield new B&#8208;O containing spirocycles (13&#8211;14) that cannot be easily obtained using &#8220;normal&#8221; valent borafluorene compounds. Collectively, these results support the notion that carbene&#8208;stabilized monoanionic borafluorenes may serve as a new platform for the one&#8208;step construction of higher&#8208;value boracyclic materials.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;like Supramolecular Iridium Catalysis Enabling C&#8722;H Bond Borylation of Pyridines with meta&#8208;Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;based supramolecular catalyst has been designed to selectively recognize pyridine&#8208;like derivatives via secondary Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions. Owing to the distance between the substrate binding site and the active site as well as the geometrically constraints, meta&#8208;selective borylation reactions were accomplished displaying catalytic behaviors typically encountered in enzymes.







Abstract
The use of secondary interactions between substrates and catalysts is a promising strategy to discover selective transition metal catalysts for atom&#8208;economy C&#8722;H bond functionalization. The most powerful catalysts are found via trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening due to the low association constants between the substrate and the catalyst in which small stereo&#8208;electronic modifications within them can lead to very different reactivities. To circumvent these limitations and to increase the level of reactivity prediction in these important reactions, we report herein a supramolecular catalyst harnessing Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions that binds to pyridine&#8208;like substrates as tight as it can be found in some enzymes. The distance and spatial geometry between the active site and the substrate binding site is ideal to target unprecedented meta&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylations with enzymatic Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics, besides unique substrate selectivity and dormant reactivity patterns.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Enables Heterogeneous Asymmetric Insertion of Carbenoids into Amines Catalyzed by Rhodium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh nanoparticle catalysts supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon were developed for asymmetric insertions of carbenoids derived from diazoesters into N&#8722;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. The nitrogen dopants are essential to promote the reactions. The catalyst could be reused several times and was applicable for a continuous&#8208;flow reaction system that produced the desired chiral amine for over 90&#8197;h through reactivation of the catalyst.







Abstract
Development of stable heterogeneous catalyst systems is a crucial subject to achieve sustainable society. Though metal nanoparticles are robust species, the study of asymmetric catalysis by them has been restricted because methods to activate metal nanoparticles without causing metal leaching were limited. We developed Rh nanoparticle catalysts (NCI&#8208;Rh) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as a solid ligand to interact with metals for asymmetric insertion of carbenoids into N&#8722;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. Nitrogen dopants played a crucial role in both catalytic activity and enantioselectivity while almost no catalysis was observed with Rh nanoparticles immobilized on supports without nitrogen dopants. Various types of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives were synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivities and NCI&#8208;Rh could be reused in seven runs. Furthermore, we demonstrated the corresponding continuous&#8208;flow reaction using a column packed with NCI&#8208;Rh. The desired product was obtained efficiently for over 90&#8197;h through the reactivation of NCI&#8208;Rh and the chiral source could be recovered.

         <title>Unified Synthesis of Polycyclic Alkaloids by Complementary Carbonyl Activation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient construction of polycyclic scaffolds of bioactive alkaloids by a novel annulation strategy enabled the synthesis of several natural products, including the dimeric berberine alkaloid ilicifoline&#8197;B (see scheme). This versatile approach also served as the basis for a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;peganumine&#8197;A featuring an asymmetric disulfonimide&#8208;catalyzed cyclization cascade.







Abstract
A complementary dual carbonyl activation strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic alkaloids has been developed. Successful applications include the synthesis of tetracyclic alkaloids harmalanine and harmalacinine, pentacyclic indoloquinolizidine alkaloid nortetoyobyrine, and octacyclic &#946;&#8208;carboline alkaloid peganumine&#8197;A. The latter synthesis features a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free assembly and an asymmetric disulfonimide&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. Furthermore, formal syntheses of hirsutine, deplancheine, 10&#8208;desbromoarborescidine&#8197;A, and oxindole alkaloids rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline have been achieved. Finally, a concise synthesis of berberine alkaloid ilicifoline&#8197;B was completed.

         <title>Isolation of Neutral, Mono&#8208;, and Dicationic B2P2 Rings by Diphosphorus Addition to a Boron&#8722;Boron Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room temperature P&#8722;P bond addition to an NHC&#8208;stabilised diboryne yielded a four&#8208;membered B2P2 heterocycle, which can be further oxidised to a radical cation and a dication depending on the oxidation reagent and its counterion.







Abstract
The NHC&#8208;stabilised diboryne (B2(SIDep)2; SIDep=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) undergoes a high&#8208;yielding P&#8722;P bond activation with tetraethyldiphosphine at room temperature to form a B2P2 heterocycle via a diphosphoryldiborene by 1,2&#8208;diphosphination. The heterocycle can be oxidised to a radical cation and a dication, respectively, depending on the oxidant used and its counterion. Starting from the planar, neutral 1,3&#8208;bis(alkylidene)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diborata&#8208;2,4&#8208;diphosphoniocyclobutane, each oxidation step leads to decreased B&#8722;B distances and loss of planarity by cationisation. X&#8208;ray analyses in conjunction with DFT and CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations reveal closed&#8208;shell singlet, butterfly&#8208;shaped structures for the NHC&#8208;stabilised dicationic B2P2 rings, with their diradicaloid, planar&#8208;ring isomers lying close in energy.

         <title>Fatty Acids and their Derivatives as Renewable Platform Molecules for the Chemical Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the use of oils and fats as a renewable raw material by covering novel examples, such as selective oxidation or cleavage of C&#8211;C double bonds in fatty acids, isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarboxylation, and the use of these renewables for polymer chemistry. Further topics include biocatalysis, the optimization of microorganisms by metabolic engineering, and the generation of new oil qualities in existing crop plants.







Abstract
Oils and fats of vegetable and animal origin remain an important renewable feedstock for the chemical industry. Their industrial use has increased during the last 10&#8197;years from 31 to 51 million tonnes annually. Remarkable achievements made in the field of oleochemistry in this timeframe are summarized herein, including the reduction of fatty esters to ethers, the selective oxidation and oxidative cleavage of C&#8211;C double bonds, the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;branched fatty compounds, the isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarboxylation, and olefin metathesis. The use of oleochemicals for the synthesis of a great variety of polymeric materials has increased tremendously, too. In addition to lipases and phospholipases, other enzymes have found their way into biocatalytic oleochemistry. Important achievements have also generated new oil qualities in existing crop plants or by using microorganisms optimized by metabolic engineering.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Hydrolysis En Route to Corroles with Increased Druglikeness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corroles substituted with only two or three carboxylic acid groups were obtained from readily available starting materials through a novel pathway (see scheme). These macrocycles and the corresponding metal chelates fulfill all the criteria of druglikeness and have potential for both bioimaging and therapy.







Abstract
Heme&#8208;like metal&#8208;chelating macrocycles, including expanded and contracted porphyrins, are of everlasting interest as drug candidates for numerous diseases. Still, all reported corrole derivatives (and most other heme analogues) do not fulfill the most basic standards expected for oral drug administration: a combination of low molecular weight and reasonable water solubility. We now disclose a very straightforward synthetic method that relies on surprisingly facile trifluoromethyl hydrolysis for gaining access to a new class of corroles that do satisfy all druglikeness criteria. The relevance is briefly exemplified for the iron corroles by demonstrating the ability to affect their association with plasma proteins and their performance for catalase&#8208;like decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.

         <title>Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering Studies of Block Copolymer Nano&#8208;Objects: Formation of Ordered Phases in Concentrated Solution During Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can produce lyotropic phases of block copolymer nano&#8208;objects. Time&#8208;resolved SAXS studies confirm that reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate in n&#8208;dodecane initially produces spheres exhibiting long&#8208;range order that subsequently evolve to form hexagonally packed worms. Serial dilution leads to disordered worms.







Abstract
We report that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can be used to prepare lyotropic phases comprising diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects in non&#8208;polar media. RAFT dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate (BzMA) at 90&#8201;&#176;C using a trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped hydrogenated polybutadiene (PhBD) steric stabilizer block in n&#8208;dodecane produces either spheres or worms that exhibit long&#8208;range order at 40&#8201;% w/w solids. NMR studies enable calculation of instantaneous copolymer compositions for each phase during the BzMA polymerization. As the PBzMA chains grow longer when targeting PhBD80&#8211;PBzMA40, time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals intermediate body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) and hexagonally close&#8208;packed (HCP) sphere phases prior to formation of a final hexagonal cylinder phase (HEX). The HEX phase is lost on serial dilution and the aligned cylinders eventually form disordered flexible worms. The HEX phase undergoes an order&#8211;disorder transition on heating to 150&#8201;&#176;C and a pure HCP phase forms on cooling to 20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Genetic Engineering in Combination with Semi&#8208;Synthesis Leads to a New Route for Gram&#8208;Scale Production of the Immunosuppressive Natural Product Brasilicardin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a heterologous producer strain that enables the sustainable production of the stereochemically complex natural products brasilicardin&#8197;C and&#8197;E at excellent rates is presented. The semi&#8208;synthetic approach allows an efficient gram&#8208;scale conversion of brasilicardin&#8197;E into the potent immunosuppressant brasilicardin&#8197;A for which the first preclinical data are reported.







Abstract
Brasilicardin&#8197;A (1) consists of an unusual anti/syn/anti&#8208;perhydrophenanthrene skeleton with a carbohydrate side chain and an amino acid moiety. It exhibits potent immunosuppressive activity, yet its mode of action differs from standard drugs that are currently in use. Further pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of this promising, biologically active natural product is hampered by restricted access to the ready material, as its synthesis requires both a low&#8208;yielding fermentation process using a pathogenic organism and an elaborate, multi&#8208;step total synthesis. Our semi&#8208;synthetic approach included a) the heterologous expression of the brasilicardin&#8197;A gene cluster in different non&#8208;pathogenic bacterial strains producing brasilicardin&#8197;A aglycone (5) in excellent yield and b) the chemical transformation of the aglycone 5 into the trifluoroacetic acid salt of brasilicardin&#8197;A (1&#8201;a) via a short and straightforward five&#8208;steps synthetic route. Additionally, we report the first preclinical data for brasilicardin&#8197;A.

         <title>Neither too Classic nor too Exotic: One&#8208;Electron Na&#8901;B Bond in NaBH3&#8722; Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;centre one&#8208;electron bond (2c&#8211;1e): Chemical bonding analysis using electron localization function (ELF), at correlated level, shows that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster exhibits a Na&#8901;B 2c&#8211;1e bond.







Abstract
It is here reported that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster exhibits a Na&#8901;B one&#8208;electron bond, a well&#8208;established type of electron&#8208;deficient bonding in the literature. The topological analysis of the electron localization function, at the correlated level, reveals that Na&#8722;, when approaching the bonding distance, fairly distributes its valence electron pair between two lobes. One of these electrons is used to bond with BH3, which participates through its boron empty p&#8208;orbital. Furthermore, the bonding situation of LiBH3&#8722;, KBH3&#8722;, MgBH3, and CaBH3 global minima structures are similar to that of NaBH3&#8722;, extending the family of these new one&#8208;electron bond systems with biradicaloid character.

         <title>Chirogenesis and Amplification of Molecular Chirality Using Optical Vortices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystal nucleus and the growth of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.







Abstract
The study of chirogenesis of organic molecules is important to elucidate the origin of the homochirality of biomolecules on Earth. Here, we have accomplished chiral symmetry breaking from a racemate using optical vortices with orbital angular momentum and a helical wavefront. We propose a new methodology of asymmetric transformation by the combination of enantioselective crystal nucleation by irradiation with optical vortices and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic optical resolution of conglomerate crystals. Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.

         <title>Organic Electrochemistry: Expanding the Scope of Paired Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many paired electrochemical reactions use perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, but this matching is not necessary. In constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes adjusts to the substrates in solution. Oxidation reactions were paired with H2 generation, showing the generality of the anodic process. This effort was followed by pairing multiple cathodic reactions with a pair of established oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Paired electrochemical reactions allow the optimization of both atom and energy economy of oxidation and reduction reactions. While many paired electrochemical reactions take advantage of perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, this matching of substrates is not necessary. In constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes adjusts to the substrates in solution. In principle, any oxidation reaction can be paired with any reduction reaction. Various oxidation reactions conducted on the anodic side of the electrolysis were paired with the generation and use of hydrogen gas at the cathode, showing the generality of the anodic process in a paired electrolysis and how the auxiliary reaction required for the oxidation could be used to generate a substrate for a non&#8208;electrolysis reaction. This is combined with variations on the cathodic side of the electrolysis to complete the picture and illustrate how oxidation and reduction reactions can be combined.

         <title>Ultrafast and Stable Proton Conduction in Polybenzimidazole Covalent Organic Frameworks via Confinement and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensing benzimidazole units via topology&#8208;directed polymerization allows the construction of stable covalent organic frameworks with ordered one&#8208;dimensional channels. The walls trigger multiple hierarchical interactions so that the proton networks are locked in the pores via spatial confinement and activated via deprotonation. Ultrafast and stable anhydrous proton conduction is achieved over a wide range of temperatures.







Abstract
Polybenzimidazoles are engineering plastics with superb thermal stability and this specificity has sparked a wide&#8208;ranging research to explore proton&#8208;conducting materials. Nevertheless, such materials encounter challenging issues owing to phosphoric acid proton carrier leakage and slow proton transport. We report a strategy for designing porous polybenzimidazole frameworks to address these key fundamental issues. The built&#8208;in channels are designed to be one&#8208;dimensionally extended, unidirectionally aligned, and fully occupied by neat phosphoric acid, while the benzimidazole walls trigger multipoint, multichain, and multitype interactions to spatially confine a phosphoric acid network in pores and facilitate proton conduction via deprotonation. The materials exhibit ultrafast and stable proton conduction for low proton carrier content and activation energy&#8212;a set of features highly desired for proton transport. Our results offer a design strategy for the fabrication of porous polybenzimidazoles for use in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Redox&#8208;responsive gene delivery from perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions through cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical utility of emulsions as delivery vehicles is hindered by a dependence on passive release. Stimuli&#8208;responsive emulsions overcome this limitation but rely on external triggers or are composed of nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized droplets that preclude sizes necessary for biomedical applications. Here, we employ cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymer surfactants to form perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions that release cargo upon exposure to glutathione. These surfactants allow for the first example of redox&#8208;responsive nanoemulsions in cellulo. A noncovalent fluorous tagging strategy is leveraged to solubilize a GFP plasmid inside the PFC nanoemulsions, whereupon protein expression is achieved selectively when employing a stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant. This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Archaeal glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) are some of the most unusual membrane lipids identified in nature. These amphiphiles are the major constituents of the membranes of numerous Archaea, some of which are extremophilic organisms. Due to their unique structures, there has been significant interest in studying both the biophysical properties and the biosynthesis of these molecules. However, these studies have thus far been hampered by limited access to chemically pure samples.

         <title>A Divergent Strategy for Site&#8208;Selective Radical Disulfuration of Carboxylic Acids with Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;Dioxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion of carboxylic acids to disulfides is described. The approach employs oxidative photocatalysis for the base&#8208;promoted decarboxylation of the substrate, which yields an alkyl radical that engages a trisulfide dioxide by homolytic substitution. The trisulfide dioxides are easily prepared via a newly described approach. Each of 1 &#176; , 2 &#176; &#160;and 3 &#176; carboxylic acids with varied substitution are good substrates, including amino acids and substrates with highly activated C&#8208;H bonds. Trisulfide dioxides are also used to achieve&#160; &#947; &#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8211;H disulfuration of amides via radical relay. In both reactions, the sulfonyl radical that results from substitution propagates the reaction. Factors governing the selectivity of substitution at S2 vs S3 of the trisulfide dioxides are explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Nano&#8208;Amperometric Measurement of Intravesicular Glutamate Content and of its Sub&#8208;Quantal Release by Living Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamate (Glu) is a crucial fundamental excitatory neurotransmitter released through vesicular exocytosis in the central nervous system. Hence, quantitative measurements of intravesicular Glu and of transient exocytotic release contents directly from individual living neurons are highly desired for understanding the mechanisms (full or sub&#8208;quantal release?) of synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, this could not be achieved so far due to the lack of adequate experimental strategies relying on selective and sensitive Glu nanosensors. Herein, we introduce a novel electrochemical Glu nanobiosensor based on a single SiC nanowire prone to selectively measure in real&#8208;time Glu fluxes released via exocytosis by large Glu vesicles (  ca.  125 nm diameter) present in single hippocampal axonal varicosities as well as their intravesicular content before exocytosis. Combination of these two series of measurements revealed a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in living hippocampal neurons, viz., only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. Importantly, this fraction remained practically the same when hippocampal neurons were pretreated with L&#8208;Glu&#8208;precursor L&#8208;glutamine, while it significantly increased after zinc treatment, although in both cases the intravesicular contents were drastically affected. By affording quantitative measurements of intravesicular Glu inside living neurons and of its sub&#8208;quantal release fractions this work is opening new possibilities for investigating in situ and in time the regulatory mechanisms of glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of photolatent bases for locally controlling dynamic exchange reactions in thermo&#8208;activated vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers exhibit a covalently crosslinked network structure as characteristic for classic thermosetting polymers. However, they are capable of rearranging their network topology by thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions when the topology freezing transition temperature (  T  v  ) is exceeded. Despite the vast number of developed vitrimers, there is a serios lack in methods which enable a (spatially) controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions above  T  v  . Herein, we highlight the localized release of the efficient transesterification catalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) by the UV&#8208;induced cleavage of a photolatent base within a covalently crosslinked thiol&#8208;epoxy network. Demonstrated with stress relaxation measurements conducted well above the network&#8217;s  T  v  , only the controlled release of TBD facilitates the immediate onset of transesterifications in terms of a viscoelastic flow. Moreover, the spatially resolved UV&#8208;mediated photoactivation of vitrimeric properties is confirmed by permanent shape changes induced locally in the material.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Highly Reactive Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality, small&#8208;sized rare&#8208;earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8208;3&#160;nm) &#8211; ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#160;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#160;pm) rare&#8208;earth metal &#8211; is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspension and powder under inert conditions. The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8208;organic compounds at room&#8208;temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of A Nitrogenase PN&#8208;Cluster Model with [Fe8S7(&#956;&#8208;Sthiolate)2] Core from the All&#8208;ferric [Fe4S4(Sthiolate)4] Cubane Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing synthetic models of the nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here, we report an optimal nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] ( 2 ) [Tbt = 2,4,6&#8208;tris{bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl}phenyl] that is the closest synthetic mimic constructed to date. Of note is that two thiolate ligands and one hexacoordinated sulfide are connecting the two Fe4S3 incomplete cubanes similar to the native PN&#8208;cluster, which has never been achieved. Cluster 2 has been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and relevant physico&#8208;chemical methods. The variable temperature magnetic moments of 2 indicate a singlet ground state (S = 0). The M&#246;ssbauer spectrum of 2 exhibit two doublets with an intensity ratio of 3:1, which suggests the presence of two types of iron sites. The synthetic pathway of the cluster 2 could indicate the native PN&#8208;cluster maturation process as it has been achieved from the Fe4S4 cubane Fe4S4(STbt)4 ( 1 ).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T he synthesis and properties of&#160; dinaphthotropone bisimide (DNTrBI) and dinaphthocycloheptatriene bisimide (DNCHepBI) are described.&#160;Their molecular design is conceptually based on the insertion of a carbon atom into a perylene bisimide (PBI) core. These molecules adopt non&#8208;planar structures due to the presence of a seven&#8208;membered ring. The PBI derivative into which a carbonyl group was inserted (DNTrBI) immediately underwent nonradiative decay and/or intersystem crossing in its excited state. The PBI derivative into which a methylene group was inserted (DNCHepBI) was susceptible to deprotonation on account of the two electron&#8208;withdrawing naphthalene monoimide units.

         <dc:description>Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy  par excellence  to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established  13  C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter. It is shown that this analysis is fit for purpose and the combination allows the synthesis of the title compounds with a significant increase in efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Hydro(Chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of Diazo Compounds with Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF  5  Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF  5  group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF  5  Cl often relied on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatuses. Herein we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF  5  Cl in  n  &#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF  5  Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K  3  PO  4  or copper catalyst respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various  &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds  of high value for potential applications.</dc:description>

Herein we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF  5  Cl in  n  &#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF  5  Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K  3  PO  4  or copper catalyst respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various  &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds  of high value for potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Magnesium&#8208;air Battery Based on Dual&#8208;layer Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mg&#8208;air batteries are explored as the next&#8208;generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics as they could work stably in neutral electrolytes and are also biocompatible. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance of Mg&#8208;air battery with low discharge voltage, poor specific capacity and low energy density. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we first report a dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte to simultaneously solve the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of&#160;dense passive layer, respectively. The resulting Mg&#8208;air batteries produced an average specific capacity of 2190 mAh&#183;g  &#8208;1  based on the total Mg anode (99.3% utilization rate of Mg anode) and energy density of 2282 Wh&#183;kg  &#8208;1  based on the total anode and air electrode, both of which are the highest among the reported Mg&#8208;air batteries. Besides, our Mg&#8208;air batteries could be made into a fiber shape, and they were flexible to work stably under various deformations such as bending and twisting.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li  3  PO  4  and poly&#8208;phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self&#8208;limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li||Li cell, more than 300 cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . Prototypical Li&#8208;O  2  and Li&#8208;ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Labeling and Crosslinking by Covalent Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a new approach to selectively modify native proteins in their biological environment using electrophilic, covalent aptamers. These aptamers are generated through introduction of a proximity&#8208;driven electrophile at specific nucleic acid sites. Using thrombin as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that covalent aptamers can selectively transfer a variety of functional handles and/or irreversibly crosslink to the target protein. This approach offers broad programmability and high target specificity. Furthermore, it addresses issues common to aptamers such as instability towards endogenous nucleases and residence times during target engagement. Covalent aptamers are new tools that enable specific protein modification and sensitive protein detection. Moreover, they provide prolonged, nuclease&#8208;resistant enzyme inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Degrader for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1/2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:   Aberrant activation of FGFR signaling occurs in many cancers, and ATP&#8208;competitive FGFR inhibitors have received regulatory approval. Despite demonstrating clinical efficacy, these inhibitors exhibit dose&#8208;limiting toxicity, potentially due to a lack of selectivity amongst the FGFR family and are poorly tolerated. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192, a bivalent degrader that couples the pan&#8208;FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 to a CRL2  VHL  E3 ligase recruiting ligand, which preferentially induces FGFR1&amp;2 degradation while largely sparing FGFR3&amp;4. DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 exhibited two  &#8208;digit nanomolar DC  50  s for both wildtype FGFR2 and several FGFR2&#8208;fusions, resulting in degradation&#8208;dependent antiproliferative activity in representative gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cells. Importantly, DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 induced degradation of a clinically relevant FGFR2 fusion protein in a xenograft model. Taken together, we demonstrate that DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 has potential as a prototype FGFR degrader.</dc:description>

Based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone&#8208;triggered ROS amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0.







Abstract
Discrimination of cancer cells/tissues from normal ones is of critical importance for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Herein, we present a new strategy for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of cancer cells/tissues based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone (&#946;&#8208;Lap, an anticancer agent) triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues. With the strategy, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe PSiR3 developed in this work with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0. What's more, the strategy allowed the fluorescence discrimination of tumor tissues from inflammatory ones based on whether a marked fluorescence enhancement could be induced when treated with PSiR3 and &#946;&#8208;Lap/PSiR3 combination, respectively.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Halogen Bonded Ternary Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonded ternary cocrystals were synthesized by employing three different approaches. The possible reasons for the formation of these cocrystals have been proposed based on a detailed crystal packing analysis and computational results.







Abstract
Higher cocrystal synthesis depends acutely on a knowledge of supramolecular synthons. We report three synthetic approaches towards ternary halogen bonded cocrystals that illustrate specificity and generality. Electrophilicity/nucleophilicity differences are needed among alternative sites of halogen bond formation. The two halogen bonds A&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B and B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C in a halogen bonded ternary cocrystal ABC need to be of different strength. Interaction mimicry of hydrogen bonds by halogen bonds is a viable approach towards ternaries as illustrated with the pyrene structure. Finally, the crystal engineer should well be able to anticipate halogen bonds that are stronger than hydrogen bonds.

     alt="Synthetic Approaches to Halogen Bonded Ternary Cocrystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halogen bonded ternary cocrystals were synthesized by employing three different approaches. The possible reasons for the formation of these cocrystals have been proposed based on a detailed crystal packing analysis and computational results.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher cocrystal synthesis depends acutely on a knowledge of supramolecular synthons. We report three synthetic approaches towards ternary halogen bonded cocrystals that illustrate specificity and generality. Electrophilicity/nucleophilicity differences are needed among alternative sites of halogen bond formation. The two halogen bonds A&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B and B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C in a halogen bonded ternary cocrystal ABC need to be of different strength. Interaction mimicry of hydrogen bonds by halogen bonds is a viable approach towards ternaries as illustrated with the pyrene structure. Finally, the crystal engineer should well be able to anticipate halogen bonds that are stronger than hydrogen bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Terminal Imido Complex of an Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first terminal imido complex of an iron&#8211;sulfur cluster has been synthesized and fully characterized. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational analysis suggest an [Fe4S4]2+=[NAr]2&#8722; formulation with a localized high&#8208;spin Fe3+ valence at the imido&#8208;bound site, and reactivity studies demonstrate competence for C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the first terminal imido complex of an Fe&#8211;S cluster, (IMes)3Fe4S4=NDipp (2; IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), which is generated by oxidative group transfer from DippN3 to the all&#8208;ferrous cluster (IMes)3Fe4S4(PPh3). This two&#8208;electron process is achieved by formal one&#8208;electron oxidation of the imido&#8208;bound Fe site and one&#8208;electron oxidation of two IMes&#8208;bound Fe sites. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies establish that the Fe&#8211;imido site is best described as a high&#8208;spin Fe3+ center, which is manifested in its long Fe&#8722;N(imido) distance of 1.763(2)&#8197;&#197;. Cluster 2 abstracts hydrogen atoms from 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to yield the corresponding anilido complex, demonstrating competency for C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Ferroelectric and Spin Crossover Behavior in a Cobalt(II) Compound Induced by Polar&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Substituent Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular ferroelectrics induced by molecular rotors, multifunctional compound exhibiting both ferroelectricity and spin crossover behavior was constructed. The flip&#8211;flop motion of polarization unit results in the expression of ferroelectricity and spin crossover behavior.







Abstract
Ferroelectric spin crossover (SCO) behavior is demonstrated to occur in the cobalt(II) complex, [Co(FPh&#8208;terpy)2](BPh4)2&#8901;3ac (1&#8901;3&#8201;ac; FPh&#8208;terpy=4&#8242;&#8208;((3&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) and is dependent on the degree of 180&#176; flip&#8211;flop motion of the ligand's polar fluorophenyl ring. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures at several temperatures confirmed the flip&#8211;flop motion of fluorobenzene ring and also gave evidence for the SCO behavior with the latter behavior also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The molecular motion of the fluorobenzene ring was also revealed using solid&#8208;state 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Thus the SCO behavior is accompanied by the flip&#8211;flop motion of the fluorobenzene ring, leading to destabilization of the low spin cobalt(II) state; with the magnitude of rotation able to be controlled by an electric field. This first example of spin&#8208;state conversion being dependent on the molecular motion of a ligand&#8208;appended fluorobenzene ring in a SCO cobalt(II) compound provides new insight for the design of a new category of molecule&#8208;based magnetoelectric materials.

         <title>Supramolecular cylinders target bulge structures in the 5'&#160;UTR of the RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and inhibit viral replication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for the development of broad spectrum anti&#8208;virals. We combine RNA analysis with Molecular Dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5' UTR of &#160;the&#160;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. Furthermore, we determine the binding of metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA structure. These nano&#8208;size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and we identify their binding to a 3&#8208;base bulge and the central cross 4&#8208;way junction located in the stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA&#8208;binding cylinders suppress SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication, highlighting their potential as novel anti&#8208;viral agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Reorganization of Self&#8208;Assembled DNA&#8208;Based Polymers using Orthogonally Addressable Building Blocks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that can re&#8208;organize in a dynamic and reversible way to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers made of a single tile, random polymers in which different tiles are distributed randomly and block structures in which the tiles are organized in segments.







Abstract
Nature uses non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve structural dynamic reconfiguration of biopolymers. Taking advantage of the programmability of DNA/DNA interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that self&#8208;assemble into polymer&#8208;like structures that can be reconfigured by external inputs. The different tiles share the same sticky ends responsible for self&#8208;assembly but are rationally designed to contain a specific regulator&#8208;binding domain that can be orthogonally targeted by different DNA regulator strands. We show that by sequentially adding specific inputs it is possible to re&#8208;organize the formed structures to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers, random and block structures. The versatility of the systems presented in this study shows the ease with which DNA&#8208;based addressable monomers can be designed to create reconfigurable micron&#8208;scale DNA structures offering a new approach to the growing field of supramolecular polymers.

         <title>Mechanochemical Prebiotic Peptide Bond Formation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical and thermal activation enable the solvent&#8208;free oligomerization of inactivated amino acids in the presence of TiO2 to form peptides. Our observations validate the usefulness of mechanochemistry to simulate and study prebiotic chemistry in an impact scenario where dry land and mineral surfaces are critical for the concentration and formation of organic building blocks.







Abstract
The presence of amino acids on the prebiotic Earth, either stemming from endogenous chemical routes or delivered by meteorites, is consensually accepted. Prebiotically plausible pathways to peptides from inactivated amino acids are still unclear as most oligomerization approaches rely on thermodynamically disfavored reactions in solution. Now, a combination of prebiotically plausible minerals and mechanochemical activation enables the oligomerization of glycine at ambient temperature in the absence of water. Raising the reaction temperature increases the degree of oligomerization concomitantly with the formation of a commonly unwanted cyclic glycine dimer (DKP). However, DKP is a productive intermediate in the mechanochemical oligomerization of glycine. The findings of this research show that mechanochemical peptide bond formation is a dynamic process that provides alternative routes towards oligopeptides and establishes new synthetic approaches for prebiotic chemistry.

Raising the reaction temperature increases the degree of oligomerization concomitantly with the formation of a commonly unwanted cyclic glycine dimer (DKP). However, DKP is a productive intermediate in the mechanochemical oligomerization of glycine. The findings of this research show that mechanochemical peptide bond formation is a dynamic process that provides alternative routes towards oligopeptides and establishes new synthetic approaches for prebiotic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Aromatic Oligomer Micelle: Large Enthalpic Stabilization and Selective Oligothiophene Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aromatic oligomer micelle was formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers. The well&#8208;defined nanostructure remains intact even under dilution and at high temperature. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes; the resultant host&#8211;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers.







Abstract
An aromatic oligomer micelle, featuring both high stability and high uptake ability, was quantitatively formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers, composed of three bent polyaromatic amphiphiles connected alternately by two hydrophilic chains. The well&#8208;defined micelle, with a diameter of ca. 2&#8197;nm, remains intact even under highly diluted conditions (ca. 3&#8197;&#956;M) and at elevated temperature (&gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), due to the polyaromatic chelate effect. The thermodynamic studies reveal that large enthalpic gain (&#916;H=&#8722;110&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is the key for the micelle formation. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes (&#8805;4&#8208;mer) to a high degree and the resultant, aqueous host&#8208;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers. Furthermore, facile uptake and release of unsubstituted polythiophenes can be achieved using the oligomer micelle.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets as a Robust Oxygen Evolution Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D MOFs on nickel foam (NF) were assembled. NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior OER performance (overpotential of 195&#8197;mV at 10 and 241&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under alkaline conditions. The ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52&#8197;eV (lower than NiFe double hydroxides: 0.81&#8197;eV).







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) by assembling nickel chloride hexahydrate and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF). The NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 195&#8197;mV and 241&#8197;mV at 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the superb OER performance originates from the ferrocene units that serve as efficient electron transfer intermediates. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52&#8197;eV, which is lower than that (0.81&#8197;eV) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiFe double hydroxides.

         <title>The Redox Journey of Iconic Ferrocene: Ferrocenium Dications and Ferrocenate Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent discoveries of both dicationic and monoanionic ferrocene derivatives throw light on the effect of the substituents on the C5 ring as well as the choice of redox agents and solvent system in the preparation of previously believed to be difficult synthetic targets. These oxidized and reduced forms of ferrocene are of interest to spectroscopists, magnetochemists, and theoreticians.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide nanomotors induce multiple acidosis in tumor cells by destroying tumor metabolic symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Destruction of tumor metabolism symbiosis is an attractive cancer treatment method which targets tumor cells with little harm to normal cells. Yet, a single intervention strategy and poor penetration of the drug in tumor tissue result in limited effect. Herein, we propose a zero&#8208;waste zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S)&#8208;driven nanomotor based on the basic principle of reaction in human body. When loaded with monocarboxylic acid transporter inhibitor &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid (&#945;&#8208;CHCA), the nanomotor can move in tumor microenvironment and induce multiple acidosis of tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth through the synergistic effect of motion effect, driving force H  2  S and &#945;&#8208;CHCA. Given the good biosafety of the substrate and driving gas of this kind of nanomotor, as well as the limited variety of nanomotors currently available to move in the tumor microenvironment, this kind of nanomotor may provide a competitive candidate for the active drug delivery system of cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte Engineering Enables Safe and Wide&#8208;Temperature Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte is an important component in redox flow batteries (RFBs) that determines the current capability, potential window, and safety, but both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have their intrinsic limits. Here, we develop the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid electrolyte chemistry to enable the design of safe and wide&#8208;temperature RFBs. In addition to the non&#8208;flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5 V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &gt;99.9%, showing long cycling stability over 800 cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8208;20 &#176;C for 150 cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.</dc:description>

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;based Chiral Porous Polyimides for Enantioselective Membrane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral porous polyimides (FTPI) were synthesized using monomers of chiral 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene. The absolute configurations were identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The obtained R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with high permeation rates.







Abstract
Enantiomers of 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene (R, R&#8208;1 and S, S&#8208;1) are split by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC and their absolute configurations are identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technology. Using the enantiomers as monomers, a couple of chiral porous polyimides (R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI) are prepared by polycondensation reactions and display good heat stability, high BET surface area and good solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, both of R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with symmetrical chiral selectivity.

The obtained &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;FTPI and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with high permeation rates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantiomers of 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene (R, R&#8208;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and S, S&#8208;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) are split by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC and their absolute configurations are identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technology. Using the enantiomers as monomers, a couple of chiral porous polyimides (R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI) are prepared by polycondensation reactions and display good heat stability, high BET surface area and good solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, both of R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with symmetrical chiral selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advanced Low&#8208;Flammable Electrolytes for Stable Operation of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced low&#8208;flammable electrolytes are developed for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With fluoroethylene carbonate as a proper electrolyte additive, the trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte achieves greatly extended cycle life over the conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte, due to the formation of enhanced surface protection layers, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.







Abstract
Despite being an effective flame retardant, trimethyl phosphate (TMPa) is generally considered as an unqualified solvent for fabricating electrolytes used in graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries as it readily leads to Gr exfoliation and cell failure. In this work, by adopting the unique solvation structure of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to TMPa and tuning the composition of the solvation sheaths via electrolyte additives, excellent electrochemical performance can be achieved with TMPa&#8208;based electrolytes in Gr&#8741;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells. After 500 charge/discharge cycles within the voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.4&#8197;V, the batteries containing the TMPa&#8208;based LHCE with a proper additive can achieve a capacity retention of 85.4&#8201;%, being significantly higher than cells using a LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates baseline electrolyte (75.2&#8201;%). Meanwhile, due to the flame retarding effect of TMPa, TMPa&#8208;based LHCEs exhibit significantly reduced flammability compared with the conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte.

         <dc:description>An redox&#8208;neutral  S  &#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at dicopper(I,I) center. Treatment of dicopper (I,I) complex with excess NO  &#8226;  and thiol generates a dicopper (I,I) di&#8208;  S  &#8208;nitrosothiol complex [Cu  I  Cu  I  (RSNO)  2  ]  2+  or dicopper (I,I) mono&#8208;  S  &#8208;nitrosothiol complex [Cu  I  Cu  I  (RSNO)]  2+  , which readily release RSNO in 88&#8208;94% yield. The  S  &#8208;nitrosation reaction proceeds through a mixed&#8208;valence [Cu  II  Cu  III  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(  &#956;  &#8208;NO)]  2+  species, which deprotonates RS&#8208;H at the basic  &#956;  &#8208;O site and nitrosates the RS  &#8722;  at the  &#956;  &#8208;NO site. The [Cu  II  Cu  III  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(  &#956;  &#8208;NO)]  2+  complex is also competent for  O  &#8208;nitrosation of MeOH, which is isoelectronic to thiol. In this case, a rare [Cu  II  Cu  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;NO)(OMe)]  2+  intermediate has been isolated and fully characterized, suggesting the  S  &#8208;nitrosation proceeds through the intermediary of analogous [Cu  II  Cu  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;NO)(SR)]  2+  species. The redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral  S&#8208;  nitrosation process reported here represents the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating  S  &#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, adding further implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO  &#8226;  /RSNO.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Structure of Lithium Polysulfides with Anti&#8208;Reductive Solvent Shells for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising secondary battery. However, constant parasitic reactions between Li anode and soluble polysulfide (PS) intermediates significantly deteriorate the working Li anode. The rational design to inhibit the parasitic reactions is plagued by the inability to understand and regulate the electrolyte structure of PSs. Herein, the electrolyte structure of PSs with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proved to be a key reason in decreasing the reactivity of PSs against Li. With isopropyl ether (DIPE) as a cosolvent, DIPE molecules tend to distribute in the outer solvent shell due to poor solvating power. Furthermore, DIPE is more stable than conventional ether solvents against Li metal. The reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. Consequently, the cycling performance of working Li&#8211;S batteries was significantly improved and a pouch cell of 300 Wh kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated. The fundamental understanding in this work provides an unprecedented ground to understand the electrolyte structure of PSs and the rational electrolyte design in Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Boration of Alkyl Halides with Borane without Hydrodehalogenation Enabled by Titanium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides with boranes is reported. The system can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation process that prevails using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The current strategy worked for various alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible radical reaction pathway.







Abstract
An unprecedented and general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8208;X, X=I, Br, Cl, OMs) with borane (HBpin, HBcat) is reported. The use of titanium catalyst can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation products that prevail using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. A series of synthetically useful alkyl boronate esters are readily obtained from various (primary, secondary, and tertiary) alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of other reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Preliminary studies on the mechanism revealed a possible radical reaction pathway. Further extension of our strategy to aryl bromides is also demonstrated.

     alt="Catalytic Boration of Alkyl Halides with Borane without Hydrodehalogenation Enabled by Titanium Catalyst"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides with boranes is reported. The system can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation process that prevails using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The current strategy worked for various alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible radical reaction pathway.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented and general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8208;X, X=I, Br, Cl, OMs) with borane (HBpin, HBcat) is reported. The use of titanium catalyst can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation products that prevail using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. A series of synthetically useful alkyl boronate esters are readily obtained from various (primary, secondary, and tertiary) alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of other reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Preliminary studies on the mechanism revealed a possible radical reaction pathway. Further extension of our strategy to aryl bromides is also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Anisotropic Synthetic Allomelanin Materials via Solid State Polymerization of Self&#8208;Assembled 1,8&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanosomes have diverse morphologies in nature, including spheres, rods, and platelets. By contrast, shapes of synthetic melanins have been almost entirely limited to spherical nanoparticles with few exceptions produced by complex templated synthetic methods. Here, we report a non&#8208;templated method to access synthetic melanins with a variety of architectures including spheres, sheets, and platelets. Three 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene dimers (4&#8208;4&#8242;, 2&#8208;4&#8242; and 2&#8208;2&#8242;) were used as self&#8208;assembling synthons. These dimers pack to form well&#8208;defined structures of varying morphologies depending on the isomer. Specifically, distinctive ellipsoidal platelets can be obtained using 4&#8208;4&#8242; dimers. Solid&#8208;state polymerization of the preorganized dimers generates polymeric synthetic melanins while maintaining the initial particle morphologies. This work provides a new route to anisotropic synthetic melanins, where the building blocks are preorganized into specific shapes, followed by solid&#8208;state polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct observation of metal oxide nanoparticles being transformed into metal single atoms with oxygen&#8208;coordinated structure and high&#8208;loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of bulk metal or nanoparticles into metal single atoms under thermal pyrolysis condition is a highly&#8208;efficient and promising strategy to fabricate single atom catalysts (SACs). Usually, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is used as the anchoring substrate to capture the migrating metal ion species at high temperatures, and stable isolated SACs with nitrogen coordinations are formed during the process. Herein, we report unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single atom catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10 wt%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere at 750  o  C for 2 h. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms and their coordinated structures were confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structures. In addition, the dynamic process of nanoparticles to atoms was directly observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Fe SAC exhibited high activity and superior selectivity for catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide.</dc:description>

         <title>High Pressure In Situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Reveals Turnstile Linker Rotation Upon Room&#8208;Temperature Stepped Uptake of Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined crystallographic and computational investigation reveals a turnstile mechanism for the gated uptake of C1&#8211;C4 alkanes in a seemingly nonporous MOF. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals no significant structural change upon uptake of methane, while subnetwork displacement is induced by ethane uptake. Counterintuitively, only linker rotation without the creation of new space is observed for the sorption of propane and butane.







Abstract
The rare availability of suitable single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structural data allows for the direct interpretation of the response of a framework to gas sorption and may lead to the development of improved functional porous materials. We report an in situ SCXRD structural investigation of a flexible MOF subjected to methane, ethane, propane, and butane gas pressures. Supporting theoretical investigations indicate weak host&#8211;guest interactions for the crystallographically modelled gaseous guests and, in addition, reveal that a turnstile mechanism facilitates the transport of alkanes through the seemingly nonporous system. Inflections present in the adsorption isotherms are furthermore rationalized as due to gate&#8208;opening, but without the expected creation of new accessible space.

         <title>Deliberate Construction of Polyoxoniobates Exploiting the Carbonate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate reacts with the labile decaniobate&#8208;POM, yielding new polyoxoniobates featuring carbonate ligands. The carbonate ligands reinforce oligomerization of clusters in solution that is observed in the solid&#8208;state and scaffolds and stabilizes larger cluster aggregates. Lanthanides directly replace Nb in PONb clusters, rather than associate electrostatically as previously observed. The lanthanide substitution is enabled by carbonate ligation.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs, metals=VV, NbV, TaV, MoVI, WVI) are molecular metal oxides that can be isolated without capping ligands. The high negative charge of polyoxoniobates (PONb) provides strong interactions with heterocations, advantageous for electrostatic assembly of modular materials. In four single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, we demonstrate that carbonate combined with the very reactive decaniobate [Nb10O28]6&#8722; reassembles into a new decaniobate, [Nb10O25(CO3)6]12&#8722;, featuring three carbonate&#8208;ligated Nb&#8208;polyhedra. These Nb&#8208;sites can be replaced by heterometals (lanthanides), and the tridentate carbonate can serve as an anchor point to build niobate&#8208;frameworks. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and two additional X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the reaction pathway proceeds through a Nb24&#8208;PONb intermediate, and the obtained PONb (with or without carbonate) is counterion, temperature, and solvent&#8208;dependent (water or mixed water&#8208;methanol). This provides an uncommon level of control for PONb chemistry.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of Hot Carriers in Plasmonic Catalysis of C&#8722;N Bond Forming Reaction of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gold nanoparticle catalyzes the oxidative coupling of benzylamine to form imine in presence of visible light. Photoexcitation of Au NP generates an electron&#8211;hole pair that activates adsorbates (reactants) at Au NP surface to form a strong oxidant&#8211;reductant pair (benzylamine radical cation and superoxide radical), which is conducive for the reaction at a low temperature, with high product yield and selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous utilization of both the hot carriers (electrons and holes) in the photocatalytic transformation of benzylamine to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine and the scope of reaction has also been successfully demonstrated with catalytic oxidation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzylamine. The wavelength&#8208;dependent excitation of AuNP allows us to tune the potential energy of charge carriers relative to the redox potential of the reactants which leads to energetically favorable product formation on the nanoparticle surface. We capture the formation of reaction intermediates and products by using in situ Raman spectroscopy, complemented by NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS. Based on the experimental substantiations, a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed.

         <title>Asymmetric Core&#8211;Shell Gold Nanoparticles and Controllable Assemblies for SERS Ratiometric Detection of MicroRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of asymmetrical plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) are created, displaying tailorable optical properties. Using amphiphilic polymer brushes, core&#8208;to&#8208;core or shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell dimers with controllable spatial precision and position of EM field enhancement are fabricated. DNA linkers are utilized to form JAuNND12(50&#8201;%), enabling them to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors.







Abstract
Janus nanogap gold nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) with varying proportions of Au shell coverage of (ca. 100/75/50/25&#8201;%) are presented. The internal nanogap between the partial Au shell and core caused asymmetric optical behavior; tunability depends on the degree of Au shell coverage and structural asymmetry. The shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell or core&#8208;to&#8208;core JAuNNDs(50&#8201;%) were self&#8208;assembled from amphiphilic JAuNNPs(50&#8201;%) by tuning the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes on the Au core or shell. The positions of electromagnetic field enhancement of JAuNNDs varied with geometrical configurations because of hybridized plasmonic coupling effects. Furthermore, DNA linkers were utilized to form JAuNND12(50&#8201;%). By combining with Raman molecules, ratiometric SERS signals could be generated, enabling JAuNND12(50&#8201;%) to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors. Asymmetric JAuNNPs allowed facile conjugation of various linkage molecules to fabricate dimeric nanostructures.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pd Nanozyme for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) with dual peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimicking activities induces ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this way Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT can be used against malignant tumors.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an extremely promising tumor therapeutic modality. However, excessive heat inevitably injures normal tissues near tumors, and the damage to cancer cells caused by mild hyperthermia is easily repaired by stress&#8208;induced heat shock proteins (HSPs). Thus, maximizing the PTT efficiency and minimizing the damage to healthy tissues simultaneously by adopting appropriate therapeutic temperatures is imperative. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported: ferroptosis&#8208;boosted mild PTT based on a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme). The Pd SAzyme with atom&#8208;economical utilization of catalytic centers exhibits peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimicking activities, and photothermal conversion performance, which can result in ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving HSPs, which enables Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT.

         <title>Versatile Direct Cyclization Constructs Spiro&#8208;acridan Derivatives for Highly Efficient TADF emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile direct cyclization is demonstrated to proceed by substituted diarylamines with various ketones under simple solvent&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions. It shows huge potential in preparing spiro&#8208;acridan derivatives and TADF emitters.







Abstract
Spiro&#8208;acridan (SpA) derivatives possess a great potential in preparing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. However, the conventional synthetic routes are cost&#8208;expensive and time&#8208;consuming. The development of a simple procedure to synthesize SpAs is still in urgent pursuing appreciated by academic and industrial communities. In this contribution, we present a feasible acid&#8208;catalyzed solvent&#8208;free metal&#8208;free cyclization between diarylamines and ketones to construct SpAs. The as&#8208;constructed moieties provide a wide possibility to assemble efficient TADF emitters. As an example, D2T&#8208;TR with high photoluminescent quantum yield and proper TADF character is applied in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) which achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.1&#8201;%. This work shows us a bright inspiration on developing excellent organic optoelectronic materials and an effective tool to realize it.

         <title>Macroscopic Ultralight Aerogel Monoliths of Imine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step method produces COF aerogel monoliths, based on sol&#8211;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying. 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The aerogels have extremely low densities, high porosity, and mechanically behave as elastic or plastic materials under different strain. They show excellent absorption capacity with high removal efficiency.







Abstract
The use of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in practical applications demands shaping them into macroscopic objects, which remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple three&#8208;step method to produce COF aerogels, based on sol&#8208;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying, in which 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The resultant COF aerogel monoliths have extremely low densities (ca. 0.02&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3), high porosity (total porosity values of ca. 99&#8201;%), and mechanically behave as elastic materials under a moderate strain (&lt;25&#8211;35&#8201;%) but become plastic under greater strain. Moreover, these COF aerogels maintain the micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosity of their constituent COFs, and show excellent absorption capacity (e.g. toluene uptake: 32&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1), with high removal efficiency (ca. 99&#8201;%). The same three&#8208;step method can be used to create functional composites of these COF aerogels with nanomaterials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Alkylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Switching Regioselectivity via Simple Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly effective Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative alkylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane with branched selectivity was achieved by using a cooperative strategy that integrated the unique trifunctional character of hydrazones with Pd/NHC catalysis.







Abstract
Conventional approaches for Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;couplings of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with nucleophiles predominantly deliver the &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkene scaffolds (linear selectivity). Herein, we report a cooperative strategy that can completely switch the reaction selectivity to give the alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkene skeletons (branched selectivity). The unique reactivity of hydrazones that enables analogous inner&#8208;sphere 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination driven by denitrogenation, as well as the assistance of steric&#8208;embedded N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, are the key to switch the regioselectivity. A wide range of hydrazones derived from naturally abundant aryl and alkyl aldehydes are well applicable, and various gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, including modified pharmaceutical and biological molecules, can be efficiently functionalized with high value alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluorinated alkene motifs under mild conditions.

         <title>The Electrolysis of Anti&#8208;Perovskite Li2OHCl for Prelithiation of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl was demonstrated could be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V via two oxidizing routes, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li+ that obtain electrons to deposit or intercalate in anode, with which as cathode Li&#8208;reservoir for pre&#8208;lithiation, the capacities of NMC811&#8741;Si@C full cells were increased proportionally with the varying dosage of pre&#8208;lithiation.







Abstract
Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl was previously studied as a solid&#8208;state Li+ conductor. Here, we report that the Li2OHCl can be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and the release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li+ via two different decomposition routes, depending on the acidity of electrolyte. In the electrolyte with trace acid, the Li2OHCl is oxidized at a constant voltage of 3.3&#8197;V. In neutral electrolyte, the oxidization of Li2OHCl starts at 4.0&#8197;V, but the produced HCl will increase the acidity of electrolyte and lead to a voltage drop to 3.3&#8197;V for the electrolysis of Li2OHCl. The electrolysis of Li2OHCl delivers a lithium releasing capacity as high as 810&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an equivalent Li&#8208;deposition or Li&#8208;intercalation on anode, making it a promising candidate as a Li reservoir for prelithiation of anode. Using Li2OHCl as the lithium source, silicon&#8208;carbon (Si@C) composite anode can be effectively prelithiated. The full cells composed of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode and prelithiated Si@C anode exhibited increased capacities with the increment of prelithiation dosages.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Using a Hybrid Hypercrosslinked Polymer**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid hypercrosslinked polymer was prepared that is capable of encapsulating both organic and inorganic phase change materials via a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous encapsulation strategy.







Abstract
In this work, an organic/inorganic hybrid polymer containing siloxyl functional groups was synthesized and applied to encapsulate phase change materials (PCMs). Owing to the mild conditions of the hypercrosslinking reaction, which only requires the addition of a catalytic amount of aqueous alkaline solution, both organic and inorganic PCMs are tolerated. It is noteworthy that the initial homogeneous state of the reaction mixture allowed the ultimate encapsulation rate of the PCMs and the uniform blending of the third nano&#8208;additives with the aim of thermal conductivity enhancement. Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid hydrophobic polymer in a phase change composite endows the latter with a unique self&#8208;cleaning property. This novel PCM encapsulation protocol is suitable for nanoparticles including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles, and inorganic oxide nanoparticles. A thermal conductivity enhancement of 600&#8201;% was achieved along with 93.7&#8201;% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1 without leakage.

         <dc:description>Deracemization describes the conversion of a racemic mixture of a chiral molecule into an enantioenriched mixture or an enantiopure compound without structural modifications. Herein, we report an inherently chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane whose chiral pocket is capable of transforming the racemic mixture of [5]&#8208;helicene into an enantioenriched mixture with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 66%. UV/Vis and fluorescence titration studies reveal high binding affinities for this cyclophane host composed of two helically twisted PBI dyes for the respective homochiral carbohelicene guests with outstanding binding constants of up to 3.9 &#215; 1010 M&#8208;1 for [4]&#8208;helicene. 2D NMR studies and single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis demonstrate that the observed strong and enantioselective binding for homochiral carbohelicenes and the successful deracemization of [5]&#8208;helicene can be explained by the enzyme&#8208;like perfect shape complementarity of the macrocyclic supramolecular host.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Tracking and Dynamically Quantifying of Reversible Changes of Extracellular Ca2+ in Multiple Brain Regions of Freely Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array was created to real&#8208;time tracking and reversibly quantifying of extracellular concentration of Ca2+ together with neuron activity across many regions in freely moving mammalian brain for 60&#8197;days. The changing sequence and rate of Ca2+ in 7 brain regions were different during the stroke, and ROS scavenger could protect Ca2+ influx and neuronal activity after stroke.







Abstract
Understanding physiological and pathological processes in the brain requires tracking the reversible changes in chemical signals with long&#8208;term stability. We developed a new anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array to real&#8208;time quantify extracellular Ca2+ concentrations together with neuron activity across many regions in the mammalian brain for 60&#8197;days, in which the signal degradation was &lt; ca. 8&#8201;%. The microarray with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution (ca. 10&#8197;&#956;m, ca. 1.3&#8197;s) was implanted into 7 brain regions of free&#8208;moving mice to monitor reversible changes of extracellular Ca2+ upon ischemia&#8208;reperfusion processes. The changing sequence and rate of Ca2+ in 7 brain regions were different during the stroke. ROS scavenger could protect Ca2+ influx and neuronal activity after stroke, suggesting the significant influence of ROS on Ca2+ overload and neuron death. We demonstrated this microarray is a versatile tool for investigating brain dynamic during pathological processes and drug treatment.

         <title>Functionalization of Silk by AIEgens through Facile Bioconjugation: Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Term Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent silks with full&#8208;color emissions were fabricated through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation with five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). White light&#8208;emitting silk was prepared and demonstrated potential applications in flexible displays. Moreover, red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silk materials were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging.







Abstract
Silkworm silk is a promising natural biopolymer for textile and biomedical applications for its remarkable flexibility, excellent biocompatibility and controllable biodegradability. The functionalization of silks makes them more versatile for flexible displays and visible bioscaffolds. However, fluorescent silks are normally fabricated through unstable physical absorption or complicated chemical reactions under harsh conditions. Herein, we developed a simple strategy for preparing fluorescent silks. Five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) with activated alkynes were synthesized by rational molecular design, and then reacted with silk fibers through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation. The resulting conjugates show bright full&#8208;color emissions and high stability. A white light&#8208;emitting silk was fabricated by simultaneous bioconjugation with red&#8208;, green&#8208; and blue&#8208;emissive AIEgens. The red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silks were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, demonstrating great potential for tissue engineering and bioscaffold monitoring.

A white light&#8208;emitting silk was fabricated by simultaneous bioconjugation with red&#8208;, green&#8208; and blue&#8208;emissive AIEgens. The red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silks were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, demonstrating great potential for tissue engineering and bioscaffold monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Functionalized Phosphonium Cations Enable Zinc Metal Reversibility in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of phosphonium&#8208;based supporting salts and a subtle difference in their ligand chemistry remarkably improves the reversibility of aqueous Zn electrolytes. By promoting interphase formation, P444(2O1)&#8208;TFSI supports a Zn coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% even at 1.17&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 20&#8201;% Zn utilization per cycle, and a stable Zn&#8741;Na2V6O16&#8901;1.63&#8201;H2O cell cycling.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc metal batteries promise attractive advantages including safety, high volumetric energy density, and low cost; however, such benefits cannot be unlocked unless Zn reversibility meets stringent commercial viability. Herein, we report remarkable improvements on Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes when phosphonium&#8208;based cations are used to reshape interfacial structures and interphasial chemistries, particularly when their ligands contain an ether linkage. This novel aqueous electrolyte supports unprecedented Zn reversibility by showing dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping for over 6400&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, or over 280&#8197;h at 2.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% even with 20&#8201;% Zn utilization per cycle. Excellent full cell performance is demonstrated with Na2V6O16&#8901;1.63&#8201;H2O cathode, which cycles for 2000 times at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. The microscopic characterization and modeling identify the mechanism of unique interphase chemistry from phosphonium and its functionalities as the key factors responsible for dictating reversible Zn chemistry

         <title>An Aromatic Micelle&#8208;Based Saccharide Cluster with Changeable Fluorescent Color and its Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multisaccharide&#8208;coated aromatic micelle forms in water through quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from blue to strong red, orange, and green (&#934;F up to 67&#8201;%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes. Moreover, the present fluorescent clusters display selective interactions with mannose&#8208;binding proteins in vitro.







Abstract
To develop a new type of synthetic saccharide clusters with changeable fluorescent colors, we herein designed a multisaccharide&#8208;coated aromatic micelle. The new cluster forms in water through the quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The spherical assembly, with a 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized polyaromatic core and ca. 18 saccharide pendants, is stable even under high dilution conditions (up to 0.02&#8197;mM). The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from moderate blue (&#934;F=19&#8201;%) to strong red, orange, and green (&#934;F up to 67&#8201;%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes in water. Moreover, the present fluorescent clusters, both with and without the dyes, display selective interactions with mannose&#8208;binding proteins in vitro.

         <title>Organic Tetrabutylammonium Cation Intercalation to Heal Inorganic CsPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite is well&#8208;known for resistant to organic cation substitution. Here, a specific organic cation of tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) with strong ionic binding to the Pb&#8208;I octahedral framework can effectively intercalate into CsPbI3 and substitute the Cs+ cation. A post&#8208;synthesis TBAI passivation then leads to in situ formation of TBAPbI3 layer to heal CsPbI3 perovskite with lower defect density and enhanced stability.







Abstract
The in situ formation of reduced dimensional perovskite layer via post&#8208;synthesis ion exchange has been an effective way of passivating organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites. In contrast, cesium ions in Cs&#8208;based inorganic perovskite with strong ionic binding energy cannot exchange with those well&#8208;known organic cations to form reduced dimensional perovskite. Herein, we demonstrate that tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) cation can intercalate into CsPbI3 to effectively substitute the Cs cation and to form one&#8208;dimensional (1D) TBAPbI3 layer in the post&#8208;synthesis TBAI treatment. Such TBA cation intercalation leads to in situ formation of TBAPbI3 protective layer to heal defects at the surface of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite. The TBAPbI3&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite exhibited enhanced stability and lower defect density, and the corresponding perovskite solar cell devices achieved an improved efficiency up to 18.32&#8201;% compared to 15.85&#8201;% of the control one.

         <title>Potent Cyclic Tetrapeptide for Lead Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic tetrapeptides were designed and screened for their ability to recover Pb&#8208;poisoned bacteria and human cells. Excellent potency was identified with two members, outcompeting the benchmark clinical chelating agents. The leading peptide was further characterized, revealing an outstanding metal affinity and selectivity, indicating its great potential as a next&#8208;generation treatment for Pb poisoning.







Abstract
Lead (Pb) is a ubiquitous poisonous metal, affecting the health of vast populations worldwide. Medications to treat Pb poisoning suffer from various limitations and are often toxic owing to insufficient metal selectivity. Here, we report a cyclic tetrapeptide that selectively binds Pb and eradicates its toxic effect on the cellular level, with superior potency than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art drugs. The Pb&#8208;peptide complex is remarkably strong and was characterized experimentally and computationally. Accompanied by the lack of toxicity and enhanced stability of this peptide, these qualities indicate its merit as a potential remedy for Pb poisoning.

         <title>Nitrone and Alkyne Cascade Reactions for Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective 1&#8208;Pyrroline Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal [4+1] cascade reaction of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been developed for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of densely substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines. This transformation provides a distinct disconnection strategy to access these heterocycles in comparison to traditional approaches. The scope, tolerance, and utility of the method are discussed, and mechanistic studies are examined to better understand reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
The synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrrolines from N&#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been explored as a retrosynthetic alternative to traditional approaches. These cascade reactions are formal [4+1] cycloadditions that proceed through a proposed dipolar cycloaddition and N&#8208;alkenylisoxazoline [3,3&#8242;]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. A variety of cyclic alkynes and terminal alkynes have been shown to undergo the transformation with N&#8208;alkenylnitrones under mild conditions to provide the corresponding spirocyclic and densely substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the balance of steric and electronic effects that promote the cascade process and control the diastereo&#8208; and regioisomeric preferences of the 1&#8208;pyrroline products. Diastereoselective derivatization of the 1&#8208;pyrrolines prepared by the cascade reaction demonstrate the divergent synthetic utility of the new method.

     alt="Nitrone and Alkyne Cascade Reactions for Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective 1&#8208;Pyrroline Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A formal [4+1] cascade reaction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been developed for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of densely substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines. This transformation provides a distinct disconnection strategy to access these heterocycles in comparison to traditional approaches. The scope, tolerance, and utility of the method are discussed, and mechanistic studies are examined to better understand reactivity and selectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrrolines from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been explored as a retrosynthetic alternative to traditional approaches. These cascade reactions are formal [4+1] cycloadditions that proceed through a proposed dipolar cycloaddition and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkenylisoxazoline [3,3&#8242;]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. A variety of cyclic alkynes and terminal alkynes have been shown to undergo the transformation with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkenylnitrones under mild conditions to provide the corresponding spirocyclic and densely substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the balance of steric and electronic effects that promote the cascade process and control the diastereo&#8208; and regioisomeric preferences of the 1&#8208;pyrroline products. Diastereoselective derivatization of the 1&#8208;pyrrolines prepared by the cascade reaction demonstrate the divergent synthetic utility of the new method.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Threefold Collaborative Stabilization of Ag14&#8208;Nanorods by Hydrophobic Ti16&#8208;Oxo Clusters and Alkynes: Designable Assembly and Solid&#8208;State Optical&#8208;Limiting Application</title>

         <dc:description>
An Ag cluster is protected by a combination of hydrophobic organic fluorinated ligands, an inorganic Ti&#8208;O shell, and terminal alkyne caps, which results in a novel Ag14&#8208;nanorod@Ti16&#8208;oxo&#8208;nanoring core&#8211;shell nanocluster. This well protected cluster exhibits superhydrophobicity, excellent ambient stability, and unprecedented solid&#8208;state optical limiting characteristic.







Abstract
Ag nanoclusters have received increasing attention due to their atomically precise and diverse structures and intriguing optical properties. Nevertheless, the inherent instability of Ag nanoclusters has seriously hindered their practical application. In this work, for the first time, Ag clusters are collaboratively protected by hydrophobic Ti&#8208;oxo clusters and alkyne ligands. Initially, a pyramidal Ag5 cluster terminated with tBuC&#8801;C&#8722; and CH3CN was inserted into the cavity of a Ti8&#8208;oxo nanoring to form Ag5@Ti8. To overcome the instability of acetonitrile&#8208;terminated silver site, such two Ag5@Ti8 clusters could sandwich an Ag4 unit to form Ag14&#8208;nanorod@Ti16&#8208;oxo&#8208;nanoring (Ag14@Ti16), which is peripherally protected by fluorophenyl groups and alkyne caps. This threefold protected (hydrophobic fluorinated organic layer, Ti&#8208;O shell, and terminal alkyne ligands) Ag14@Ti16 exhibits superhydrophobicity and excellent ambient stability, endowing it with solid&#8208;state optical limiting characteristics.

         <title>Structural and mechanistic insights into C&#8208;S bond formation in gliotoxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus  Aspergillus fumigatus  however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulphur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulphurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8208;sulphur linkage formation from a bis&#8208;hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Ser]&#8208;bis&#8208;glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified  A. fumigatus  strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme&#8208;mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C&#8208;S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A set of rhenium&#8208;catalyzed aryl&#8208;acylcyclization between (hetero)arylmagnesium halides and enol lactones through a cascade Csp  2  &#8210;Csp  2  /Csp  2  &#8210;Csp  2  bond formation has been developed under mild reaction conditions. Indeed, a wide range of functional groups on both organomagnesium halides and enol lactones are well tolerated by the simple rhenium catalysis, thus furnishing polyfunctionalized indenones in one&#8208;pot fashion and with complete control of the regioselectivity. Moreover, this approach also provides a straightforward synthesis to neo&#8208;lignan and (  iso  )pauciflorol  F  .

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;range polariton&#8208;assisted energy transfer in organic microcavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;radiative energy transfer between spatially&#8208;separated molecules in a microcavity can occur when an excitonic state on both molecules are strongly&#8208;coupled to the same optical mode, forming so&#8208;called &#8216;hybrid&#8217; polaritons. Such energy transfer has previously been explored when thin&#8208;films of different molecules are relatively closely spaced (~100 nm). In this letter, we explore strong&#8208;coupled microcavities in which thin&#8208;films of two J&#8208;aggregated molecular dyes were separated by a spacer layer having a thickness of up to 2 &#956;m. Here, strong light&#8208;matter coupling and hybridisation between the excitonic transition is identified using white&#8208;light reflectivity and photoluminescence emission. We use steady&#8208;state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8216;mesoscopic distances&#8217;, with this process being enhanced compared to non&#8208;cavity control structures.</dc:description>

We use steady&#8208;state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8216;mesoscopic distances&#8217;, with this process being enhanced compared to non&#8208;cavity control structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering in High Performance Ambipolar Emissive Mesopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesopolymers, with structural defects free, high solubility and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation of conjugated polymers, open a new avenue for organic optoelectronics. For example, organic light emitting transistors (OLETs) that integrate the functions of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) together, and are promising devices for next generation display technology and organic electrically pumped laser. However, in most cases, charge transport ability and light emitting strength are contradictory within one conjugated polymer. Therefore, the development of polymeric materials with high carrier mobility and light emitting ability becomes a key challenge. Herein, three low molecular weighted mesopolymers with thienopyrroledione&#8208;benzothiadiazole repeating units (meso&#8208;TBTF) were obtained by direct arylation polymerization of monomers. Resultant mesopolymers display strong solid state emission and high ambipolar carrier mobility, making them competitive candidates for light&#8208;emission devices. The molecular weights of meso&#8208;TBTF can be tuned by polymerization temperature, affording products with molecular weights of 3.8 kDa, 6.7 kDa, and 9.9 kDa for device characterization. All mesopolymers exhibit undetectable homo&#8208;coupling defects with gradiently&#8208;tunable energy levels and better electrical performance over the corresponding high molecular weight polymer. It is found that meso&#8208;TBTF with molecular weight of 6.7 kDa has the best electrical performance with an average mobility of 5.65 &#215; 10&#8208;3 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 for electrons and 1.50 &#215; 10&#8208;2 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 for holes, which are among the highest ambibipolar luminescent polymers. In summary, all mesopolymers have photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of about 50% in solution and 10% in solid state. Polymer light emitting diodes of this material are fabricated to explore its potential use in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Anthracycline Utorubicin for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel anticancer compounds and their precision delivery systems are actively developed to create potent and well&#8208;tolerated anticancer therapeutics. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel anthracycline, Utorubicin (UTO), and its preclinical development as an anticancer payload for nanocarriers. Free UTO was significantly more toxic to cultured tumor cell lines than the clinically used anthracycline, doxorubicin. Nanoformulated UTO, encapsulated in polymeric nanovesicles (polymersomes, PS), reduced the viability of cultured malignant cells and this effect was potentiated by functionalization with a tumor&#8208;penetrating peptide (TPP). Systemic peptide&#8208;guided PS showed preferential accumulation in triple&#8208;negative breast tumor xenografts implanted in mice. At the same systemic UTO dose, the highest UTO accumulation in tumor tissue was seen for the TPP&#8208;targeted PS, followed by nontargeted PS, and free doxorubicin. Our study suggests potential applications for UTO in the treatment of malignant diseases and encourages further preclinical and clinical studies on UTO as a nanocarrier payload for precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;valence compounds as polarizing agents for Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization in solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper we investigate a novel set of polarizing agents &#8208; mixed&#8208;valence compounds &#8208; by theoretical and experimental methods and demonstrate their performance in high&#8208;field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) NMR experiments in the solid state. Mixed&#8208;valence compounds constitute a group of molecules, in which molecular mobility persists even in solids. Consequently, such polarizing agents can be used to perform Overhauser&#8208;DNP experiments in solid&#8208;state, with favorable conditions for dynamic nuclear polarization formation at ultra&#8208;high magnetic fields</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Hybrid Bi&#8208;microcompartments with Exocytosis&#8208;Inspired Behavior toward Fast Temperature&#8208;Modulated Transportation of living Organisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the unique characteristics of living cells, the creation of life&#8208;inspired functional ensembles is a rapidly expanding research topic, enabling transformative applications in various disciplines. Herein, we report a facile method for the fabrication of phospholipid and block copolymer hybrid bi&#8208;microcompartments via spontaneous asymmetric assembly at the water/tributyrin interface, whereby the temperature&#8208;mediated dewetting of the inner microcompartments allowed for exocytosis to occur in the constructed system. The exocytosis location and commencement time could be mediated by the buoyancy of the inner microcompartment and temperature, respectively. Furthermore, the constructed bi&#8208;microcompartments showed excellent biocompatibility and a universal loading capacity toward cargoes of widely ranging sizes; thus, the proliferation and temperature&#8208;programmed transportation of living organisms was achieved. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of complex mesoscale dynamic ensembles with life&#8208;inspired behaviors and provide a novel platform for on&#8208;demand transportation of various living organisms.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tumor biomarker&#8208;based theranostics has achieved broad interest and success in recent years. However, single biomarker&#8208;based recognition can cause false&#8208;positive feedback, including the on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor phenomenon by the absence of tumor&#8208;specific antigen. Besides, multi&#8208;biomarker&#8208;based recognition molecules often elicit nonspecific and undesired internalization when they bind to &#8216;&#8216;bystander&#8217;&#8217; cells. Herein, we report a universal DNA tetrahedral scaffold (DTS) that anchors on the cell membrane to load multiple aptamers and therapeutics for precise and effective theranostics. This DNA logic&#8208;gated nanorobot (DLGN) not only facilitates the precise discrimination among five cell lines, but also triggers the synergistic killing of effector aptamer&#8208;tethered synergistic drugs (EASDs) to target cancer cells. Logic&#8208;gated recognition integrated in aptamer&#8208;functionalized molecular machines will prompt fast tumor profiling,  in situ  capture and isolation, and safe delivery of precise medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Hole&#8208;Tunneling Heterojunction of Hematite&#8208;Based Photoanodes Accelerates Photosynthetic Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reported the rational design of single&#8208;atom metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (SMIS) heterojunctions based on earth&#8208;abundant Sn&#8208;doped hematite nanorods (SF NRs) for high&#8208;rate, efficient CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion and unveiled the details of dielectric field&#8208;assisted hole&#8208;tunneling dynamics at the SMIS heterojunctions. The results showed that the RuO  x  &#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe  2  O  3  photoanode (SMIS&#8208;3), which was prepared by a combined methodology of atomic deposition of 3.0 nm thick Al  2  O  3  overlayer with chemical grafting of atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  hole&#8208;collectors, gives an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion efficiency of 52.0% under 370 nm light irradiation in 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer solution at 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl, &gt;5&#8208;fold larger than that of the bare SF NRs photoanode. The characterization results clearly indicated that the dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al  2  O  3  /SF NRs interface. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber facilitates the fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  species, accelerating the O  2  &#8208;evolving reaction kinetics in the photoreaction compartment of PV&#8208;coupled artificial photosynthetic cells. Accordingly, a maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3 mmol&#8226;g  &#8208;1  &#8226;h  &#8208;1  was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO  2  &#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode, and an impressive overall quantum efficiency of 5.7% was recorded under 450 nm light irradiation.</dc:description>

The results showed that the RuO  x  &#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe  2  O  3  photoanode (SMIS&#8208;3), which was prepared by a combined methodology of atomic deposition of 3.0 nm thick Al  2  O  3  overlayer with chemical grafting of atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  hole&#8208;collectors, gives an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion efficiency of 52.0% under 370 nm light irradiation in 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer solution at 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl, &amp;gt;5&#8208;fold larger than that of the bare SF NRs photoanode. The characterization results clearly indicated that the dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al  2  O  3  /SF NRs interface. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber facilitates the fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  species, accelerating the O  2  &#8208;evolving reaction kinetics in the photoreaction compartment of PV&#8208;coupled artificial photosynthetic cells. Accordingly, a maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3 mmol&#8226;g  &#8208;1  &#8226;h  &#8208;1  was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO  2  &#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode, and an impressive overall quantum efficiency of 5.7% was recorded under 450 nm light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling Strategy for CO2 Valorization Integrated with Organic Synthesis by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into solar fuels and/or fine chemicals is a promising way to enrich energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  However, the conventional reaction system for CO  2  photoreduction with pure H  2  O or sacrificial agents usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency, poor stability or cost&#8208;ineffective atom economy. Recent surge of integrating photocatalytic CO  2  valorization with selective organic synthesis into one reaction system indicates an efficient modus operandi that enables sufficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes to  achieve the sustainable economic and social development goals. This paper reviews the current advances in cooperative photoredox reaction systems of integrating CO  2  valorization with organics upgrading based on heterogeneous photocatalysis. The applications and virtues of this photoredox&#8208;based win&#8208;win coupling strategy, as well as the understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms are demonstrated. The ongoing challenges and prospects for further exploration of such versatile and efficient photoredox coupling reaction systems integrating CO  2  valorization with organic synthesis are critically discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymers for efficient Fluorocarbon&#8208;based Adsorption Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption&#8208;based cooling is an energy efficient renewable&#8208;energy technology that can be driven using low&#8208;grade industrial waste heat and/or solar heat. Here, we report the first exploration of fluorocarbon adsorption using porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) for this cooling application. High fluorocarbon R134a equilibrium capacities and unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms are revealed for the materials, namely COP&#8208;2 and COP&#8208;3. The key role of mesoporous defects on this unusual adsorption behavior was demonstrated by molecular simulations based&#8208;on atomistic defective models built for both porous COPs. Analysis of simulated R134a adsorption isotherms for varying defect&#8208;containing atomistic models of the COPs shows a direct correlation between higher fluorocarbon adsorption capacities and increasing pore volumes induced by defects. Combined with their high porosities, excellent reversibility, fast kinetics, and large operating window, these defective porous COPs are proven to be promising for adsorption&#8208;based cooling applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of meso&#8208;chiral interconversion in butterfly&#8208;shape overcrowded alkene rotor tunable by solvent properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over dynamic motion at the molecular level and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness are important issues for making nano&#8208;motors, nano&#8208;actuators or nano&#8208;sensors. Elucidation of dynamics of molecular rotational motion is an essential part and still challenging area of research. In this report, demonstration of reversible diastereomeric interconversion of a molecular rotor composed of overcrowded butterfly&#8208;shape alkene (  FDF  ) is given. Its inherent dual rotatory motion (two rotors, one stator) with interconversion between two diastereomers, chiral&#160;  trans  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;and meso&#160;  cis  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;forms, has been examined in detail upon varying temperatures and solvents. The free energy profile of 180 &#176; &#160;revolution of one rotor part has a bimodal shape with unevenly positioned maxima (i.e. transition states).&#160;  FDF  &#160;in aromatic solvents adopts preferentially meso&#160;  cis  &#8208;conformation, while in non&#8208;aromatic solvents a chiral&#160;  trans  &#8208;conformation is more abundant. Additionally, moderate correlations between the&#160;  trans  &#8208;  FDF  /  cis  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;ratio and solvent parameters, such as refractive index, polarizability, and viscosity were found. The results presented here have implementations in several fields of organic chemistry, such as design of artificial molecular machines, asymmetric/stereoselective reactions and solvent properties scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Kinetic and Spectroscopic Signatures of Copper Sites for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites of different topologies possess high activity in the direct conversion of methane to methanol via the chemical looping approach. Despite a large number of studies, identification of the active sites, and especially their intrinsic kinetic characteristics remain incomplete and ambiguous. In the present work, we collate the kinetic behavior of different copper species with their spectroscopic identities and track the evolution of various copper motifs during the reaction. Using time&#8208;resolved UV&#8208;vis and  in situ  EPR, XAS, and FTIR spectroscopies, two types of copper monomers were identified, one of which is active in the reaction with methane, in addition to a copper dimeric species with the mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo structure. Kinetic measurements showed that the reaction rate of the copper monomers is somewhat slower than that of the dicopper mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo species, while the activation energy is two times lower.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoreticular Crystallization of Highly Porous Cubic Covalent Organic Cage Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modular frameworks featuring well&#8208;defined pore structures in microscale domains establish tailor&#8208;made porous materials. For open molecular solids however, maintaining long&#8208;range order after desolvation is inherently challenging, since packing is usually governed by only a few supramolecular interactions. Here we report on two series of nanocubes obtained by co&#8208;condensation of two different hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacenes (TBTQs) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acids (BDBAs) with varying linear alkyl chains in 2,5&#8208;position.&#160;  n  Butyl groups at the apical position of the TBTQ vertices yielded soluble model compounds, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, methyl&#8208;substituted cages spontaneously crystallized as isostructural and highly porous solids with BET surface areas and pore volumes of up to 3426&#160;m  2  &#160;g  &#8722;1  &#160;and 1.82 cm  3  &#160;g  &#8722;1  . Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and sorption measurements revealed an intricate cubic arrangement of alternating micro&#8208; and mesopores in the range of 0.97&#8211;2.2&#160;nm that are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents at the BDBA linker.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of an enantiopure sub&#8208;monolayer of helicenes radical cations on Au(111) surface via non&#8208;covalent interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality and magnetism of molecules are two properties that in the last years raised notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices. Chiral helicenes combine these functionalities, and their nanostructuration is the first step toward&#160; developing new multifunctional devices. Here, we present a novel assembling strategy to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate permitting the persistence of both the paramagnetic character and chirality of these molecules at the nanoscale. In&#8208;house characterizations demonstrated the retention of the chemical and paramagnetic properties after the deposition process. Furthermore, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Na9Bi5Os3O24: A&#160; Diamagnetic Oxide Featuring a Pronouncedly Jahn&#8208;Teller Compressed Octahedral Coordination of Osmium(VI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) theorem constitutes one of the most fundamental and stringent concepts in chemistry. In transition elements chemistry, the 3  d  4  , 3  d  9  , and 3  d  7  configurations in octahedral complexes are particularly illustrative, where a distortion in local geometry is associated to a reduction of electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate about the fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate. In contrast, for Na  9  Bi  5  Os  3  O  24  , the octahedron around Os  6+  (5  d  2  ) is heavily compressed, and the splitting of the  t  2g  set of 5  d  orbitals induced by this compression is extreme, such that a diamagnetic ground state results. Both these issues are extremely rare. The splitting into a lower  d  xy  (hosting two  d  electrons with opposite spin) and two higher  d  xz  and  d  yz  orbitals is so large that the Hund&#180;s coupling for  t  2g  electrons is overcome. These effects are not forced by structural constraints, the structure offers sufficient space for osmium to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. The relevance of these findings is far reaching, since they provide insights in the hierarchy of perturbations defining ground states of open shell electronic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;guided Design of G Protein&#8208;coupled Receptor Polypharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many diseases are polygenic and can only be treated efficiently with drugs that modulate multiple targets. However, rational design of compounds with multi&#8208;target profiles is rarely pursued because it is considered too difficult, in particular if the drug must enter the CNS. Here, a structure&#8208;based strategy to identify dual&#8208;target ligands of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors is presented. We use this approach to design compounds that both antagonize the A2A adenosine receptor and activate the D2 dopamine receptor, which have excellent potential as antiparkinson drugs. Atomic resolution models of the receptors guided generation of a chemical library with compounds designed to occupy orthosteric and secondary binding pockets in both targets. Structure&#8208;based virtual screens identified ten compounds, of which three had affinity for both targets. One of these scaffolds was optimized to nanomolar dual&#8208;target activity and showed the predicted pharmacodynamic effect in a rat model of Parkinsonism.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ Sites for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can effectively facilitate carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) to produce multi&#8208;carbon products. However, the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ and the mechanistic understanding remain elusive. This paper describes the controllable construction of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella to enhance CO2ER performance. Specifically, 20% Cu/CuSiO3 shows the superior CO2ER performance with 51.8% C2H4 Faraday efficiency at &#8208;1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) during the 6 hours&#8208;test. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism over Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites. The enhancement in CO2ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs: The Cu0 site activates CO2 and facilitates the following electron transfers; while the Cu+ site strengthens the *CO adsorption to further boost C&#8208;C coupling. This paper provides an efficient strategy to rationally design Cu&#8208;based catalysts with viable valence states to boost CO2ER.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise identification and characterization of catalytically active sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;alumina is one of the oldest and most important commercial catalytic materials with high surface area and stability. These attributes enabled its use as the first commercial large&#8208;scale heterogeneous catalyst for ethanol dehydration. Despite progress in materials characterization and over a hundred years of active research, the nature of the specific sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina which are responsible for its unique catalytic properties has remained obscure and controversial. Using combined infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements we identify the octahedral, amphoteric (O)  5  Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites on the (100) segments of massively restructured (110) facets on typical rhombus&#8208;platelet &#947;&#8208;alumina as well as the (100) segments of irrational surfaces (invariably always present in all &#947;&#8208;alumina samples) responsible for its unique catalytic activity. Such (O)  5  Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites are also present on the macroscopically defined (100) facets of &#947;&#8208;alumina with elongated/rod&#8208;like geometry. The exact mechanism by which these sites lose &#8208;OH groups upon thermal dehydroxylation resulting in coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al  +3  O  5  sites is clarified. These coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al sites demonstrate new chemistry, producing well&#8208;defined thermally stable Al&#8208;carbonyl complexes. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the nature of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina and their role as catalytically active sites.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&#947;&#8208;alumina is one of the oldest and most important commercial catalytic materials with high surface area and stability.

         <dc:description>Here, a tumor&#8211;targeting yet enhanced chemotherapy enabled by aptamer&#8211;drug conjugate nanomicelles is reported to boost antitumor immune responses. Aptamer&#8211;multivalent&#8211;drug conjugate (ApMDC), an amphiphilic telodendrimer consisting of a hydrophilic aptamer and a hydrophobic monodendron anchored with four anticancer drugs by acid&#8211;labile linkers, is designed and synthesized. By co&#8211;self&#8211;assembly with an ApMDC analogue, in which aptamer is replaced with polyethylene glycol, surface aptamer density of these nanomicelles can be screened to reach an optimal complementation between blood circulation and tumor&#8211;targeting ability. Optimized nanomicelles can enhance immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, which strikingly augments tumor&#8211;specific immune responses of checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent tumor&#8211;bearing mice. ApMDC nanomicelles represent a robust platform for structure&#8211;function optimization of drug conjugates and nanomedicines, suggesting an alternative to improve antitumor efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zinc&#8208;Doped Silica Nanospheres Simultaneously Featuring Stable Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence and phosphorescence are known as two kinds of fundamental optical signals, which have been used for myriad applications. Of particular note, simultaneous activation of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in aqueous phase remains a big challenge up to present. Herein, we prepare a kind of zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) with fluorescence and RTP properties through a facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy. For the as&#8208;prepared Zn@SiNSs, the recombination of electrons and holes in defects and defect&#8208;stabilized excitons derived from oxygen vacancy/C=N bonds lead to the production of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived RTP (emission lasting for ~9 s, quantum yield (QY): ~33.6%, RTP lifetime: ~236 ms). In addition, the internal Si&#8208;O bonded networks and hydrophilic surface in Zn@SiNSs can reduce nonradiative decay to form self&#8208;protective RTP, and also provide high water solubility, excellent pH&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium&#8722;sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The employment of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect within lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100% atom&#8208;utilization possess competitive advantages to serve as both anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. However, it&#8217;s still a great challenge due to the insufficiency of facile synthetic strategy and ambiguity of the structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, a novel kind of tungsten (W) SAC immobilized on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (W/NG) with a unique W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C coordination configuration and a high W loading of 8.6 wt% is first proposed via a self&#8208;template and self&#8208;reduction strategy. The special local coordination environment of W atom endows the W/NG with elevated LiPSs adsorption ability and catalytic activity evidenced by combination of experimental and theoretical studies. Impressively, LSBs equipped with W/NG modified separator manifest greatly improved electrochemical performances with high cycling stability over 1000 cycles and ultrahigh rate capability. Moreover, it indicates high areal capacity of 6.24 mAh cm&#8722;2  with robust cycling life at a high sulfur mass loading of 8.3 mg cm&#8722;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction of Novel van der Waals Boron Oxides with Superior Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10791-10797, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring boron oxide (18MR&#8208;B2O3) is predicted with 1:1 ratio of [BO3] triangles and [B3O6] boroxol rings. Its van der Waals stackings, AA and AB, satisfy all the stringent criteria for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials, exhibiting short second harmonic generation (SHG) phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and large SHG response.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials are attracting increasing attention because of their structural diversity and complexity. Using the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystal structure prediction method combined with the first&#8208;principles calculations, here we propose layered 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (18MR) boron oxide B2O3 polymorphs as high&#8208;performance NLO materials. 18MR&#8208;B2O3 with the AA and AB stackings are potential DUV NLO materials. The superior performing 18MR&#8208;B2O3AB has an unprecedentedly high second harmonic generation coefficient of 1.63&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, the largest among the DUV NLO materials, three times larger than that of the advanced DUV NLO material KBe2BO3F2 and comparable to that of &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4. Its unusually large birefringence of 0.196 at 400&#8197;nm guarantees the phase&#8208;matching wavelength &#955;PM to reach this material's extreme absorption edge of &#8776;154&#8197;nm.

         <title>Cage&#8208;Like Porous Materials with Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Excellent C2H2/CO2 Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10828-10832, May 3, 2021. </description>

Cage&#8208;like FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, nPr and iPr) series all exhibit excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance, which may overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based separation is an important technology for C2H2 purification due to the environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;efficient advantage. In addition to the high selectivity of C2H2/CO2, the high uptake of C2H2 also plays an important role in the separation progress. However, the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance is still in a dilemma. Herein, we report a series of cage&#8208;like porous materials named FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, nPr and iPr) which all have high C2H2 uptakes at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K. Dynamic breakthrough studies show that they all exhibit excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance. Particularly, FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;Me possesses a long breakthrough time up to 90&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation reveals that the suitable pore space and geometry contribute much to the excellent separation performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adsorption&#8208;based separation is an important technology for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; purification due to the environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;efficient advantage. In addition to the high selectivity of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the high uptake of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also plays an important role in the separation progress. However, the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance is still in a dilemma. Herein, we report a series of cage&#8208;like porous materials named FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr and &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr) which all have high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K. Dynamic breakthrough studies show that they all exhibit excellent C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance. Particularly, FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;Me possesses a long breakthrough time up to 90&#8197;min&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation reveals that the suitable pore space and geometry contribute much to the excellent separation performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10888-10894, May 3, 2021. </description>

CO oxidation taking place under a 2D microporous silicon dioxide film demonstrates a &#8764;12&#8201;% enhancement in CO2 production by creating an interfacial microenvironment that fosters a higher coverage of reactive Pd surface oxide sites that are integral to CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8211;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using in situ IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO2 formation rates than Pd alone.

         <title>Unprecedented 2D Homochiral Hybrid Lead&#8208;Iodide Perovskite Thermochromic Ferroelectrics with Ferroelastic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10730-10735, May 3, 2021. </description>

2D homochiral lead&#8208;iodide perovskites were constructed by the introduction of a chiral center. The perovskites exhibit coexisting ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism, offering great application prospects for next&#8208;generation smart devices.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites have emerged as a significant class of materials showing promising optoelectronic and spintronic applications. Reports of chiral perovskite ferroelectrics, however, have been scarce. In this work, we have successfully synthesized homochiral lead&#8211;iodide perovskite ferroelectrics [(R)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 and [(S)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 by introducing a methyl group into the organic cation of the parent (N&#8208;benzylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium)PbI4. Vibrational circular dichroism spectra identify the chiral mirroring relationship. They both undergo 222F2&#8208;type paraelectric&#8211;ferroelectric behavior at around 378&#8197;K coupled with clear ferroelastic domain &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching. Besides, they exhibit an evident thermochromism with color change from orange&#8211;yellow to orange&#8211;red. To our knowledge, the discovery of integrated ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism in chiral perovskites is unprecedented.

         <title>Multinuclear Ag Clusters Sandwiched by Pt Complex Units: Fluxional Behavior and Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cluster Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10654-10660, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New types of multinuclear sandwich complexes consisting of an Ag3 core and Pt complex units are reported. The first observation of CD and CPL properties from a multinuclear sandwich complex was achieved after optical resolution using a chiral anion.







Abstract
Multinuclear Ag clusters sandwiched by Pt complex units were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR studies. The sandwich&#8208;shaped multinuclear Ag complexes showed two different types of fluxional behavior in solution: rapid slippage of Pt complex units on the Ag3 core and a reversible demetalation&#8211;metalation reaction by the treatment with Cl anion and Ag ion, respectively. The Ag2 complex obtained by demetalation reaction from the Ag3 complex displayed U to Z isomerization. These multinuclear Ag complexes showed strong photoluminescence whose properties depended on the existence of Pt&#8594;Ag dative bonds. The Ag3 complex, identified to be &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cluster&#8221;, was optically resolved by the formation of a diastereomeric salt with a chiral anion. The enantiomers show circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties which is unprecedented for compounds based on a chiral sandwich structure. Theoretical calculations allow to understand their structural features and photophysical properties.

         <title>A Balance Between Capture and Release: How Nanochaperones Regulate Refolding of Thermally Denatured Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10865-10870, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two working mechanisms of nanochaperones in regulating the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme were fully deciphered. The balance between the capture and release of client proteins that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating the refolding of denatured proteins, regardless of the ATP&#8208;independent or ATP&#8208;dependent chaperones.







Abstract
Nanochaperones have been designed and used for regulating the (re)folding of proteins, treating protein misfolding&#8208;related diseases, and, more recently, in drug delivery. Despite various successes, a complete understanding of the working mechanisms remains elusive, which represents a challenge for the realization of their full potential. Here, we thoroughly investigated the functioning of differently charged nanochaperones that regulate the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme. We found that the balance between the capture and release of lysozyme clients that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating refolding. More importantly, the findings could be applied to other enzymes with various physicochemical properties. On the basis of these results, we could recover the activity of enzymes with high efficiency either after 20&#8197;days of storage at 40&#8201;&#176;C or heating at high temperatures for 30&#8211;60&#8197;min. Our results provide important new design strategies for nanochaperone systems to improve their properties and expand their applications.

A novel and versatile strategy has been developed for the synthesis of bimetal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). The sizes of the homogeneous&#8208;dispersion Cu&#8208;M SNCs (M=Pd, Pt, or Ru) are mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm even at high loadings up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;M@HPC catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the selective oxidation of furfural to maleic acid under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) have shown great promise for a variety of catalytic reactions. However, the fabrication of stable metal SNCs simultaneously with high dispersion and high metal contents remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel and versatile strategy for the synthesis of various bimetal SNCs stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). This facile synthesis only involves the self&#8208;assembly of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, a molten salt assisted pyrolysis process and the final metal replacement. The metal SNCs (mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm) derived from the metal nodes of the MOF are exclusively confined and homogeneously dispersed throughout the organic ligands derived HPC at high loadings (up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The obtained Cu&#8208;Pd@HPC composite exhibits superior catalytic activity and recycling durability in the selective transformation of furfural to maleic acid, achieving 97.8&#8201;% yield of maleic acid with a TOF value as high as 20.1&#8197;h&#8722;1 under mild conditions. DFT calculations reveal that the introduction of Pd shifts the partial density of states of Cu toward the Fermi level, leading to stronger chemisorption of furfural to enhance the catalytic activity.

         <title>Effect of Zinc&#8208;Doping on the Reduction of the Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Rate in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10957-10963, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper Zn&#8208;doping (0.34&#8201;%) in perovskites is found to be able to significantly slowdown the hot&#8208;carrier cooling, the cooling rate of the 500&#8197;K hot&#8208;carriers can be reduced down to one third of the un&#8208;doped sample. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations uncover the mechanisms of such efficient retardation of the hot&#8208;carrier cooling via Zn&#8208;doping.







Abstract
The fast hot&#8208;carrier cooling process in the solar&#8208;absorbers fundamentally limits their photon&#8208;conversion efficiencies. It is highly desirable to develop a solar absorber with long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carriers at sun&#8208;illumination intensity, which can be used to develop the hot&#8208;carrier solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Herein, we reveal that zinc&#8208;doped (0.34&#8201;%) halide perovskites have the slower hot&#8208;carrier cooling compared with the pristine sample through the transient absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. The hot&#8208;carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 1017&#8197;cm&#8722;3 is found to be &#8776;3 times smaller than that of un&#8208;doped perovskites for T=500&#8197;K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot&#8208;carrier temperature approaches the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc&#8208;dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot&#8208;carriers relaxation processes. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot&#8208;carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which would be invaluable for the further development of practical hot&#8208;carrier photovoltaics based on perovskites.

         <title>Hierarchical Metal&#8211;Polymer Hybrids for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10977-10982, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8211;polymer hybrids constructed from various metals and different polymers showed outstanding performance for the electroreduction of CO2 with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes were found to be critical for high performance.







Abstract
The design of catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability is key to the electroreduction of CO2. Herein, we report the synthesis of 3D hierarchical metal/polymer&#8211;carbon paper (M/polymer&#8208;CP) electrodes by in situ electrosynthesis. The 3D polymer layer on CP (polymer&#8208;CP) was first prepared by in situ electropolymerization, then a 3D metal layer was decorated on the polymer&#8208;CP to produce the M/polymer&#8208;CP electrode. Electrodes with different metals (e.g. Cu, Pd, Zn, Sn) and various polymers could be prepared by this method. The electrodes could efficiently reduce CO2 to desired products, such as C2H4, CO, and HCOOH, depending on the metal used. For example, C2H4 could be formed with a Faradaic efficiency of 59.4&#8201;% and a current density of 30.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 by using a very stable Cu/PANI&#8208;CP electrode in an H&#8208;type cell. Control experiments and theoretical calculations showed that the 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes are critical for the excellent performance.

         <title>Controlled Ligand Exchange Between Ruthenium Organometallic Cofactor Precursors and a Na&#239;ve Protein Scaffold Generates Artificial Metalloenzymes Catalysing Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10919-10927, May 3, 2021. </description>

A ruthenium organometallic complex is transformed into an effective transfer hydrogenation catalyst upon exchanging ligands with a na&#239;ve protein. The direct coordination of protein sidechains to the metal is an underutilised feature in artificial metalloenzymes.







Abstract
Many natural metalloenzymes assemble from proteins and biosynthesised complexes, generating potent catalysts by changing metal coordination. Here we adopt the same strategy to generate artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) using ligand exchange to unmask catalytic activity. By systematically testing RuII(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(bipyridine) complexes designed to facilitate the displacement of functionalised bipyridines, we develop a fast and robust procedure for generating new enzymes via ligand exchange in a protein that has not evolved to bind such a complex. The resulting metal cofactors form peptidic coordination bonds but also retain a non&#8208;biological ligand. Tandem mass spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise the organometallic cofactors and identify the protein&#8208;derived ligands. By introduction of ruthenium cofactors into a 4&#8208;helical bundle, transfer hydrogenation catalysts were generated that displayed a 35&#8208;fold rate increase when compared to the respective small molecule reaction in solution.

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 has impacted the life quality and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Herein, a novel approach using ReI tricarbonyl complexes as coordinate covalent inhibitors for the main protease is presented. These complexes target the active site cysteine residue and show selective inhibition of the main protease over several human proteases.







Abstract
Since its outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has impacted the quality of life and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Based on its global spread and mortality, there is an urgent need for novel treatments which can combat this disease. To date, the 3&#8208;chymotrypsin&#8208;like protease (3CLpro), which is also known as the main protease, is considered among the most important pharmacological targets. The vast majority of investigated 3CLpro inhibitors are organic, non&#8208;covalent binders. Herein, the use of inorganic, coordinate covalent binders is proposed that can attenuate the activity of the protease. ReI tricarbonyl complexes were identified that demonstrate coordinate covalent enzymatic inhibition of 3CLpro. Preliminary studies indicate the selective inhibition of 3CLpro over several human proteases. This study presents the first example of metal complexes as inhibitors for the 3CLpro cysteine protease.

         <title>Prebiotic Phosphorylation and Concomitant Oligomerization of Deoxynucleosides to form DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10775-10783, May 3, 2021. </description>

Phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides under plausible prebiotic conditions with diamidophosphate gives rise to 5&#8242;&#8208;amidophosphorylated nucleotides and concomitantly to the 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;linked DNA oligomers. This direct conversion of deoxynucleosides to DNA oligonucleotides in a single pot scenario&#8212;under conditions compatible with ribonucleosides&#8212;sets the stage for the potential emergence of RNA and DNA from mixtures of nucleosides.







Abstract
Recent demonstrations of RNA&#8211;DNA chimeras (RDNA) enabling RNA and DNA replication, coupled with prebiotic co&#8208;synthesis of deoxyribo&#8208; and ribo&#8208;nucleotides, have resurrected the hypothesis of co&#8208;emergence of RNA and DNA. As further support, we show that diamidophosphate (DAP) with 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (amido)phosphorylates and oligomerizes deoxynucleosides to form DNA&#8212;under conditions similar to those of ribonucleosides. The pyrimidine deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;amidophosphates are formed in good (&#8776;60&#8201;%) yields. Intriguingly, the presence of pyrimidine deoxynucleos(t)ides increased the yields of purine deoxynucleotides (&#8776;20&#8201;%). Concomitantly, oligomerization (&#8776;18&#8211;31&#8201;%) is observed with predominantly 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;phosphodiester DNA linkages, and some (&lt;5&#8201;%) pyrophosphates. Combined with previous observations of DAP&#8208;mediated chemistries and the constructive role of RDNA chimeras, the results reported here help set the stage for systematic investigation of a systems chemistry approach of RNA&#8211;DNA coevolution.

         <title>Distinct Sustainable Carbon Nanodots Enable Free Radical Photopolymerization, Photo&#8208;ATRP and Photo&#8208;CuAAC Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10983-10991, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable carbon dots are prepared as light&#8208;sensitive materials originating from different biomass. Based on their implemented moieties they enable to initiate free radical polymerization choosing LEDs at different wavelength and tailor&#8208;made polymer synthesis facilitating photo&#8208;ATRP and photo click chemistry. CDs take the offer to compete with traditional ATRP based on CuI regarding the dispersity of the polymeric material.







Abstract
Carbon nanodots (CDs) originating from different biomass result in different activities to sensitize photo&#8208;ATRP and photo&#8208;CuAAC reaction protocols with visible light. Free radical polymerization of tri(propylene glycol)diacrylate also exhibited a good efficiency using CDs in combination with an iodonium salt employing LEDs emitting either at 405&#8197;nm, 525&#8197;nm or 660&#8197;nm. Photo&#8208;ATRP experiments confirmed controlled polymerization conditions using CuII at the ppm scale resulting in dispersities between 1.06 to 1.10. Chain end fidelity was successfully provided by chain extension and block copolymerization additionally approving the living feature of polymerization using a CD synthesized from lac dye comprising olefinic moieties in the originating biomass. By global analysis, time resolved fluorescence measurements indicated the appearance of several emitting species contributing to the reactivity of the excited states. Different cytotoxic response appeared following the answer of MCF&#8208;10A cells in a flow cytometry assay; that is 400&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Thus, cell viability was greater 80&#8201;% in the case of CD&#8208;2&#8211;CD&#8208;5 while that of CD&#8208;1 was close to 70&#8201;%.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Pot Template Reaction Towards a Manganese&#8208;Based T1 Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10736-10744, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a single&#8208;pot template synthesis strategy for a manganese&#8208;based MRI contrast agent, MnLMe. MnLMe is highly inert toward zinc&#8208;transmetallation and displays enhanced T1 relaxivity upon non&#8208;covalent interaction with serum albumin. In&#8197;vivo studies show higher contrast enhancement in the liver and longer blood half&#8208;life than that of the commercially available contrast agent Magnevist. MnLMe shows great potential for use as a blood pool agent.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based contrast agents (MnCAs) have emerged as suitable alternatives to gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GdCAs). However, due to their kinetic lability and laborious synthetic procedures, only a few MnCAs have found clinical MRI application. In this work, we have employed a highly innovative single&#8208;pot template synthetic strategy to develop a MnCA, MnLMe, and studied the most important physicochemical properties in&#8197;vitro. MnLMe displays optimized r1 relaxivities at both medium (20 and 64&#8197;MHz) and high magnetic fields (300 and 400&#8197;MHz) and an enhanced r1b=21.1&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (20&#8197;MHz, 298&#8197;K, pH&#8197;7.4) upon binding to BSA (Ka=4.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). In&#8197;vivo studies show that MnLMe is cleared intact into the bladder through renal excretion and has a prolonged blood half&#8208;life compared to the commercial GdCA Magnevist. MnLMe shows great promise as a novel MRI contrast agent.

The link between the high&#8208;valent structure of P2&#8208;type sodium layered transition metal oxides and the redox properties involving oxygen redox is demonstrated. By substituting Fe with Cu and Ni from P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2, the antisite&#8208;vacancy defect formation is controlled during desodiation of the positive electrodes. Ligand to metal charge transfer and the O 2p state near the Fermi level evoke and stabilize oxygen redox from the electrodes.







Abstract
We investigate high&#8208;valent oxygen redox in the positive Na&#8208;ion electrode P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 (NMF) where Fe is partially substituted with Cu (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.66Fe0.20Cu0.14]O2, NMFC) or Ni (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.65Fe0.20Ni0.15]O2, NMFN). From combined analysis of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge structure with electrochemical voltage hysteresis and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function profiles, we correlate structural disorder with high&#8208;valent oxygen redox and its improvement by Ni or Cu substitution. Density of states calculations elaborate considerable anionic redox in NMF and NMFC without the widely accepted requirement of an A&#8208;O&#8208;A&#8242; local configuration in the pristine materials (where A=Na and A&#8242;=Li, Mg, vacancy, etc.). We also show that the Jahn&#8211;Teller nature of Fe4+ and the stabilization mechanism of anionic redox could determine the extent of structural disorder in the materials. These findings shed light on the design principles in TM and anion redox for positive electrodes to improve the performance of Na&#8208;ion batteries.

A simple strategy comprising of the grafting of amino acids onto porous MOFs followed by metalation with earth&#8208;abundant metals, such as iron, affords heterogeneous single&#8208;site chiral catalysts by site isolation. The iron catalysts displayed high activity and excellent enantioselectivity in hydrosilylation and hydroboration of carbonyls.







Abstract
We report a strategy to develop heterogeneous single&#8208;site enantioselective catalysts based on naturally occurring amino acids and earth&#8208;abundant metals for eco&#8208;friendly asymmetric catalysis. The grafting of amino acids within the pores of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), followed by post&#8208;synthetic metalation with iron precursor, affords highly active and enantioselective (&gt;99&#8201;% ee for 10 examples) catalysts for hydrosilylation and hydroboration of carbonyl compounds. Impressively, the MOF&#8208;Fe catalyst displayed high turnover numbers of up to 10&#8201;000 and was recycled and reused more than 15 times without diminishing the enantioselectivity. MOF&#8208;Fe displayed much higher activity and enantioselectivity than its homogeneous control catalyst, likely due to the formation of robust single&#8208;site catalyst in the MOF through site&#8208;isolation.

         <title>Impact of In&#8208;Cell and In&#8208;Vitro Crowding on the Conformations and Dynamics of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein</title>

In&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy reveals the effects of intracellular crowding on the dimensions and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins.







Abstract
The conformations and dynamics of proteins can be influenced by crowding from the large concentrations of macromolecules within cells. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit chain compaction in crowded solutions in vitro, but no such effects were observed in cultured mammalian cells. Here, to increase intracellular crowding, we reduced the cell volume by hyperosmotic stress and used an IDP as a crowding sensor for in&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy. In these more crowded cells, the IDP exhibits compaction, slower chain dynamics, and much slower translational diffusion, indicating a pronounced concentration and length&#8208;scale dependence of crowding. In vitro, these effects cannot be reproduced with small but only with large polymeric crowders. The observations can be explained with polymer theory and depletion interactions and indicate that IDPs can diffuse much more efficiently through a crowded cytosol than a globular protein of similar dimensions.

         <title>Chiral Dibenzopentalene&#8208;Based Conjugated Nanohoops through Stereoselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10680-10689, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral, dibenzo[a,e]pentalene&#8208;based conjugated nanohoops were synthesized in a stereoselective way from enantiomerically pure diketone precursors. The hoop shows ambipolar electrochemical behavior due to the antiaromaticity of the dibenzopentalene units and can accommodate two fullerene molecules. Circular dichroism measurements and molecular dynamics simulations indicated no racemization even at 110&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Conjugated nanohoops allow to investigate the effect of radial conjugation and bending on the involved &#960;&#8208;systems. They can possess unexpected optoelectronic properties and their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;system makes them attractive for host&#8211;guest chemistry. Bending the &#960;&#8208;subsystems can lead to chiral hoops. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of two enantiomers of chiral conjugated nanohoops by incorporating dibenzo[a,e]pentalenes (DBPs), which are generated in the last synthetic step from enantiomerically pure diketone precursors. Owing to its bent shape, this diketone unit was used as the only bent precursor and novel &#8220;corner unit&#8221; in the synthesis of the hoops. The [6]DBP[4]Ph&#8208;hoops contain six antiaromatic DBP units and four bridging phenylene groups. The small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and ambipolar electrochemical character of the DBP units is reflected in the optoelectronic properties of the hoop. Electronic circular dichroism spectra and MD simulations showed that the chiral hoop did not racemize even when heated to 110 &#176;C. Due to its large diameter, it was able to accommodate two C60 molecules, as binding studies indicate.

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Sheath of Li Ions by Using Hydrogen Bonds for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10871-10879, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath by introducing hydrogen bonds for constructing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;metal batteries is proposed. Depending on the hydrogen bonding of the additives with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent, the regulated solvation sheath promoted the formation of desirable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase with more LiF component and stabilized the electrolytes.







Abstract
The performance of Li anodes is extremely affected by the solvation of Li ions, leading to preferential reduction of the solvation sheath and subsequent formation of fragile solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI), Li dendrites, and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, we propose a novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, through the introduction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent by small amount additives.

     alt="Regulating the Solvation Sheath of Li Ions by Using Hydrogen Bonds for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Metal Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath by introducing hydrogen bonds for constructing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;metal batteries is proposed. Depending on the hydrogen bonding of the additives with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent, the regulated solvation sheath promoted the formation of desirable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase with more LiF component and stabilized the electrolytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of Li anodes is extremely affected by the solvation of Li ions, leading to preferential reduction of the solvation sheath and subsequent formation of fragile solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI), Li dendrites, and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, we propose a novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, through the introduction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent by small amount additives. The addition of such hydrogen bonds reduced the LUMO energy level of anions in electrolyte, promoted the formation of a robust SEI, reduced the amount of free solvent molecules, and enhanced stability of electrolytes. Based on this strategy, flat and dense lithium deposition was obtained. Even under lean electrolytes, at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a fixed capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the Li&#8211;Cu cells showed an impressive CE value of 99.2&#8201;%. The Li&#8208;LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full cells showed long&#8208;term cycling stability for more than 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C, with a total capacity loss of only 15&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Making Waxy Salts in Water: Synthetic Control of Hydrophobicity for Anion&#8208;Induced and Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Light Emission</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition in water is an unperfected art in synthetic supramolecular chemistry. We demonstrate that the inherent hydrophobicity of tripodal fluorogenic cations can be synthetically modulated to control the sensitivity toward large, non&#8208;spherical, and charge&#8208;diffuse anions in water.







Abstract
We show that multipodal polycationic receptors function as anion&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitters in water. Prevailing paradigms utilize rigid holes and cavities for ion recognition. We instead built open amphiphilic scaffolds that trigger polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar environment transitions around cationic fluorophores upon anion complexation. This ion&#8208;pairing and aggregation event produces a dramatic enhancement in the emission intensity, as demonstrated by perchlorate as a non&#8208;spherical hydrophobic anion model. A synergetic interplay of C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion hydrogen bonding and tight anion&#8211;&#960;+ contacts underpins this supramolecular phenomenon. By changing the aliphatic chain length, we demonstrate that the response profile and threshold of this signaling event can be controlled at the molecular level. With appropriate molecular design, inherently weak, ill&#8208;defined, and non&#8208;directional van der Waals interaction enables selective, sensitive, and tunable recognition in water.

We compare K+&#8208;induced folding of an RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) with a sequence homologous DNA G4 using CD spectroscopy and real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. The folding kinetics of RNA and DNA G4 are markedly different: while DNA folding is biphasic, shows kinetic partitioning and involves kinetically favoured off&#8208;pathway intermediates, RNA folding is faster and monophasic. We attribute the differences to different stabilities of the torsion angle &#967;.







Abstract
We investigated the folding kinetics of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures by comparing the K+&#8208;induced folding of an RNA G4 derived from the human telomeric repeat&#8208;containing RNA (TERRA25) with a sequence homologous DNA G4 (wtTel25) using CD spectroscopy and real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. While DNA G4 folding is biphasic, reveals kinetic partitioning and involves kinetically favoured off&#8208;pathway intermediates, RNA G4 folding is faster and monophasic. The differences in kinetics are correlated to the differences in the folded conformations of RNA vs. DNA G4s, in particular with regard to the conformation around the glycosidic torsion angle &#967; that uniformly adopts anti conformations for RNA G4s and both, syn and anti conformation for DNA G4s. Modified DNA G4s with 19F bound to C2&#8242; in arabino configuration adopt exclusively anti conformations for &#967;. These fluoro&#8208;modified DNA (antiTel25) reveal faster folding kinetics and monomorphic conformations similar to RNA G4s, suggesting the correlation between folding kinetics and pathways with differences in &#967; angle preferences in DNA and RNA, respectively.

A crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer with an amphiphilic corona&#8208;forming block leads to formation of 3D spherulite&#8208;like micelles by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and seeded growth in dilute solution. Micelle growth can be stopped at any stage depending on the unimer feed ratio and provides a powerful model for studying the spherulite growth process.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) and 2D structures by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) can form fascinating hierarchical structures through secondary self&#8208;assembly. But examples of 3D structures formed via hierarchical self&#8208;assembly are rare. Here we report seeded growth experiments in decane of a poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) BCP with an amphiphilic corona forming block in which lenticular platelets grow into classic spherulite&#8208;like uniform colloidally stable structures. These 3D objects are spherically symmetric on the exterior, but asymmetric near the core, where there is a more open structure consisting of sheaf&#8208;like leaves. The most remarkable aspect of these experiments is that growth stops at different stages of growth process, depending upon how much unimer is added in the seeded growth step. The system provides a model for studying spherulitic growth where real&#8208;time observations on their growth at different stages remains challenging.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanoemulsion for Synergistic Photodynamic&#8208;Immunotherapy Against Hypoxic Breast Tumor</title>

A biomimetic nanoemulsion camouflaged with a PD&#8208;1&#8208;expressing cell membrane is fabricated. The PD&#8208;1 protein on the membrane blocks the PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells to relief the immune brake. The perfluorocarbon inside the nanoemulsion supplement oxygen for PDT in hypoxic tumors. The codelivery of photosensitizer DVDMS and PD&#8208;1 protein realizes effective synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy against hypoxic breast tumors.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used as an &#8220;in situ vaccine&#8221; to enhance the response rate of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. Unfortunately, the high cost and adverse effects of these antibodies, and the hypoxic state of solid tumors limits the efficacy of synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy. Here, we developed a biomimetic nanoemulsion camouflaged with a PD&#8208;1&#8208;expressing cell membrane for synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy against hypoxic breast tumors. The perfluorocarbon of the nanoemulsion could provide oxygen as the source of PDT against hypoxic tumors. Moreover, co&#8208;delivering a photosensitizer and the PD&#8208;1 protein (substituting for a PD&#8208;L1 antibody) achieves the synergy effect of PDT and immunotherapy. Synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy completely inhibited primary and distant subcutaneous 4T1 tumors, mechanistically by boosting the maturation of dendritic cells and tumor infiltration of cytotoxic&#8197;T lymphocytes.

         <title>Selectivity Map for the Late Stages of CO and CO2 Reduction to C2 Species on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10784-10790, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selectivity map is provided for the late stages of CO2 reduction to C2 molecules based on computational models and electrochemical experiments. Sites with moderate coordination are efficient for ethylene production, with Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces. Conversely, kinks and steps are more active for ethanol production.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CORR and CO2RR) using copper catalysts and renewable electricity hold promise as a carbon&#8208;neutral route to produce commodity chemicals and fuels. However, the exact mechanisms and structure sensitivity of Cu electrodes toward C2 products are still under debate. Herein, we investigate ethylene oxide reduction (EOR) as a proxy to the late stages of CORR to ethylene, and the results are compared to those of acetaldehyde reduction to ethanol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that ethylene oxide undergoes ring opening before exclusively reducing to ethylene via *OH formation. Based on generalized coordination numbers (CN), a selectivity map for the late stages of CORR and CO2RR shows that sites with moderate coordination (5.9 &lt; CN &lt; 7.5) are efficient for ethylene production, with pristine Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces such as Cu(311). In contrast, kinks and edges are more active for ethanol production, while (111) terraces are relatively inert.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Functionalised Hybrid Ultramicroporous Materials that Enable Single&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from a Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10902-10909, May 3, 2021. </description>

Hybrid ultramicroporous materials in which aminopyrazine ligands substitute pyrazine ligands are the first physisorbents that enable polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) ethylene production from ternary C2&#8208;CO2 gas mixtures under ambient conditions thanks to coadsorption of both C2H2 and CO2.







Abstract
Pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous (pore size &lt;7&#8197;&#197;) materials (HUMs) offer benchmark performance for trace carbon capture thanks to strong selectivity for CO2 over small gas molecules, including light hydrocarbons. That the prototypal pyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs are amenable to crystal engineering has enabled second generation HUMs to supersede the performance of the parent HUM, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn, mainly through substitution of the metal and/or the inorganic pillar. Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni (17=aminopyrazine; M=Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO2 than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO2 affinity but enhanced C2H2 affinity. MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (&gt;99.95&#8201;% for SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni) from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO2 thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni versus SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn.

         <title>Effective Encapsulation of C60 by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Polyamide Macrocyclic Linkers</title>

A ditopic flexible benzylic amide macrocycle was employed as an organic ligand for the assembly of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These reticular materials form non&#8208;interpenetrated channels with a remarkable solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. The incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pockets of these materials was studied, and C60 was able to occupy an impressive 98&#8201;% of them. These materials were selective for the recognition of C60 in the presence of the larger C70.







Abstract
A flexible benzylic amide macrocycle, functionalized with two carboxylic acid groups, was employed as the organic ligand for the preparation of robust copper(II)&#8208; and zinc(II)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non&#8208;interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. Unlike metal&#8211;organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability. We studied the incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pocket generated between two macrocycles connected to the same dinuclear clusters, occupying a remarkable 98&#8201;% of the cavities inside the network. The use of these materials as hosts for the selective recognition of different fullerenes was evaluated, mainly encapsulating the smaller size fullerene derivative in several mixtures of C60 and C70.

Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide activated esters stand among the most used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox. These two types of functional groups are merged in NHS&#8208;activated acrylamide reagents for efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins.

Abstract
Widely used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox, Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated esters, are combined in NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides for efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides allow for a fast functionalization of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (k2=1.54&#177;0.18&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) under dilute aqueous conditions, enabling selectivity over other nucleophilic amino acids. Additionally, the versatility of these new bioconjugation handles was demonstrated in the cross&#8208;linking of in&#8208;chain or C&#8208;terminal cysteines with nearby lysine residues. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides are compatible with the use of other cysteine selective reagents, allowing for orthogonal dual&#8208;modifications. This strategy was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins with a PEG unit, fluorescent probe, and cytotoxic agent. The level of molecular control offered by NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides is expected to promote amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling technology as a powerful strategy to design functional bioconjugates.

A Lewis trio involving a bulky chiral primary amine, B(C6F5)3 and a bulky tertiary amine has been developed as an effective enamine catalyst for enantioselective disulfuration reactions. The chiral bulky Lewis trio (BLT) allows for the construction of chiral disulfides via direct disulfuration with &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls or &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes in a practical and highly stereocontrolled manner.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component Lewis acid&#8211;base (Lewis trio) involving a bulky chiral primary amine, B(C6F5)3 and a bulky tertiary amine has been developed as an effective enamine catalyst for enantioselective disulfuration reactions. The bulky tertiary amine was found to activate a bulky primary&#8211;tertiary diamine&#8211;borane Lewis pair for enamine catalysis via frustrated interaction. The resulted chiral bulky Lewis trio (BLT) allows for the construction of chiral disulfides via direct disulfuration with &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls or &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes in a practical and highly stereocontrolled manner.

         <title>Conductive Metallophthalocyanine Framework Films with High Carrier Mobility as Efficient Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10806-10813, May 3, 2021. </description>

A fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and conductive 2D metallophthalocyanine framework with cobalt tetraaza[14]annulene linkages (see structure) exhibited high electrical conductivity of up to 0.52&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 and a high carrier mobility of 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8201;s&#8722;1. Thin films of the material with thicknesses of 100&#8211;1000&#8197;nm functioned as efficient chemiresistors and displayed high sensitivity and selectivity towards gases at low concentrations.







Abstract
The poor electrical conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline frameworks greatly limits their utilization in optoelectronics and sensor technology. Herein, we describe a conductive metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework with cobalt(II) tetraaza[14]annulene linkages. The high conjugation across the whole network combined with densely stacked metallophthalocyanine units endows this material with high electrical conductivity, which can be greatly enhanced by doping with iodine. The NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework was also fabricated as thin films with different thicknesses from 100 to 1000&#8197;nm by the steam&#8208;assisted conversion method. These films enabled the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases and exhibited remarkable sensitivity and stability. This study indicates the enormous potential of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based conductive frameworks in advanced stand&#8208;off chemical sensors and provides a general strategy through tailor&#8208;make molecular design to develop sensitive and stable chemical sensors for the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Size&#8208;Controlled m&#8208;Pyridine&#8211;Urea Oligomers and Their Biomimetic Chloride Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10833-10841, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomers with distinct self&#8208;folding and self&#8208;assembly behaviour are constructed by using m&#8208;pyridine&#8211;urea repeating units, an important feature of which is that the urea carbonyl tends to point outward and the NH unit tends to direct inward. Among these oligomers, the trimer forms nanotubes, which can efficiently transport Cl&#8722; ions.







Abstract
The m&#8208;pyridine urea (mPU) oligomer was constructed by using the intramolecular hydrogen bond formed by the pyridine nitrogen atom and the NH of urea and the intermolecular hydrogen bond of the terminal carbonyl group and the NH of urea. Due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonds, mPU oligomer folds and exhibits strong self&#8208;assembly behaviour. Affected by folding, mPU oligomer generates a twisted plane, and one of its important features is that the carbonyl group of the urea group orientates outwards from the twisted plane, while the NHs tend to direct inward. This feature is beneficial to NH attraction for electron&#8208;rich species. Among them, the trimer self&#8208;assembles into helical nanotubes, and can efficiently transport chloride ions. This study provides a novel and efficient strategy for constructing self&#8208;assembled biomimetic materials for electron&#8208;rich species transmission.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photopolymerization of Hybrid Acrylate&#8208;Oxetane Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10935-10941, May 3, 2021. </description>

A wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization process of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture was developed. Control over the sequence and rate of both polymerizations allows for control over phase separation within the interpenetrating network structure. The structurally colored cholesteric coatings could be used to monitor the phase separation.







Abstract
We report on the wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture. By controlling the sequence and rate of the orthogonal free&#8208;radical and cationic photopolymerization reactions, it is possible to control the degree of phase separation in the resulting liquid crystal interpenetrating networks. We show that this can be used to tune the reflective color of the structurally colored coatings produced. Conversely, the structural color can be used to monitor the degree of phase separation. Our new photopolymerization procedure allows for structuring liquid crystal networks in three dimensions, which has great potential for fabricating liquid crystal polymer materials with programmable functional properties.

The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties including low bioavailability and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. Herein we demonstrate the potential for using mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane, leading to enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity in cancer cells compared to the &#8220;uncaged&#8221; metallodrug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity and translocation to the cell nucleus.







Abstract
The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties, such as poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. To combat this, various drug carriers have been investigated to enhance the pharmacological profile of therapeutic agents. In this work, we demonstrate the use of mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane. More specifically, we report the synthesis of rotaxanes incorporating as a stoppering unit a known G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binder, namely a PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This compound cannot interact with DNA when it is part of the mechanically interlocked assembly. The second rotaxane stopper can be cleaved by either light or an esterase, releasing the PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This system shows enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity within osteosarcoma cells compared to the free drug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity, arising from the translocation of PtII&#8208;salphen to the nucleus and its binding to DNA.

&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties, such as poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. To combat this, various drug carriers have been investigated to enhance the pharmacological profile of therapeutic agents. In this work, we demonstrate the use of mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane. More specifically, we report the synthesis of rotaxanes incorporating as a stoppering unit a known G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binder, namely a Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;salphen complex. This compound cannot interact with DNA when it is part of the mechanically interlocked assembly. The second rotaxane stopper can be cleaved by either light or an esterase, releasing the Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;salphen complex. This system shows enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity within osteosarcoma cells compared to the free drug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity, arising from the translocation of Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;salphen to the nucleus and its binding to DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10670-10679, May 3, 2021. </description>

The genome&#8208;guided discovery of an autoinducing peptide (AIP) that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum is reported. A combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain reveals that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP).







Abstract
Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density&#8208;dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone&#8208;containing peptides, their true structures remain elusive. Here, we report the genome&#8208;guided discovery of an AIP that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain, we reveal that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP). Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid S&#8594;N acyl shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme&#8208;primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial AIP biosynthesis.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Rapid Synthesis of Pd&#8208;Based Ultrathin Porous Intermetallic Nanosheets for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10942-10949, May 3, 2021. </description>

This template&#8208;directed synthetic strategy is a universal route for shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanocrystals and will provide new opportunities for intermetallic nanocatalysts.







Abstract
Atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles exhibit improved catalytic activity and durability relative to random alloy counterparts. However, conventional methods with time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;temperature syntheses only have rudimentary capability in controlling the structure of intermetallic nanoparticles, hindering advances of intermetallic nanocatalysts. We report a template&#8208;directed strategy for rapid synthesis of Pd&#8208;based (PdM, M=Pb, Sn and Cd) ultrathin porous intermetallic nanosheets (UPINs) with tunable sizes. This strategy uses preformed seeds, which act as the template to control the deposition of foreign atoms and the subsequent interatomic diffusion. Using the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a model reaction, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Pb UPINs exhibit superior activity, durability, and methanol tolerance. The favored geometrical structure and interatomic interaction between Pd and Pb in Pd3Pb UPINs are concluded to account for the enhanced ORR performance.

         <title>S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides: Ultrafast and Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerizations Towards Well&#8208;defined Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10798-10805, May 3, 2021. </description>

S&#8208;carboxyanhydride (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids are introduced. The SCA monomers are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ring&#8208;opening polymerization. The polymerizations reach complete conversion within minutes at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, and retained stereoregularity.







Abstract
Aliphatic polythioesters are popular polymers because of their appealing performance such as metal coordination ability, high refractive indices, and biodegradability. One of the most powerful approaches for generating these polymers is the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic monomers. However, the synthesis of precisely controlled polythioesters via ROP of thiolactones still faces formidable challenges, including the minimal functional diversity of available thiolactone monomers, as well as inevitable transthioesterification side reactions. Here we introduce a hyperactive class of S&#8208;carboxyanhydride (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids that are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ROP. Inclusion of the initiator PPNOBz ([PPN]=bis(triphenylphosphine)&#8208;iminium) with chain transfer agent benzoic acid, the polymerizations that can be operated in open vessels reach complete conversion within minutes (1&#8211;2&#8197;min) at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, retained stereoregularity and chemical recyclability. Most fascinating are the functionalized SCAs that allow the incorporating of functional groups along the polythioester chain and thus finely tune their physicochemical performance. Computational studies were carried out to explore the origins of the distinctive rapidity and exquisite selectivity of the polymerizations, offering mechanistic insight and explaining why high polymerizability of SCA monomer is able to facilitate exquisitely selective ring&#8208;opening for enchainment over competing transthioesterification and backbiting reactions.

         <title>Dual Active Sites on Molybdenum/ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyst for Methane Dehydroaromatization: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10709-10715, May 3, 2021. </description>

The bifunctional acidic proton&#8208;carburized Mo active site in Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite was revealed by probing their spatial proximity using double&#8208;resonance solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The spatial interaction of the dual site governs the activity of the catalyst for MDA reaction.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst is promising for direct transformation of natural gas. Understanding the nature of active sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 is a challenge for applications. Herein, using 1H{95Mo} double&#8208;resonance solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, we identify proximate dual active sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst by direct observation of internuclear spatial interaction between Br&#248;nsted acid site and Mo species in zeolite channels. The acidic proton&#8211;Mo spatial interaction is correlated with methane conversion and aromatics formation in the MDA process, an important factor in determining the catalyst activity and lifetime. The evolution of olefins and aromatics in Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 channels is monitored by detecting their host&#8211;guest interactions with both active Mo sites and Br&#248;nsted acid sites via 1H{95Mo} double&#8208;resonance and two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8211;1H correlation NMR spectroscopy, revealing the intermediate role of olefins in hydrocarbon pool process during the MDA reaction.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catabolic Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanosponge for Programmable Drug Delivery and Efficient Gene Silencing</title>

An exquisite cascade DNAzyme&#8208;sustained gene silencing platform was assembled to program the &#8220;mask&#8208;cleave&#8208;release&#8221; of therapeutic DNAzyme from the intelligent DNAzyme nanosponge, where the upstream self&#8208;catabolic DNAzyme mediated the specific and accurate activation of downstream therapeutic DNAzyme for guaranteeing the efficient gene silencing with improved bioavailability.







Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self&#8208;catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor&#8208;specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self&#8208;excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor&#8208;anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli&#8208;responsive cascade DNAzyme activation. By virtue of the programmable RCR assembly strategy, our compact DNAzyme nanoplatform shows great promise for developing versatile smart gene therapeutics and personalized nanomedicines.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Design Strategy to Construct Smart Fluorescent Probes for the Precise Tracking of Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10756-10765, May 3, 2021. </description>

We report a two&#8208;dimensional design strategy to construct smart fluorescent probes for the precise tracking of senescence. Our approach relies on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in combination with the monitoring of lysosomal microenvironmental pH since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells.







Abstract
The tracking of cellular senescence usually depends on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal). Previous probes for SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal with this purpose only cover a single dimension: the accumulation of this enzyme in lysosomes. However, this is insufficient to determine the destiny of senescence because endogenous &#946;&#8208;gal enriched in lysosomes is not only related to senescence, but also to some other physiological processes. To address this issue, we introduce our fluorescent probes including a second dimension: lysosomal pH, since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells. With this novel design, our probes achieved excellent discrimination of SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal from cancer&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, which enables them to track cellular senescence as well as tissue aging more precisely. Our crystal structures of a model enzyme E. coli &#946;&#8208;gal mutant (E537Q) complexed with each probe further revealed the structural basis for probe recognition.

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Harvesting Covalent Organic Framework Bearing Single Nickel Sites as a Highly Efficient Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Cross&#8208;Coupling Dual Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10820-10827, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual catalyst (Ace&#8208;COF&#8208;Ni), which is composed of a photosensitive covalent organic framework and single nickel sites, is reported. This dual catalyst exhibits excellent visible&#8208;light and organometallic nickel synergistic catalytic performances for the sulfur&#8211;carbon cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have recently emerged as light&#8208;harvesting devices, as well as elegant heterogeneous catalysts. The combination of these two properties into a dual catalyst has not yet been explored. We report a new photosensitive triazine&#8208;based COF, decorated with single Ni sites to form a dual catalyst. This crystalline and highly porous catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic sulfur&#8211;carbon cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Incorporation of single transition metal sites in a photosensitive COF scaffold with two&#8208;component synergistic catalyst in organic transformation is demonstrated for the first time.

         <title>Decoding the Complex Free Radical Cascade by Using a DNA Framework&#8208;Based Artificial DNA Encoder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10745-10755, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder for the complex free radical cascade was developed. Unlike time&#8208;consuming and vulnerable genome&#8208;encoded systems, it can actively sense and actuate information communications in real time, with enhanced environmental tolerance, broad decoding activities, and concurrent blocking of adverse communications between free radicals and inflammatory signaling, contributing to its anti&#8208;obesity effects.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular communications (DMC) are critical for regulating biological networks to maintain stable organismic functions. However, the complicated, time&#8208;consuming information transmission process involved in genome&#8208;coded DMC and the limited, vulnerable decoding activity generally lead to communication impairment or failure, in response to external stimuli. Herein, we present a conceptually innovative DMC strategy mediated by the DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder. With the free&#8208;radical cascade as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the artificial DNA encoder shows active sensing and real&#8208;time actuation, in&#8197;situ and broad free radical&#8208;decoding efficacy, as well as robust resistance to environmental noise. It can also block undesirable short&#8208;to&#8208;medium&#8208;range communications between free radicals and inflammatory networks, leading to a synergistic anti&#8208;obesity effect. The artificial DNA encoder&#8208;based DMC may be generalized to other communication systems for a variety of applications.

         <title>Division and Regrowth of Phase&#8208;Separated Giant Unilamellar Vesicles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10661-10669, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate division of phase&#8208;separated lipid vesicles following quantitative predictions from an analytical model. The division is controlled by metabolic decomposition or light&#8208;triggered uncaging of a fluorophore. This provides spatiotemporal control over the division of a target vesicle. We regrow phase&#8208;separated vesicles by targeted fusion using DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Success in the bottom&#8208;up assembly of synthetic cells will depend on strategies for the division of protocellular compartments. Here, we describe the controlled division of phase&#8208;separated giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). We derive an analytical model based on the vesicle geometry, which makes four quantitative predictions that we verify experimentally. We find that the osmolarity ratio required for division is 
, independent of the GUV size, while asymmetric division happens at lower osmolarity ratios. Remarkably, we show that a suitable osmolarity change can be triggered by water evaporation, enzymatic decomposition of sucrose or light&#8208;triggered uncaging of CMNB&#8208;fluorescein. The latter provides full spatiotemporal control, such that a target GUV undergoes division whereas the surrounding GUVs remain unaffected. Finally, we grow phase&#8208;separated vesicles from single&#8208;phased vesicles by targeted fusion of the opposite lipid type with programmable DNA tags to enable subsequent division cycles.

A new easily handled synthetic method toward N&#8208;aryl DPPs was reported through the reaction of H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI. The N&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in solutions and solid states. Furthermore, the reaction can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties, demonstrating their potential applications in organic semiconductors of high performance.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a building block has been intensively investigated for organic semiconductors and light emitting materials. The synthesis of N&#8208;aryl DPPs remains challenging. Herein, we firstly report a new easily handled synthetic method toward N&#8208;aryl DPPs through H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI, which shows broad reaction scope. Sixteen N&#8208;aryl DPPs, including phenyl, furan and thiophene as flanking aromatic groups, were synthesized with yields up to 78&#8201;%. These N&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in both solutions and solid states, with quantum yields up to 96&#8201;% and 40&#8201;%, respectively. Moreover, we show that the reaction between H&#8208;DPP and diaryliodonium salt can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst. Nine &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs were obtained in 27&#8211;61&#8201;% yields. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties with hole mobility of 0.71&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, demonstrating that they are useful building blocks for high performance organic semiconductors.

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperative Catalysis for Decarbonylative Heteroarylation of Carboxylic Acids via C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10690-10699, May 3, 2021. </description>

Bimetallic cooperative catalysis is reported for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of carboxylic acids via acyl C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H coupling. The cooperative action of copper and palladium catalysts is exploited for chemoselective synthesis of heterobiaryl motifs. A broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples) is accessible, including late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and streamlined synthesis of bioactive agents.







Abstract
Cooperative bimetallic catalysis is a fundamental approach in modern synthetic chemistry. We report bimetallic cooperative catalysis for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of ubiquitous carboxylic acids via acyl C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H coupling. This novel catalytic system exploits the cooperative action of a copper catalyst and a palladium catalyst in decarbonylation, which enables highly chemoselective synthesis of important heterobiaryl motifs through the coupling of carboxylic acids with heteroarenes in the absence of prefunctionalization or directing groups. This cooperative decarbonylative method uses common carboxylic acids and shows a remarkably broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), including late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and streamlined synthesis of bioactive agents. Extensive mechanistic and computational studies were conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The key step involves intersection of the two catalytic cycles via transmetallation of the copper&#8211;aryl species with the palladium(II) intermediate generated by oxidative addition/decarbonylation.

         <title>Unveiling Electrochemical Urea Synthesis by Co&#8208;Activation of CO2 and N2 with Mott&#8211;Schottky Heterostructure Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10910-10918, May 3, 2021. </description>

The space&#8211;charge region in Mott&#8211;Schottky Bi&#8208;BiVO4 heterostructures promotes the targeted adsorption and activation of inert N2 and CO2 molecules and further guarantees the exothermic coupling of *N=N* intermediates with generated CO via C&#8211;N coupling reactions to form the urea precursor *NCON*.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N bond coupling to convert CO2 and N2 molecules into urea under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to harsh industrial processes. However, the adsorption and activation of inert gas molecules and then the driving of the C&#8211;N coupling reaction is energetically challenging. Herein, novel Mott&#8211;Schottky Bi&#8208;BiVO4 heterostructures are described that realize a remarkable urea yield rate of 5.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 12.55&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. Comprehensive analysis confirms the emerging space&#8211;charge region in the heterostructure interface not only facilitates the targeted adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2 molecules on the generated local nucleophilic and electrophilic regions, but also effectively suppresses CO poisoning and the formation of endothermic *NNH intermediates. This guarantees the desired exothermic coupling of *N=N* intermediates and generated CO to form the urea precursor, *NCON*.

         <title>Back Cover: Distinct Sustainable Carbon Nanodots Enable Free Radical Photopolymerization, Photo&#8208;ATRP and Photo&#8208;CuAAC Chemistry (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 19/2021)</title>

Light&#8208;driven processes based on sustainable materials originating from different biomass such as citric acid in lemon, alginate in seaweed, or lac dye in Kerria lacca have received increased attention for the generation of carbon nanodots (CDs). This enables initiation of radical photopolymerization with visible light. CDs can also be employed to generate tailor&#8208;made polymeric materials by sensitization of copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed ATRP, resulting in small dispersities following classical ATRP and CuACC click chemistry, as reported by Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;10983.

From thought to action. In the creative process of natural product synthesis, the mental movement of atoms to their desired positions encounters the boundaries of real reactivity. In their Communication on page&#8197;10521, Thomas&#8197;B. Poulsen et&#8197;al. report the highly efficient assembly of a series of alkaloid natural products in the streptazone and abikoviromycin family. Precise orchestration of (asymmetric) redox manipulations and rapid scaffold assembly via a selective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction enabled the syntheses.

Multinuclear precious metal sandwich complexes containing an asymmetric center in the cluster were synthesized as described by Shinnosuke Horiuchi, Keisuke Umakoshi, and co&#8208;workers in the Research Article on page&#8197;10654. Reversible multipoint coordination in the cluster core can endow them with a remarkable stability, allowing separation of enantiomers and detection of chiroptical properties of the sandwich complexes in solution.

         <title>Boron in Prebiological Evolution</title>

Research suggests that borate could have mediated the prebiotic synthesis of RNA precursors (ribose, ribonucleosides, and ribonucleotides) in reactions relevant for the origin of life. This minireview provides an overview of recent developments in prebiological chemistry related to boron species.







Abstract
Boron(III), as borate (or boric acid), mediates the synthesis of ribose, ribonucleosides, and ribonucleotides. These reactions are carried out under moderate temperatures (typically 70&#8211;95&#8201;&#176;C) with organic molecules (or their derivatives) detected in interstellar space and inorganic ions found in minerals on Earth (and could occur during early stages of prebiotic evolution). Research in this century suggests that borate was a relevant prebiological reagent, thus reinforcing the RNA world hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of life. Herein, these developments on prebiological chemistry related to boron species are reviewed.

         <title>Alternative Oxidants for the Catalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>

The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane to C2 products with O2 (O2&#8208;OCM) is challenged by overoxidation to CO and CO2, despite extensive research. OCM with alternative oxidants such as N2O, CO2, S2 may provide a route to higher C2 selectivities. This Review analyzes progress on catalytic OCM with alternative oxidants, discussing the current status and future prospects.







Abstract
The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O2&#8208;OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to COx products. Other gaseous reagents such as N2O, CO2, and S2 have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O2. Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X&#8208;OCM) have not been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze OCM research results reporting the implementation of N2O, CO2, S2, and other non&#8208;O2 oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O2&#8208;OCM. Current outlook and potential areas for future study are also discussed.

         <title>Probing the Mineral&#8211;Water Interface with Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy</title>

The interaction between minerals and water is relevant for a wide range of geological, atmospheric, environmental, and electro(photo&#8208;)chemical systems. This Review highlights the developments made through studying a variety of mineral&#8211;water interfaces by nonlinear optical spectroscopy. These methods provide molecular&#8208;level details about the organization of water in the direct vicinity of the interface.







Abstract
The interaction between minerals and water is manifold and complex: the mineral surface can be (de)protonated by water, thereby changing its charge; mineral ions dissolved into the aqueous phase screen the surface charges. Both factors affect the interaction with water. Intrinsically molecular&#8208;level processes and interactions govern macroscopic phenomena, such as flow&#8208;induced dissolution, wetting, and charging. This realization is increasingly prompting molecular&#8208;level studies of mineral&#8211;water interfaces. Here, we provide an overview of recent developments in surface&#8208;specific nonlinear spectroscopy techniques such as sum frequency and second harmonic generation (SFG/SHG), which can provide information about the molecular arrangement of the first few layers of water molecules at the mineral surface. The results illustrate the subtleties of both chemical and physical interactions between water and the mineral as well as the critical role of mineral dissolution and other ions in solution for determining those interactions.

The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical generation of H2O2 is a promising approach for the large&#8208;scale production of this important green fuel and oxidant. Recent developments in H2O2 production on the anode side, including property evaluation and material/catalyst selection, and strategies for increasing the selectivity, efficiency, and accumulation, are comprehensively discussed in this Minireview.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as a green fuel and oxidant, has drawn increasing attention in the energy and environmental research. Compared with the traditional anthraquinone process, the electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) syntheses of H2O2 are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly. In order to construct membraneless EC/PEC devices for the full H2O2 synthesis, anodic H2O2 production by water oxidation, which is less developed than cathodic H2O2 generation, is highly desirable. Here, we review recent developments for the EC/PEC H2O2 production by water oxidation, including fundamental aspects, benchmarking activity evaluation, material/catalyst selection, and strategies for increasing selectivity, efficiency, and accumulation. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and outlook of water oxidation for H2O2 production, especially device&#8208;level development, accumulation and stability, and industrial applications. Our review is intended to stimulate studies further improving EC/PEC H2O2 production.

         <title>Biased Symmetry Breaking and Chiral Control by Self&#8208;Replicating in Achiral Tetradentate Platinum (II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10531-10536, May 3, 2021. </description>

A series of achiral platinum (II) complexes showed controllable biased symmetry breaking and circularly polarized luminescence in twisted grain boundary mesophase. Among them, the distorted geometry and twisted self&#8208;assembled nanobelts could be responsible for the intense optical activity (CD and CPL). Unprecedently, the handedness of LCs film can be inherited by self&#8208;replicating.







Abstract
Obtaining homochirality from biased symmetry&#8208;breaking of self&#8208;assembly in achiral molecules remains a great challenge due to the lack of ingenious strategies and controlling their handedness. Here, we report the first case of biased symmetry breaking from achiral platinum (II) liquid crystals which self&#8208;organize into an enantiomerically enriched single domain without selection of handedness in twist grain boundary TGB [*] phase. Most importantly, the chiral control of self&#8208;organization can be achieved by using above the homochiral liquid crystal films with determined handedness (P or M) as a template. Moreover, benefiting from self&#8208;assembled superhelix, these complexes exhibit prominent circularly polarized luminescence with high |glum| up to 3.4&#215;10&#8722;3 in the TGB [*] mesophase. This work paves a neoteric avenue for the development of chiral self&#8208;assemblies from achiral molecules.

         <title>Regulating the Local Charge Distribution of Ni Active Sites for the Urea Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10577-10582, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient W&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;WOx UOR catalyst for the urea oxidation reaction has been devised which could be used in CO2 electroreduction devices. A low cell voltage of 2.16&#8197;V was achieved in a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolyzer, saving 15&#8201;% energy compared to standard devices based on the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accounts for a large proportion of the energy consumption. The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives to OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, owing to the sluggish UOR kinetics, its potential in practical use has not been unlocked. Herein, we developed a tungsten&#8208;doped nickel catalyst (Ni&#8208;WOx) with superior activity towards UOR. The Ni&#8208;WOx catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and a high turnover frequency of 0.11&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. In further experiments, we found that the W dopant regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni3+ sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni&#8208;WOx into a CO2 flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16&#8197;V accompanying with &#8776;98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide.

   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; UOR catalyst for the urea oxidation reaction has been devised which could be used in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction devices. A low cell voltage of 2.16&#8197;V was achieved in a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolyzer, saving 15&#8201;% energy compared to standard devices based on the oxygen evolution reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accounts for a large proportion of the energy consumption. The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives to OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, owing to the sluggish UOR kinetics, its potential in practical use has not been unlocked. Herein, we developed a tungsten&#8208;doped nickel catalyst (Ni&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) with superior activity towards UOR. The Ni&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and a high turnover frequency of 0.11&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. In further experiments, we found that the W dopant regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; into a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16&#8197;V accompanying with &#8776;98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Implantable Biosupercapacitor Inspired by the Cellular Redox System</title>

The present study describes an implantable supercapacitor using NAD+, which is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction.







Abstract
The carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn supercapacitor has high potential for in vivo energy storage because it can be used in aqueous environments and stitched to inner parts of the body, such as blood vessels. The biocompatibility issue for frequently used pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides, is controversial in the human body. Here, we report an implantable CNT yarn supercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system. In all living cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Based on this redox system, CNT yarn electrodes were fabricated by inserting a twist in CNT sheets with electrochemically deposited NAD and benzoquinone for redox shuttling. Consequently, the NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes exhibited the maximum area capacitance (55.73&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under physiological conditions, such as phosphate&#8208;buffered saline and serum. In addition, the yarn electrodes showed a negligible loss of capacitance after 10&#8201;000 repeated charge/discharge cycles and deformation tests (bending/knotting). More importantly, NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes implanted into the abdominal cavity of a rat's skin exhibited the stable in vivo electrical performance of a supercapacitor. Therefore, these findings demonstrate a redox biomolecule&#8208;applied platform for implantable energy storage devices.

         <title>Au&#8211;Ag Bimetallic Catalysis: 3&#8208;Alkynyl Benzofurans from Phenols via Tandem C&#8722;H Alkynylation/Oxy&#8208;Alkynylation</title>

A mild and general synthesis of 3&#8208;alkynylbenzofurans from readily available phenols by Au&#8211;Ag bimetallic catalysis has been developed. Importantly, this also advances our mechanistic understanding of the &#8220;silver effect&#8221; in gold redox chemistry.







Abstract
The development of new methodologies enabling a facile access to valuable heterocyclic frameworks still is an important subject of research. In this context, we describe a dual catalytic cycle merging C&#8722;H alkynylation of phenols and oxy&#8208;alkynylation of the newly introduced triple bond by using a unique redox property and the carbophilic &#960;&#8197;acidity of gold. Mechanistic studies support the participation of a bimetallic gold&#8211;silver species. The one&#8208;pot protocol offers a direct, simple, and regio&#8208;specific approach to 3&#8208;alkynyl benzofurans from readily available phenols. A broad range of substrates, including heterocycles, is transferred with excellent functional group tolerance. Thus, this methodology can be used for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of benzofurans.

A mixed Fe3+/Co2+&#8208;seamed capsule comprising multiple heterometallic metal&#8211;metal interactions is presented. This capsule displays unexpected semiconducting and photoelectric conversion properties.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a novel metal&#8211;organic capsule constructed from six pyrogallol[4]arene macrocycles, which are switched together by 16&#8201;FeIII and 16&#8201;CoII ions. This supramolecular structure is the first instance of a spheroidal heterometallic nanocage assembled through a one&#8208;step metal&#8211;ligand coordination approach. This new assembly also demonstrates an important proof of concept through the formation of multiple heterometallic metal&#8211;metal interactions within the capsule framework. Photophysical and electrochemical studies of self&#8208;assembled capsule films indicate their potential as semiconductors. These materials display unexpected photoelectric conversion properties, thus representing an emergent phenomenon in discrete metal&#8211;organic supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Toward a Photoinduced Single&#8208;Chain Magnet Showing High Coercivity Values</title>

A light&#8208;induced spin&#8208;crossover switchable single&#8208;chain magnet was discovered in an asymmetric ditopic ligand&#8208;containing cyanide&#8208;bridged compound. A photoinduced opening hysteresis with the highest coercive field of 1.3&#8197;T was realized in pure 3d metal&#8208;based molecular magnets.







Abstract
The production of photo&#8208;switchable molecular nanomagnets with substantial coercivity, which is indispensable for information storage and process applications, is challenging. Introducing photo&#8208;responsive spin&#8208;crossover units provides a feasible means of controlling the magnetic anisotropy, interactions, and overall nanomagnet properties. Herein, we report a cyanide&#8208;bridged chain 1&#8901;12H2O ({[(PzTp)FeIII(CN)3]2FeII(Pmat)2}n&#8901;12&#8201;H2O) generated by linking the FeII&#8208;based spin&#8208;crossover unit with the [(PzTp)Fe(CN)3]&#8722; (PzTp: tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate) building block in the presence of asymmetric ditopic ligand Pmat ((4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyleneamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole). Structural characterization revealed that the introduction of this asymmetric ligand led to a distorted coordination environment of FeII ions, which were equatorially coordinated by four cyanide N atoms, and apically coordinated by one pyridine N atom and one triazole N atom. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation, 1&#8901;12H2O underwent photoinduced spin&#8208;crossover and exhibited single&#8208;chain magnet behavior with a coercive field of up to 1.3&#8197;T. This represents a 3d&#8208;based photoinduced single&#8208;chain magnet exhibiting pronounced hysteresis.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of 3d&#8208;Block Metal (Hydro)oxides by Ligand&#8208;Induced Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10614-10619, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy was proposed to boost the electrocatalytic activities of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides. After the introduction of an organic ligand, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) increased by &#8776;5.7 times.







Abstract
The 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy&#8208;related applications that feature easily tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, considering that most 3d&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands downshifts the d&#8208;band center, which narrows the band gap, and optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates. For example, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be greatly promoted by &#8776;5.7 times over a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) after a terephthalic acid (TPA)&#8208;induced conversion process, arising from the reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O*. Impressively, the proposed ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy is applicable to a series of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides, including NiFe2O4, NiCo2O4, and NiZn LDH, providing a general structural upgrading scheme for existing high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Selective Inhibition of the Hsp90&#945; Isoform</title>

The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. A structure&#8208;based approach was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.







Abstract
The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. Many of these proteins contribute to the progression of cancer, and consequently, inhibition of the Hsp90 protein folding machinery represents an innovative approach toward cancer chemotherapy. However, clinical trials with Hsp90 N&#8208;terminal inhibitors have encountered deleterious side effects and toxicities, which appear to result from the pan&#8208;inhibition of all four Hsp90 isoforms. Therefore, the development of isoform&#8208;selective Hsp90 inhibitors is sought to delineate the pathological role played by each isoform. Herein, we describe a structure&#8208;based approach that was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.

         <title>Strong Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acidic Sites in the Borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10643-10646, May 3, 2021. </description>

The ever&#8208;expanding chemistry of borosulfates is enriched by the novel borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 featuring an unprecedented Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct of water to the anion [B(SO4)3]3&#8722;. Isodesmic exchange calculations revealed high Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acidity, opening new insights and perspectives for this fascinating silicate&#8208;analogous material class.







Abstract
Borosulfates provide fascinating structures and properties that go beyond a pure analogy to silicates. Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 is the first borosulfate featuring a boron atom solely coordinated by three tetrahedra. Thus, the free Lewis acidic site forms a Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct with a water molecule. This is unprecedented for borosulfate chemistry and even for borates. Quantum chemical calculations on water exchange reactions with BF3 and B(C6F5)3 revealed a higher Lewis acidity for the borosulfate anion. Moreover, proton exchange reactions showed a higher Br&#248;nsted acidity than comparable silicates or phosphates. Additionally, Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 was characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

A fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (C6H5CH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7, is demonstrated for exploration of photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories.







Abstract
Through a functional unit&#8208;transmutation strategy, a fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (C6H5CH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7 (BCPB) has been developed, which demonstrates stable spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 6.5&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high Curie temperature up to 425&#8197;K. Meanwhile, BCPB shows splendid bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) properties with noticeable zero&#8208;bias photocurrent density (5 &#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and high on/off switching ratio of current (over 3&#215;105); these merits even overmatch the most known ferroelectric semiconductor BiFeO3. The unique structure with self&#8208;regulated net electrical charged layers gives rise to the fatigue&#8208;free feature of Ps and BPVE (no significant fatigue after 108 polarity switching cycles), promoting the potential applications of BCPB in photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. This work offers an efficient approach for exploring fatigue&#8208;free semiconducting ferroelectrics as well as excavates their further applications in next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

         <title>Ultrafast Excimer Formation and Solvent Controlled Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in the Excitonically Coupled Subphthalocyanine Dimer</title>

Solvent polarity tunes the interplay of excimer formation and symmetry breaking charge separation (SB&#8211;CS) in the photoexcited subphthalocyanine dimer.







Abstract
Knowledge of the factors controlling excited state dynamics in excitonically coupled dimers and higher aggregates is critical for understanding natural and artificial solar energy conversion. In this work, we report ultrafast solvent polarity dependent excited state dynamics of the structurally well&#8208;defined subphthalocyanine dimer, &#956;&#8208;OSubPc2. Stationary electronic spectra demonstrate strong exciton coupling in &#956;&#8208;OSubPc2. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements reveal ultrafast excimer formation from the initially excited exciton, mediated by intramolecular structural evolution. In polar solvents the excimer state decays directly through symmetry breaking charge transfer to form a charge separated state. Charge separation occurs under control of solvent orientational relaxation.

         <title>Selective Prebiotic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Threofuranosyl Cytidine by Photochemical Anomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10526-10530, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
TNA cytidine, a candidate precursor to RNA cytidine at the origin of life, is synthesized from prebiotic precursors via a high&#8208;yielding, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective, protecting&#8208;group free synthesis utilizing an efficient photochemical anomerization. Phosphorylation also enables selective photodestruction of the contaminating erythro&#8208;diastereomer enriching any potential pool of TNA monomers.







Abstract
The structure of life's first genetic polymer is a question of intense ongoing debate. The &#8220;RNA world theory&#8221; suggests RNA was life's first nucleic acid. However, ribonucleotides are complex chemical structures, and simpler nucleic acids, such as threose nucleic acid (TNA), can carry genetic information. In principle, nucleic acids like TNA could have played a vital role in the origins of life. The advent of any genetic polymer in life requires synthesis of its monomers. Here we demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding, stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and furanosyl&#8208;selective prebiotic synthesis of threo&#8208;cytidine 3, an essential component of TNA. Our synthesis uses key intermediates and reactions previously exploited in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleoside cytidine 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that erythro&#8208;specific 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate synthesis provides a mechanism to photochemically select TNA cytidine. These results suggest that TNA may have coexisted with RNA during the emergence of life.

         <title>Decarboxylative Polyfluoroarylation of Alkylcarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10557-10562, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed decarboxylative polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids is reported. The defluorinative C&#8722;C bond formation through a radical process enables expedient access to polyfluoroaromatics from abundant carboxylic acids.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are useful building blocks in several areas such as drug discovery, materials, and crop protection. Herein, we report the first polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids via photoredox decarboxylation. The method proceeds with broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Moreover, small complex molecules such as natural products and drugs can be modified by late&#8208;stage modification.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Silver Active Sites in Gold Nanoclusters for Chemical Fixation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10573-10576, May 3, 2021. </description>

Tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the chemical fixation of CO2 were achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au clusters. Au19Ag4(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a completely open surface Ag site has the best catalytic activity, Au20Ag1(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a partially open Ag site is least efficient, and Au21(S&#8208;Adm)15 without a Ag site exhibits decent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Precise control of the composition and structure of active sites in an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fashion remains insuperable for heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we introduce tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au nanoclusters. Our results reveal that a single open Ag site on the Au19Ag4 cluster improves the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides and sequent CO2 insertion, while the partially exposed Ag site on the Au20Ag1 cluster exhibits a weak affinity for epoxides and poor efficiency for CO2 capture. Structural tunability imparted by the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring and unusual atomic charges distributed on Au and Ag atoms of the three clusters seem to be crucial for promoting challenging bond cleavages and formations in the chemical utilization of CO2.

A copper and pyrrolidine dual catalyst system enables the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones to synthesize 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The key intermediates are catalytically generated &#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl radical species and enamines.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient method for the tertiary alkylation of a ketone by using an &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compound as the tertiary alkyl source in a combined Cu&#8208;organocatalyst system. This dual catalyst system enables the addition of a tertiary alkyl radical to an enamine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the catalytically generated enamine is a key intermediate in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used to synthesize substituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds containing quaternary carbons bearing various alkyl chains.

A rhodium catalyzed C(aryl)&#8722;C(allyl) bond&#8208;forming reaction is achieved via a combination of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C activation. Gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates, enabling C&#8722;H allylation of a variety of simple arenes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a rhodium catalyzed directing&#8208;group free regioselective C&#8722;H allylation of simple arenes. Readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates via a sequence of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond activation, providing allyl arene derivatives in good yields with high regioselectivity under mild conditions. The robust methodology enables facile late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The high efficiency of this reaction is also demonstrated by the high turnover number (TON, up to 1700) of the rhodium catalyst on gram&#8208;scale experiments. Preliminary success on kinetic resolution of this transformation is achieved, providing a promising access to enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.

         <title>p&#8208;Type Charge Transfer Doping of Graphene Oxide with (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx for Air&#8208;Stable, All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbIBr2 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

(NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx decorated GO is used as a hole booster in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC. A champion efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% is achieved arising from the charge transfer doping effect between (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx and GO.







Abstract
The precise regulation of interfacial charge distribution highly determines the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inorganic (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide (GO) is successfully demonstrated as a hole booster for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC free of precious metal electrode. Arising from the spontaneous electron transfer induced p&#8208;type doping of GO from edged oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups to (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx, the best all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC achieves an efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% under one standard sun owing to the eliminated paradox between charge extraction and charge localization in GO surface. Furthermore, the champion device exhibits an excellent long&#8208;term stability at 10&#8201;% relative humidity without encapsulation over 70&#8197;days because of the suppressed ions migration.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alsmaphorazine&#8197;C and Formal Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Strictamine: A Photo&#8208;Fries Approach</title>

A continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;Fries/imine capture cascade process efficiently assembles the 2,7&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused tetrahydrocarbazole framework of strychnos and akuammiline&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. Based on this crucial transformation, the first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alsmaphorazine&#8197;C and formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;strictamine have been accomplished.







Abstract
A bioinspired photo&#8208;Fries/imine capture cascade reaction was developed in continuous&#8208;flow mode, which facilitated the rapid construction of a series of diversely functionalized 2,7&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused tetrahydrocarbazoles, the ubiquitous core structures embedded in strychnos and akuammiline&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. The synthetic utility of this novel method has been preliminarily explored by the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alsmaphorazine&#8197;C and formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;strictamine in a concise and efficient manner.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Separation of n&#8208;Hexane by a Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Reduced Energy Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10593-10597, May 3, 2021. </description>

A dynamic metal&#8208;organic framework with breathing effect shows unique separation properties toward hexane isomers. A reversed relationship between uptake capacity and diffusion rate as a function of temperature caused by the structure dynamic provides a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures and with less energy consumption.







Abstract
The separation of n&#8208;alkanes from their branched isomers is vitally important to improve octane rating of gasoline. To facilitate mass transfer, adsorptive separation is usually operated under high temperatures in industry, which require considerable energy. Herein, we present a kind of dynamic pillar&#8208;layered MOF that exhibits self&#8208;adjustable structure and pore space, a behavior induced by guest molecules. A combination of the flexibility of the framework with the commensurate adsorption for n&#8208;hexane results in exceptional performance in separating hexane isomers. More significantly, lower temperature prompts the guest molecules to open the dynamic pores, which may provide a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures with less energy consumption.

         <title>Preparation of a Multicarbazole&#8208;Based Nanocapsule Capable of Largely Modulating Guest Spectroscopic Properties in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10552-10556, May 3, 2021. </description>

A nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels was formed from bent carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles in water. The capsule displayed enhanced emissivity, improved electrochemical stability, and unique host abilities toward substituted dyes. Notably, a highly blue&#8208;shifted absorption band from twisted coumarin dyes and two absorption bands from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion were observed in the cavity.







Abstract
A nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels (ca. 12 panels) was quantitatively generated from bent carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles in water. Unlike previously reported macrocycles and coordination cages bearing several carbazole panels, the resultant nanocapsule displays enhanced emissivity and improved electrochemical stability as compared with the monomeric amphiphile. The spectroscopic properties of substituted coumarin and boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dyes can be modulated upon encapsulation by the nanocapsule in water. In the cavity, a highly blue&#8208;shifted absorption band is observed from largely twisted coumarin dyes and two absorption bands are found from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion. Moreover, the encapsulated dimers exhibit unique excimer&#8208;like emission.

         <title>Scalable Negishi Coupling between Organozinc Compounds and (Hetero)Aryl Bromides under Aerobic Conditions when using Bulk Water or Deep Eutectic Solvents with no Additional Ligands</title>

Coupling runs across water and DES: Scalable Pd&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;couplings between (hetero)aryl bromides and organozinc halides have been developed either by using bulk water, or the choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture as a reaction medium. These processes proceed under mild conditions, short reaction times in air, in the absence of additional ligands, with high chemoselectivity and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions between organozinc compounds and (hetero)aryl bromides have been reported when using bulk water as the reaction medium in the presence of NaCl or the biodegradable choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture. Both C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) and C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) couplings have been found to proceed smoothly, with high chemoselectivity, under mild conditions (room temperature or 60&#8201;&#176;C) in air, and in competition with protonolysis. Additional benefits include very short reaction times (20&#8197;s), good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%), wide substrate scope, and the tolerance of a variety of functional groups. The proposed novel protocol is scalable, and the practicability of the method is further highlighted by an easy recycling of both the catalyst and the eutectic mixture or water.

In the presence of chiral pyridoxal 5&#8201;d as a carbonyl catalyst, asymmetric 1,4&#8208;conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;position of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and subsequent in situ lactamization formed chiral pyroglutamic acid esters 4 in 43&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% enantioselectivities, providing an interesting and straightforward way to make chemically and biologically significant pyroglutamic acid derivatives.







Abstract
Direct &#945;&#8208;functionalization of NH2&#8208;free glycinates with relatively weak electrophiles such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters still remains a big challenge in organic synthesis. With chiral pyridoxal 5&#8201;d as a carbonyl catalyst, direct asymmetric conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;C of glycinate 1&#8201;a with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters 2 has been successfully realized, to produce various chiral pyroglutamic acid esters 4 in 14&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% ee's after in situ lactamization. The trans and cis diastereomers can be obtained at the same time by chromatography and both of them can be easily converted into chiral 4&#8208;substituted pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones such as Alzheimer's drug Rolipram (11) with the same absolute configuration via tert&#8208;butyl group removal and subsequent Barton decarboxylation.

         <title>Honeycomb Carbon Nanofibers: A Superhydrophilic O2&#8208;Entrapping Electrocatalyst Enables Ultrahigh Mass Activity for the Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Honeycomb carbon nanofibers behave as a superb electrocatalyst for selective H2O2 production (97.3&#8201;%) via 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction, capable of attaining an ultrahigh mass activity of 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a H2O2 yield rate of 6.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The catalytic mechanism is revealed by in situ Raman analysis and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction has emerged as a promising alternative to the energy&#8208; and waste&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process for distributed H2O2 production. This process, however, suffers from strong competition from the four&#8208;electron pathway leading to low H2O2 selectivity. Herein, we report using a superhydrophilic O2&#8208;entrapping electrocatalyst to enable superb two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction electrocatalysis. The honeycomb carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) are robust and capable of achieving a high H2O2 selectivity of 97.3&#8201;%, much higher than that of its solid carbon nanofiber counterpart. Impressively, this catalyst achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of up to 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, surpassing all other catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The superhydrophilic porous carbon skeleton with rich oxygenated functional groups facilitates efficient electron transfer and better wetting of the catalyst by the electrolyte, and the interconnected cavities allow for more effective entrapping of the gas bubbles. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by in situ Raman analysis and density functional theory calculations.

A concise route to deliver [4.3.0] alkaloid natural products featuring an allene&#8208; ynamide Pauson&#8211;Khand cyclization, an asymmetric and highly regioselective epoxidation and a chemoselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed reduction is presented. The route delivers streptazone&#8197;B1, streptazone&#8197;A and abikoviromycin for the first time, and lastly demonstrates an idiosyncratic thiol reactivity characteristic for streptazone&#8197;A.







Abstract
Streptazone&#8197;A and abikoviromycin are alkaloids that both feature an unusual arrangement of reactive functionalities within a compact tricyclic ring system. Here, we report a highly concise asymmetric synthesis of both natural products. The route first constructs another family member, streptazone&#8197;B1, using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed distal selective allene&#8208;ynamide Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction. A regio&#8208; and enantioselective epoxidation under chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions directly afforded streptazone&#8197;A in 8&#8197;steps overall. In one additional step, a chemoselective, iridium&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the enaminone system then gave abikoviromycin. The reactivity of streptazone&#8197;A towards a cysteine mimic, N&#8208;acetylcysteamine, was studied and revealed unanticipated transformations, including bis&#8208;thiol conjugation which may proceed via formation of a cyclopentadienone intermediate. With flexible access to these compounds, studies aimed to identify their direct biological targets are now possible.
