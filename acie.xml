      <title>Interfacial structure of water as a new descriptor of hydrogen evolution reaction</title>

      <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;selective chemistry targeting the canonical amino acids&#160;enables the controlled installation of desired functionality into native peptides and proteins. Such techniques facilitate the development of polypeptide&#8208;small molecule conjugates to advance therapeutics, diagnostics and basic science. Herein, we report the development of a versatile and selective method to functionalize peptides and proteins via the process of free radical&#8208;mediated dechalcogenation. By exploiting phosphine&#8208;induced homolysis of the C&#8208;Se and C&#8208;S bonds of selenocysteine and cysteine, respectively, we demonstrate the site&#8208;selective installation of groups appended to a persistent radical probe. The reaction is rapid, operationally simple, and chemoselective. The resulting aminooxy linker, attached to the beta&#8208;carbon of the target residue, is stable under a variety of conditions and selectively cleavable in the presence of a low oxidation state transition metal. We explore the limits of this reaction in model peptide systems before demonstrating the versatility of the method by installing a diverse range of functionality into larger, more complex synthetic peptides and a recombinantly expressed protein.</dc:description>

      <title>Chromophore&#8208;assisted proximity labeling of DNA reveals chromosomal organization in living cells</title>
      <dc:description>The spatial arrangement of chromosome within the nucleus is intimately linked to genome function and gene expression regulation. Existing genome&#8208;wide mapping methods to study chromosome organization often rely on chemically crosslinking DNA with protein baits, which raises concerns of introducing artefacts during cellular fixation. Herein, we developed a novel proximity&#8208;dependent DNA labeling method based on the chromophore&#8208;assisted nucleobase photooxidation. By genetically targeting a photosensitizer protein to specific subnuclear locations, we achieved blue light&#8208;activated labeling of local DNA with a bioorthogonal functional handle, which allowed subsequent affinity purification and sequence identification via next&#8208;generation sequencing. When applied to the nuclear lamina in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, our method revealed lamina&#8208;associated domains (LADs) that cover 37.6% of the genome. These LADs overlap with heterochromatin hallmarks including histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and are depleted with CpG islands. This simple labeling method avoids the harsh treatment of chemical crosslinking and is generally applicable for the genome&#8208;wide high&#8208;resolution mapping of the spatial chromosome organization in living cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrastable perovskite&#8208;zeolite composite enabled by encapsulation and in situ passivation</title>
      <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites have been widely applied in optoelectronic fields, but their poor stability hinders their actual applications. Here, a perovskite&#8208;zeolite composite was synthesized via  in situ  growth in air based on aluminophosphate AlPO&#8208;5 zeolite crystals and perovskite nanocrystals. The zeolite matrix provides quantum confinement for perovskite nanocrystals achieving efficient green emission, and passivates the defects of perovskite by H&#8208;bonding interaction leading to longer lifetime compare to bulk perovskite film. Furthermore, the AlPO&#8208;5 zeolite also acts as protection shield and enables ultrahigh stability of perovskite nanocrystals under 150&#186;C heat stress, under 15&#8208;month long&#8208;term ambient exposure, and even in water for more than 2 weeks, respectively. The strategy of  in situ  passivation and encapsulation for the perovskite@AlPO&#8208;5 composite has been demonstrated universal from MA&#8208;based to Cs&#8208;based perovskites. Benefited from the high stability and photoluminescence performance, the composite exhibits great potential to be virtually applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and backlight displays.</dc:description>

      <title>The Optical Spectrum of Au2+</title>
      <dc:description>The electronic structure of the Au  2  +  cation is essential for understanding its catalytic activity. We present the optical spectrum of mass&#8208;selected Au  2  +  measured via photodissociation spectroscopy. Two vibrationally resolved band systems are observed in the 290&#8208; 450&#160;nm range (at&#160;~440 and ~325 nm), which both exhibit rather irregular structure indicative of strong vibronic and spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The experimental spectra are compared to high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations at the CASSCF&#8208;MRCI level including spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The results demonstrate that the understanding of the electronic structure of this simple, seemingly H  2  +  &#8208;like diatomic molecular ion strictly requires multireference and relativistic treatment including spin&#8208;orbit effects. The calculations reveal that multiple electronic states contribute to each respective band system. It is shown that popular DFT methods completely fail to describe the complex vibronic pattern of this fundamental diatomic cation.</dc:description>

The most striking character is that the photoanode exhibits a strong &#8220;self&#8208;healing&#8221; property on photostability over 100 h under intermittent test.

      <title>Regioselective C&#8211;H Functionalization of Heteroarene N&#8208;Oxides Enabled by a Traceless Nucleophile</title>
      <dc:description>Although N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts have been widely used as umpoled synthons with nucleophilic (hetero)arenes, the use of electron&#8208;poor heteroarenes has remained unexplored. To overcome the inherent electron deficiency of quinolinium salts, a traceless nucleophile&#8208;triggered strategy was designed, wherein the quinolinium segment is converted to a transiently activated intermediate, thereby allowing simultaneous C8&#8208;functionalization of quinolines at room temperature. Experimental and computational studies support the traceless operation of a nucleophile, which enables the previously inaccessible transformation of N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts. Remarkably, the generality of this strategy has been further demonstrated by broad applications in the regioselective C&#8211;H functionalization of other electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes such as phenanthridine, isoquinoline, and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, offering a practical tool for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biorelevant molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Switching the Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Liposoluble Porphyrin in Aqueous Phase by Molecular Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>A facile molecular structure regulation strategy was exploited to potentially transform the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophore of lipsoluble porphyrin to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active in aqueous phase. By peripheral decoration of 5&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin (ATPP) with inherent AIE active tetraphenylethene (TPE), a versatile AIEgenic porphyrin derivative (ATPP&#8208;TPE) was obtained, which greatly abolishes the detrimental &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and thus surmounts the notorious ACQ effect of ATPP in aqueous phase. The photoluminescence of ATPP&#8208;TPE is 4.5&#8208;fold stronger than ATPP at aggregation state. Moreover, an unequivocal aggregation induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) of ATPP&#8208;TPE was found seriously dependent on its aggregation property in aqueous solution with efficiency of 34%, which is 6 times higher than pure ATPP. The versatility of this molecular structure modulation strategy along with the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation in this work provides direction to guide for applying liposoluble porphyrins in aqueous phase by designs of synthetic porphyrin AIEgens.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing CO2 Electroreduction to Methane with Cobalt Phthalocyanine and Zinc&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Tandem Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Developing copper&#8208;free catalysts for CO  2  conversion into hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable for electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). Herein, we report a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and zinc&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) tandem catalyst for CO  2  RR to CH  4  . This tandem catalyst shows more than 100 times  enhancement in CH  4  /CO production rate ratio  compared with CoPc or Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C alone. Density functional theory calculations and electrochemical CO reduction reaction results suggest that CO  2  is firstly reduced into CO over CoPc and then CO diffuses onto Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C for further conversion into CH  4  over Zn&#8208;N  4  site, decoupling complicated CO  2  RR pathway on single active site into a two&#8208;step tandem reaction. Moreover, mechanistic analysis indicates that CoPc not only generates CO but also enhances the availability of *H over adjacent N sites in Zn&#8208;N  4  , which is the key to achieve the high CH  4  production rate and understand intriguing electrocatalytic behavior distinctive to copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing copper&#8208;free catalysts for CO  2  conversion into hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable for electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). Herein, we report a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and zinc&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) tandem catalyst for CO  2  RR to CH  4  . This tandem catalyst shows more than 100 times  enhancement in CH  4  /CO production rate ratio  compared with CoPc or Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C alone. Density functional theory calculations and electrochemical CO reduction reaction results suggest that CO  2  is firstly reduced into CO over CoPc and then CO diffuses onto Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C for further conversion into CH  4  over Zn&#8208;N  4  site, decoupling complicated CO  2  RR pathway on single active site into a two&#8208;step tandem reaction. Moreover, mechanistic analysis indicates that CoPc not only generates CO but also enhances the availability of *H over adjacent N sites in Zn&#8208;N  4  , which is the key to achieve the high CH  4  production rate and understand intriguing electrocatalytic behavior distinctive to copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [4+1] and [5+1] Annulation of Arenes and 1,3&#8208;Enynes: Distinct Mechanism of Allyl Formation and Allyl Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Metal allyl species are versatile intermediates in a number of coupling reactions. However, Rh(III) &#960;&#8208;allyls have been rarely elaborated in the context of asymmetric C&#8208;H functionalization. Reported herein is chiral Rh(III) cyclopentadienyl&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of lactams and isochromenes via oxidative [4+1] and [5+1] annulation, respectively, between arenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The reaction proceeds via a C&#8208;H activation, alkenyl to allyl rearrangement, and nucleophilic cyclization cascade. The mechanistic details of the [4+1] annulation of N&#8208;methoxybenzamide and an 1,3&#8208;enyne have been elucidated by a combination of experimental and computational methods. DFT studies indicate that following the C&#8208;H activation and alkyne insertion, a Rh(III) alkenyl intermediate undergoes &#948;&#8208;hydrogen elimination of the allylic C&#8208;H via a six&#8208;membered ring transition state to produce a Rh(III) enallene hydride intermediate. Subsequent hydride insertion and allyl rearrangement affords several rhodium(III) allyl intermediates, and a rare Rh(III) &#951;4 ene&#8208;allyl species with &#960;&#8208;agostic interaction undergoes SN2'&#8208;type external attack by the nitrogen nucleophile, instead of C&#8208;N reductive elimination, as the stereodetermining step.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Recently &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers have received a lot of attention due to their unique material properties, although synthesis of long and defect free polymers remains challenging. Here we introduce a novel on&#8208;surface synthesis of coordination polymers with quinoidal ligand under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, which enables formation of flexible coordination polymers with lengths up to hundreds of nanometers. Moreover, this procedure allows the incorporation of different transition metal atoms tuning their coordination between four and two&#8208;fold.

      <title>Designing cascades of electron transfer processes in multicomponent graphene conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>A novel family of nanocarbon&#8208;based materials were designed, synthesized, and probed within the context of charge&#8208;transfer cascades. In details, we implemented fine&#8208;tuned chains of photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active constituents.

To control the rate of charge flow between the individual building blocks, we bridged them  via  oligo&#8208;  p  &#8208;phenyleneethynylenes of variable lengths. Unique are the linkages between the bridges, on one hand, and the (metallo)porphyrins / GNPs, on the other hand, by means of  &#946;  &#8208;linkages and the Prato&#8208;Maggini reaction. With the help of steady&#8208;state absorption, fluorescence, Raman, and XPS measurements we realized the basic physico&#8208;chemical characterization of the photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active components, in general, and the multicomponent conjugates, in particular. Going beyond this, we performed transient absorption measurements and corroborated by single wavelength and target analyses that the selective (metallo)porphyrin photoexcitation triggers a cascade of charge transfer events, that is, charge separation, charge shift, and charge recombination, to enable the directed charge flow.

      <title>Overcoming Symmetry Mismatch in Vaccine Nanoassembly via Spontaneous Amidation</title>
      <dc:description>Matching of symmetry at interfaces is a fundamental obstacle in molecular assembly. Virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) are important platforms to generate vaccines against pathogenic threats including Covid&#8208;19. However, symmetry mismatch between multimeric antigens and VLP subunits can prohibit vaccine nanoassembly. Here we explore spontaneous amidation to establish principles for coupling VLPs to diverse antigen symmetries. SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003&#8208;mediated decoration enabled efficient VLP conjugation and extreme thermal resilience. Many people showed pre&#8208;existing antibodies to SpyTag:SpyCatcher, but decreased antibodies against 003 variants. We coupled efficiently to the computationally&#8208;designed VLP, built from twenty trimers, not only monomers (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) but also cyclic dimers (Newcastle Disease Virus or Lyme disease), trimers (Influenza Hemagglutinins), and tetramers (Influenza Neuraminidases). Even small antigens with dihedral symmetry could be displayed. For the global challenge of Influenza, Spy&#8208;display enabled powerful induction of neutralizing antibodies to trimeric and tetrameric antigens. SpyCatcher003 conjugation is compatible with nanodisplay of diverse symmetries, towards generation of potent vaccines.</dc:description>

      <title>An Electrochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Film</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) possess merits such as high porosity, tunable structure, facile modification, and easy regeneration, which, however, have yet to be brought into play for exploring new functional HOF materials. In this study, an electrochromic HOF film was first time reported. The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method applied here generated a transparent film at room temperature in merely 2 minutes, being facile, efficient, low&#8208;cost, and applicable to other HOFs. The resulted film exhibits reversible electrochromic property with the advantages of long cycle life (&gt;500 cycles). More strikingly, such an all&#8208;organic film can be easily regenerated (through rinsing with DMF and re&#8208;deposition) and shows tunable electrochromic behavior (via low&#8208;cost post&#8208;synthetic modification) capable of successive color changes, which is hardly achieved by conventional electrochromic materials. With the above&#8208;mentioned advantages, an electrochromic device is manufactured to further demonstrate its application potential. The work presented here may open a new avenue toward preparing HOF films for broad practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Anionic Aliovalent Substitution from Structure Models of ZnS: Novel Defect Diamond&#8208;like Halopnictide Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials with Wide Band Gaps and Large SHG Effects</title>
      <dc:description>To design pnictide nonlinear optical materials with wide band gap and large second&#8208;harmonic generation, the heavy halogen I was introduced into pnictides through anionic aliovalent substitution with diamond&#8208;like ZnS as templates. Thus, four excellent halopnictide&#8208;based infrared nonlinear optical crystals, M II  3  PnI 3  (M II  =Zn, Cd; Pn=P, As), were obtained. They all exhibited defect diamond&#8208;like structures with highly parallel&#8208;oriented [M II  PnI 3  ] mixed&#8208;anionic tetrahedra groups, leading to excellent physical properties including wide band gaps (2.38&#8208;2.85 eV), large second harmonic generation responses (2.7&#8208;5.1 &#215; AgGaS 2  ), high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (5.5&#8208;10.7 &#215; AgGaS 2  ), and good IR transparency. Especially, Cd 3  PI 3  and Cd 3  AsI 3  achieved phase&#8208;matching (&#916;n = 0.035 and 0.031) that their template &#946;&#8208;ZnS could not do.

      <title>Direct&#8208;Space Structure Determination of Covalent Organic Frameworks from 3D Electron Diffraction Data</title>
      <dc:description>Structure determination of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at atomic precision is a bottle&#8208;neck that hinders the development of COF chemistry. Although three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D&#8208;ED) data has been used to solve structures of sub&#8208;micrometre sized COFs, successful structure solution is not guaranteed as the data resolution is usually low. Herein, we demonstrate that  the direct&#8208;space strategy for structure solution, implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA), is a successful approach for structure determination of COF&#8208;300 from 3D&#8208;ED data.  Structural models with different geometric constraints were considered in the GA calculations, with successful structure solution achieved from room&#8208;temperature 3D&#8208;ED data with resolution as low as  ca  . 3.78 &#197;. The generality of this strategy is further verified for different phases of COF&#8208;300. This study demonstrates a viable strategy for structure solution of COF materials from 3D&#8208;ED data of limited resolution, which may facilitate the discovery of new COF materials in the future.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Nikolay Zelinsky was one of the leading chemists worldwide at the beginning of the 20th century. He discovered four reactions that bear his name and his work formed the basis for the petrochemical industry in the Soviet Union. This Essay looks back at his achievements and sets the historical context.







Abstract
This Essay outlines the life path and scientific achievements of Nikolai Zelinsky to testify to his contributions to organic chemistry, catalysis, and petrochemistry. His legacy includes four name reactions (the Hell&#8211;Volhard&#8211;Zelinsky reaction, 1887; the Zelinsky&#8211;Stadnikov reaction, 1906; Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, 1911; the Zelinsky&#8211;Kazansky acetylene trimerization, 1924), pioneering contributions to the main oil&#8208;refining processes (thermal cracking, catalytic cracking, hydrodesulfurization, reforming, and oxidative regeneration of coked catalysts), the coal gas mask, Pd/C and other supported catalysts, and a very large scientific school.

      <title>Impact of Ethylene on Efficiency and Stereocontrol in Olefin Metathesis : When to Add It, When to Remove It, and When to Avoid It</title>
      <dc:description>E    thylene is the byproduct of olefin metathesis reactions that involve one or more terminal alkenes. Ethylene&#8217;s volatility is one reason why many cross&#8208;metathesis or ring&#8208;closing metathesis processes, which are reversible transformations, are efficient. However, because ethylene can be converted to a methylidene complex, which is a highly reactive but relatively unstable species, its concentration can impact olefin metathesis in other ways. In some cases, introducing excess ethylene can increase reaction rate owing to faster catalyst initiation. Ethylene and a derived methylidene complex can also advantageously inhibit substrate or product homocoupling, and/or divert a less selective pathway. In other instances, a methylidene&#8217;s low stability and high activity may lead to erosion of efficiency and/or kinetic selectivity, making it preferable that ethylene is removed while being generated. If methylidene decomposition is so fast that there is little or no product formation, it is best that ethylene and methylidene complex formation is avoided altogether. This is accomplished by the use of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes in stereoretentive processes, which includes adopting methylene capping strategy. Here, we analyze the different scenarios through which ethylene and the involvement of methylidene complexes can be manipulated and managed so that an olefin metathesis reaction may occur more efficiently and/or more stereoselectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Control of surface barriers in mass transfer to modulate methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins reaction over SAPO&#8208;34 zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Mass transfer of guest molecules has great impact on the applications of nanoporous crystalline materials and particularly the shape selective catalysis over zeolites. Control of mass transfer to alter reaction over zeolites, however, remains an open challenge. Recent studies show that, in addition to intracrystalline diffusion, surface barriers represent another transport mechanism which may dominate the overall mass transport rate in zeolites.

      <title>Pushing the limits of precious metal atom economy for three&#8208;way&#8208;catalysts (TWC): thermally stable and highly active single Rh atom catalysts (Rh1/ceria) for NO abatement</title>
      <dc:description>We show for the first time that atomically dispersed Rh cations on ceria, prepared via high&#8208;temperature atom trapping synthesis, are the active species for (CO+NO) reaction. This provides a direct link with the organometallic homogeneous Rh(I) complexes capable of catalyzing dry (CO+NO) reaction but without the stability concern. In particular, thermally stable Rh cations in 0.1wt% Rh1/CeO2 achieve full NO conversion with a TOF of ~ 330 hr&#8208;1 per Rh atom at 120 &#8304;C.&#160; Under dry conditions, the main product above 100 &#8304;C is N2 with N2O being the minor product. The presence of water promotes low&#8208;temperature activity of 0.1wt% Rh1/CeO2 starting at 50 &#8304;C with full NO conversion at ~120 &#8304;C. In the case with the wet stream, however, ammonia and nitrogen are the main products with only minor N2O amounts. NH3 formation at such low temperatures is attractive because of the potential to use this as a passive SCR system. Because of the uniformity of Rh ions on the support, we are able to observe the intermediates of (CO+NO) reaction via infrared measurements on Rh cations on zeolite and ceria. Furthermore, we show that ammonia formation correlates with the WGS activity of the material and thus, rhodium hydride Rh&#8208;H species are involved in this reaction: we detect Rh(CO)Hx species on ceria using isotopic IR measurements. These findings provide new mechanistic understanding for the catalytically active species in TWC catalysis and open up a new avenue for the synthesis of novel emissions control catalysts with 100% atom economy of ultra&#8208;expensive precious metals such as Rh.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Center of attention: This Review gives an overview of methods to investigate HER&#8208;active atomic centers and discusses active sites with different coordination configurations.

Abstract
The evolution of hydrogen from water using renewable electrical energy is a topic of current interest. Pt/C exhibits the highest catalytic activity for the H2 evolution reaction (HER), but scarce supplies and high cost limit its large&#8208;scale application. Atomic active centers in single&#8208;atom catalysts, single&#8208;atom alloys, and catalysts with two atom sorts exhibit maximum atomic efficiency, unique structure, and exceptional activity for the HER. Interactions between well&#8208;defined active sites and supports are known to affect electron transfer and dramatically accelerate the reaction. This Review first highlights methods for studying atomic active centers for the HER. Then, active sites with different coordination configurations are described. Active centers with one metal atom, two different metal atoms as well as nonmetal atoms are analyzed at the atomic scale. Finally, future research perspectives are proposed.

      <title>Conductive and Elastic TiO2 Nanofibrous Aerogels: A New Concept toward Self&#8208;Supported Electrocatalysts with Superior Activity and Durability</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, various titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures have received increasing attention in the fields of energy conversion and storage due to extraordinary electrochemical properties. However, these particulate nanomaterials exclusively exist in the powder form, which may cause health risks and environmental hazards. Here we report a novel, highly elastic bulk form of TiO2  for safe use and easy recycling. Specifically, TiO2  nanofibrous aerogels (NAs) consisting of resiliently bonded, flexible TiO2  nanofibers are constructed, which are featured by ultralow bulk density, ultrahigh porosity, and excellent elasticity. To further promote the charge transfer, they are subjected to the lithium reduction to generate abundant oxygen vacancies, which can modulate the electronic structures of TiO2, resulting in a conductivity up to 38.2 mS cm&#8211;1. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the conductive and elastic TiO2  NAs serve as a new type of self&#8208;supported electrocatalysts for ambient nitrogen fixation, achieving an ammonia yield of 4.19&#215;10&#8211;10  mol s&#8211;1  cm&#8211;2  and a Faradaic efficiency of 20.3% as determined by the indophenol blue method. The origin of the superior electrocatalytic activity is revealed by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular assembly and chirality of synthetic carbohydrate materials</title>
      <dc:description>Hierarchical carbohydrate architectures serve multiple roles in Nature. Hardly any correlations between the carbohydrate chemical structures and the material properties are available due to the lack of standards and suitable analytic techniques. Therefore, designer carbohydrate materials remain highly unexplored, as compared to peptides and nucleic acids.

      <title>Renal Secretion Pathway&#8208;dependent Efflux Transport Enabled Hyperfluorescence Imaging of Kidney Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Renal tubular secretion is an active efflux pathway for the kidneys to remove molecules but has never been used to enhance kidney cancer targeting. Herein, we report the first renal tubule&#8208;secretable near infrared&#8208;emitting fluorophore, indocyanine green (ICG) conjugated with a 2100 Da PEG molecule (ICG&#8208;PEG45) and its advantages in hyperfluorescence imaging of kidney cancers, which cannot be achieved with hepatobiliary&#8208; and glomerular&#8208;clearable ICG. This pathway&#8208;dependent targeting of kidney cancer fundamentally arises from the fact that the secretion pathway enabled ICG&#8208;PEG45 to be effectively effluxed out of normal proximal tubules through P&#8208;glycoprotein transporter while being retained in the kidney cancerous tissues with low P&#8208;glycoprotein expression. Tuning elimination pathways and utilizing different efflux kinetics of medical agents in normal and diseased tissues could be a new strategy, in addition to well&#8208;known vasculature&#8208;based passive and ligand&#8208;receptor mediated active targeting, for tackling challenges in disease diagnosis and treatments.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal halide regulated photophysical turning of zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids: from efficient phosphorescence to ultralong afterglow.</title>
      <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials with exceptional structural and photophysical tunability, thanks to the rich choices of organic cations and metal halides for the formation of ionically bonded systems. Here we report photophysical tuning of a series of tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP) metal halide hybrids containing distinct metal halides, TPP  2  MX  n  (MX  n  = SbCl  5  , MnCl  4  , ZnCl  4  , ZnCl  2  Br  2  , ZnBr  4  ), from efficient phosphorescence to ultralong afterglow. It is found that the afterglow properties of TPP  +  cations could be suspended for the hybrids containing low bandgap emissive metal halide species, such as SbCl  5  2&#8208;  and MnCl  4  2&#8208;  , but significantly enhanced for the hybrids containing wide bandgap non&#8208;emissive ZnCl  4  2&#8208;  . Structural and photophysical studies reveal that the enhanced afterglow is attributed to stronger &#960; &#8208; &#960; stacking and intermolecular electronic coupling between TPP  +  cations in TPP  2  ZnCl  4  than in the pristine organic ionic compound TPPCl. Moreover, the afterglow in TPP  2  ZnX  4  can be tuned by controlling the halide composition, with the change from Cl to Br resulting in a shorter afterglow due to heavy atom effect.</dc:description>

      <title>Photo&#8208;effect on ion transport in mixed cation and halide perovskites and implications for photo demixing</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskites are considered to be most promising photovoltaic materials. Highest efficiency and improved stability of perovskite solar cells have been achieved by using cation and anion mixtures. Experimental information on electronic and ionic charge carriers is key to evaluate device performance, as well as processes of photo&#8208;decomposition and photo&#8208;demixing which are observed in these materials. Here, we measure ionic and electronic transport properties and investigate various cation and anion substitutions with a special eye on their photo&#8208;ionic effect, following our previous study on CH 3  NH 3  PbI 3  , where we found that light enhances not only electronic but also ionic conductivities. We find that this phenomenon is very sensitive to the nature of the halide, while the cationic substitutions are less relevant. Based on the observation that the ionic conductivity enhancement found for iodide perovskites is significantly weakened by bromide substitution, we provide a chemical rationale for the photo&#8208;demixing in mixed halide compositions.</dc:description>

Experimental information on electronic and ionic charge carriers is key to evaluate device performance, as well as processes of photo&#8208;decomposition and photo&#8208;demixing which are observed in these materials. Here, we measure ionic and electronic transport properties and investigate various cation and anion substitutions with a special eye on their photo&#8208;ionic effect, following our previous study on CH 3  NH 3  PbI 3  , where we found that light enhances not only electronic but also ionic conductivities. We find that this phenomenon is very sensitive to the nature of the halide, while the cationic substitutions are less relevant. Based on the observation that the ionic conductivity enhancement found for iodide perovskites is significantly weakened by bromide substitution, we provide a chemical rationale for the photo&#8208;demixing in mixed halide compositions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Metal Nanozyme with Ester Hydrolysis Activity in the Presence of Ammonia&#8211;Borane and Its Use in a Sensitive Immunosensor</title>
      <dc:description>Metal nanoparticle surfaces are used for peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like nanozymes but not for esterase&#8208;like nanozymes. It is challenging to obtain rapid catalytic hydrolysis on a metal surface and even more so without a catalytically labile substrate. Here, we report that metal nanoparticle surfaces rapidly catalyze non&#8208;redox ester hydrolysis in the presence of redox H 3  N&#8211;BH 3  (AB). Metal hydrides are readily generated on a Pt nanoparticle (PtNP) from AB, and as a result the PtNP becomes electron&#8208;rich, which might assist nucleophilic attack of H 2  O on the carbonyl group of an ester. The nanozyme system based on PtNP, AB, and 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate provides an electrochemical signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio much higher than natural enzymes, due to the rapid ester hydrolysis and redox cycling involving the hydrolysis product. The nanozyme system is applied in a sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for thyroid&#8208;stimulating hormone detection. The calculated detection limit is approximately 0.3 pg/mL, which indicates the high sensitivity of the immunosensor using the PtNP nanozyme.</dc:description>

      <title>&#8220;To jump or not&#8221;: manipulating light&#8208;induced dynamic macro&#8208;movement and static photonic properties within 1D isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Smart molecular crystals with light&#8208;driven mechanical responses have received intense interest owing to their potential uses in developing novel molecular machines, artificial muscles, and biomimetics. However, challenges remain in control over both the dynamic photo&#8208;mechanical behaviors and static photonic properties of molecular crystals that are based on the same molecule. Herein, we illustrate that the construction of isostructural co&#8208;crystals is an effective approach to tune on/off their light&#8208;induced cracking and jumping behaviors (photosalient effect). The hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals organized from 4&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthylvinyl)pyridine (  NVP  ) along with co&#8208;formers (tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (  THA  ) and tetrafluorobenzoic acid (  TA  )) crystallize as isostructural crystals, but have notably different static and dynamic photo&#8208;mechanical behaviors. These differences are due to alternations in the relative orientation of  NVP  and hydrogen&#8208;bonding modes of the included co&#8208;formers. After light activation, the 1D  NVP&#8208;TA  crystal splits and shears off within 1 second, as a result from [2+2] cycloaddition of the olefin pair in  NVP  . For  NVP&#8208;THA  , its photostability and high quantum yield endow the 1D microstructure with novel photonic properties, including low optical waveguide loss (0.066 dB &#181;m  &#8722;1  ), highly polarized anisotropy (  r  =0.72) and efficient up&#8208;conversion fluorescence. Therefore, this work not only provides an isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal strategy to manipulate light&#8208;induced dynamic movement and static photonic properties within 1D crystalline microstructures, but also affords a deep understanding regarding the role of hydrogen bonding in the construction of microscopic optical&#8211;mechanical responses in molecular systems.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of the anti&#8208;COVID&#8208;19 drug remdesivir has been realized via the coupling of the P&#8208;racemic phosphoryl chloride with protected nucleoside GS441524. The chiral bicyclic imidazole catalyst is crucial for the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) to proceed smoothly with high reactivity and excellent stereoselectivity [96% conv., 22:1 P(S):P(R)].

      <title>Sequential Solid&#8208;State Transformations Involving Consecutive Rearrangements of Secondary Building Units in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state transformations in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) systems are important phenomena and have led to the creation of new MOF structures. Solid&#8208;state transformations from interpenetrated to non&#8208;interpenetrated networks involving rearrangement of secondary building units (SBUs) in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion have not been explored to date. Herein, we report the sequential, thermally stimulated solid&#8208;state transformations in a barium&#8208;organic framework (  UPC&#8208;600  ). The two&#8208;fold interpenetrated framework of&#160;  UPC&#8208;600  &#160;is converted at 373 K to  UPC&#8208;601  , a&#160;non&#8208;interpenetrated framework. This proceeds in a SCSC fashion and involves the rearrangement of two proximate rod&#8208;shaped SBUs in different nets to generate a new rod&#8208;shaped SBU. At 473 K,&#160;a&#160;continuous solid&#8208;state transformation involving a second rearrangement&#160;occurred,&#160;  UPC&#8208;601  &#160;converted to  UPC&#8208;602  &#160;by the rearrangement of the 1D rod&#8208;shaped SBU to a 2D layer SBU. This is the first example of such a thermally&#8208;driven stepwise transformation involving simultaneous cleavage and regeneration of multiple bonds.&#160;This result will enable detailed studies of solid&#8208;state transformations, and encourages a deep understanding of the role of solid&#8208;state transformations in the synthesis of MOF materials.</dc:description>

At 473 K,&#160;a&#160;continuous solid&#8208;state transformation involving a second rearrangement&#160;occurred,&#160;  UPC&#8208;601  &#160;converted to  UPC&#8208;602  &#160;by the rearrangement of the 1D rod&#8208;shaped SBU to a 2D layer SBU. This is the first example of such a thermally&#8208;driven stepwise transformation involving simultaneous cleavage and regeneration of multiple bonds.&#160;This result will enable detailed studies of solid&#8208;state transformations, and encourages a deep understanding of the role of solid&#8208;state transformations in the synthesis of MOF materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>In&#8208;syringe electrokinetic protein removal from biological samples prior to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>Matrix effects can compromise ionization and hence reliability of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), making sample clean&#8208;up including protein removal critical in bioanalysis. Automation of protein removal protocols is challenging. Here, an electrokinetic extraction (EkE) syringe is presented allowing for on&#8208;line electrokinetic removal of serum proteins before ESI&#8208;MS. The method relies on the electrophoretic migration of charged serum proteins away from neutral target analytes in an electric field, applied across the syringe barrel utilizing the metallic syringe needle and plunger as electrodes. Under acidic conditions, most proteins are cationic facilitating their accumulation at an cathodic plunger. Similarly, under basic conditions, the anionic proteins aggregate near the anodic plunger. Actuation of the plunger enables infusion of the deproteinated sample remaining in the barrel into the ESI&#8208;MS for detection of acidic or basic molecules. The proposed concept is demonstrated by the determination of pharmaceuticals from human serum within minutes, with sample preparation limited to a 5x dilution of the sample in the background electrolyte (BGE) and application of voltage, both of which can be performed in&#8208;syringe. Signal enhancements of 3.6&#8208;32 fold relative to direct infusion of diluted serum and up to 10.8 fold enhancement, were obtained for basic and acidic pharmaceuticals, respectively. Linear correlations for the basic drugs by EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS were achieved, covering the necessary clinical range with LOQs of 5.3, 7.8, 6.1, and 17.8 ng/mL for clomipramine, chlorphenamine, pindolol, and atenolol, respectively. For the acidic drugs analysis, EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, the LOQs were 3.1 &#181;g/mL and 2.9 &#181;g/mL for naproxen and paracetamol, respectively. The EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS methods showed good accuracy (%found of 81% to 120%), precision (&lt; 20%), and linearity (r &gt; 0.997) for all the studied drugs in spiked serum samples.</dc:description>

      <title>How big is the pinacol boronic ester as a substituent?</title>
      <dc:description>The synthetically versatile pinacol boronic ester group (Bpin) is generally thought of as a bulky moiety due to the two adjacent quaternary sp  3  &#8208;hydribized carbon atoms in its diol backbone. However, recent diastereoselective reactions reported in the literature have cast doubt on this perception. Herein, we report a detailed experimental and computational analysis of Bpin and structurally related boronic esters which allows us to determine three different steric parameters for the Bpin group: the A&#8208;value, ligand cone angle, and percent buried volume. All three parameters suggest that the Bpin moiety is remarkably small, with the planarity of the oxygen&#8211;boron&#8211;oxygen motif playing an important role in minimising steric interactions. Of the three steric parameters, percent buried volume provides the best correlation between steric size and diastereoselectivity in a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>A De Novo Design of Fully Non&#8208;fused Ring Acceptor with Planar Backbone and Near&#8208;IR Absorption for High Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors have made significant progress in recent years, while the development of fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors has been unsatisfactory. Here, two fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors, o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  and m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  , were designed and synthesized. By regulating the location of the hexyloxy chains, o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  formed planar backbones, while m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  displayed a twisted backbone. Additionally, the o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  film showed a markedly red&#8208;shifted absorption after thermal annealing, which indicated the formation of J  &#8208;aggregates. For fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs), PBDB&#8208;T was used as a donor and blended with the two acceptors. The o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  &#8208;based blend films displayed high charge mobilities, lower energy loss and a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). The optimized devices based on o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  gave a PCE of 10.26%, which was much higher than those based on m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  at 2.63%, and it is one of the highest reported PCE values for fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Zwitterionic peptide cloak mimics protein surfaces for protein protection</title>
      <dc:description>Inspired by the amino acid composition of natural protein surfaces, we developed a zwitterionic cloak containing multi&#8208;layers of short alternating glutamic acid and lysine (EK) peptides as a facile, highly effective and low&#8208;immunogenicity approach for the protection and delivery of biotherapeutics. Each EK layer grafted to proteins provides multiple times of new lysine reaction sites for the growth of subsequent EK layers. This unique design allows EK peptides to achieve high coating density on proteins, overcoming the limitation of traditional conjugation strategies that rely on the number of innate lysine groups. A triple&#8208;layer EK cloak manifests to successfully eliminate the specific and non&#8208;specific interactions of protected asparaginase, a highly immunogenic protein drug, with biological media while prolong the drug circulation time and significantly mitigate its&#160;immunogenicity in vivo, suggesting an EK peptide cloak as a promising approach to improve the safety and efficacy of biotherapeutics.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Interaction of a&#8208;Synuclein (aS) with biological lipid is crucial for the onset of its fibrillation at the cell membrane&#8208;water interface. Here, we probe the interaction of aS with membrane mimicking lipid monolayer&#8208;water interfaces using surface&#8208;selective heterodyne&#8208;detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD&#8208;VSFG) spectroscopy. Our results depict that aS interacts negligibly with zwitterionic lipid, but strongly affects the pristine air&#8208;water and charged lipid&#8208;water interfaces by perturbing the structure and orientation of the interfacial water. Specifically, the net negative aS (&#8208;9 in bulk water; pH 7.4) reorients the water as hydrogen&#8208;up (H&#8208;up) at the air&#8208;water interface; electrostatically interacts&#160;with positively charged lipids, making the interface nearly net neutral. Strangely, aS also interacts with negatively charged lipids: the net H&#8208;up orientation of the interfacial water decreases at anionic lipid&#8208;water interface, revealing a domain&#8208;specific (positively charged N&#8208;terminal) interaction of net negative aS with the negatively charged lipids at membrane surface.</dc:description>

      <title>Cross&#8208;module Enoylreduction in the Azalomycin F Polyketide Synthase</title>
      <dc:description>The colinearity of canonical modular polyketide synthases, which creates a direct link between multienzyme structure and the chemical structure of the biosynthetic end&#8208;product, has become a cornerstone of knowledge&#8208;based genome mining. Here we report genetic and enzymatic evidence for the remarkable role of an enoylreductase in the polyketide synthase for azalomycin F biosynthesis. This internal enoylreductase domain, previously identified as acting only in the second of two chain extension cycles on an initial iterative module, is shown here also to catalyse enoylreduction  in trans  within the next module. The mechanism for this rare deviation from colinearity appears to involve direct cross&#8208;modular interaction of the reductase with the longer acyl chain, rather than backtransfer of the substrate into the iterative module, suggesting an additional and surprising plasticity in natural PKS assembly&#8208;line catalysis.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The colinearity of canonical modular polyketide synthases, which creates a direct link between multienzyme structure and the chemical structure of the biosynthetic end&#8208;product, has become a cornerstone of knowledge&#8208;based genome mining. Here we report genetic and enzymatic evidence for the remarkable role of an enoylreductase in the polyketide synthase for azalomycin F biosynthesis. This internal enoylreductase domain, previously identified as acting only in the second of two chain extension cycles on an initial iterative module, is shown here also to catalyse enoylreduction  in trans  within the next module. The mechanism for this rare deviation from colinearity appears to involve direct cross&#8208;modular interaction of the reductase with the longer acyl chain, rather than backtransfer of the substrate into the iterative module, suggesting an additional and surprising plasticity in natural PKS assembly&#8208;line catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Aptamer&#8208;mediated reversible transactivation of gene expression by light</title>
      <dc:description>The investigation and manipulation of cellular processes with subcellular resolution requires non&#8208;invasive tools with spatiotemporal precision and reversibility. Building on the interaction of the photoreceptor PAL with an RNA aptamer, we describe a variation of the CRISPR/dCAS9 system for light&#8208;controlled activation of gene expression. This platform significantly reduces the coding space required for genetic manipulation and provides a strong on&#8208;switch with almost no residual activity in the dark. It adds to the current set of modular building blocks for synthetic biological circuit design and is broadly applicable</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Cysteine&#8208;Specific Bioconjugation: Biocompatible Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Bioconjugation methods using visible&#8208;light photocatalysis have emerged as powerful synthetic tools for the selective modification of biomolecules under mild reaction conditions. However, the number of photochemical transformations that allow successful protein bioconjugation is still limited because of the need for stringent reaction conditions. Herein, we report that a newly developed water&#8208;compatible fluorescent photosensitizer Q PEG  can be used for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cysteine&#8208;specific bioconjugation for the installation of Q PEG  by exploiting its intrinsic photosensitizing ability to activate the S&#8211;H bond of cysteine. In addition, the slightly modified Q CAT  enables the effective photocatalytic cysteine&#8208;specific conjugation of biologically relevant groups. The superior reactivity and cysteine selectivity of this methodology was further corroborated by traceless bioconjugation with a series of complex peptides and proteins under biocompatible conditions.</dc:description>
