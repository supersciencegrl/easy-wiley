         <title>Structure of an Ultrathin Oxide on Pt3Sn(111) Solved by Machine Learning Enhanced Global Optimization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning techniques can be implemented to accelerate surface structure determination based on density functional theory. The application of such an algorithm is demonstrated here for a surface oxide on Pt3Sn(111) which had eluded determination by experimental methods.







Abstract
Determination of the atomic structure of solid surfaces typically depends on comparison of measured properties with simulations based on hypothesized structural models. For simple structures, the models may be guessed, but for more complex structures there is a need for reliable theory&#8208;based search algorithms. So far, such methods have been limited by the combinatorial complexity and computational expense of sufficiently accurate energy estimation for surfaces. However, the introduction of machine learning methods has the potential to change this radically. Here, we demonstrate how an evolutionary algorithm, utilizing machine learning for accelerated energy estimation and diverse population generation, can be used to solve an unknown surface structure&#8212;the (4&#215;4) surface oxide on Pt3Sn(111)&#8212;based on limited experimental input. The algorithm is efficient and robust, and should be broadly applicable in surface studies, where it can replace manual, intuition based model generation.

         <title>Protein Flexibility and Dissociation Pathway Differentiation Can Explain Onset Of Resistance Mutations in Kinases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding how mutations render a drug ineffective is a problem of immense relevance. Often the mechanism through which mutations cause drug resistance can be explained purely through thermodynamics. However, the more perplexing situation is when two proteins have the same drug binding affinities but different residence times. In this work, we demonstrate how all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations using recent developments grounded in statistical mechanics can provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for such variances. We discover dissociation mechanisms for the anti&#8208;cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) against wild&#8208;type and the N368S mutant of Abl kinase. We show how this point mutation triggers far&#8208;reaching changes in protein&#8217;s flexibility and leads to a different, much faster, drug dissociation pathway. We believe that this work marks an efficient and scalable approach to obtain mechanistic insight into resistance mutations in biomolecular receptors that are hard to explain using a structural perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>Promising Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Birefringent Materials via Rational Design and Assembly of Planar &#960;&#8208;Conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] Functional Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent materials play a significant role to modulate polarized light in optical communication and the laser industry. However, the discovery of deep ultraviolet (DUV,  &#955;  &lt; 200 nm) birefringent materials still faces a serious challenge. Herein, we propose hydroxylated  &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] units for designing DUV birefringent materials. Innovatively, four new hydroxyborates have been synthesized under mild synthesis conditions. They present four novel pseudo layers that benefit from a large degree of freedom assembly modes of [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] genes and large birefringence (0.057&#8208;0.123@532 nm). Moreover, The Cs3[B(OH)3]2Cl3  crystal features a short DUV cutoff edge (180 nm), which further indicates that reported compounds are potential DUV birefringent crystals. Free and flexible assembly modes of  &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] groups endow them a particular advantage as significant genes for exploring promising DUV birefringent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Allylic Alcohol Formation by a Multifunctional Cytochrome&#8197;P450 Monooxygenase with Rare Redox Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional cytochrome&#8197;P450 monoxygenase CayG plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the cytotoxic fatty acid caryoynencin in pathogenic bacteria. CayG promotes an unusual desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence to install an allylic alcohol with the help of rare ferredoxin/rubredoxin redox partners. This enzyme system may inspire new multifunctional (bio)catalysts for regio&#8208; and stereoselective modifications of saturated carbon backbones.







Abstract
Caryoynencin is a toxic and antifungal fatty acid derivative produced by a number of plant&#8208;pathogenic and insect&#8208;protective bacteria (Trinickia caryophylli and Burkholderia spp.). In addition to the reactive tetrayne unit, the presence of an allylic alcohol moiety is critical for antimicrobial activities. By a combination of mutational analyses, heterologous expression and in vitro reconstitution experiments we show that the cytochrome&#8197;P450 monooxygenase CayG catalyzes the complex transformation of a saturated carbon backbone into an allylic alcohol. Unexpectedly, CayG employs a ferritin&#8208;like protein (CayK) or a rubredoxin (CayL) component for electron transport. A desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence was deduced from a time&#8208;course study and in vitro biotransformations with pathway intermediates, substrate analogues, protegencin congeners from Pseudomonas protegens Pf&#8208;5, and synthetic derivatives. This unusual multifunctional oxygenase may inspire future biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Bound Inward&#8208;Growth of Artificial Cytoskeletons and Their Selective Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth strategy is presented to construct membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs) consisting of convergent&#8208;arranged nanofibers grown from a capsule membrane. Furthermore, this method enables the light&#8208;controlled integration of dynamic covalent bonds into the MAC and to realize two modes of selective disassembly behaviors.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is one of the most important cellular components. Up to now, most of the reported artificial cytoskeletons are based on a gel&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle strategy. Herein, we report a membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth pathway to prepare cytoskeleton&#8208;like and radially aligned nanofibers grown from capsule membranes to get membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs). The mechanism therein is disclosed through the direct observation of the intermediates in both dried and liquid states. Furthermore, the as&#8208;prepared MACs show a selective disassembly behavior in the presence of reductants: both capsule membranes and MACs can be disassembled or only MACs can be disassembled through the selective introduction of dynamic disulfide bonds (DS) into them and by the switch of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The present work provides a new hierarchical self&#8208;assembly way to construct artificial cytoskeletons with controlled compositions and orientations.

         <title>Bonding in a Crystalline Tri&#8208;Thorium Cluster: Not &#963;&#8208;Aromatic But Still Unique</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High symmetry and unusual thermodynamic stability of the recently prepared and isolated crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster is determined by the unique multicenter charge&#8208;shift bonding pattern (ThCl2)3 rather than the &#963;&#8208;aromatic Th3 bonding. The delocalized (ThCl2)3 bond extends the range of the charge&#8208;shift bonding beyond transition metals to a record seventh row of the periodic table.







Abstract
Very recently, Boronski et&#8197;al. reported the first thorium&#8211;thorium bond in a crystalline cluster prepared under normal experimental conditions. By using a range of experimental techniques and computational models, the authors found that the isolated actinide cluster contains at its heart two paired electrons delocalized over the tri&#8208;thorium ring. The recorded Raman spectrum allegedly confirmed the existence of a &#963;&#8208;aromatic three&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bond. In the following we demonstrate that the experimentally observed broad inelastic scattering bands between 60 and 135&#8197;cm&#8722;1, originally assigned by the authors to thorium&#8208;thorium vibrations, represent the combination of Th&#8722;Cl stretching and Th&#8722;Cl&#8722;Th bending modes, and they establish the existence of an unprecedented multicenter charge&#8208;shift bonding (ThCl2)3 rather than the &#963;&#8208;aromatic bonding Th3. In the light of the presented findings, the latter remains experimentally unproven and computationally questionable.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Evolution of G Protein&#8208;Biased &#956;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
cryoEM structures of the &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) bound to the lead compound PZM21 and the newly developed agonist FH210 were obtained to understand the mechanism of their biased signaling and to guide the evolution of next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.







Abstract
The &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) is the major target for opioid analgesics. Activation of &#956;OR initiates signaling through G protein pathways as well as through &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment. &#956;OR agonists that are biased towards G protein signaling pathways demonstrate diminished side effects. PZM21, discovered by computational docking, is a G protein biased &#956;OR agonist. Here we report the cryoEM structure of PZM21 bound &#956;OR in complex with Gi protein. Structure&#8208;based evolution led to multiple PZM21 analogs with more pronounced Gi protein bias and increased lipophilicity to improve CNS penetration. Among them, FH210 shows extremely low potency and efficacy for arrestin recruitment. We further determined the cryoEM structure of FH210 bound to &#956;OR in complex with Gi protein and confirmed its expected binding pose. The structural and pharmacological studies reveal a potential mechanism to reduce &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment by the &#956;OR, and hold promise for developing next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allenyl Alcohols by Cobalt(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential C&#8722;H Bond Addition to 1,3&#8208;Enynes and Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and stereoselective Co&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component synthesis of allenyl alcohols is reported. This method introduces two C&#8722;C &#963; bonds through C&#8722;H bond activation and sequential addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes and a wide range of aldehydes. A plausible mechanism and further transformations are disclosed.







Abstract
An efficient and stereoselective CoIII&#8208;catalyzed sequential C&#8722;H bond addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes and aldehydes is disclosed. This transformation represents the first example of sequential C&#8722;H bond additions to 1,3&#8208;enynes and a second coupling partner and provides the first example of preparing allenes by C&#8722;H bond addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes. A wide range of aldehydes, C&#8722;H bond substrates and 1,3&#8208;enynes with large substituents on the alkynes are effective substrates. The allenyl alcohol products can be further converted to dihydrofurans with high stereoselectivity either in situ or under Ag&#8208;mediated cyclization conditions. The allenyl silyl group can also be transferred to the adjacent alcohol by a Brook rearrangement. Moreover, a mechanism for the transformation is proposed supported by X&#8208;ray structural characterization of a cobaltacycle intermediate.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Active, Reversible, and Irreversible Covalent Inhibitors That Selectively Target the Catalytic Lysine of BCR&#8208;ABL Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine is reported. Amongst lead compounds, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent nanomolar inhibition against endogenous ABL kinase, with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets.







Abstract
Despite recent interests in developing lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors, no general approach is available to create such compounds. We report herein a general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine residue using key SuFEx and salicylaldehyde&#8208;based imine chemistries. We validated the strategy by successfully developing (irreversible and reversible) covalent inhibitors against BCR&#8208;ABL kinase. Our lead compounds showed high levels of selectivity in biochemical assays, exhibited nanomolar potency against endogenous ABL kinase in cellular assays, and were active against most drug&#8208;resistant ABL mutations. Among them, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent ABL inhibition with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets in K562 cells. Bioinformatics further suggested the generality of our strategy against the human kinome.

         <title>Enlightening the &#8220;Spirit Molecule&#8221;: Photomodulation of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor by a Light&#8208;Controllable N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) was made photoswitchable following an &#8220;azo&#8208;extension&#8221; approach on the indole moiety. A library of azo&#8208;DMTs was synthesized out of which 5&#8208;(4&#8208;MeO)&#8208;azo&#8208;DMT (Photo&#8208;DMT) acted as cis&#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221;.







Abstract
Classical psychedelics are a group of hallucinogens which trigger non&#8208;ordinary states of consciousness through activation of the 5&#8208;HT2A receptor (5&#8208;HT2AR) in the brain. However, the exact mechanism of how 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism alters perception remains elusive. When studying receptor signaling, tools which work at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the receptor are exceptionally useful. To create such a tool, we designed a set of photoswitchable ligands based on the classical psychedelic N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine (DMT). By incorporation of the DMT&#8208;indole ring into the photoswitchable system, we obtained red&#8208;shifted ligands which can be operated by visible light. Among these azo&#8208;DMTs, compound 2&#8201;h (&#8220;Photo&#8208;DMT&#8221;) stands out as its cis isomer exhibits DMT like activity while the trans isomer acts as weak partial agonist. Such a cis&#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5&#8208;HT2AR signaling.

Such a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain of Supramolecular Interactions in Single&#8208;Stacking Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strains of supramolecular interaction were explored, and revealed an odd&#8211;even effect in a series of single&#8208;stacking junctions, offering new insights into the supramolecular interaction from the molecular level.







Abstract
Supramolecular electronics provide opportunities to integrate molecular building blocks into electronic circuits, and investigations of the mechanical properties of the non&#8208;covalent interactions are necessary to understand the role of the assembly configuration in the electronic coupling among different assembly blocks. However, the mechanical characterization of supramolecular interactions remains experimentally challenging. We investigated the strain distribution of the supramolecular interactions through a series of single&#8208;stacking junctions. The alpha values exhibit a clear odd&#8208;even effect versus the numbers of thiophene rings. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that a larger rotational barrier of the single&#8208;stacking junctions with an even number of thiophene rings leads to limited torsional freedom and thus a smaller strain distribution. These results provide new insights into the control of supramolecular interactions by the design of the basic molecular building blocks.

         <title>Signal Transduction Strategies for Analyte Detection Using DNA&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various signal transduction strategies that are employed in chemical and biological sensing with DNA&#8208;based nanostructures are the focus of this Minireview. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these different methods are also discussed and the considerations that determine the ideal strategy for a given application are delineated.







Abstract
The use of DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as probes has led to significant advances in chemical and biological sensing, allowing the detection of analytes in complex media, the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the ability to diagnose diseases based on molecular signatures. The utility of these structures arises both from DNA's inherent ability to selectively recognize and bind a variety of chemical species and from the unique properties observed when DNA is restructured at the nanoscale. In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA&#8208;based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.

         <title>anti&#8208;Selective Borylstannylation of Alkynes with (o&#8208;Phenylenediaminato)borylstannanes by a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have achieved the first  anti  &#8208;borylstannylation of alkynes by using (  o  &#8208;phenylenediaminato)borylstannanes. This reaction afforded 1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;stannylalkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity by a radical mechanism. This  anti  &#8208;addition manner is in sharp contrast to the  syn  &#8208;selectivity obtained during transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylstannylation. The mild radical conditions enabled a broad substrate scope, and various types of aromatic and aliphatic alkynes were applicable. The origin of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity was elucidated by DFT calculation of the reaction mechanism. The application of the borylstannylation products to cross&#8208; or homocoupling reactions provided ready access to either triarylethenes or bisborylbutadienes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>There is a constant need for deuterium labelled products for multiple applications in life sciences and beyond. Here, a new class of heterogeneous catalysts is reported for practical deuterium incorporation in anilines, phenols, and heterocyclic substrates. The optimal material can be conveniently synthesised and allows for high deuterium incorporation using deuterium oxide as isotope source. This new catalyst has been fully characterised and successfully applied to the labelling of natural products as well as marketed drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Epoxidation and Acidic Epoxide Opening of Antibacterial and Antiplasmodial Chlorotonils Yield Highly Potent Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rise of antimicrobial resistance poses a severe threat to public health. The natural product chlorotonil was identified as a new antibiotic targeting multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens and Plasmodium falciparum. Although chlorotonil shows promising activities, the scaffold is highly lipophilic and displays potential biological instabilities. Therefore, we strived towards improving its pharmaceutical properties by semisynthesis. We demonstrated stereoselective epoxidation of chlorotonils and epoxide ring opening in moderate to good yields providing derivatives with significantly enhanced solubility. Furthermore, in vivo stability of the derivatives was improved while retaining their nanomolar activity against critical human pathogens (e.g. methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and P. falciparum). Intriguingly, we showed further superb activity for the frontrunner molecule in a mouse model of S. aureus infection.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Natural Products by a Pharmacophore&#8208;Oriented Semisynthesis Approach for the Discovery of Potential Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products possessing unique scaffolds may have antiviral activity but their complex structures hinder facile synthesis. A pharmacophore&#8208;oriented semisynthesis approach was applied to (&#8211;)&#8208;maoelactone A (  1  ) and oridonin (  2  ) for the discovery of anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 agents. The Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade (WRLC) reaction was developed to construct the unprecedented maoelactone&#8208;type scaffold during semisynthesis of  1  . Further mechanistic study suggested a concerted mechanism for Wolff rearrangement and a water&#8208;assisted stepwise process for lactonization. The WRLC reaction then enabled the creation of a novel family by assembly of the maoelactone&#8208;type scaffold and the pharmacophore of  2  , whereby one derivative inhibited SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication in HPA EpiC cells with a low EC50  value (19 &#177; 1 nM) and a high TI value (&gt;1000), both values better than those of remdesivir.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Chalcogen&#8208;Bonded Semiconducting Nanoribbons at Work in Lighting Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;bonded p&#8208;type semiconducting ribbons have been engineered through the self&#8208;assembly of tailored &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules. Theoretical studies of the electronic states showed the presence of a local charge density between Te and N atoms. Implementation of the ribbons as hole&#8208;transport layers in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells gave rise to devices with performances similar to those obtained with state&#8208;of&#8208;art semiconductors.







Abstract
This work describes the design and synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated telluro[3,2&#8208;&#946;][1]&#8208;tellurophene&#8208;based synthon that, embodying pyridyl and haloaryl chalcogen&#8208;bonding acceptors, self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons through chalcogen bonds. The ribbons &#960;&#8208;stack in a multi&#8208;layered architecture both in single crystals and thin films. Theoretical studies of the electronic states of chalcogen&#8208;bonded material showed the presence of a local charge density between Te and N atoms. OTFT&#8208;based charge transport measurements showed hole&#8208;transport properties for this material. Its integration as a p&#8208;type semiconductor in multi&#8208;layered CuI&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) led to a 10&#8208;fold increase in stability (38&#8197;h vs. 3&#8197;h) compared to single&#8208;layered devices. Finally, using the reference tellurotellurophene congener bearing a C&#8722;H group instead of the pyridyl N atom, a herringbone solid&#8208;state assembly is formed without charge transport features, resulting in LECs with poor stabilities (&lt;1&#8197;h).

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Monooxygenation of Phenols: Evidence for a Mononuclear Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic CuI complexes with different ligands (CH3CN, oDFB, NEt3) and counterions of varying coordination ability (BF4&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, Al(OC(CF3)3)4&#8722;) catalyze the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. Detailed mechanistic research shows that this reaction follows a mononuclear pathway, in contrast to the dinuclear mechanism of the enzyme tyrosinase.







Abstract
The CuI salts [Cu(CH3CN)4]PF and [Cu(oDFB)2]PF with the very weakly coordinating anion Al(OC(CF3)3)4&#8722; (PF) as well as [Cu(NEt3)2]PF comprising the unique, linear bis&#8208;triethylamine complex [Cu(NEt3)2]+ were synthesized and examined as catalysts for the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. The activities of these CuI salts towards monooxygenation of 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (DTBP&#8208;H) were compared to those of [Cu(CH3CN)4]X salts with &#8220;classic&#8221; anions (BF4&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, PF6&#8722;), revealing an anion effect on the activity of the catalyst and a ligand effect on the reaction rate. The reaction is drastically accelerated by employing CuII&#8208;semiquinone complexes as catalysts, indicating that formation of a CuII complex precedes the actual catalytic cycle. This result and other experimental observations show that with these systems the oxygenation of monophenols does not follow a dinuclear, but a mononuclear pathway analogous to that of topaquinone cofactor biosynthesis in amine oxidase.

         <title>Cooperative Palladium/Isothiourea Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal (3+2) Cycloaddition of Vinylcyclopropanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative palladium and isothiourea catalysis allows the formal (3+2) cycloaddition of vinylcyclopropanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters to generate functionalized cyclopentanes via an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediate with the addition of LiCl crucial to obtain high product diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A protocol for the enantioselective synthesis of substituted vinylcyclopentanes has been realised using cooperative palladium and isothiourea catalysis. Treatment of vinylcyclopropanes with Pd(PPh3)4 generates a zwitterionic &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate that intercepts a catalytically generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium species prepared from the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated para&#8208;nitrophenyl ester and the isothiourea (R)&#8208;BTM. Intermolecular formal (3+2) cycloaddition between these reactive intermediates generates functionalised cyclopentanes in generally good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 dr, 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 er), with the use of LiCl as an additive proving essential for optimal stereocontrol. To the best of our knowledge a dual transition metal/organocatalytic process involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediates has not been demonstrated previously.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of peri&#8208;Heptacene on a Metallic Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful on&#8208;surface synthesis of pristine peri&#8208;heptacene (7&#8208;PA) reveals, after thermal activation of a 4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrakis(3&#8208;methylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrene precursor on a Au(111) via surface&#8208;assisted oxidative ring&#8208;closure and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, an antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet ground state exhibiting singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling of 49&#8197;meV.







Abstract
The synthesis of long n&#8208;peri&#8208;acenes (n&#8208;PAs) is challenging as a result of their inherent open&#8208;shell radical character, which arises from the presence of parallel zigzag edges beyond a certain n value. They are considered as &#960;&#8208;electron model systems to study magnetism in graphene nanostructures; being potential candidates in the fabrication of optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface formation of the largest pristine member of the n&#8208;PA family, i.e. peri&#8208;heptacene (n=7, 7&#8208;PA), obtained on an Au(111) substrate under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. Our high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy investigations, complemented by theoretical simulations, provide insight into the chemical structure of this previously elusive compound. In addition, scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet ground state of 7&#8208;PA, exhibiting singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (Jeff) of 49&#8197;meV.

         <title>Solution&#8208;processed AIEgen NIR OLEDs with EQE Approaching 15&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acceptor core, obtained by fusing dithiafulvalene with benzothiadiazole, was utilized to construct near&#8208;infrared AIEgen luminophores, in which TBSMCN emitted at 820&#8197;nm in the solid state and featured a high quantum yield of 10.7&#8201;%. The doped and non&#8208;doped NIR OLEDs achieved excellent external quantum efficiencies of 14.3&#8201;% and 2.2&#8201;% peaking at 750 and 804&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens have attracted intensive attention considering their vast potential applications in areas like bioimaging, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and night&#8208;vision telecommunication. However, organic NIR luminogens with high solid quantum efficiencies are scarce, limiting their applications. Here, we reported an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, BSM, based on dithiafulvalene and benzothiadiazole, which could work as a strong acceptor to produce highly efficient NIR emitters with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. One of the AIEgens, TBSMCN emitted at 820&#8197;nm with a solid quantum yield of 10.7&#8201;%. When applied to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs, an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.4&#8201;% was achieved with a peak wavelength at 728&#8197;nm. Moreover, its non&#8208;doped device could achieve an extraordinary EQE of 2.2&#8201;% peaking at 804&#8197;nm. In the further optimized configuration, when an extra sensitizer was added to harvest triplet excitons, the EQE unprecedentedly soared up to 14.3&#8201;% with a peak wavelength of 750&#8197;nm.

         <title>Versatile Vibrational Energy Sensors for Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational energy transfer in proteins has been related to enzyme catalysis, energy dissipation and allosteric communication. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200648), Jens Bredenbeck and co&#8208;workers establish a broad palette of vibrational energy sensors. A variety of functionalities covers chemical and sterical diversity. Their comparable responsivity allows to choose a suitable non&#8208;canonical amino acid for each site, as exemplified for a showcase of an allosteric protein.

         <title>Expeditious Access to Morphinans by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benchmark chemical synthesis of codeine creates an opportunity to diversify essential opiate&#8208;medicine supply chains. The brevity of this approach derives from a double&#8208;Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot, while a subsequent photo&#8208;redox hydroamination protocol is deployed to provide a novel, atom&#8208;economical means for assembling the morphinan piperidine D&#8208;ring.







Abstract
Morphinans are essential medicines derived entirely from poppy supply chains rendered increasingly volatile by climate change. Here, we report a seven&#8208;step, asymmetric chemical synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;codeine from simple materials that requires a total combined reaction time of fewer than 24&#8197;hours. The efficiency of our approach arises from a double&#8208;Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot. A subsequent photo&#8208;redox hydroamination protocol provides a novel, atom&#8208;economical means for assembling the piperidine D&#8208;ring of codeine. Simple modifications to the closing stages of our sequence offer effective access to pharmacologically valuable derivatives of N&#8208;demethyl codeine. Our work highlights the capacity for contemporary, stand&#8208;alone chemical synthesis regimes to diversify access to essential opiate medicines.

         <title>Formation of LiF&#8208;rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase by Electrolyte Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is successfully constructed on LiCoO2 cathode by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at 1.7&#8197;V. LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration and Co dissolution during cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, demonstrating an excellent cyclability with high capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5C.







Abstract
The capacity of transition metal oxide cathode for Li&#8208;ion batteries can be further enhanced by increasing the charging potential. However, these high voltage cathodes suffer from fast capacity decay because the large volume change of cathode breaks the active materials and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), resulting in electrolyte penetration into broken active materials and continuous side reactions between cathode and electrolytes. Herein, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI was formed by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at a low potential of 1.7&#8197;V. By taking LiCoO2 as a model cathode, we demonstrate that the LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration at a high cut&#8208;off potential of 4.6&#8197;V. The LiCoO2 with LiF&#8208;rich CEI exhibited a capacity of 198&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5C and an enhanced capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles as compared to the LiF&#8208;free LiCoO2 with only 17.4&#8201;% of capacity retention.

         <title>Strong and Reversible Covalent Double Network Hydrogel Based on Force&#8208;Coupled Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A force&#8208;coupled enzymatic reaction was used to tune a strong covalent peptide linkage to create a reversible bond and engineer double network (DN) hydrogels that combine high mechanical strength and reversible mechanical recovery. The peptide ligase, sortase A (SrtA), can promote the proteolysis of peptides under force and re&#8208;ligation of peptides without force, allowing the sacrificial network in DN hydrogels to be ruptured and rebuilt reversibly.







Abstract
Biological load&#8208;bearing tissues are strong, tough, and recoverable under periodic mechanical loads. However, such features have rarely been achieved simultaneously in the same synthetic hydrogels. Here, we use a force&#8208;coupled enzymatic reaction to tune a strong covalent peptide linkage to a reversible bond. Based on this concept we engineered double network hydrogels that combine high mechanical strength and reversible mechanical recovery in the same hydrogels. Specifically, we found that a peptide ligase, sortase A, can promote the proteolysis of peptides under force. The peptide bond can be re&#8208;ligated by the same enzyme in the absence of force. This allows the sacrificial network in the double&#8208;network hydrogels to be ruptured and rebuilt reversibly. Our results demonstrate a general approach for precisely controlling the mechanical and dynamic properties of hydrogels at the molecular level.

         <title>Traceless Benzylic C&#8211;H Amination via Bifunctional N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H amination reactions provide the opportunity to streamline the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing organic small molecules. The impact of intermolecular C&#8211;H amination methods, however, is currently limited by typical requirement that the amine precursors bear activating groups, such as  N  &#8208;sulfonyl substituents, that are both challenging to remove and not useful synthetic handles for subsequent derivatization. Here, we introduce traceless nitrogen activation for C&#8211;H amination&#8212;which enables application of selective C&#8211;H amination chemistry to the preparation of diverse  N  &#8208;functionalized products&#8212;via sequential benzylic C&#8211;H  N  &#8208;aminopyridylation followed by Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N cross coupling with aryl boronic acids. Unlike many C&#8211;H amination reactions that provide access to protected amines, the current method installs an easily diversifiable synthetic handle that serves as a lynchpin for C&#8211;H amination, deaminative N&#8211;N functionalization sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Reaction Routes in Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Conversion of Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenolysis and hydrolysis of aryl ethers in the liquid phase are important reactions for accessing functionalized cyclic compounds from renewable feedstocks. On supported noble metals, hydrogenolysis is initiated by a hydrogen addition to the aromatic ring followed by C&#8211;O bond cleavage. In water, hydrolysis and hydrogenolysis proceed by partial hydrogenation of the aromatic ring prior to water or hydrogen insertion. The mechanisms are common for the studied metals, but the selectivity to hydrogenolysis increases in the order Pd &lt; Rh &lt; Ir &lt; Ru &#8776; Pt in decalin and water; the inverse was observed for the selectivity to hydrolysis in water. Hydrogenolysis selectivity correlates with the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption. Hydrogenolysis has the highest standard free energy of activation and a weak dependence on H  2  pressure, thus, the selectivity to hydrogenolysis is maximized by increasing temperature and decreasing H  2  pressure. Selectivity to C&#8211;O bond cleavage reaches &gt;95% in water and alkaline conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Actuation of Liquid Crystalline Elastomers at or Below Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are an emerging class of material actuators. LCE undergo macroscopic dimensional changes when subject to a stimulus. The large stimuli&#8208;response of LCE is associated with thermotropic disruption of order. Historically, comparatively high temperatures are required to disrupt orientation in LCE to achieve meaningful work output. Here, we introduce a materials chemistry to prepare LCE via thiol&#8208;Michael/thiol&#8208;ene reactions that actuate at or below ambient temperature. Alignment was imparted to the LCE by mechanical alignment and 3&#8208;D printing. The LCE materials detailed here achieve strains of 40% with a maximum deformation rate of 6.5%&#730;C  &#8208;1  . The functional utility of the tunability of the thermotropic response of these materials is illustrated in reconfiguration triggered via body heat and sequential actuation of a multi&#8208;material element.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Turn&#8208;on Fluorescence Mechanism of a Fluorescein&#8208;Based Probe in GABAA Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>GABAA (&#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid type A) receptors are ligand&#8208;gated ion channels mediating fast inhibitory transmission in the mammalian brain. Here we report the molecular and electronic mechanism governing the turn&#8208;on emission of a fluorescein&#8208;based imaging probe able to target the human GABAA receptor. Multiscale calculations evidence a drastic conformational change of the probe from folded in solution to extended upon binding to the receptor. Intramolecular &#960;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions present in the folded probe are responsible for quenching fluorescence in solution. In contrast, unfolding within the GABAA receptor changes the nature of the bright excited state triggering emission. Remarkably, this turn&#8208;on effect only manifests for the dianionic prototropic form of the imaging probe, which is found to be the strongest binder to the GABAA receptor. This study is expected to assist the design of new photoactivatable screening tools for allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Breakthroughs in P4 Chemistry: Towards Practical, Direct Transformations into P1 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For several decades, academic researchers have been intensively studying the chemistry of white phosphorus (P  4  ) in the hope of developing direct methods for its transformation into useful P&#8208;containing products. This would bypass the hazardous, multistep procedures currently relied on by industry. However, while academically interesting P  4  activation reactions have become well established, their elaboration into useful, general synthetic procedures has remained out of reach. Very recently, however, a series of independent reports has begun to change this state of affairs. Each shows how relatively simple and practical synthetic methods can be used to access academically or industrially relevant P  1  compounds from P  4  directly, in &#8216;one pot&#8217; or even in a catalytic fashion. These reports mark a step change in the field of P  4  chemistry, and suggest its possible transition from an area of largely academic interest to one with the promise of true synthetic relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;vivo production of diverse &#946;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The wide range of moieties installed in ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) suggests largely untapped potential for protein engineering. However, many RiPP maturases recognize target peptide precursors through an N&#8208;terminal leader sequence that is challenging to adapt to proteins. We have recently reported a family of enzymes that splice XYG sites in RiPPs to install &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Backbone modifications influence diverse protein properties, yet the toolkit to install &#946;&#8208;amino acids is limited. Here we report their leader&#8208;independent incorporation into proteins in  E. coli  . Integrating an 11&#8208;residue splice tag into six different proteins permitted the site&#8208;selective introduction of &#946;&#8208;residues  in vivo  . The motif fusion at C&#8208;, N&#8208;terminal, and internal positions yielded various &#946;&#8208;residues. Our approach complements the few existing methods to introduce &#946;&#8208;amino acids or ketone&#8208;bearing moieties, suggesting diverse applications in chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pyridylic C&#8211;H Functionalization by Photocatalytic Radical Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An  efficient  pyridylic C(sp  3  )  &#8211;H functionalization has been developed through photocatalytic radical&#8208;mediated  fluoroalkylation  or cascade reactions. This method is enabled by the reversible formation of alkylidene dihydropyridine intermediates via the facile enolate formation of C4&#8208;alkyl  N  &#8208;amidopyridinium salts in the absence of an external base, thereby establishing the conditions necessary for subsequent intermolecular radical trapping. Rapid structural diversification of the pyridylic site can be achieved through photocatalytic multicomponent cascade reactions involving alkene trifluoromethylation, SO  2  &#8208;reincorporation, and sulfonyl radical addition. This operationally simple method features a broad substrate scope and high chemoselectivity and offers a unique approach for the rational modification of the heterobenzylic C&#8211;H bonds of pyridines and quinolines with uniform site&#8208;selective control. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Disorder&#8208;order Conversion&#8208;induced Enhancement of Thermal Stability of Pyroxene NIR Phosphors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The minimization of thermal quenching, which leads to luminescence loss at high temperatures, is one of the most important research topics for near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting phosphors. In the present work, the properties of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting Ca(Sc,Mg)(Al, Si)O  6  :Cr  3+  phosphor with a pyroxene&#8208;type structure under blue light excitation were investigated. The CaScAlSiO  6  :Cr  3+  end member of Ca(Sc,Mg)(Al,Si)O  6  :Cr  3+  phosphor led to broadband emission at a full&#8208;width half maximum of 215 nm, whereas the CaMgSi  2  O  6  :Cr  3+  end member exhibited high thermal stability at 150&#176;C with an intensity of 88.4% of that at room temperature. The structural analysis and DFT calculations revealed that the absence of soft conformations and local space confinement contributed to high structural rigidity and weakened the thermal quenching effect. Moreover, NIR&#8208;LEDs were fabricated using the investigated pyroxene phosphors to demonstrate the potential applications of NIR light for cracks and flaws detection inside structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unimolecular Nanoparticles toward more Precise Regulations of Self&#8208;assembled Superlattices in Soft Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process opens up a great potential for the construction of nanostructural superlattices. Precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled superlattices, however, remains a challenge. Even the primary molecules are precise, the supramolecular motifs (or secondary building blocks) can vary dramatically. In the present work, we propose the concept of unimolecular nanoparticles (UMNPs). It acts as the supramolecular motif and directly packs into the superlattices. A highly branched giant molecule is presented. We systematically explore its conformations and superlattice of this giant molecule. Moreover, intriguing complex phases are discovered when blending this UMNP with other conventional giant molecules. These binary mixtures provide direct evidence to support our previously proposed self&#8208;sorting process in the self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;. The concept of UMNPs offers a unique approach toward more precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled superlattices in soft matter.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Templated &#947;&#8208;Keggin Alkyltin&#8208;Oxo Cluster: Electronic Structure and Optical Limiting Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most representative polyoxometalate (POM) structures, Keggin clusters have attracted considerable attention. Nevertheless, the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;templated Keggin structure has not been reported to date. In this work, for the first time, Ag atom was successfully incorporated to template the formation of &#947;&#8208;Keggin alkytin&#8208;oxo cluster. Moreover, the central Ag atom has brought significant heavy atom effect, showing important influence on the electronic structure and optical property. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Ag atom affects the frontier molecular orbitals and excited states of the  AgSn12  cluster, and also the process of electron transfer. The solid structure of the  AgSn12  cluster exhibits significant third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and excellent optical limiting effect has been experimentally verified. The success of this work opens a way for the construction and optical properties modulation of noble metal templated Keggin structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Pyrenophanes: Intense Circularly Polarized&#160;Luminescence Based on a D2 Symmetry Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of  D  2  &#8208;symmetric macrocycles composed of alternately linked pyrene and binaphthyl moieties (binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes) have been synthesized. Among them, a pyrenophane possessing ether linkers at the 2,7&#8208;positions of the pyrenes exhibited intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a |  g  lum  | value of 0.053. This value is by far the highest for excimers and was not sensitive to temperature, solvent, or concentration. The CPL originated from a twisting pyrene excimer, with the (  R  )&#8208;binaphthyl moieties producing a left&#8208;handed twist excimer, which exhibited (&#8211;)&#8208;CPL. The electric and magnetic transition dipole moments are perfectly parallel, which is the best relationship for strong CPL.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Synthesis of 2&#8208;Benzazepine Derivatives via Tunable Cyclization and 1,4&#8208;Acyl Transfer Triggered by Amide N&#8208;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;controlled tunable cyclization/cross&#8208;couplings was developed for the divergent synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;benzazepine frameworks. The bidentate ligand facilitates the formation of 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;5&#8208;ones and benzo[c]pyrano[2,3&#8208;e]azepines. The tridentate ligand promotes the formation of 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;3&#8208;ones.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;directed divergent synthesis can transform common starting materials into distinct molecular scaffolds by simple tuning different ligands. This strategy enables the rapid construction of structurally rich collection of small molecules for biological evaluation and reveals novel modes of catalytic transformation, representing one of the most sought&#8208;after challenges in synthetic chemistry. We herein report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;controlled tunable cyclization/cross&#8208;couplings for the divergent synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;benzazepine frameworks. The bidentate ligand facilitates the nucleophilic addition of the aryl halides to the amide carbonyl, followed by 1,4&#8208;acyl transfer and cross&#8208;coupling to obtain 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;5&#8208;ones and benzo[c]pyrano[2,3&#8208;e]azepines. The tridentate ligand promotes the selective 7&#8208;endo cyclization/cross&#8208;coupling to access to 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The protocol operates under mild reaction conditions with divergent cyclization patterns that can be easily modulated through the ligand backbone.

     alt="Ni-Catalyzed Divergent Synthesis of 2-Benzazepine Derivatives via Tunable Cyclization and 1,4-Acyl Transfer Triggered by Amide N-C Bond Cleavage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni-catalyzed ligand-controlled tunable cyclization/cross-couplings was developed for the divergent synthesis of pharmacologically important 2-benzazepine frameworks. The bidentate ligand facilitates the formation of 2-benzazepin-5-ones and benzo[c]pyrano[2,3-e]azepines. The tridentate ligand promotes the formation of 2-benzazepin-3-ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ligand-directed divergent synthesis can transform common starting materials into distinct molecular scaffolds by simple tuning different ligands. This strategy enables the rapid construction of structurally rich collection of small molecules for biological evaluation and reveals novel modes of catalytic transformation, representing one of the most sought-after challenges in synthetic chemistry. We herein report a Ni-catalyzed ligand-controlled tunable cyclization/cross-couplings for the divergent synthesis of pharmacologically important 2-benzazepine frameworks. The bidentate ligand facilitates the nucleophilic addition of the aryl halides to the amide carbonyl, followed by 1,4-acyl transfer and cross-coupling to obtain 2-benzazepin-5-ones and benzo[c]pyrano[2,3-e]azepines. The tridentate ligand promotes the selective 7-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; cyclization/cross-coupling to access to 2-benzazepin-3-ones. The protocol operates under mild reaction conditions with divergent cyclization patterns that can be easily modulated through the ligand backbone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Nonflammable Ether Electrolytes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Chlorine Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte of LiFSI/1.6Cl&#8208;DEE/3TTE with chlorinated&#8208;DEE as the base solvent has excellent flame&#8208;retarding properties, intrinsic anti&#8208;oxidation capabilities and forms interphases riched in LiF and LiCl, which improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages.







Abstract
The issues of inherent low anodic stability and high flammability hinder the deployment of the ether&#8208;based electrolytes in practical high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. Here, we report a rationally designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte with chlorine functionality on ether molecular structure to address these critical challenges. The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates a high Li Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% and a high capacity retention &gt;88&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes at an ultrahigh cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V (stable even up to 4.7&#8197;V). The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte not only greatly improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages with interphases riched in LiF and LiCl, but possesses the intrinsic nonflammable safety feature owing to the flame&#8208;retarding ability of chlorine functional groups. This study offers a new approach to enable ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high energy density, long&#8208;life and safe Li metal batteries.

         <title>Repeatedly Regenerating Mechanically Robust Polymer Brushes from Persistent Initiator Coating (PIC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic&#8208;hybrid persistent initiator coating (PIC) was fabricated by the introduction of initiator into a mechanically robust sol&#8208;gel layer for surface initiated polymerization. This strategy enables polymerization repeatedly when polymer brushes on the surface were worn off and both PIC and surface grafted brushes show excellent anti&#8208;abrasive property compared to conventional brushes.







Abstract
In this study, a novel surface initiated polymerization (SIP) method was developed from organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid persistent initiator coating (PIC) that embeds initiator molecules into inorganic silica sol&#8208;gel layer. Comparing with traditional silane initiator surface that prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, the PIC can effectively improve the mechanical stability of initiator that was able to endure ten&#8208;thousand times of friction cycles. Besides, it allows polymer grafting from sub&#8208;surface and so the grafted brushes, poly 3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (pSPMA) on the PIC were also much more wear&#8208;resisting than those prepared by the traditional ways. More importantly, the PIC could still trigger new polymerization reaction when the grafted brushes were worn off. In addition, the PIC is universal and can be covered on different substrates including glass, metals and plastics, etc. to realize functionalization of these materials. The approach may pave technological way for the application of surface grafted polymer brushes.

         <title>Diastereoselective Transfer of Tri(di)fluoroacetylsilanes&#8208;Derived Carbenes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cis&#8208;selective cyclopropanation reaction of terminal alkenes with tri(di)fluoroacetylsilanes was developed for the synthesis of cyclopropanol derivatives. A combination of experimental and computational studies identified triplet carbenes as the key intermediates in this transformation. The gram scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization demonstrated the synthetic potential of this strategy.







Abstract
Stereoselective cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes is usually achieved by metal complexes via singlet&#8208;metal&#8208;carbene intermediates. However, previous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes with acylsilanes afforded low diastereoselectivity. Herein, we report the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation reaction of terminal alkenes with trifluoroacetylsilanes and difluoroacetylsilanes. Both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are suitable substrates for the highly cis&#8208;selective [2+1] cyclization reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies identified triplet carbenes as being key intermediates in this transformation. The gram scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization demonstrated the synthetic potential of this strategy.

         <title>Alteration of the Catalytic Reaction Trajectory of a Vicinal Oxygen Chelate Enzyme by Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of ChaP, a novel vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme, afforded bifunctional enzymes designated as &#8220;ChaP variants&#8221;, which catalyzed regioselective intradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone cleavage and o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylation of the ring&#8208;opened molecules. This activity expands the VOC catalytic repertoire to bring us closer to artificial VOC enzymes of broad biotechnological significance.







Abstract
The vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme superfamily catalyzes a highly diverse set of reactions with the mechanism characterized by the bidentate coordination of vicinal oxygen atoms to metal ion centers, but there remains a lack of a platform to steer the reaction trajectories, especially for o&#8208;quinone metabolizing pathways. Herein, we present the directed&#8208;evolution&#8208;enabled bifunctional turnover of ChaP, which is a homotetramer and represents an unprecedented VOC enzyme class. Unlike the ChaP catalysis of extradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone cleavage and concomitant &#945;&#8208;keto acid decarboxylation, a group of ChaP variants (CVs) catalyze intradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone deconstruction and CO2 liberation from the resulting o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid scaffolds with high regioselectivity. Enzyme crystal structures, labeling experiments and computational simulations corroborated that the D49L mutation allows the metal ion to change its coordination with the tyrosine phenoxy atoms in different monomers, thereby altering the reaction trajectory with the regiospecificity further improved by the follow&#8208;up replacement of the Y92 residue with any of alanine, glycine, threonine, and serine. The study highlights the unpredicted catalytic versatility and enzymatic plasticity of VOC enzymes with biotechnological significance.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer Driven Enantioselective Minisci Reaction of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective Minisci reaction between pyridines and prochiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals has been developed. Hydrogen atom transfer is used to generate the latter from simple alcohols and the reaction formally constitutes the couple of two C&#8722;H bonds to form a new C&#8722;C bond in a process that is highly enantioselective and regioselective. Computational studies provide insight into the origins of selectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective Minisci reactions have recently been developed but all instances so far utilize &#945;&#8208;amino radical coupling partners. We report a substantial evolution of the enantioselective Minisci reaction that enables &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals to be used, providing valuable enantioenriched secondary alcohol products. This is achieved through the direct oxidative coupling of two C&#8722;H bonds on simple alcohol and pyridine partners through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;driven approach: a challenging process to achieve due to the numerous side reactions that can occur. Our approach is highly regioselective as well as highly enantioselective. Dicumyl peroxide, upon irradiation with 390&#8197;nm light, serves as both HAT reagent and oxidant whilst selectivity is controlled by use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst.

     alt="Hydrogen Atom Transfer Driven Enantioselective Minisci Reaction of Alcohols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enantioselective Minisci reaction between pyridines and prochiral &#945;-hydroxy radicals has been developed. Hydrogen atom transfer is used to generate the latter from simple alcohols and the reaction formally constitutes the couple of two C&#8722;H bonds to form a new C&#8722;C bond in a process that is highly enantioselective and regioselective. Computational studies provide insight into the origins of selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic enantioselective Minisci reactions have recently been developed but all instances so far utilize &#945;-amino radical coupling partners. We report a substantial evolution of the enantioselective Minisci reaction that enables &#945;-hydroxy radicals to be used, providing valuable enantioenriched secondary alcohol products. This is achieved through the direct oxidative coupling of two C&#8722;H bonds on simple alcohol and pyridine partners through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-driven approach: a challenging process to achieve due to the numerous side reactions that can occur. Our approach is highly regioselective as well as highly enantioselective. Dicumyl peroxide, upon irradiation with 390&#8197;nm light, serves as both HAT reagent and oxidant whilst selectivity is controlled by use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. Computational and experimental evidence provide mechanistic insight as to the origin of selectivity, revealing a stereodetermining deprotonation step distinct from the analogous reaction of amide-containing substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Selective Monitoring of Subcellular Enzyme Dynamics in Response to Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanoplatform was constructed for in situ imaging of the subcellular enzyme dynamics in response to near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT). With this versatile nanodevice, mitochondrial accumulation of specific enzymes was visualized in response to the increased concentration of reactive oxygen species during PDT.







Abstract
Tracking spatial and temporal dynamics of bioactive molecules such as enzymes responding to therapeutic treatment is highly important for understanding of the related functions. However, in situ molecular imaging at subcellular level during photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been hampered by the limitations of existing methods. Herein, we present a multifunctional nanoplatform (termed as UR&#8208;HAPT) that is able to simultaneously monitor subcellular dynamics of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) during the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated PDT. UR&#8208;HAPT was constructed by the combination of an upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;based PDT design and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting strategy with an APE1&#8208;responsive DNA reporter. Benefiting from the gain&#8208;of&#8208;function approach, activatable mitochondrial accumulation of APE1 in response to the oxidative stress was observed during the NIR light&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted PDT process. We envision that this nanoplatform can be applicable to screen and evaluate potential enzyme inhibitors to improve the PDT efficacy.

         <title>Electronic Structure Changes of an Aromatic Amine Photoacid along the F&#246;rster Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic structural changes along the F&#246;rster cycle of an aromatic amine photoacid are monitored with time&#8208;resolved nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy, providing key insight into the factors responsible for the photoacidity properties.







Abstract
Photoacids show a strong increase in acidity in the first electronic excited state, enabling real&#8208;time studies of proton transfer in acid&#8208;base reactions, proton transport in energy storage devices and biomolecular sensor protein systems. Several explanations have been proposed for what determines photoacidity, ranging from variations in solvation free energy to changes in electronic structure occurring along the four stages of the F&#246;rster cycle. Here we use picosecond nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy to monitor the electronic structure changes of the proton donating group in a protonated aromatic amine photoacid in solution upon photoexcitation and subsequent proton transfer dynamics. Probing core&#8208;to&#8208;valence transitions locally at the amine functional group and with orbital specificity, we clearly reveal pronounced electronic structure, dipole moment and energetic changes on the conjugate photobase side. This result paves the way for a detailed electronic structural characterization of the photoacidity phenomenon.

         <title>Computational Identification and Experimental Demonstration of High&#8208;Performance Methane Sorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising MOFs were identified computationally and experimentally demonstrate remarkable methane uptake that outperforms known benchmarks both volumetrically and gravimetrically. Advanced set of interatomic potentials that explicitly accounts for the presence of coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) in MOFs were used to identify the high&#8208;capacity MOFs that were previously overlooked due to the limitation of the general interatomic potentials.







Abstract
Remarkable methane uptake is demonstrated experimentally in three metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) identified by computational screening: UTSA&#8208;76, UMCM&#8208;152 and DUT&#8208;23&#8208;Cu. These MOFs outperform the benchmark sorbent, HKUST&#8208;1, both volumetrically and gravimetrically, under a pressure swing of 80 to 5&#8197;bar at 298&#8197;K. Although high uptake at elevated pressure is critical for achieving this performance, a low density of high&#8208;affinity sites (coordinatively unsaturated metal centers) also contributes to a more complete release of stored gas at low pressure. The identification of these MOFs facilitates the efficient storage of natural gas via adsorption and provides further evidence of the utility of computational screening in identifying overlooked sorbents.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes in Water: Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Stereoregular Telechelic Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization of phenylacetylenes in water was achieved by the development of a water&#8208;soluble rhodium&#8208;based multicomponent catalytic system. The obtained water&#8208;soluble polymers have high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The present polymerization method enables control of molecular weights of the polymers and functionalization of both polymer chain ends and the synthesis of novel block copolymers in water.







Abstract
Well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of water&#8208;soluble phenylacetylene derivatives in water was achieved for the first time using a multicomponent catalytic system consisting of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, an aryl boronic acid, diphenylacetylene having carboxy groups, a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, and a water&#8208;soluble triphenylphosphine. This catalytic system enables a direct synthesis of various water&#8208;soluble cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s having a narrow molecular weight distribution, the molecular weight of which can be controlled by the initial feed ratio of the monomer to the catalyst. Moreover, the syntheses of water&#8208;soluble telechelic poly(phenylacetylene)s having various functional groups at both chain ends as well as a water&#8208;soluble block copolymer were achieved.

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Couples from Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient recycling of catalyst&#8208;solvent couples was showcased in enantioselective Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions that were run in highly Lewis basic environments in which there is a greater risk of metal leaching. The success is attributed to a bioinspired approach to heterogenize microhydrated chiral Lewis acids within appropriate hydrophobic cavities, thereby decreasing catalyst deactivation and suppressing metal leaching.







Abstract
Bioinspired supramolecular architectures were used to compartmentalize highly charged aqua scandium ions into chiral hydrophobic scaffolds for Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions. Recycling without significant loss in catalytic performance is a formidable task, especially for Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. This is because Lewis basic impurities derived from starting materials, products, and water are highly competitive ligands for both substrate binding and metal complexation, thus poisoning the Lewis acids and leading to their leaching. Even when basic aniline is used, the architecture allowed for effective suppression of Sc3+ leaching and for reuse of solvent&#8208;catalyst couples in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions without deactivation. Application to asymmetric thia&#8208;Michael addition and hydroxymethylation was also demonstrated. The successful recycling in highly Lewis basic environments underpins the exceptionally high robustness of the chiral Lewis acid catalyst.

         <title>(Hetero)aryl&#8208;SVI Fluorides: Synthetic Development and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of methods that exploit the synthesis of (hetero)arylsulfur(VI) fluorides is steadily growing due to their potential in organic synthesis. This Minireview covers the synthesis of arylsulfur(VI) fluorides from levels 2 to 5 of fluorination, the substrate scope, mechanisms, and the further applicability of these fluorinated compounds.







Abstract
(Hetero)arylsulfur compounds where the S atom is in the oxidation state VI represent a large percentage of the molecular functionalities present in organic chemistry. More specifically, (hetero)aryl&#8208;SVI fluorides have recently received enormous attention because of their potential as chemical biology probes, as a result of their reactivity in a simple, modular, and efficient manner. Whereas the synthesis and application of the level&#8197;1 fluorination at SVI atoms (sulfonyl and sulfonimidoyl fluorides) have been widely studied and reviewed, the synthetic strategies towards higher levels of fluorination (levels&#8197;2 to 5) are somewhat more limited. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in the synthesis of highly fluorinated aryl&#8208;SVI compounds at all levels, discussing synthetic strategies, reactivity, the advantages and disadvantages of the synthetic procedures, the proposed mechanisms, and the potential upcoming opportunities.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Management for High&#8208;Temperature Mesoporous SnO2 Electron Transport Layers in Printable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies (OVs) were managed by the lattice Mg and the interstitial Mg which modulated the formation and ionization of OVs for self&#8208;doping in SnO2. OV management optimized the capability of high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO2 to serve as well&#8208;performed ETLs for printable PSCs with efficiency enhanced from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.







Abstract
The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed to the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO2 ETL (mp&#8208;SnO2) brings poor device performance. Herein, we report the application of mp&#8208;SnO2 for efficient printable PSCs via oxygen vacancy (OV) management by introducing magnesium (Mg) into the paste. We find that high&#8208;temperature annealing suppresses self&#8208;doping of SnO2 by reducing OVs. The introduced Mg occupies both the Sn site and interstitial site of SnO2 and promotes the formation of OVs. Lattice Mg tends to induce neutral OVs and interstitial Mg could promote the ionization of neutral OVs for self&#8208;doping. The synergy effect on OVs increases the carrier density and upshifts the Fermi level energy of mp&#8208;SnO2, ensuring its capability as the well&#8208;performed ETL with trap&#8208;less charge transport and suppressed surface recombination for dramatic improved device PCE from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.

         <title>Asymmetric Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Racemic Allylic Alcohols for the Synthesis of Chiral Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic allylic alcohols are converted into chiral amino acid derivatives via asymmetric hydroalkylation enabled by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggested that a single ruthenium chiral catalyst controls the stereoselectivity of two remote chiral centers through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation and a diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols has been developed for the synthesis of chiral amino acid derivatives with two remote chiral centers by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. The stereoselectivities are controlled by a single chiral Ru catalyst via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process and an interesting diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product. The method could be used for the synthesis of several types of biologically important molecules, including stereodivergent synthesis of chiral pyrrolidine derivatives.

         <title>Electronic Regulation of Nickel Single Atoms by Confined Nickel Nanoparticles for Energy&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;nanoparticle catalyst was developed. With electron donation from the Ni nanoparticle to single atoms via a carbon network, the catalyst achieves a high CO current density of 310&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V with an overall energy efficiency of 57&#8201;% for electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of atomically dispersed active sites is promising to boost catalytic activity but is challenging to achieve. Here we show a cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;nanoparticle catalyst (NiSA/NP) prepared via direct solid&#8208;state pyrolysis, where Ni nanoparticles donate electrons to Ni(i)&#8722;N&#8722;C sites via a network of carbon nanotubes, achieving a high CO current density of 346&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs RHE in an alkaline flow cell. When coupled with a NiFe&#8208;based anode in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrolyzer, the catalyst delivers an industrially relevant CO current density of 310&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V, corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 57&#8201;%. The superior CO2 electroreduction performance is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of key intermediate COOH* on the electron&#8208;rich Ni single atoms, as well as a high density of active sites.

         <title>Sustainable Afterglow Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emission Materials Generated Using Natural Phenolics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable organic afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long lifetime is a particularly attractive phenomenon but remains difficult to achieve. Here, we prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime up to 934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from natural phenolics has seldom been reported yet this is essential for the development of sustainable afterglow RTP materials. With this research, we have prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime of up to &#8776;934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix. Theoretical simulations indicate that the restricted carbonyl moieties of the GA and H&#8208;type aggregates of GA in a SA matrix promoted the spin orbit coupling (SOC) of GA and induced afterglow emission. Moreover, afterglow RTP emission could be produced by embedding different types of natural phenolics such as, tannic acid, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid into Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked networks of SA. As an illustration of potential applications, GA@SA was used to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeit afterglow clothing and paper. This work provides an innovative method for the activation of long&#8208;lived afterglow RTP from sustainable phenolics.

         <title>Discrete, Cationic Palladium(II)&#8208;Oxo Clusters via f&#8208;Metal Ion Incorporation and their Macrocyclic Host&#8208;Guest Interactions with Sulfonatocalixarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The first cationic palladium(II)&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs) containing f&#8208;metal ions, [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=CeIV, ThIV), have been structurally characterized and utilized as electrocatalysts. These POCs exhibit host&#8208;guest interactions with 4&#8208;sulfocalix[n]arenes (n=4, 6, 8), resulting in the first examples of discrete, enthalpically&#8208;driven supramolecular assemblies between calixarene&#8208;based macrocycles and large metal&#8208;oxo clusters.







Abstract
We report on the discovery of the first two examples of cationic palladium(II)&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs) containing f&#8208;metal ions, [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=CeIV, ThIV), and their physicochemical characterization in the solid state, in solution and in the gas phase. The molecular structure of the two novel POCs comprises an octahedral {Pd6O12}12&#8722; core that is capped by eight MIV ions, resulting in a cationic, cubic assembly {Pd6O12MIV8}20+, which is coordinated by a total of 16 terminal dimethylarsinate and eight water ligands, resulting in the mixed PdII&#8208;CeIV/ThIV oxo&#8208;clusters [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=Ce, Pd6Ce8; Th, Pd6Th8). We have also studied the formation of host&#8208;guest inclusion complexes of Pd6Ce8 and Pd6Th8 with anionic 4&#8208;sulfocalix[n]arenes (n=4, 6, 8), resulting in the first examples of discrete, enthalpically&#8208;driven supramolecular assemblies between large metal&#8208;oxo clusters and calixarene&#8208;based macrocycles. The POCs were also found to be useful as pre&#8208;catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;reduction and HCOOH&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Dendrite Issues for Zinc Anodes in a Flexible Cell Configuration for Zinc&#8208;Based Wearable Energy&#8208;Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most studies and optimizations of Zn anodes for batteries are based on a planar working mode, ignoring the flexible modes needed for wearable devices. Herein, the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curved areas and the correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells are studied. Ideal cell configurations are shown to be hydrogel electrolytes with good mechanical properties and high adhesivity.







Abstract
A key application of aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;based batteries (RZBs) is flexible and wearable energy storage devices (FESDs). Current studies and optimizations of Zn anodes have not considered the special flexible working modes needed. In this study, we present the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curve areas of flexible anodes. The correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells is proposed. The interface contact of hydrogel electrolytes when working in a bending mode is another key factor affecting cell lifespan. After detailed analysis, the ideal cell configuration is shown to be hydrogel electrolytes with suitable chemistry, satisfactory mechanical properties, and high adhesivity. Thus a water in salt (WIS) hydrogel is proposed that demonstrates a highly stable cell performance. This work provides a new perspective in Zn anode research for the development of FESDs.

         <title>Direct Affinity Purification of Long&#8208;Acting PASylated Proteins with Therapeutic Potential Using L&#8208;Prolinamide for Mild Elution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PASylation of pharmacologically active proteins or peptides drastically expands their hydrodynamic volume and, thus, retards renal filtration, which results in prolonged in vivo half&#8208;life. We have now developed an antibody&#8208;based affinity chromatography that permits the one&#8208;step purification of PASylated molecules in the native state using L&#8208;prolinamide as mild elution reagent.







Abstract
Both insufficient plasma half&#8208;life (circulation for only few hours or less) and laborious downstream purification can be bottleneck for biological drug development. We report a novel strategy for the efficient and gentle affinity purification of pharmacologically relevant proteins modified by PASylation for prolonged action in vivo. We previously described antibodies specific for Pro/Ala&#8208;rich sequences (PAS) covering a range of binding characteristics. Our present approach relies on a chromatography matrix functionalized with a low&#8208;affinity PAS&#8208;specific antibody Fab fragment for specific adsorption of the PASylated protein from a macromolecular mixture. With the complete absence of hydrophobic/aromatic or ionic groups in the PAS sequence epitope, binding is mediated by Van der Waals contacts and distinct hydrogen bonds only. Surprisingly, selective competitive elution is achieved by application of the highly soluble and biologically inactive imino acid derivative L&#8208;prolinamide. Based on the specific but strongly dynamic biomolecular interaction, our procedure allows the direct one&#8208;step purification of PASylated proteins from a cell extract or culture supernatant while avoiding harsh elution conditions as they are often needed for conventional affinity chromatography.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Activatable Phototheranostic Probe for Biomarker&#8208;Regulated Photodynamic and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe is developed to turn on its near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signal for real&#8208;time imaging. Additionally, the probe can activate photodynamic therapy in response to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase in the tumor periphery and switch to photothermal therapy triggered by nitroreductase in the hypoxic tumor core.







Abstract
Activatable phototheranostics holds promise for precision cancer treatment owing to the &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signals and therapeutic effects. However, most activatable phototheranostic probes only possess photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photothermal therapy (PTT), which suffer from poor therapeutic efficacy due to deficient cellular oxygen and complex tumor microenvironment. We herein report a dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe that activates near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) signals in tumor, triggers PDT in response to a tumor&#8208;periphery biomarker, and switches from PDT to PTT upon detecting a tumor&#8208;core&#8208;hypoxia biomarker. This PDT&#8208;PTT auto&#8208;regulated probe exhibits complete tumor ablation under the photoirradiation of a single laser source by producing cytotoxic singlet oxygen at the tumor periphery and generating hyperthermia at tumor&#8208;core where is too hypoxic for PDT. This dual&#8208;locked probe represents a promising molecular design approach toward precise cancer phototheranostics.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activated, Chemiluminescent Siderophore&#8208;Dioxetane Probes Enable the Selective and Highly Sensitive Detection of Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive diagnosis is crucial for the successful treatment of bacterial infections. The conjugation of bacteria&#8208;specific, uptake&#8208;enhancing siderophore vectors with enzyme&#8208;inducible chemiluminescent dioxetanes enabled the broad&#8208;spectrum detection of &#8220;ESKAPE&#8221; pathogens. The probes displayed a high sensitivity in human plasma and also detected intracellular Gram&#8208;positive and &#8208;negative bacteria.







Abstract
The sensitive detection of bacterial infections is a prerequisite for their successful treatment. The use of a chemiluminescent readout was so far hampered by an insufficient probe enrichment at the pathogens. We coupled siderophore moieties, that harness the unique iron transport system of bacteria, with enzyme&#8208;activatable dioxetanes and obtained seven trifunctional probes with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios (S/B=426&#8208;859). Conjugates with efficient iron transport capability into bacteria were identified through a growth recovery assay. All ESKAPE pathogens were labelled brightly by desferrioxamine conjugates, while catechols were weaker due to self&#8208;quenching. Bacteria could also be detected inside lung epithelial cells. The best probe 8 detected 9.1&#215;103&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 of S. aureus and 5.0&#215;104&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 of P. aeruginosa, while the analogous fluorescent probe 10 was 205&#8211;305fold less sensitive. This qualifies siderophore dioxetane probes for the selective and sensitive detection of bacteria.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity of a Hydrido&#8208; and Imido&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear Ytterbium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex (2) was synthesized via the reaction of an ytterbium(II) hydrido complex (1) with Me3SiN3. This unusual product represents the first example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands. DFT calculations indicated that the N2 release from Me3SiN3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable because of the cooperative effects of the two metal centers.







Abstract
The trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido and imido complexes are of versatile reactivity, and many such complexes have been synthesized. However, no example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands has been reported. Herein, we report the first rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands, namely a hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex. The complex was synthesized via an unprecedented redox reaction of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido complex with azido compound. DFT calculation indicated that the N2 release from azido compound in the presence of ytterbium(II) is a kinetically facile process because of the cooperative effects of the two metal centers. The reactivity of the hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex was also explored, which showed the redox, addition and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactivities.

         <title>Minimizing the Reorganization Energy of Cobalt Redox Mediators Maximizes Charge Transfer Rates from Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;induced charge separation is at the very heart of many solar harvesting technologies. The reduction of energetic barriers to charge separation and transfer increases the rate of separation and the overall efficiency of these technologies. Here we report that internal reorganization energy&#173; of the redox acceptor, the movement of the atoms with changing charge, has a profound effect on the charge transfer rates from donor quantum dots. We experimentally studied and modelled with Marcus Theory charge transfer to cobalt complexes that have similar electrochemical potentials covering 350 mV, but vastly different reorganization energies spanning 2 eV. While the driving force does influence the electron transfer rates, the reorganization energies had a far more profound effect, increasing charge transfer rates by several orders of magnitude. Our studies suggest that careful design of redox mediators to minimize reorganization energy is an untapped route to drastically increase the efficiency of quantum dot applications that feature charge transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest Alignment and Defect Formation during Pore Filling in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The degree of pore filling is an important parameter for defining guest@MOF properties in applications including electronics, optics, and gas separation. However, the interplay of key aspects of host&#8208;guest interactions, such as a quantitative description of the guest alignment or the structural integrity of the host as function of pore filling are yet to be determined. Polarisation&#8208;dependent infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection configuration combined with gas sorption allowed to simultaneously study the orientation of the guest molecule and structural changes of the MOF framework during the pore filling process. Thereby we found, that initially randomly oriented guest molecules align with increasing pore filling during adsorption from the gas phase. At the same time, the framework itself undergoes a reversible, guest molecule&#8208;dependent rotation of the aromatic linker and a linker detachment process, which induce defects.</dc:description>

         <title>Trap Inlaid Cationic Hybrid Composite Material for Efficient Segregation of Toxic Chemicals from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based oxoanions are potentially toxic pollutants that causes serious water pollution. Therefore, the segregation of such species has recently received significant research attention. Even though several adsorbents have been employed for effective management of chemicals, their limited microporous nature along with non&#8208;monolithic applicability has thwarted their large&#8208;scale real&#8208;time application. Herein, we strategized a unique anion exchangeable hybrid composite aerogel material (IPcomp&#8208;6), integrating a stable cationic metal&#8208;organic polyhedron with a hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic gel. The composite scavenger demonstrated a highly selective and very fast segregation efficiency for various hazardous oxoanions such as, HAsO42&#8722;, SeO42&#8722;, ReO4&#8722;, CrO42&#8722;, MnO4&#8722;, in water, in the presence of 100&#8208;fold excess other coexisting anions. The material was able to selectively eliminate trace HAsO42&#8722; even at low&#8208;concentration to well below the As(V) limit in drinking water defined by WHO.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation with Water Vapor on Single&#8208;Atom Platinum&#8208;Decorated Defective Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with water is an important route to simultaneously address carbon neutrality and produce fuels. It is challenging to achieve high selectivity in CO2 methanation due to competing reactions. Nonetheless, aspects of the catalyst design can be controlled with meaningful effects on the catalytic outcomes. We report highly selective CO2 methanation with water vapor using a photocatalyst that integrates polymeric carbon nitride (CN) with single Pt atoms. As revealed by experimental characterization and theoretical simulations, the widely explored Pt&#8722;CN catalyst is adapted for selective CO2 methanation with our rationally designed synthetic method. The synthesis creates defects in CN along with formation of hydroxyl groups proximal to the coordinated Pt atoms. The photocatalyst exhibits high activity and carbon selectivity (99%) for CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with pure water. This work provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for selective CO2 methanation.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise and Stereodivergent Approach to Chromanone Lactones through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Addition of Siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;Ester&#8208;Substituted Chromones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vicinal oxygen&#8208;containing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted stereocenters exist widely in chromanone lactone and tetrahydroxanthone natural products. Their enantioselective construction in a single step remains elusive and poses a formidable challenge for chemical synthesis. Here, we report the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous additions of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones, which enable concise and enantioselective assembly of chromanone lactones. Both syn and anti adducts can be accessed with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity by judicious choice of the chiral ligands. Our approach allowed for the efficient synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;blennolide B with precise stereochemical control, which provides a formal synthesis of secalonic acid A.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#160;Covalent Organic Framework Packed Nanochannel Membrane for Enantioseparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanochannel membrane has the prospect of large&#8208;scale separation. However, selectivity in enantioseparation is a challenge, due to the size difference between nanochannels and enantiomers. Here, we compartmented nanochannels by the  in&#8208;situ  synthesis of L&#8208;tyrosine functionalized covalent organic framework (L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF). The L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF decreased the pore size of channels to match with naproxen enantiomers (S/R&#8208;NPX) and improved the enantioselective gating. In contrast to the surface&#8208;functionalized nanochannels (L&#8208;Tyr channel), the L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF packed nanochannels (L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF channel) exhibited high enantioselectivity for S&#8208;NPX and realized the enantioseparation with the enantiomer excess value up to 94.2 %. The separation flux through the highly porous L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF channel was 1.33 mmolm  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  . This study provided a size&#8208;matching strategy and the chiral covalent organic framework packed nanochannel membrane to realize enantioseparation with high selectivity and flux.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Octahedral Cages with Three Types of Chirality towards Spontaneous Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is one of the most important intrinsic properties of (supra)molecules. In this study, we obtained enantiomeric metallo&#8208;supramolecular octahedra without using any chiral sources. Such cages were self&#8208;assembled by prochiral trispyridine ligand  L  based on a  C3h  truxene core and Cu(II) salts. Crystallization of the cages with BF4&#9472;&#160;as counterions afforded racemate crystals; while crystallizations of cages with ClO4&#9472;&#160;and OTf&#9472;&#160;as counterions resulted in conglomerates with spontaneous resolution. Three types of chirality were observed in each cage, including planar chirality of the truxene core, axial chirality from the pyridyl and truxene moieties, and propeller chirality of the pyridyl&#8208;Cu(II) coordination sites. The cages reported here are among the largest discrete synthetic metallo&#8208;supramolecules ever reported with chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior. Remarkably, the chiral cage exhibited very slow racemization even at low concentrations, suggesting their high stability in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Equilibria between Aluminium(I) and Aluminium(III): the Formation of Dihydroalanes, Masked Dialumenes and Aluminium(I) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of new reductive routes to low oxidation state aluminium (Al) compounds offers the opportunity to better understand redox processes at the metal centre and develop reactivity accordingly. Here, a monomeric Al(I) compound acts as a stoichiometric reducing agent towards a series of Al(III) dihydrides, leading to the formation of new low oxidation state species including symmetric and asymmetric dihydrodialanes, and a masked dialumene. These compounds are formed by a series of equilibrium processes involving Al(I), Al(II) and Al(III) species and product formation can be manipulated by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions. The transient formation of monomeric Al(I) compounds is proposed: this is shown to be energetically viable by computational (DFT) investigations and reactivity studies show support for the formation of Al(I) species. Importantly, despite the potential for the equilibrium mixtures to lead to ill&#8208;defined reactivity, controlled reactivity of these low oxidation state species is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Saving the Energy Loss in Lithium&#8208;mediated Nitrogen Fixation by Using Highly Reactive Li3N Intermediate for C&#8211;N Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct synthesis of N&#8208;containing organic compounds from dinitrogen (N2) can make synthetic chemistry more sustainable. Previous bottlenecks in lithium&#8208;mediated N2  fixation were resolved by loading Li metal anodes covered with the typical Li+  ion&#8208;conducting solid electrolyte interface, which are subsequently allowed to react with N2. The developed strategy allowed us to reach high Faradaic efficiencies toward Li3N. These reactive Li3N were then contacted with acylchlorides. Surface nitride ions are more nucleophilic than amines which direct the two C&#8211;N coupling reactions toward formation of imides rather than amides, and an integrated current efficiency of 57~77% could be realized. This study thereby not only provides a feasible electrochemical Li3N synthesis, but also delineates an economical and green synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing compounds from N2  under mild conditions, just using commercial spare parts and processes from omnipresent Li battery technology.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;C bond formation on metal surfaces has attracted great attention as a route toward novel molecular nanostructures under ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum conditions. Unlike the extensively explored reactions of aryl halides, we describe the on&#8208;surface dehalogenative homocoupling of benzylic bromides, namely bis&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208; and bis&#8208;  gem  &#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene as a potential route to either hydrocarbon dimers or conjugated polymers on Au (111). While bis&#8208;  gem  &#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene affords different dimers with naphthocyclobutadiene as the key intermediate, bis&#8208;bromomethyl naphthalene furnishes a poly(  o  &#8208;naphthylene vinylidene) as a non&#8208;conjugated polymer which undergoes dehydrogenation toward its conjugated derivative poly(  o  &#8208;naphthylene vinylene) upon mild annealing. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and density functional theory calculations provides deep insights into the prevailing mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Demanding Flexible Phosphoric Acids for Constructing Efficient and Multi&#8208;Purpose Asymmetric Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of counterion enhanced catalysis to promote the asymmetric functionalization of enones was demonstrated. Combining the use of sterically demanding phosphoric acids with simple chiral diamines allowed for the preparation of simple ion&#8208;paired and highly tunable organocatalysts. The latter could be applied in four different asymmetric transformations, providing a highly enantioselective access to both product antipodes in all cases.







Abstract
Herein, we present a novel approach for various asymmetric transformations of cyclic enones. The combination of readily accessible chiral diamines and sterically demanding flexible phosphoric acids resulted in a simple and highly tunable catalyst framework. The careful optimization of the catalyst components led to the identification of a particularly powerful and multi&#8208;purpose organocatalyst, which was successfully applied for asymmetric epoxidations, aziridinations, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated cyclizations, as well as for a novel Robinson&#8208;like Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure/aldol cyclization. High catalytic activities and excellent stereocontrol was observed for all four reaction types, indicating the excellent versatility of our catalytic system. Furthermore, a simple change in the diamine's configuration provided easy access to both product antipodes in all cases.

         <title>Controlled Tetradeuteration of Straight&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids: Synthesis, Application, and Insight into the Metabolism of Oxidized Linoleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions has been developed. The use of four deuterium atoms in fatty acids as well as a diagnostic peak of phosphatidylcholines thus obtained enabled the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from an oxidized linoleic acid, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), to lysophosphatidylcholine.







Abstract
We describe a concise and reliable protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids (FAs) at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions that is generally applicable to a variety of FAs, including trans&#8208;FAs, polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), and their oxidized derivatives. The precisely controlled introduction of four deuterium atoms into the FAs enables their persistent and quantitative tracking by LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis based on their molecular structures. In addition, the phosphatidylcholine (PC) species prepared from the tetradeuterated FAs thus obtained give a diagnostic peak, namely, a phosphocholine fragment that contains deuterium, in the LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. With these features, the metabolism of a representative oxidized linoleic acid, that is, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), was investigated, leading to the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from HODE to lysophosphatidylcholine.

         <title>In Situ Hydrolysis of Block Copolymers at the Water&#8208;Oil Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time pendant drop tensiometry of a toluene solution of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;b&#8208;PS) in water was measured to monitor the conversion of PSM blocks into glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) blocks upon the addition of acid to the aqueous phase. This work provides opportunities to quantitatively monitor responsive block copolymers for structuring liquids.







Abstract
In situ manipulation of the chemical composition of block copolymers at the fluid interfaces affords a route by which the interfacial tension, the packing of the copolymers, and the penetration of the blocks into the two liquids can be controlled. Here, a series of linear block copolymers of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;b&#8208;PS) are used, converting hydrophobic PSM block into a hydrophilic glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) block, that results in a marked decrease in the liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial tension. The kinetics of the first&#8208;order hydrolysis reaction was analyzed by monitoring the time&#8208;dependent interfacial tension as a function of pH, polymer concentration, molecular weight, and composition. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to measure the in&#8208;plane dynamics of the copolymers before and after hydrolysis. This work provides insights into a quantitative pathway by which in situ interfacial reactions may be performed and monitored in real time, completely changing the interfacial activity of the molecule.

         <title>Protocellular CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Based Diffusive Communication Using Transcriptional RNA Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering synthetic biochemical machinery for information processing and communication is essential for the construction of artificial protocells with complex dynamic behaviors. Here we use synthetic transcriptional circuits to produce diffusive RNA signal that can regulate CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing and localization in a binary community of synthetic protocells.







Abstract
Protocells containing enzyme&#8208;driven biomolecular circuits that can process and exchange information offer a promising approach for mimicking cellular features and developing molecular information platforms. Here, we employ synthetic transcriptional circuits together with CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing inside semipermeable protein&#8208;polymer microcompartments. We first establish a transcriptional protocell that can be activated by external DNA strands and produce functional RNA aptamers. Subsequently, we engineer a transcriptional module to generate RNA strands functioning as diffusive signals that can be sensed by neighboring protocells and trigger the activation of internalized DNA probes or localization of Cas nucleases. Our results highlight the opportunities to combine CRISPR/Cas machinery and DNA nanotechnology for protocellular communication and provide a step towards the development of protocells capable of distributed molecular information processing.

         <title>Switch from Anionic Polymerization to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization: a Valuable Strategy to Make Olefin Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive anionic polymerization and transmetallation reaction were used to design in situ macromolecular chain transfer agents involved in coordinative chain transfer copolymerization (CCTcoP) of ethylene and butadiene. Olefin block copolymers were formed for the first time by the switch from anionic polymerization to CCT(co)P.







Abstract
Anionic polymerization of butadiene or/and styrene is performed with lithium initiators, functional or not. The polymer chains are subsequently transferred to magnesium. The resulting polymeryl&#8208;magnesium compounds were combined with {(Me2Si(C13H8)2)Nd(&#956;&#8208;BH4)[(&#956;&#8208;BH4)Li(THF)]}2 metallocene complex to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macroCTAs) in coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of ethylene (E) or its copolymerization (CCTcoP) with butadiene (B). Block copolymers were produced for the first time by this switch from anionic polymerization to CCTP. Hard and soft blocks such as PB, polystyrene (PS), poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (SBR) obtained by anionic polymerization and PE or poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (EBR) produced by CCT(co)P were combined and the corresponding structures were characterized.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8722;NiI catalyst promotes regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling of polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides to afford trisubstituted borylalkenes and styrenes.

Catalytic strategies that provide stereoselective access to highly substituted alkenes from abundant monosubstituted substrates are exceedingly sought&#8208;after but rare. Here, we show that a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;NiI catalytic species mediates efficient union of electronically polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides, in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate and trimethylamine additives, to generate trisubstituted boron&#8208; and arene&#8208;containing trans alkenes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Control experiments provide evidence for a mechanism involving branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation that overrides substrate control, followed by trans&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift. The method represents a significant addition to the toolbox of reactions for the concise synthesis of unsaturated biologically active compounds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Under Visible Light Enabled by a Particulate Conjugated Polymer Loaded with Palladium and Iridium**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Poly(dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone) loaded with Pd/IrO2 facilitates stoichiometric overall water splitting for an extended period after the system stabilized, albeit currently with low activities. The study demonstrates the importance of co&#8208;catalysts for polymer photoatalysts and results were rationalized by transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Polymer photocatalysts have received growing attention in recent years for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Most studies report hydrogen production with sacrificial electron donors, which is unsuitable for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy production. Here we show that the palladium/iridium oxide&#8208;loaded homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (P10) facilitates overall water splitting to produce stoichiometric amounts of H2 and O2 for an extended period (&gt;60&#8197;hours) after the system stabilized. These results demonstrate that conjugated polymers can act as single component photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting when loaded with suitable co&#8208;catalysts, albeit currently with low activities. Transient spectroscopy shows that the IrO2 co&#8208;catalyst plays an important role in the generation of the charge separated state required for water splitting, with evidence for fast hole transfer to the co&#8208;catalyst.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medium&#8208;sized N,S&#8208;heterocycles have received tremendous interest due to their biological activities and potential medical applications. However, asymmetric synthesis of these compounds are extremely rare. Described herein is a catalyst&#8208;dependent [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxide&#8208;ynamides, enabling divergent and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a series of valuable medium&#8208;sized N,S&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope. Importantly, excellent enantioselectivities have been achieved via an unprecedented chirality&#8208;transfer. Moreover, theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the origins of the catalyst&#8208;dependent stereospecific [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxylated Multi&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes Covalently Modified with Tris(hydroxypropyl) Phosphine as a Functional Interlayer for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have successfully constructed a new type of intercalation membrane material by covalently grafting organic molecules tris (hydroxypropyl) phosphine (THPP) onto hydroxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNT&#8208;OH) as a functional interlayer for the advanced LSBs. The as&#8208;assembled interlayer has been demonstrated to be responsible for the fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides, the inhibition of polysulfide shuttle effect, as well as the formation of stable SEI layer. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we further found THPP plays a key role in accelerating the conversion of polysulfides into low&#8208;ordered lithium sulfides and suppressing the loss of polysulfides, thus rendering the as&#8208;designed lithium&#8208;sulfur battery in this work a high capacity, excellent rate performance and long&#8208;term stability. Even at low temperatures, the capacity decay rate was only 0.036% per cycle for 1700 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Na/K Alloy Interfacial Synthesis of Functional Porous Carbon at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functional groups in porous carbon generally suffer a severe loss during the high&#8208;temperature carbonization. Instead, the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of carbon featuring porous structures and abundant functional groups is not only a solution that evades the pitfalls of pyrolysis but also is of significance for the development of synthetic methodology. Herein, a liquid metal interfacial engineering strategy is reported for the synthesis of porous carbon using CCl4 as the carbon precursor and sodium&#8208;potassium alloy (NaK) as the reducing agent, which is superior to traditional synthetic methods because it enables the engineering of a highly active liquid metal alloy microemulsion to directly generate porous carbon at ambient temperature. As synthesized porous carbon featured abundant carbon&#8208;chlorine bonds can be tandem grafted with imidazole and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to achieve a CO2 cycloaddition catalyst, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity, in addition to exceptional stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free SF6 Activation: A New SF5&#8208;Based Reagent Enables Deoxyfluorination and Pentafluorosulfanylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of SF  6  , a potent greenhouse gas, under metal&#8208;free and visible light conditions is reported. Herein, mechanistic investigations including EPR spectroscopy, NMR studies and cyclic voltammetry allowed the rational design of a new fluorinating reagent which was synthesized from the 2&#8208;electron activation of SF  6  with commercially available TDAE. This new SF  5  &#8208;based reagent was efficiently employed for the deoxyfluorination of CO  2  and the fluorinative desulfurization of CS  2  allowing the formation of useful fluorinated amines. Moreover, for the first time we demonstrated that our SF  5  &#8208;based reagent could afford the mild generation of Cl&#8208;SF  5  gas. This finding was exploited for the chloro&#8208;pentafluorosulfanylation of alkynes and alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Photoluminescent Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles by Electrostatic Mediated Intramolecular Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported large&#8208;scale synthesis of photoluminescent SCNPs by electrostatic mediated intramolecular crosslinking in a concentrated solution of 40 mg/mL by continuous addition of the free radical initiator. The example polymer of poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) was charged by quaternization with vinyl&#8208;imidazolium for the intramolecular crosslinking by using 2,2&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetophenone (DMAP) as the radical initiator.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We reported large-scale synthesis of photoluminescent SCNPs by electrostatic mediated intramolecular crosslinking in a concentrated solution of 40 mg/mL by continuous addition of the free radical initiator. The example polymer of poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) was charged by quaternization with vinyl-imidazolium for the intramolecular crosslinking by using 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMAP) as the radical initiator. Under the electrostatic repulsion thus interchain isolation, the intrachain crosslinking experiences the transition from coil through pearl-necklace to globular state. The SCNPs demonstrate strong photoluminescence at visible range when the non-emissive units are confined thereby. Composition and microstructure of the SCNPs are tunable. The example photoluminescent tadpole-like Janus SCNP can be used to selectively illuminate interfacial membranes while stabilizing the emulsions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Metal Site Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Reduction: Mechanistic Insight into Active Site Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;supported nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal site catalysts (i.e., M&#8208;N&#8208;C, M: Fe, Co, or Ni) are active for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N&#8208;M bond structures and coordination is limited. Herein, we expand the coordination environments of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts by designing dual&#8208;metal active sites. The Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst displayed the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N&#8208;coordinated dual&#8208;metal site configurations are 2N&#8208;bridged (Fe&#8208;Ni)N6, in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual&#8208;metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single&#8208;metal sites (FeN4 or NiN4) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic as a Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylene semihydrogenation is a key technology for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene from crude ethylene. Ni&#8208;based catalysts are promising alternatives to noble&#8208;metals for this process. However, achieving high catalytic activity and selectivity remains a big challenge. We report a novel catalyst design based on high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEI), which provide thermally stable isolated Ni without excess counterpart metals and achieve exceptionally high performance. Intermetallic NiGa was multi&#8208;metalized to a (NiFeCu)(GaGe), where the Ni and Ga sites were partially substituted with Fe/Cu and Ge, respectively, without altering the parent CsCl&#8208;type structure. The NiFeCuGaGe/SiO  2  HEI catalyst completely inhibited ethylene overhydrogenation even at complete acetylene conversion, and exhibited five&#8208;times higher activity than other 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The DFT study showed that the surface energy decreased by multi&#8208;metallization, which drastically weakened ethylene adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Ammonium Ion Battery: A New Strategy for Nonmetallic Ion Energy Storage System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetallic ammonium (NH  4  +  ) ion batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage system, which have the merit of low molar mass, sustainability, non&#8208;toxicity and non&#8208;dendrite. Herein, for the first time, we introduce the novel organic ammonium ion batteries (OAIBs). Significantly, a manganese&#8208;based Prussian white analogue (noted as MnHCF) as cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 104 mAh g  &#8208;1  with 98% retention over 100 cycles. We further demonstrated the electrochemical performance of NH  4  +  ion full cell, which delivers a reversible capacity of 45 mAh g  &#8208;1  with a broad electrochemical window. Combining ex&#8208;situ XPS, ex&#8208;situ XRD results and electrochemical properties, the NH  4  +  ions storage mechanism of MnHCF in non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte is clearly revealed. This work verifies the feasibility of employing NH  4  +  ions as charge carriers in organic energy storage system and provides new insights for designing organic nonmetallic ion batteries with broad electrochemical windows and high energy density.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polarized&#8208;light detection in deep ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind region is indispensable for optoelectronic application. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics with inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) have become a robust candidate in this portfolio. We here report a wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (isobutylammonium)2(methylamium)Pb2Cl7 (1), in which BPVE behaves as self&#8208;driving source for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarized&#8208;light detection. It exhibits a large dichroism ratio (~15.7) and superior BPVE&#8208;directed photocurrent (~3.6 &#956;A/cm2, under 266 nm). These attributes facilitate excellent self&#8208;powered polarized&#8208;light detection of high on/off contrast (~103) and polarization ratio (~2.5), beyond those of inorganic oxides (e.g., ZnO, 1.47; GaN, 1.38). This study highlights potential of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics for new optoelectronic application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal complexes has been widely studied, especially in biochemistry and catalytic chemistry. Although metal complexes bearing redox&#8208;active ligands play a part in these research areas, those with &#960;&#8208;planar structure remain entirely unexplored, which are vital for future development of iono&#8208;electronics. Here, proton&#8211;electron coupling of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel complex bearing redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands, Ni(itsq)2, was investigated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. Strong proton&#8211;electron coupling was manifested in a large potential shift, which is twice greater than that of a typical PCET&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;planar metal complex with redox&#8208;inactive ligands, [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8211;.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When it comes to using solar energy to promote catalytic reactions, photocatalysis technology will be first thought. However, the sunlight can not only be directly converted to chemical energy through photocatalytic process, but can also be converted through different energy transfer pathways. Using sunlight as the energy source, photocatalytic reaction can proceed independently, and can also be coupled with other catalytic technologies to enhance overall catalytic efficiency. Therefore, sun light driven catalytic reactions are diversified, and need to be given a specific definition. We propose a timely perspective for the catalytic reactions driven by sunlight and give them a specific definition, namely Solar Energy Catalysis. The concept of different types of solar energy catalysis, such as photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, solar cell powered electrocatalysis and pyroelectric catalysis, are highlighted. Finally, their limitations and future research direction are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Alteration in Adsorption Sites over SAPO&#8208;34 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites have found tremendous applications in the chemical industry. However, it is unclear about the dynamic nature of their active sites under the flow of adsorbate molecules for adsorption and catalysis, especially in operando conditions, which could be different from the as&#8208;synthesized structures. In the present study, we report a structural transformation of the adsorptive active sites in SAPO&#8208;34 zeolite by using acetone as a probe molecule under various temperatures. The combination of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, in&#8208;situ variable&#8208;temperature synchrotron x&#8208;ray diffraction, and in&#8208;situ diffuse&#8208;reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy allow a clear identification and quantification that the chemisorption of acetone can convert the classical Br&#248;nsted acid site adsorption mode to an induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs adsorption mode at increasing temperatures. Such facile conversion is also supported by the calculations of ab&#8208;initio molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations. This work sheds new light on the importance of the dynamic structural alteration of active sites in zeolites with adsorbates at elevated temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Regulation of FeN4 Spin State by Neighboring Cu Atoms for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis in Flexible Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron, nitrogen&#8208;codoped carbon (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) nanocomposites have emerged as viable electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the formation of FeN  x  C  y  moieties.  In this study, results from first&#8208;principles calculations show a nearly linear correlation of the energy barriers of key reaction steps with the Fe magnetic moment. Experimentally, when single Cu sites are incorporated into Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C aerogels (denoted as NCAG/Fe&#8208;Cu), the Fe centers exhibit a reduced magnetic moment and markedly enhanced ORR activity within a wide pH range of 0~14  . With the NCAG/Fe&#8208;Cu nanocomposites used as the cathode catalyst in a neutral/quasi&#8208;solid aluminum&#8211;air and alkaline/quasi&#8208;solid zinc&#8208;air battery, both achieve a remarkable performance with an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.00 and 1.51 V, large power density of 130 and 186 mA cm  &#8211;2  , and good mechanical flexibility, all markedly better than those with commercial Pt/C or Pt/C&#8208;RuO  2  catalysts at the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Redox Features Induced by Strong Covalency in Layered NaTi1&#8208;yVyS2 Cathodes for Na&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rising demand for energy density of cathodes means the need to raise the voltage or capacity of cathodes. Transition metal (TM) doping has been employed to enhance the electrochemical properties in multiple aspects. The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, we found anomalous redox features in NaTi  1&#8208;y  V  y  S  2  . The first discharge platform potential (2.4 V) is significantly higher than that of undoped NaTiS  2  and NaVS  2  (both around 2.2 V), and the energy density is raised by 15%. We speculate that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong hybridization in Ti&#8208;V&#8208;S system. Ti  3+  and V  3+  undergo charge transfer, form a more stable Ti (t  2g  0  e  g  0  ) and V (t  2g  3  e  g  0  ) electronic configuration. Our results state that higher voltage of cathode materials could be achieved by strong TM&#8208;ligand covalency, and this conclusion provides the possible opportunities to explore high voltage materials for future layered cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy Atom&#8208;Free, Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted, and Activatable Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy with Real&#8208;Time In&#8208;Situ Therapeutic Monitoring</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free and mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizers (PSs) with the real&#8208;time in situ self&#8208;reporting ability was constructed for photodynamic cancer therapy. Based on the platform, activatable PSs were further developed, and their ability in either selective killing of cancer cells over normal cells or in effectively ablating an implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.







Abstract
Based on spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing mechanism, two heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (PSs) BDP1/BDP2 with absorption maxima at 506&#8197;nm/660&#8197;nm were constructed for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The long triplet state lifetimes and large singlet oxygen quantum yields, coupled with the mitochondria&#8208;targeted feature, made them highly phototoxic toward cancer cells. Moreover, the PDT&#8208;promoted cell apoptosis could be monitored by an obvious fluorescence off&#8208;on response of the two PSs due to the concomitant activation of extensive mitophagy, thus facilitating timely therapeutic feedback to avoid under&#8208; or over&#8208;treatment. Importantly, such design allows the activatable PSs Glu&#8208;BDP1/Glu&#8208;BDP2 to be fabricated by attaching &#947;&#8208;glutamyl, a substrate of &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase, to the alkoxyaniline unit of BDP1/BDP2, and their ability in either selectively killing cancer cells over normal cells or in ablating implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.

         <title>(PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6: A Robust Tetravalent Phosphaza&#8208;adamantane Scaffold for Molecular and Macromolecular Construction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new air&#8208;stable and thermally robust tetrahedral tetravalent inorganic cage, (PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6 has been achieved. This cage allows four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions on its periphery to give unprecedented molecular and macromolecular constructs. This utility is shown by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion and the first all P/N polyphazene network material.







Abstract
Tetraarylmethanes and adamantanes are important rigid covalent connectors that play a four&#8208;way scaffolding role in molecular and materials chemistry. We report the synthesis of a new tetravalent phosphaza&#8208;adamantane cage, (PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6 (2), that shows high thermal, air, and redox stability due to its geometry. It nevertheless participates in covalent four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions along its periphery. The combination of a robust core and reactive corona makes 2 a convenient inorganic scaffold upon which tetrahedral molecular and macromolecular chemistry can be constructed. This potential is demonstrated by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion (in compound 3) and the first all P/N poly(phosphazene) network (5).

&lt;p&gt;Tetraarylmethanes and adamantanes are important rigid covalent connectors that play a four-way scaffolding role in molecular and materials chemistry. We report the synthesis of a new tetravalent phosphaza-adamantane cage, (PNSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NMe)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), that shows high thermal, air, and redox stability due to its geometry. It nevertheless participates in covalent four-fold functionalization reactions along its periphery. The combination of a robust core and reactive corona makes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; a convenient inorganic scaffold upon which tetrahedral molecular and macromolecular chemistry can be constructed. This potential is demonstrated by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion (in compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and the first all P/N poly(phosphazene) network (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Cyclopropane&#8208;Fused N&#8208;Heterocycles Enabled by Underexplored Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles from readily available amines was achieved. Key to the disclosed strategy was the development and implementation of reactive &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, providing access to structurally and functionally diverse products. Application of the method is showcased in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.







Abstract
Cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles are featured in various biologically active compounds and represent attractive scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. However, synthesis routes to access structurally and functionally diverse cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles remain underexplored. Leveraging novel &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, we report a general approach for the direct and modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused lactams from unsaturated amines. The operationally simple transformation, which proceeds through successive acylation, (3+2) cycloaddition and fragmentation, tolerates a broad range of functional groups and yields a wide spectrum of complex molecular scaffolds, including fused, bridged and spiro ring systems. We demonstrate the utility of this transformation in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.

         <title>Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanines: Amphiphilic Phosphotyrosine Mimetics Displaying Fluorine&#8208;Specific Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The more fluorine the better? Pentafluorophosphato amino acids A and B are stable new molecular entities showing surprisingly high binding affinities to the phosphotyrosine binding site of a protein tyrosine phosphatase&#8212;better than the current gold standard for phosphotyrosine mimetics. PF5 motifs display remarkable fluorine&#8208;specific interactions and thus might enable a new class of potent tools for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.







Abstract
Phosphotyrosine residues are essential functional switches in health and disease. Thus, phosphotyrosine biomimetics are crucial for the development of chemical tools and drug molecules. We report here the discovery and investigation of pentafluorophosphato amino acids as novel phosphotyrosine biomimetics. A mild acidic pentafluorination protocol was developed and two PF5&#8208;amino acids were prepared and employed in peptide synthesis. Their structures, reactivities, and fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in bioactivity assays. The mono&#8208;anionic PF5 motif displayed an amphiphilic character binding to hydrophobic surfaces, to water molecules, and to protein&#8208;binding sites, exploiting charge and H&#8722;F&#8208;bonding interactions. The novel motifs bind 25&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold stronger to the phosphotyrosine binding site of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B than the best current biomimetics, as rationalized by computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Rational Design of a Novel Tubulin Inhibitor with a Unique Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antitubulin drugs are used very successfully in chemotherapy but their chemical structures are complex. Based on a previously performed crystallographic fragment screen, we here rationally designed the small molecule tubulin inhibitor Todalam. The compound displays a unique molecular mechanism of action by targeting a novel binding site in tubulin.







Abstract
In this study, we capitalized on our previously performed crystallographic fragment screen and developed the antitubulin small molecule Todalam with only two rounds of straightforward chemical synthesis. Todalam binds to a novel tubulin site, disrupts microtubule networks in cells, arrests cells in G2/M, induces cell death, and synergizes with vinblastine. The compound destabilizes microtubules by acting as a molecular plug that sterically inhibits the curved&#8208;to&#8208;straight conformational switch in the &#945;&#8208;tubulin subunit, and by sequestering tubulin dimers into assembly incompetent oligomers. Our results describe for the first time the generation of a fully rationally designed small molecule tubulin inhibitor from a fragment, which displays a unique molecular mechanism of action. They thus demonstrate the usefulness of tubulin&#8208;binding fragments as valuable starting points for innovative antitubulin drug and chemical probe discovery campaigns.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Panowamycins, TM&#8208;135, and Veramycin&#8197;F Using C&#8722;H Insertion with Donor/Donor Carbenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Total Synthesis Shell Game: The asymmetric first synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM&#8208;135, veramycin&#8197;F, and two unnatural isomers in a stereoselective fashion, featuring a dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reaction with donor/donor carbenes in the key step to construct the isochroman core. These syntheses reveal a structural misassignment for panowamycin&#8197;A and computational NMR studies unveil the correct configuration of the natural isomer, which was also synthesized.







Abstract
Panowamycins are a group of isochroman&#8208;based natural products first isolated from Streptomyces sp. K07&#8208;0010 in 2012 by Satoshi &#332;mura and co&#8208;workers that exhibit modest anti&#8208;trypanosomal activity. Herein we demonstrate the first syntheses of these natural products and their epimers. Stereoselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reactions with a donor/donor carbene construct the substituted isochroman core in the key bond&#8208;forming step. The syntheses are completed without the use of protecting groups and feature a late&#8208;stage Wacker oxidation. Incongruent NMR spectra between natural and synthetic samples revealed the structural misassignment of panowamycin&#8197;A and veramycin&#8197;F. Computational NMR studies suggested panowamycin&#8197;A to be an alternate diastereomer, which was confirmed by synthesizing this isomer. Concurrent with this work, in 2021 Mahmud and co&#8208;workers came to the same conclusion with an updated NMR analysis of panowamycin&#8197;A. In a divergent, asymmetric sequence, we report the synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM&#8208;135, and veramycin&#8197;F.

         <title>Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodeacetoxylation of Aryl Acetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich aryl acetates derived from (renewable) phenolics were selectively reduced to the corresponding arenes using pinacolborane (HBpin) and a nickel&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system in the green solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The method is applicable to 4&#8208;propylguaiacyl acetate derived from pine wood.







Abstract
Acetate serves as a renewable and easily installed leaving group for selective deoxygenation of phenolics (ArOH). Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydrodeacetoxylation of aryl acetates (Ar&#8722;OAc) with HBpin in a green carbonate solvent selectively delivers the corresponding deoxygenated arenes (ArH). The method is also applicable to highly challenging guaiacyl and syringyl acetates, leaving &#8722;OMe groups intact without arene reduction. Renewable 4&#8208;propylguaiacol obtained from pine can also be transformed without significant loss in yield versus oil derived feedstock. The observed chemoselectivity for Ar&#8722;OAc versus ArO&#8722;Ac bond cleavage was rationalized based on mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. ArOH side&#8208;product formation is attributed to direct competitive Ni&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the C=O bond.

     alt="Selective Nickel-Catalyzed Hydrodeacetoxylation of Aryl Acetates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron-rich aryl acetates derived from (renewable) phenolics were selectively reduced to the corresponding arenes using pinacolborane (HBpin) and a nickel-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system in the green solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The method is applicable to 4-propylguaiacyl acetate derived from pine wood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetate serves as a renewable and easily installed leaving group for selective deoxygenation of phenolics (ArOH). Ni-catalyzed hydrodeacetoxylation of aryl acetates (Ar&#8722;OAc) with HBpin in a green carbonate solvent selectively delivers the corresponding deoxygenated arenes (ArH). The method is also applicable to highly challenging guaiacyl and syringyl acetates, leaving &#8722;OMe groups intact without arene reduction. Renewable 4-propylguaiacol obtained from pine can also be transformed without significant loss in yield versus oil derived feedstock. The observed chemoselectivity for Ar&#8722;OAc versus ArO&#8722;Ac bond cleavage was rationalized based on mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. ArOH side-product formation is attributed to direct competitive Ni-catalyzed reduction of the C=O bond. Hydrodeacyloxylation of a set of aryl alkanoates featured interesting chemoselectivity with a dramatic influence of the length and structure of the alkyl chain on catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concentrated Aqueous Peroxodicarbonate: Efficient Electrosyn&#8208; thesis and Use as Oxidizer in Epoxidations, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical synthesis of concentrated (&#8776;1.0&#8201;m) peroxodicarbonate solutions was achieved by a newly designed electrolysis cell with an elaborate heat&#8208;transfer system, a ternary K2CO3/Na2CO3/KHCO3 electrolyte, and the use of high current densities of above 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Peroxodicarbonate solutions were shown to be powerful and green oxidizers, permitting N&#8208; and S&#8208;oxidations as well as epoxidations.







Abstract
Peroxodicarbonates are of substantial interest as potentially powerful and sustainable oxidizers but have so far been accessible only in low concentrations with unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Concentrated (&gt;&#160;0.9&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1) peroxodicarbonate solutions have now been made accessible by the electrolysis of aqueous K2CO3/Na2CO3/KHCO3 solutions at high current density of 3.33&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an efficiently cooled circular flow reactor equipped with a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode and a stainless&#8208;steel cathode. Their synthetic potential as platform oxidizers was clearly demonstrated in transformations including sulfoxidation, N&#8208;oxidation, and epoxidation.

         <title>Adsorption in Reversed Order of C2 Hydrocarbons on an Ultramicroporous Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) shows a reversed adsorption order for C2 hydrocarbons. The C2 hydrocarbon uptake of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follow the order C2H6&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H2 and not the usual C2H2&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H6.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks have been widely studied in the separation of C2 hydrocarbons, which usually preferentially bind unsaturated hydrocarbons with the order of acetylene (C2H2)&gt;ethylene (C2H4)&gt;ethane (C2H6). Herein, we report an ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework Zn&#8208;FBA (H2FBA=4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid)), shows a reversed adsorption order characteristic for C2 hydrocarbons, that the uptake for C2 hydrocarbons of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follows the order C2H6&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H2. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm that the completely reversed adsorption order behavior is attributed to the close van der Waals interactions and multiple cooperative C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonds between the framework and C2H6. Moreover, Zn&#8208;FBA exhibits a high selectivity of about 2.9 for C2H6 over C2H4 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. The experimental breakthrough studies show that the high&#8208;purity C2H4 can be obtained from C2H6 and C2H4 mixtures in one step.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Directed Regulation of Structures and Luminescence of Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions were employed to direct the regulation of the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Two novel clusters with triangular bipyramidal CAu6Ag5 (2) and hexagram&#8208;like CAu6Ag6 (3) cores were obtained from the CAu6Ag4 type precursor 1. They exhibit red&#8208; or blue&#8208;shifted luminescence, respectively. Remarkably, the quantum yields of 2 and 3 are one order of magnitude higher than 1.







Abstract
Anions have been used to regulate the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Introducing ClO4&#8722; into orange&#8208;emissive, butterfly&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag4](BF4)6 (1, PPhpy2=bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenylphosphine) leads to the formation of red&#8208;emissive [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag5(ClO4)3](ClO4)4 (2) with a novel trigonal bipyramidal structure; employing PhCO2&#8722; gives yellow&#8208;emissive, hexagram&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag6(PhCO2)3](BF4)5 (3). Notably, 1 exhibits weak luminescence in CH2Cl2/CH3OH=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (v&#8201;:&#8201;v) with a quantum yield (QY) of 0.05, whereas it was dramatically increased to 0.49 and 0.83 for 2 and 3, respectively. Theoretical calculation confirms that the involvement of anions in the electronic structures is responsible for the shifts of emission. The high QYs of 2 and 3 are attributed to the protection provided by ligands and anions. This work demonstrates that anions may serve as an extra designable factor beyond just counterions for functional metal clusters.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Assisted Hydrophobic Li+&#8208;Solvated Structure for Stabilizing Dual Electrode Electrolyte Interphases through Suppressing LiPF6 Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have been drawn much attention due to their high energy density. However, the hydrolysis of LiPF  6  in commercial carbonate electrolytes will deteriorate the electrode electrolyte solid interphases and structural collapse of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes, leading to the uncontrollable Li dendrites growth and fast capacity fading. Herein, a hydrophobic Li  +  &#8208;solvated structure is designed by inducing the hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate (HFAC) into the electrolyte system. Due to the the alkene groups and non&#8208;polar perfluorocarbon (&#8208;CF  2  CF  2  CF  3  ) chain, the HFAC could help to form a hydrophobic surface around Li ion solvation aggregates to protect the LiPF  6  against the attack from trace H  2  O, improving the stability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and structure of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Moreover, the HFAC could also help to form an organic SEI layer with rich polar C&#8208;F bonds, which can fast capture Li ions to restrain the dendrite growth. Therefore, the Li||Li symmetric cells show a stable cycling performance up to 500 h at a current density of 1 mA cm  &#8208;2  . When paired with LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  cathode&#65292;the Li metal cells show good cycling stability, exhibiting a specific capacity of 111 mA h g  &#8208;1  at 1C with a capacity retention of 74% after 200 cycles.</dc:description>

Herein, a hydrophobic Li  +  -solvated structure is designed by inducing the hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate (HFAC) into the electrolyte system. Due to the the alkene groups and non-polar perfluorocarbon (-CF  2  CF  2  CF  3  ) chain, the HFAC could help to form a hydrophobic surface around Li ion solvation aggregates to protect the LiPF  6  against the attack from trace H  2  O, improving the stability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and structure of Ni-rich cathodes.

When paired with LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  cathode&#65292;the Li metal cells show good cycling stability, exhibiting a specific capacity of 111 mA h g  -1  at 1C with a capacity retention of 74% after 200 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular nanoribbons are a class of atomically&#8208;precise nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. An iterative approach that allows doubling the lenght&#160;of the longest&#160;pyrene&#8208;pyrazoquinoxaline molecular nanoribbons is described. The largest nanoribbon obtained through this approach &#8211;with a 60 linearly&#8208;fused ring backbone (14.9 nm) and a 324&#8208;atoms core (C  276  N  48  )&#8211; shows an extremely high molar absorptivity (values up to 1,198,074 M  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;1  ) that also endows it with a high molar fluorescence brightness (8,700 M  &#8210;1  cm  &#8210;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Fluorescence Affinity Assay to Decipher Uranyl&#8208;Binding to Native Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determining the affinity of proteins for uranyl is key to understand the toxicity of this cation and to further develop decorporation strategies. However, usual techniques to achieve that goal often require specific equipment and expertise. Here, we propose a simple, efficient, fluorescence&#8208;based method to assess the affinity of proteins and peptides for uranyl, at equilibrium and in buffered solution. We first designed and characterized an original uranyl&#8208;binding fluorescent probe. We then built a reference scale for uranyl affinity in solution, relying on signal quenching of our fluorescent probe in presence of high&#8208;affinity uranyl&#8208;binding peptides. We finally validated our approach by re&#8208;evaluating the uranyl&#8208;binding affinity of four native proteins. We envision that this tool will facilitate the reliable and reproducible assessment of affinities of peptides and proteins for uranyl.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(alkenyl)&#8211;H Activation Facilitated by a Transient Directing Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(alkenyl)&#8211;H alkenylation enabled by a transient directing group (TDG) strategy is described. The dual catalytic process takes advantage of reversible condensation between an alkenyl aldehyde substrate and an amino acid TDG to facilitate coordination of the metal catalyst and subsequent C(alkenyl)&#8211;H activation by a tailored carboxylate base. The resulting palladacycle then engages an acceptor alkene, furnishing a 1,3&#8208;diene with high regio&#8208; and  E/Z  &#8208;selectivity. The reaction enables the synthesis of enantioenriched atropoisomeric 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes, which have seldom been examined in previous literature. Catalytically relevant alkenyl palladacycles were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the energy profiles of the C(alkenyl)&#8211;H activation step and the stereoinduction model were elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing 4s&#8208;2p Orbital Hybridization to Stabilize Spinel Oxide Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxides composed of oxygen framework and interstitial cations are promising cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the instability of oxygen framework under harsh operating conditions results in fast battery capacity decay, due to the weak orbital interactions between cations and oxygen (mainly 3d&#8208;2p interaction). Here, a robust and endurable oxygen framework is created by introducing strong 4s&#8208;2p  &#160;  orbital hybridization into the structure using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 oxide as an example. The modified oxide delivers extraordinarily stable battery performance, achieving 71.4% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 C. This work shows that an orbital&#8208;level understanding can be leveraged to engineer high structural stability of the anion oxygen framework of oxides. Moreover, the similarity of oxygen lattice between oxide electrodes makes this approach extendable to other electrodes, with orbital&#8208;focused engineering a new avenue for the fundamental modification of battery materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Growth of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Assemblies on Cu(100) and Cu(111): from Single Molecules to Magic&#8208;Number Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have superior properties as building blocks of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs). Understanding the influence of the substrate in the molecular arrangement is a fundamental step before employing these ligands in technological applications. Herein, we study the molecular arrangement of a model NHC on Cu(100) and Cu(111). While mostly disordered phases appear on Cu(100), on Cu(111) well&#8208;defined structures are formed, evolving from magic&#8208;number islands to molecular ribbons with coverage. This work presents the first example of magic&#8208;number islands formed by NHC assemblies on flat surfaces. Intermolecular interactions, diffusion and commensurability are key factors explaining the observed arrangements. These results shed light on the molecule&#8208;substrate interaction and open the possibility of tuning nanopatterned structures based on NHC assemblies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) is one of the smallest polyheterocyclic aromatic building blocks for forming conjugated metal&#8722;organic frameworks (cMOFs). However, the strong inter&#8208;molecular steric hindrance impedes the growth of HAT&#8208;based cMOFs. Here we employ on&#8208;surface synthesis to grow single&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional cMOFs of M  3  (HAT)  2  (M= Ni, Fe, Co). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) analysis, we resolve that the frameworks comprise a hexagonal lattice of HAT molecules and a Kagome lattice of metal atoms. The DFT analysis indicates that Ni, Co and Fe carry a magnetic moment of 1.1, 2.5, and 3.7 &#956;B, respectively. We anticipate that the small &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of HAT and strong bidentate chelating coordination gives rise to appealing electronic and magnetic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of Multifunctional and Non&#8208;stereoselective Oxidoreductase RubE7/IstO, Expanding the Functional Diversity of the Flavoenzyme Superfamily</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional, non&#8208;stereoselective FMN&#8208;dependent enzyme, RubE7/IstO, catalyzes both the reduction of three spatially different bonds and dehydrogenation of a tropolone ring. The crystal structure of IstO revealed that a big catalytic pocket permits free rotation of the substrate, resulting in nonselective reduction reactions. Molecular docking and site mutation studies showed that His106 is important for the reversible dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes enable a broad range of redox transformations and generally act as monofunctional and stereoselective catalysts. Herein, we report the investigation of a multifunctional and non&#8208;stereoselective FMN&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase RubE7 from the rubrolone biosynthetic pathway. Our study outlines a single RubE7&#8208;catalysed sequential reduction of three spatially distinct bonds in a tropolone ring and a reversible double&#8208;bond reduction and dehydrogenation. The crystal structure of IstO (a RubE7 homologue) with 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution reveals the location of the active site at the interface of two monomers, and the size of active site is large enough to permit both flipping and free rotation of the substrate, resulting in multiple nonselective reduction reactions. Molecular docking and site mutation studies demonstrate that His106 is oriented towards the substrate and is important for the reverse dehydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic (2+1) Cycloaddition of Thioketones to Synthesize Tetrasubstituted Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of catalytic enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides with thioketones is presented, catalyzed by chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co&#921;&#921; complexes. This method provides a rapid and facile access to a series of optically active tetrasubstituted thiiranes with good outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 97&#8201;% ee). The origin of stereoselectivity was well elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of thioketones with &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides for the direct synthesis of tetrasubstituted thiiranes. In the presence of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/cobalt(&#921;&#921;) complexes (2&#8211;5&#8197;mol%), excellent efficiency (up to 99&#8201;% yield within 15&#8197;mins) and high stereoselectivity (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 97&#8201;% ee) are available. Elaborations of thiiranes via desulfuration have also been conducted to deliver tetrasubstituted olefins. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reaction initiates from a doublet state cobalt(&#921;&#921;) carbenoid, which is followed by a quartet cobalt(&#921;&#921;)&#8208;bound thiocarbonyl ylide pathway. This work provides a route for the selective construction of tetrasubstituted thiiranes and olefins that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Fluorination and Betaine Modification Augment the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing Ability of Cylindrical Polymer Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that fluorination augments the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration of cylindrical polymer brushes by altering the surface state, and betaine modification achieves this function via a betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries.







Abstract
Blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing ability of drugs is of paramount importance for the treatments of central nervous system diseases. However, the known methods for drug transport across the BBB are generally complicated and inefficient, and exhibit serious side effects in some cases. Herein, we report an exciting finding that fluorination and betaine modification can significantly augment the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of cylindrical polymer brushes (CPBs), which was demonstrated by the comparison with the CPBs modified with alkyl and poly(ethylene glycol) chains, respectively. We surmise that fluorination enhances the BBB penetration of the CPBs by increasing the hydrophobicity and reducing the surface energy, and betaine medication achieves this function via a betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries. By means of an in vitro BBB model, we demonstrated that the CPBs penetrated the BBB through transendothelial transport. This work provides a novel strategy for enhancing the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of nanomaterials.

         <title>Structurally Disordered RuO2 Nanosheets with Rich Oxygen Vacancies for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural disorder enhanced catalytic performance is demonstrated for carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets. The improved activity is ascribed to the disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies, which can modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus resulting in a low endothermic potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) and a high efficiency.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate pollutants to ammonia has emerged as an attractive alternative for ammonia synthesis. Currently, many strategies have been developed for enhancing nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) efficiency, but the influence of the degree of structural disorder is still unexplored. Here, carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets with adjustable crystallinity are synthesized by a facile molten salt method. The as&#8208;synthesized amorphous RuO2 displays high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (97.46&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.42&#8201;%), greatly outperforming the crystalline counterparts. The disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies is revealed to modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus lowering the energy of the potential&#8208;determining step (NH2*&#8594;NH3*).

         <title>Reversibly Photoswitching Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;Sensitive Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An upconverting nanoparticle probe can be switched on and off by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for multiple cycles of photoacoustic imaging (PA). Through reversible modulation of the probe PA activation state, a background&#8208;free PA signal can be recovered in imaging 0.05&#8197;nM of the probe in hemoglobin (Hb) solution and 104 labeled cancer cells subcutaneously implanted in mice.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging uses light excitation to generate the acoustic signal for detection and improves tissue penetration depth and spatial resolution in the clinically relevant depth of living subjects. However, strong background signals from blood and pigments have significantly compromised the sensitivity of PA imaging with exogenous contrast agents. Here we report a nanoparticle&#8208;based probe design that uses light to reversibly modulate the PA emission to enable photoacoustic photoswitching imaging (PAPSI) in living mice. Such a nanoprobe is built with upconverting nanocrystals and photoswitchable small molecules and can be switched on by NIR light through upconversion to UV energy. Reversibly photoswitching of the nanoprobe reliably removed strong tissue background, increased the contrast&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and thus improved imaging sensitivity. We have shown that PAPSI can image 0.05&#8197;nM of the nanoprobe in hemoglobin solutions and 104 labeled cancer cells after implantation in living mice using a commercial PA imager.

         <title>A Crystalline Partially Fluorinated Triazine Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline, partially fluorinated triazine covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed with broad visible&#8208;light responsiveness, improved charge separation and transfer, and enhanced O2 affinity. The COF exhibited attractive photocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for H2O2 production under visible&#8208;light irradiation, and with higher activity than previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
A partially fluorinated, metal&#8208;free, imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional triazine covalent organic framework (TF50&#8208;COF) photocatalyst was developed. Fluorine (F)&#8208;substituted and nonsubstituted units were integrated in equimolar amounts on the edge aromatic units, where they mediated two&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. F&#8208;substitution created an abundance of Lewis acid sites, which regulated the electronic distribution of adjacent carbon atoms and provided highly active sites for O2 adsorption, and widened the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range of the catalyst, while enhancing charge separation. Varying the proportion of F maximized the interlayer interactions of TF50&#8208;COF, resulting in improved crystallinity with faster carrier transfer and robust photostability. The TF50&#8208;COF catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability in O2 photoreduction into H2O2, with a high H2O2 yield rate of 1739&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 5.1&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, exceeding the performance of previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Environmentally Benign Biosynthesis of Hierarchical MOF/Bacterial Cellulose Composite Sponge for Nerve Agent Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthesized MOF&#8208;based sponge composite materials feature hierarchical pores and tunable MOF loading. They can be used for efficient nerve agent simulant catalytic hydrolysis and toxic nerve agent capture.







Abstract
The fabrication of MOF polymer composite materials enables the practical applications of MOF&#8208;based technology, in particular for protective suits and masks. However, traditional production methods typically require organic solvent for processing which leads to environmental pollution, low&#8208;loading efficiency, poor accessibility, and loss of functionality due to poor solvent resistance properties. For the first time, we have developed a microbial synthesis strategy to prepare a MOF/bacterial cellulose nanofiber composite sponge. The prepared sponge exhibited a hierarchically porous structure, high MOF loading (up to &#8776;90&#8201;%), good solvent resistance, and high catalytic activity for the liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state hydrolysis of nerve agent simulants. Moreover, the MOF/ bacterial cellulose composite sponge reported here showed a nearly 8&#8208;fold enhancement in the protection against an ultra&#8208;toxic nerve agent (GD) in permeability studies as compared to a commercialized adsorptive carbon cloth. The results shown here present an essential step toward the practical application of MOF&#8208;based protective gear against nerve agents.

         <title>NIRII&#8208;HDs: A Versatile Platform for Developing Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorogenic Probes for Reliable In Vivo Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;HD&#8208;like dyes (NIRII&#8208;HDs) with bright and stable NIR&#8208;II emission together with proper pKa is reported. By decorating the tunable hydroxyl group, the novel NIR&#8208;II dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 can serve as an effective platform to design various activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for reliable in vivo bioimaging with high contrast.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) activatable fluorescent probes can potentially provide a high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep tissue penetration. However, most of the reported NIR&#8208;II activatable small&#8208;molecule probes exhibit poor versatility owing to the lack of a general and stable optically tunable group. In this study, we designed NIRII&#8208;HDs, a novel dye scaffold optimized for NIR&#8208;II probe development. In particular, dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 showed the best optical properties such as proper pKa value, excellent stability, and high NIR&#8208;II brightness, which can be beneficial for in vivo imaging with high contrast. To demonstrate the applicability of the NIRII&#8208;HD5 dye, we designed three target&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for ROS, thiols, and enzymes. Using these novel probes, we not only realized reliable NIR&#8208;II imaging of different diseases in mouse models but also evaluated the redox potential of liver tissue during a liver injury in vivo with high fidelity.

         <title>Selective Electrooxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohols to Aldehydes in a Neutral Medium: Promoted Water Dissociation over a Nickel&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) was achieved in neutral medium over single&#8208;atom Ru supported on NiO (Ru1&#8208;NiO). Single&#8208;atom Ru sites boost HMF oxidation by facilitating water dissociation, which generates electrophilic OH* as a key reactant. The substrate scope was extended to produce aldehydes from various biomass&#8208;derived alcohols. Key: Ni (light gray), Ru (green), O (red), C (dark gray), H (white).







Abstract
The biomass&#8208;derived alcohol oxidation reaction (BDAOR) holds great promise for sustainable production of chemicals. However, selective electrooxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds is still challenging.

     alt="Selective Electrooxidation of Biomass-Derived Alcohols to Aldehydes in a Neutral Medium: Promoted Water Dissociation over a Nickel-Oxide-Supported Ruthenium Single-Atom Catalyst"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) was achieved in neutral medium over single-atom Ru supported on NiO (Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NiO). Single-atom Ru sites boost HMF oxidation by facilitating water dissociation, which generates electrophilic OH* as a key reactant. The substrate scope was extended to produce aldehydes from various biomass-derived alcohols. Key: Ni (light gray), Ru (green), O (red), C (dark gray), H (white).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biomass-derived alcohol oxidation reaction (BDAOR) holds great promise for sustainable production of chemicals. However, selective electrooxidation of alcohols to value-added aldehyde compounds is still challenging. Herein, we report the electrocatalytic BDAORs to selectively produce aldehydes using single-atom ruthenium on nickel oxide (Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NiO) as a catalyst in the neutral medium. For electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NiO exhibits a low potential of 1.283&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and an optimal 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) selectivity of 90&#8201;%. Experimental studies reveal that the neutral electrolyte plays a critical role in achieving a high aldehyde selectivity, and the single-atom Ru boosts HMF oxidation in the neutral medium by promoting water dissociation to afford OH*. Furthermore, Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NiO can be extended to selective electrooxidation of a series of biomass-derived alcohols to corresponding aldehydes, which are conventionally difficult to obtain in the alkaline medium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide Production via Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ceria&#8208;supported gold nanoparticles (2&#8211;3&#8197;nm) are highly active and selective for N2O production via NH3 oxidation, exhibiting superior stability and two orders of magnitude higher productivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art system. The interplay between interfacial Au&#948;+ species and active oxygen species supplied by ceria is key to the unprecedented performance.







Abstract
The production of nitrous oxide, N2O, via NH3 oxidation is not on a practical scale due to the lack of a suitable catalyst. Instead, it is produced via thermal decomposition of NH4NO3, rendering N2O too costly and limiting its prospective uses. Herein, we report CeO2&#8208;supported Au nanoparticles (2&#8211;3&#8197;nm) as a highly selective catalyst for low&#8208;temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher space&#8211;time yield than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Mn&#8722;Bi/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and remarkable stability over 70&#8197;h on stream. The reaction proceeds via a Mars&#8211;van Krevelen mechanism, with the density of interfacial Au&#948;+ species and the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 identified as the key performance descriptors. The latter could be enhanced by cobalt doping, improving the catalytic activity and setting a new benchmark for N2O productivity. These findings establish NH3 oxidation as an efficient process for N2O manufacture and facilitate its broader utilization in selective oxidations.

         <title>Reconfiguration and Reorganization of Bottlebrush Polymer Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key stages of bottlebrush random copolymer (BRCP) assembly at fluid interfaces are shown in the picture: Diffusion of BRCP from oil solution to the interface, reconfiguration to a hydrophilic&#8208; and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformation and interfacial adsorption (lhs), and reorganization of the BRCPs assembled at the liquid interface by in&#8208;plane diffusion (rhs).







Abstract
Bottlebrush random copolymers (BRCPs), having randomly distributed hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains, are shown to reconfigure into hydrophilic&#8208;rich and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformations at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to reduce interfacial energy. Both the degree of polymerization (NBB) and extent of grafting in these BRCPs were found to impact surface coverage and assembly kinetics. The time&#8208;dependence of the interfacial tension is described as the sum of two exponential relaxation functions characterizing BRCP diffusion, interfacial adsorption, and reorganization. Interfacial tension (&#947;) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) results showed that higher molecular weight BRCPs require longer time to adsorb to the water&#8211;oil interface, but less time for interfacial reorganization. Overall, this work describes fundamental principles of BRCP assembly at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, with implications pertaining to polymer design with enhanced understanding of emulsification, adhesion, and related properties in fluids and at interfaces.

         <title>Theoretical Optimization of Compositions of High&#8208;Entropy Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxides are investigated theoretically as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The energetics of the reaction is calculated on individual active sites following two different pathways, and it is shown that the overpotential and preferred pathway depend on the local atomic environment. A surface model is constructed in order to identify the composition that maximises the catalytic activity.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides are oxides consisting of five or more metals incorporated in a single lattice, and the large composition space suggests that properties of interest can be readily optimised. For applications within catalysis, the different local atomic environments result in a distribution of binding energies for the catalytic intermediates. Using the oxygen evolution reaction on the rutile (110) surface as example, here we outline a strategy for the theoretical optimization of the composition. Density functional theory calculations performed for a limited number of sites are used to fit a model that predicts the reaction energies for all possible local atomic environments. Two reaction pathways are considered; the conventional pathway on the coordinatively unsaturated sites and an alternative pathway involving transfer of protons to a bridging oxygen. An explicit model of the surface is constructed to describe the interdependency of the two pathways and identify the composition that maximizes catalytic activity.

         <title>Integrated Ring&#8208;Chain Design of a New Fluorinated Ether Solvent for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An integrated fluorinated ring&#8208;chain molecular approach was developed through structural modification of a low&#8208;cost, commercial ether for a new solvent 2&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (cFTOF), which served as a single ether solvent for lithium&#8208;metal batteries combining high&#8208;voltage stability up to 6&#8197;V, and regulated Li+ solvation structure, increasing Li+ ion&#8208;pairing with FSI anions in a low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration electrolyte system.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes offer promising features such as high lithium&#8208;ion solvation power and stable interface, yet their limited oxidation stability impedes application in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Whereas the fluorination of the ether backbone improves the oxidative stability, the resulting solvents lose their Li+&#8208;solvation ability. Therefore, the rational molecular design of solvents is essential to combine high redox stability with good ionic conductivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a new high&#8208;voltage fluorinated ether solvent through integrated ring&#8208;chain molecular design, which can be used as a single solvent while retaining high&#8208;voltage stability. The controlled Li+&#8208;solvation environment even at low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration (1&#8197;M or 2&#8197;M) enables a uniform and compact Li anode and an outstanding cycling stability in the Li|NCM811 full cell (20&#8197;&#956;m Li foil, N/P ratio of 4). These results show the impact of molecular design of electrolytes towards the utilization of LMBs.

         <title>Construction of an Autocatalytic Hybridization Assembly Circuit for Amplified In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reproducing dandelion&#8208;like autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit was proposed for in vivo amplified bioimaging research where the initiator promoted the autonomous cross&#8208;activation of the cascade hybridization reaction (CHR) and catalytic DNA assembly (CDA) components.







Abstract
Lowly expressed analyte in complex cytoplasmic milieu necessitates the development of non&#8208;enzymatic autocatalytic DNA circuits with high amplification and anti&#8208;interference performance. Herein, we engineered a versatile and robust stimuli&#8208;responsive autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit for high&#8208;performance in vivo bioanalysis. Under a moderately confined condition, the initiator motivated the autonomous and cooperative cross&#8208;activation of cascade hybridization reaction and catalytic DNA assembly for generating an exponentially amplified readout without the parasite steric hindrance and random diffusion side effects. The AHA circuit was systematically investigated by a series of experimental studies and theoretical simulations. The successively guaranteed target recognition and synergistically accelerated signal&#8208;amplification enabled the sensitive and selective detection of analyte, and realized the robust miRNA imaging in living cells and mice. This autocatalytic DNA circuit could substantially expand the toolbox for accurate diagnosis and programmable therapeutics.

         <title>Characterization of a Nitrogenase Iron Protein Substituted with a Synthetic [Fe4Se4] Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic [Fe4Se4] compound is incorporated into the nitrogenase iron protein, showing redox properties distinct from its [Fe4S4] counterpart that can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.







Abstract
The Fe protein of nitrogenase plays multiple roles in substrate reduction and cluster maturation via its redox&#8208;active [Fe4S4] cluster. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a water&#8208;soluble [Fe4Se4] cluster that is used to substitute the [Fe4S4] cluster of the Azotobacter vinelandii Fe protein (AvNifH). Biochemical, EPR and XAS/EXAFS analyses demonstrate the ability of the [Fe4Se4] cluster to adopt the super&#8208;reduced, all&#8208;ferrous state upon its incorporation into AvNifH. Moreover, these studies reveal that the [Fe4Se4] cluster in AvNifH already assumes a partial all&#8208;ferrous state ([Fe4Se4]0) in the presence of dithionite, where its [Fe4S4] counterpart in AvNifH exists solely in the reduced state ([Fe4S4]1+). Such a discrepancy in the redox properties of the AvNifH&#8208;associated [Fe4Se4] and [Fe4S4] clusters can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements for the substrate reduction and cluster maturation of nitrogenase, pointing to the utility of chalcogen&#8208;substituted FeS clusters in future mechanistic studies of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.

         <title>Insights into Dynamic Surface Bromide Sites in Bi4O5Br2 for Sustainable N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic N2 reduction on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 nanosheets reveals a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of the catalyst surface. Creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle.







Abstract
Simulating photosynthesis has long been one of the ideas for realizing the conversion of solar energy into industrial chemicals. Heterogeneous N2 photofixation in water is a promising way for sustainable production of ammonia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the complex aqueous photocatalytic N2 reduction is still lacking. In this study, a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of catalyst surface for N2 reduction are revealed on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 (BOB) nanosheets, in which the creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle. Our rapid scan in situ FT&#8208;IR spectra verify that photocatalytic N2 reduction proceeds through an associative alternating mechanism on BOB surface with bromine vacancies (BrV&#8208;BOB). This work provides a new strategy to combine light&#8208;dependent facilitated reaction with light&#8208;independent regeneration of catalyst for advancing sustainable ammonia production.

Exploiting target exosomes (Exos) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track: A self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free and highly sensitive detection of tumor Exos is constructed using split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous walking powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly. This STDW allows the direct detection of tumor Exos in serum and clinical samples.







Abstract
Sensitive and accurate analysis of low&#8208;concentration of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (Exos) in biofluids is essential for noninvasive cancer diagnosis but is still challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;sensitive methods with low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;operation. Herein, exploiting target Exos as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track for the first time, we developed a self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free detection of tumor Exos using exosomal glycoprotein, which was enabled by split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous running powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). Benefiting from high selectivity and sensitivity of the STDW assay, direct detection of tumor Exos in cell culture medium and serum could also be realized. Furthermore, this method exhibited high accuracy in clinical sample analysis, offering the potential for early cancer diagnosis and postoperative response prediction.

         <title>Superhydrophilic 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks as Broadband Absorbers for Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>

A 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthr&#8208;acene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) with both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions is developed for solar steam generation (SSG) and delivers an excellent water evaporation up to 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation.







Abstract
The intrinsic hydrophobicity and limited light absorption especially in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of porous organic polymers are two bottlenecks impeding their applications in solar steam generation (SSG). Herein, we develop a 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) (TPAD&#8208;COF) featuring both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering from the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions for SSG. TPAD&#8208;COF serving as a highly efficient photothermal conversion material without any additives displays an excellent water evaporation of 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under 1 sun irradiation. Further extension of the light absorption range of the TPAD&#8208;based COF is realized through post&#8208;synthetic modification by chelating BF2 moieties. Systematic control experiments and analysis confirm that the hydrophilicity of photothermal conversion materials plays a more dominant role in the current TPAD&#8208;based COFs for SSG.

&lt;p&gt;A 1,4,5,8-tetrakis(phenylamino)anthr-acene-9,10-dione (TPAD)-based covalent organic framework (COF) with both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions is developed for solar steam generation (SSG) and delivers an excellent water evaporation up to 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic hydrophobicity and limited light absorption especially in the near-infrared (NIR) region of porous organic polymers are two bottlenecks impeding their applications in solar steam generation (SSG). Herein, we develop a 1,4,5,8-tetrakis(phenylamino)anthracene-9,10-dione (TPAD)-based covalent organic framework (COF) (TPAD-COF) featuring both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering from the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions for SSG. TPAD-COF serving as a highly efficient photothermal conversion material without any additives displays an excellent water evaporation of 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under 1 sun irradiation. Further extension of the light absorption range of the TPAD-based COF is realized through post-synthetic modification by chelating BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moieties. Systematic control experiments and analysis confirm that the hydrophilicity of photothermal conversion materials plays a more dominant role in the current TPAD-based COFs for SSG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Acridinium Salts by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Cyclization of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Iminiums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of catalyst stereocontrol in Friedel&#8211;Crafts 6&#960; electrocyclizations through ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums was demonstrated. Upon stereoconvergent activation using chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts (HB*), enantioselectivity was governed by means of ion&#8208;pairing catalysis. Combined with a stereospecific oxidation, atropisomeric acridinium salts were accessible with up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 e.r. and 96&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Quinone methides are fundamental intermediates for a wide range of reactions in which catalyst stereocontrol is often achieved by hydrogen bonding. Herein, we describe the feasibility of an intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts 6&#960; electrocyclization through ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums stereocontrolled by a contact ion pair. A disulfonimide catalyst activates racemic trichloroacetimidate substrates and imparts stereocontrol in the cyclization step, providing a new avenue for selective ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminium functionalization. A highly stereospecific oxidation readily transforms the enantioenriched acridanes into rotationally restricted acridiniums. Upon ion exchange, the method selectively affords atropisomeric acridinium tetrafluoroborate salts in high yields and an enantioenrichment of up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 e.r. We envision that ion&#8208;pairing catalysis over ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums enables the selective synthesis of a diversity of heterocycles and aniline derivatives with distinct stereogenic units.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Covalent Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>

A bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (COF&#8208;TfpBpy) showed excellent activity for H2O2 photosynthesis with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.57&#8201;% at 298&#8197;K and 1.08&#8201;% at 333&#8197;K. The photocatalytic process involves a 2&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation and 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction from water and air. The photocatalytic H2O2 solution can be directly used for Rhodamine B degradation and sterilization of E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
Synthesizing H2O2 from water and air via a photocatalytic approach is ideal for efficient production of this chemical at small&#8208;scale. However, the poor activity and selectivity of the 2&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation reaction (WOR) greatly restricts the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production. Herein we prepare a bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (denoted as COF&#8208;TfpBpy) for H2O2 production from water and air. The solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency at 298&#8197;K and 333&#8197;K is 0.57&#8201;% and 1.08&#8201;%, respectively, which are higher than the current reported highest value. The resulting H2O2 solution is capable of degrading pollutants. A mechanistic study revealed that the excellent photocatalytic activity of COF&#8208;TfpBpy is due to the protonation of bipyridine monomer, which promotes the rate&#8208;determining reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; WOR) and then enhances Yeager&#8208;type oxygen adsorption to accelerate 2&#8201;e&#8722; one&#8208;step oxygen reduction. This work demonstrates, for the first time, the COF&#8208;catalyzed photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and air; and paves the way for wastewater treatment using photocatalytic H2O2 solution.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Phase Approach to Fusicoccane Synthesis To Uncover a Compound That Reduces Tumourigenesis in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;phase route for the synthesis of fusicoccane diterpenes enabled the total synthesis of alterbrassicicene D (1) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (2) and the structural determination of 2. The route yielded 15&#8197;g of 3 in eight steps from (R)&#8208;limonene and 720&#8197;mg of the penultimate intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. This penultimate intermediate was found to have tumourigenesis&#8208;abolishing potential.







Abstract
Alterbrassicicene D (1) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (2) were synthesised via a two&#8208;phase approach featuring concise construction of the 5&#8208;8&#8208;5 tricyclic intermediate and a tandem base&#8208;mediated epoxide opening&#8211;transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade to forge the complex skeleton of 2. The route is scalable and we generated 15&#8197;g of the tricyclic intermediate in 8 steps from (R)&#8208;limonene and 720&#8197;mg of the penultimate bioactive intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of 2 and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC&#8208;1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour&#8208;initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.

Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour-initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Protein Modification with Reducing Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with diverse reducing carbohydrates was developed. This method enabled the efficient and selective installation of GlcNAc moieties with a stable native&#8208;like linkage and subsequent enzymatic construction of defined oligosaccharides on proteins.







Abstract
Protein glycosylation plays critical roles in many biological processes. However, the fundamental study and application of glycobiology are hindered by the heterogeneousness of oligosaccharides in natural glycoproteins and the difficulty in constructing glycoproteins of human design. Herein, we describe a semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with reducing carbohydrates. The method involves the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified aspartate, which was subsequently quantitatively converted into alanine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydrazide (A&#946;z), and chemoselective conjugation of A&#946;z with a range of readily available reducing carbohydrates. The resulting A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc is a close mimic of native N&#8208;GlcNAc and could be installed on various proteins, including IL&#8208;17A and RNase A. Notably, A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc on proteins reacted with biantennary oligosaccharide oxazoline derivatives through endoglycosidase&#8208;catalyzed transglycosylation reactions to enable the assembly of homogeneous glycans on proteins.

         <title>DREAMTIME NMR Spectroscopy: Targeted Multi&#8208;Compound Selection with Improved Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DREAMTIME NMR overcomes spectral overlap and increases sensitivity, opening a new world for targeted NMR detection. A user can define any unique suite of compounds and isolate them without complex sample preparation. DREAMTIME can be directly joined to any existing NMR experiment (1D, nD or MRI) and holds promise for all areas of science from chemical engineering, through environmental monitoring, to medical diagnosis.







Abstract
NMR/MRI are critical tools for studying molecular structure and interactions but suffer from relatively low sensitivity and spectral overlap. Here, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) approach, termed DREAMTIME, is introduced that provides &#8220;a molecular window&#8221; inside complex systems, capable of showing only what the user desires, with complete molecular specificity. The user chooses a list of molecules of interest, and the approach detects only those targets while all other molecules are invisible. The approach is demonstrated in whole human blood and urine, small living aquatic organisms in 1D/2D NMR, and MRI. Finally, as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, once overlap is removed via DREAMTIME, a novel &#8220;multi&#8208;focusing&#8221; approach can be used to increase sensitivity. In human blood and urine, sensitivity increases of 7&#8211;12 fold over standard 1H NMR are observed. Applicable even to unknowns, DREAMTIME has widespread application, from monitoring product formation in organic chemistry to monitoring/identifying suites of molecular targets in complex media or in vivo.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer and Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel donor&#8208;pillar[5]arene&#8208;acceptor structure with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property shows a twisted conformation and intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). Balancing of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission via viscosity and polar guest generates the single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission.







Abstract
The fabrication of single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission (SMWLE) materials has become a highly studied topic in recent years and through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is emerging as an important concept in this field. However, the preparation of ideal TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a bifunctional pillar[5]arene (TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA) with a linear donor&#8208;spacer&#8208;acceptor structure and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. The bulky pillar[5]arene between the donor and acceptor induces a twisted conformation and a non&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in intramolecular TSCT. In addition, the AIE feature and pillar[5]arene cavity endow TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA with responsiveness to viscosity and polar guests, by which the TSCT emission is triggered. The combination of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission of TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA generates SMWLE. Therefore, we provide a new and versatile strategy for the construction of TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials.

         <title>Multiple Emission of Phosphonium Fluorophores Harnessed by the Pathways of Photoinduced Counterion Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of a series of multipolar donor&#8211;acceptor phosphonium fluorophores (D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;)nA+[X&#8722;] have been investigated. These dyes exhibit steady&#8208;state panchromatic luminescence attributed to the photoinduced counterion migration. The intra&#8208;ion&#8208;pair dynamics and the fluorescence response can be rationally tuned on the molecular level that might broaden the scope of functionalities and stimulate the development of new ionic systems.







Abstract
In the emerging field of intramolecular charge transfer induced counterion migration, we report the new insights into photophysical features of luminescent donor&#8211;acceptor phosphonium dyes (D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;)nA+[X&#8722;] (&#960;=&#8722;(C6H4)x&#8722;). The unique connectivity of the phosphorus atom affords multipolar molecules with a variable number of arms and the electronic properties of the acceptor group. In the ion&#8208;paired form, the transition from dipolar to quadrupolar configuration enhances the low energy migration&#8208;induced band by providing the additional pathways for anion motion. The multipolar architecture, adjustable lengths of the &#960;&#8208;spacers and the nature of counterions allow for efficient tuning of the emission and achieving nearly pure white light with quantum yields around 30&#8201;%. The methyl substituent at the phosphorus atom reduces the rate of ion migration and suppresses the red shifted bands, simultaneously improving total emission intensity. The results unveil the harnessing of the multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores by anion migration via structure and branching of donor&#8211;acceptor arms.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete metal&#8211;organic cages with polyoxotungstate nodes were assembled from a tritopic Keggin cluster, {SiW9Ni4}, and rigid dicarboxylates. Varying the bend angles of the linkers from 122&#176; to 180&#176; allows a set of POM2nL3n&#8208;type cages to be realized. The fact they can serve as highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 reduction opens up future opportunities for novel functions and applications by taking advantage of the confinement effect of their void spaces.







Abstract
A tritopic, Ni&#8208;substituted Keggin cluster, {SiW9Ni4}, assembles with rigid dicarboxylate linkers to give rise to a set of discrete, POM2nL3n&#8208;type structures (POM={SiW9Ni4}) with defined interior voids. The outcome of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assemblies of these polyhedral cages&#8212;from fused dimers to trigonal prisms&#8212;was found to be sensitive to bend angles of the ditopic ligands, which vary from 122&#176; to 180&#176;. These polyoxotungstate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra, when coupled with [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as a photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, serve as highly effective catalysts for CO2 reduction, with turnover numbers up to 328 and CO selectivity as high as 96.2&#8201;%. The inner cavities of such cage structures, if functionalized or of sufficient size to encapsulate targeted guest molecules, could present a new strategy towards functional materials for potential applications.

         <title>Predicting the Solubility of Inorganic Ion Pairs in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using alkali&#8208;polyoxometalate salts, a previously&#8208;undescribed solubility trend in polyoxometalate chemistry was discovered, termed anomalous solubility. Mapping charge&#8208;density on inorganic polyatomic anions along with an artificial neural network accurately describes and predicts solubility trends of alkali&#8208;anion pairs. Solubility experiments to validate computation lead to new POMs discovery.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), ranging in size from 1 to 10&#8217;s of nanometers, resemble building blocks of inorganic materials. Elucidating their complex solubility behavior with alkali&#8208;counterions can inform natural and synthetic aqueous processes. In the study of POMs ([Nb24O72H9]15&#8722;, Nb24) we discovered an unusual solubility trend (termed anomalous solubility) of alkali&#8208;POMs, in which Nb24 is most soluble with the smallest (Li+) and largest (Rb/Cs+) alkalis, and least soluble with Na/K+. Via computation, we define a descriptor (&#963;&#8208;profile) and use an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict all three described alkali&#8208;anion solubility trends: amphoteric, normal (Li+&gt;Na+&gt;K+&gt;Rb+&gt;Cs+), and anomalous (Cs+&gt;Rb+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+). Testing predicted amphoteric solubility affirmed the accuracy of the descriptor, provided solution&#8208;phase snapshots of alkali&#8211;POM interactions, yielded a new POM formulated [Ti6Nb14O54]14&#8722;, and provides guidelines to exploit alkali&#8211;POM interactions for new POMs discovery.

         <title>Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular machine is presented that uses the light&#8208;powered unidirectional rotation trajectory of a molecular motor to actively thread a tetraethylene glycol chain through a macrocyclic ring. This molecular setup thus realizes the miniaturization of macroscopic threading providing a fundamental entry step into mechanical molecular weaving or sewing processes.







Abstract
Molecular motors transform external energy input into directional motions and offer exquisite precision for nano&#8208;scale manipulations. To make full use of molecular motor capacities, their directional motions need to be transmitted and used for powering downstream molecular events. Here we present a macrocyclic molecular motor structure able to perform repetitive molecular threading of a flexible tetraethylene glycol chain through the macrocycle. This mechanical threading event is actively powered by the motor and leads to a direct translation of the unidirectional motor rotation into unidirectional translation motion (chain versus ring). The mechanism of the active mechanical threading is elucidated and the actual threading step is identified as a combined helix inversion and threading event. The established molecular machine function resembles the crucial step of macroscopic weaving or sewing processes and therefore offers a first entry point to a &#8220;molecular knitting&#8221; counterpart.

         <title>Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Nonfullerene Acceptor with Ultralow Nonradiative Voltage Loss for High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with an over 40&#8197;nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 is designed and synthesized. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8208;based binary cell exhibits the lowest nonradiative voltage loss of 0.15&#8197;eV ever achieved by organic solar cells (OSCs). Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8208;based semitransparent (ST)&#8208;OSCs, for the first time, achieve a power conversion efficiency of 14&#8201;% with an average visible transmittance over 20&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) are considered as one of the most valuable applications of OSCs and a strong contender in the market. However, the optical band gap of current high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OSCs is still not low enough to achieve the optimal balance between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). An N&#8208;substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with over 40&#8197;nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 was designed and synthesized, based on which the device with PM6 as donor obtained a PCE of 14.3&#8201;%, accompanied with a nonradiative voltage loss as low as 0.15&#8197;eV. Meanwhile, ternary devices with the addition of SN into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 can achieve a PCE of 17.5&#8201;% with an unchanged open&#8208;circuit voltage and improved short&#8208;circuit current. Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss, ST&#8208;OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 were fabricated and the optimized device demonstrated a PCE of 14.0&#8201;% at an AVT of 20.2&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE at an AVT over 20&#8201;%.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticle Library with Precise pH Tunability by Co&#8208;Polymerization with Non&#8208;Ionizable Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy for the development of an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive nanoparticle library with precisely tuned pH transitions (pHt=4.0&#8211;7.4) was proposed through co&#8208;polymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The nanoprobe library exhibits excellent barcode imaging of endosome maturation and precise cancer imaging.







Abstract
Precise monitoring of the subtle pH fluctuation during biological events remains a big challenge. Previously, we reported an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive (UPS) nanoprobe library with a sharp pH response using co&#8208;polymerization of two tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers with distinct pKa. Currently, we have generalized the UPS nanoparticle library with tunable pH transitions (pHt) by copolymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The pHt of nanoparticles is fine&#8208;tuned by the non&#8208;ionizable monomers with different hydrophobicity. Each non&#8208;ionizable monomer presents a constant contribution to pH tunability regardless of tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers. Based on this strategy, we produced two libraries of nanoprobes with continuous pHt covering the entire physiological pH range (5.0&#8211;7.4) for fluorescent imaging of endosome maturation and cancers. This generalized strategy provides a powerful toolkit for biological studies and cancer theranostics.

&lt;p&gt;A generalized strategy for the development of an ultra-pH-sensitive nanoparticle library with precisely tuned pH transitions (pH&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=4.0&#8211;7.4) was proposed through co-polymerization of a tertiary amine-containing monomer with a series of non-ionizable monomers. The nanoprobe library exhibits excellent barcode imaging of endosome maturation and precise cancer imaging.

         <title>Tailoring a Nanochaperone to Regulate &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanochaperone for &#945;&#8208;synuclein was designed and fabricated to prevent the misassembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein. The nanochaperone, termed &#945;S&#8208;nChap, dynamically and transiently captures monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its oligomerization. Moreover, &#945;S&#8208;nChap tightly captures oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its fibrillization.







Abstract
Protein misassembly leads to the formation of dysfunctional and toxic molecular species relating to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tailored a nanochaperone (&#945;S&#8208;nChap) for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to regulate its assembly. The &#945;S&#8208;nChap is capable of i)&#8197;specifically recognizing &#945;&#8208;synuclein; ii)&#8197;dynamically capturing and stabilizing monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and retarding oligomerization; iii)&#8197;tightly capturing oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein to prevent fibrillization; and iv)&#8197;transporting &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers to the lysosomal degradation system. The regulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein assembly by &#945;S&#8208;nChap was studied in vitro. Moreover, the role of &#945;S&#8208;nChap preventing &#945;&#8208;synuclein pathology in cells and protecting neurons from apoptosis was investigated. The strategy of tailoring a nanochaperone to regulate aberrant assembly of pathogenic proteins provides important insights into protein misfolding diseases. We foresee that &#945;S&#8208;nChap has therapeutic value for Parkinson's disease.

         <title>Asymmetrical&#8208;Dendronized TADF Emitters for Efficient Non&#8208;doped Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs by Eliminating Degenerate Excited States and Creating Solely Thermal Equilibrium Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two asymmetric &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8221; and &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8208;half&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; TADF emitters eliminate degenerate excited states, assuring a solely thermal equilibrium route for an effective spin&#8208;flip process. AEE properties can minimize the exciton quenching. The isolated encapsulating tricarbazole unit protects the TADF unit, reducing nonradiative decay. Non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a remarkably high EQEmax of 24.0&#8201;% and low roll&#8208;off are achieved.







Abstract
The mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in dendrimers is not clear. We report that fully&#8208;conjugated or fully&#8208;nonconjugated structures cause unwanted degenerate excited states due to multiple identical dendrons, which limit their TADF efficiency. We have synthesized asymmetrical &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8221; and &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8208;half&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; emitters. By eliminating degenerate excited states, the triplet locally excited state is &#8805;0.3&#8197;eV above the lowest triplet charge&#8208;transfer state, assuring a solely thermal equilibrium route for an effective spin&#8208;flip process. The isolated encapsulating tricarbazole unit can protect the TADF unit, reducing nonradiative decay and enhancing TADF performance. Non&#8208;doped solution&#8208;processed devices reach a high external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.0&#8201;% (65.9&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 59.2&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) with CIE coordinates of (0.24, 0.45) with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off and EQEs of 23.6&#8201;% and 21.3&#8201;% at 100 and 500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <dc:description>
A novel design principle of polymerization and fluorination for salt anions has been proposed and lithiated Nafion (LN) was suggested as a representative soluble lithium salt for the polyelectrolyte solution to improve the Li+ transfer number and produce a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Furthermore, the perfluorinated backbone of LN delivers the polyelectrolyte solution low flammability. Thus, making the Li&#8722;O2 batteries realize all&#8208;round performance amelioration.







Abstract
The severe performance degradation of high&#8208;capacity Li&#8722;O2 batteries induced by Li dendrite growth and concentration polarization from the low Li+ transfer number of conventional electrolytes hinder their practical applications. Herein, lithiated Nafion (LN) with the sulfonic group immobilized on the perfluorinated backbone has been designed as a soluble lithium salt for preparing a less flammable polyelectrolyte solution, which not only simultaneously achieves a high Li+ transfer number (0.84) and conductivity (2.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1), but also the perfluorinated anion of LN produces a LiF&#8208;rich SEI for protecting the Li anode from dendrite growth. Thus, the Li&#8722;O2 battery with a LN&#8208;based electrolyte achieves an all&#8208;round performance improvement, like low charge overpotential (0.18&#8197;V), large discharge capacity (9508&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (225&#8197;cycles). Besides, the fabricated pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;air cells exhibit promising applications to power electronic equipment with satisfactory safety.

         <title>A Pair of Atypical KAS III Homologues with Initiation and Elongation Functions Program the Polyketide Biosynthesis in Asukamycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
KAS IIIs are known to be involved in the initiation step of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In vitro reconstitution of the upper triene chain of asukamycin unveils two highly unusual KAS IIIs which both exhibit initiation and iterative elongation activity. Together with the permissive ketoreductase and dehydratase, these C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes can synthesize a large variety of polyenes.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III (KAS III) is a class of important C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes that mostly catalyze the initiation of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we elucidated an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) system that involves two unique KAS IIIs (AsuC3 and C4) in the biosynthesis of the upper triene chain of asukamycin. Significantly, AsuC3 and C4 have both initiation and iterative elongation activity, while being functionally biased toward the elongation and initiation steps, respectively. Mutational analysis revealed that their catalytic activities rely on the catalytic triad Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Asn. Unlike other KAS IIIs, AsuC3 and C4 are very promiscuous and can accept various lengths of acyl&#8208;CoAs with either cyclic, branched or linear acyl moieties. By cooperation with the permissive ketoreductase (AsuC7) and dehydratase (AsuC8/C9), a large variety of polyenes can be efficiently synthesized.

&lt;p&gt;KAS IIIs are known to be involved in the initiation step of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In vitro reconstitution of the upper triene chain of asukamycin unveils two highly unusual KAS IIIs which both exhibit initiation and iterative elongation activity. Together with the permissive ketoreductase and dehydratase, these C&#8722;C bond-forming enzymes can synthesize a large variety of polyenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#946;-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (KAS III) is a class of important C&#8722;C bond-forming enzymes that mostly catalyze the initiation of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we elucidated an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) system that involves two unique KAS IIIs (AsuC3 and C4) in the biosynthesis of the upper triene chain of asukamycin. Significantly, AsuC3 and C4 have both initiation and iterative elongation activity, while being functionally biased toward the elongation and initiation steps, respectively. Mutational analysis revealed that their catalytic activities rely on the catalytic triad Cys-His-Asn. Unlike other KAS IIIs, AsuC3 and C4 are very promiscuous and can accept various lengths of acyl-CoAs with either cyclic, branched or linear acyl moieties. By cooperation with the permissive ketoreductase (AsuC7) and dehydratase (AsuC8/C9), a large variety of polyenes can be efficiently synthesized. This study significantly broadens the understanding of KAS IIIs and polyketide biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Soft Alloys Constructed with Distinct Mesoatoms via Self&#8208;Sorting Assembly of Giant Shape Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional metal alloy&#8208;originated superlattices with large volume asymmetry were successfully constructed in soft matter by blending binary giant shape amphiphiles, especially including a first experimentally observed CaCu5 phase in soft matter. Furthermore, the thermodynamic origin of these superlattices was also quantitatively analyzed by isoperimetric quotient.







Abstract
The packing structures of spherical motifs affect the properties of resultant condensed materials such as in metal alloys. Inspired by the classic metallurgy, developing complex alloy&#8208;like packing phases in soft matter (also called &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;) is promising for the next&#8208;generation superlattice engineering. Nevertheless, the formation of many alloy&#8208;like phases in single&#8208;component soft matter is usually thermodynamically unfavourable and technically challenging. Here, we utilize a novel self&#8208;sorting assembly approach to tackle this challenge in binary blends of soft matter. Two types of giant shape amphiphiles self&#8208;sort to form their discrete spherical motifs, which further simultaneously pack into alloy&#8208;like phases. Three unconventional spherical packing phases have been observed in these binary systems, including MgZn2, NaZn13, and CaCu5 phases. It's the first time that the CaCu5 phase is experimentally observed in soft matter. This work demonstrates a general approach to constructing unconventional spherical packing phases and other complex superlattices in soft matter.

         <title>Emissive Platinum(II) Macrocycles as Tunable Cascade Energy Transfer Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive PtII macrocycles decorated with hydrophobic alkyl chains are developed as scaffolds for artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems with sequential energy transfer capabilities. These molecules have tunable aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties and form spherical aggregates upon self&#8208;assembly in water&#8211;acetone medium. A strategy to control the light&#8208;harvesting efficiency by changing hydrophobic chain length is shown.







Abstract
Developing artificial light&#8208;harvesting scaffolds with a cascade energy transfer process is significant for better understanding of photosynthesis. Here, we report [3+3] self&#8208;assembled PtII fluorescent macrocycles (3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b) as light&#8208;harvesting platforms with cascade energy transfer. The PtII macrocycles aggregate into nanospheres and show emission&#8208;enhancement characteristics upon increasing water content in acetone medium. These aggregates (3aa and 3ba) serve as energy donors when mixed with the hydrophobic dye Eosin&#8208;Y (ESY). In the presence of a second dye, Nile Red (NiR), an unusual sequential two&#8208;step energy transfer takes place from the macrocycles to NiR. In this case, ESY acts as a bridge in the relay mode. Additionally, a unique strategy to control such an energy transfer process by tuning the chain length of the alkyl group attached to the periphery of the macrocycles is demonstrated.

         <title>Cystine Knot Peptides with Tuneable Activity and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Separate approaches for tuning the activity of cystine knot peptides are reported. Protease inhibitors were designed that had light&#8208;controlled activity and could be switched ON against new targets, or had an affinity tag that allowed inhibitors to be switched OFF. These peptides enabled modulation of target activity with exquisite temporal control.







Abstract
Knottins are topologically complex peptides that are stabilised by a cystine knot and have exceptionally diverse functions, including protease inhibition. However, approaches for tuning their activity in situ are limited. Here, we demonstrate separate approaches for tuning the activity of knottin protease inhibitors using light or streptavidin. We show that the inhibitory activity and selectivity of an engineered knottin can be controlled with light by activating a second mode of action that switches the inhibitor ON against new targets. Guided by a knottin library screen, we also identify a position in the inhibitor's binding loop that permits insertion of a biotin tag without impairing activity. Using streptavidin, biotinylated knottins with nanomolar affinity can be switched OFF in activity assays, and the anticoagulant activity of a factor XIIa inhibitor can be rapidly switched OFF in human plasma. Our findings expand the scope of engineered knottins for precisely controlling protein function.

         <title>A Rational Biphasic Tailoring Strategy Enabling High&#8208;Performance Layered Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational biphasic tailoring strategy to prepare layered composite cathodes with the desired phase ratio is proposed. Benefiting from the reversible phase transition within transition metal slabs and the decreased structure strain at the phase boundary of the intergrowth structure during Na extraction and insertion, the Com&#8208;NaNMFT composite material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes usually exhibit high compositional diversity, thus providing controllable electrochemical performance for Na&#8208;ion batteries. These abundant components lead to complicated structural chemistry, closely affecting the stacking preference, phase transition and Na+ kinetics. With this perspective, we explore the thermodynamically stable phase diagram of various P2/O3 composites based on a rational biphasic tailoring strategy. Then a specific P2/O3 composite is investigated and compared with its monophasic counterparts. A highly reversible structural evolution of P2/O3&#8211;P2/O3/P3&#8211;P2/P3&#8211;P2/Z/O3&#8242;&#8211;Z/O3&#8242; based on the Ni2+/Ni3.5+, Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3.8+/Mn4+ redox couples upon sequential Na extraction/insertion is revealed. The reduced structural strain at the phase boundary alleviates the phase transition and decreases the lattice mismatch during cycling, endowing the biphasic electrode a large reversible capacity of 144&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with the energy density approaching 514&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Linker Molecules Convert Commercial Fluorophores into Tailored Functional Probes during Biolabelling</title>

Fluorophore functionality with a click: A new biolabelling strategy using bespoke linker structures is introduced that allows to convert commercially available fluorophores into functional probes with high photostability (self&#8208;healing dyes) or dyes with the ability to sense bivalent metal ions resulting in blinking emission.







Abstract
Many life&#8208;science techniques and assays rely on selective labeling of biological target structures with commercial fluorophores that have specific yet invariant properties. Consequently, a fluorophore (or dye) is only useful for a limited range of applications, e.g., as a label for cellular compartments, super&#8208;resolution imaging, DNA sequencing or for a specific biomedical assay. Modifications of fluorophores with the goal to alter their bioconjugation chemistry, photophysical or functional properties typically require complex synthesis schemes. We here introduce a general strategy that allows to customize these properties during biolabelling with the goal to introduce the fluorophore in the last step of biolabelling. For this, we present the design and synthesis of &#8216;linker&#8217; compounds, that bridge biotarget, fluorophore and a functional moiety via well&#8208;established labeling protocols. Linker molecules were synthesized via the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) which facilitates a modular design of linkers with diverse functional properties and bioconjugation&#8208; and fluorophore attachment moieties. To demonstrate the possibilities of different linkers experimentally, we characterized the ability of commercial fluorophores from the classes of cyanines, rhodamines, carbopyronines and silicon&#8208;rhodamines to become functional labels on different biological targets in vitro and in vivo via thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry. With our strategy, we showed that the same commercial dye can become a photostable self&#8208;healing dye or a sensor for bivalent ions subject to the linker used. Finally, we quantified the photophysical performance of different self&#8208;healing linker&#8211;fluorophore conjugates and demonstrated their applications in super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy.

         <title>Highly Efficient Conversion of Propargylic Alcohols and Propargylic Amines with CO2 Activated by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 with a yolk&#8211;shell structure was synthesized, and it represents the first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can effectively catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cyclization reactions of propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 are important in industrial applications, but it was a great challenge that non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts catalyzed both reactions under mild conditions. Herein, the catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 was prepared by encapsulating Cu2O nanoparticles into robust ZIF&#8208;8, and it can effectively catalyze the cyclization of both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 into valuable &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonates and oxazolidinones with turnover numbers (TONs) of 12.1 and 19.6, which can be recycled at least five times. The mechanisms were further uncovered by NMR, FTIR, 13C isotope&#8208;labeling experiments and DFT calculations, in which Cu2O and DBU can synergistically activate the C&#8801;C bond and the hydroxy/amino group of substrates. Importantly, it is the first example of a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 simultaneously.

A game of two halves Direct ammonia oxidation unlocks a pathway towards affordable and efficient production of nitrous oxide, a highly promising agent for selective oxidation reactions, but necessitates the development of suitable catalysts. In their Research Article (e202200772), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between Au nanoparticles and CeO2 support results in a material with unprecedented levels of N2O selectivity and productivity, far surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems.

         <title>Inside Cover: Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 19/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular motor setup that allows harnessing the trajectory of directional motor rotation for an active mechanical threading process is presented by Henry Dube and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202201882). The motor is embedded into a macrocycle and its indane&#8208;based rotor fragment then serves as a &#8220;revolving door&#8221; in the light&#8208;driven rotation. In this way a process akin to macroscopic threading of a needle is miniaturized to the molecular level, offering a first entry point to mechanical molecular knitting or weaving processes.

The Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) was applied by Andreas Herrmann, Thorben Cordes, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202112959) to synthesize a library of linker molecules (illustrated as the ESA space gateway) to link biological targets (the space shuttle) to commercially available fluorescent dyes (the Orion service modules). The modular design of the Ugi&#8208;4CR allows the addition of different functional groups to the linkers, which in turn alter the properties of the fluorophore. Functional groups were introduced that turned a variety of fluorophores into highly stable self&#8208;healing dyes or metal&#8208;chelating dyes during biolabelling.

         <title>From Structural Design to Functional Construction: Amine Molecules in High&#8208;Performance Formamidinium&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural design of amine molecules is effective for functional construction of perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer in perovskite solar cells. High&#8208;efficiency and robust perovskite solar cells can be achieved through crystal regulation of formamidinium&#8208;based perovskites and improvement of the specific perovskite properties including defect condition, charge transfer, and moisture resistance.







Abstract
Formamidinium (FA) based perovskites are considered as one of the most promising light&#8208;absorbing perovskite materials owing to their narrower band gap and better thermal stability compared to conventional methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Constant improvement by using various additives stimulates the potential application of these perovskites. Amine molecules with different structures have been widely used as typical additives in FA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, and decent performances have been achieved. Thus, a systematic review focusing on structural regulation and functional construction of amines in FA&#8208;based perovskites is of significance. Herein, we analyze the construction mechanism of different structural amines on the functional perovskite crystals. The influence of amine molecules on specific perovskite properties including defect conditions, charge transfer, and moisture resistance are evaluated. Finally, we summarize the design rules of amine molecules for the application in high&#8208;performance FA&#8208;based perovskites and propose directions for the future development of additive molecules.

         <title>Molecular Catalysts for the Reductive Homocoupling of CO2 towards C2+ Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent progress in molecular catalysis of CO2 and CO homocoupling through thermochemical and electrochemical reductive approaches. Particular attention is paid to C&#8722;C coupling processes that generate multicarbon products. The current challenges in this rapidly growing field are described and perspectives for possible future developments are outlined.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into multicarbon (C2+) compounds by reductive homocoupling offers the possibility to transform renewable energy into chemical energy carriers and thereby create &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; fuels or other valuable products. Most available studies have employed heterogeneous metallic catalysts, but the use of molecular catalysts is still underexplored. However, several studies have already demonstrated the great potential of the molecular approach, namely, the possibility to gain a deep mechanistic understanding and a more precise control of the product selectivity. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in both the thermo&#8208; and electrochemical reductive homocoupling of CO2 toward C2+ products mediated by molecular catalysts. In addition, reductive CO homocoupling is discussed as a model for the further conversion of intermediates obtained from CO2 reduction, which may serve as a source of inspiration for developing novel molecular catalysts in the future.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Erectones A and B, and the Revised Structure of Hyperelodione D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical speculation on the biosynthesis of hyperelodione D leads to its structural reassignment via a concise total synthesis. The key step is a bioinspired, Diels&#8211;Alder cascade reaction between E,E&#8208;&#945;&#8208;farnesene and a naturally occurring quinone that generates three rings and six stereocentres.







Abstract
The field of biomimetic synthesis seeks to apply biosynthetic hypotheses to the efficient construction of complex natural products. This approach can also guide the revision of incorrectly assigned structures. Herein, we describe the evolution of a concise total synthesis and structural reassignment of hyperelodione D, a tetracyclic meroterpenoid derived from a Hypericum plant, alongside some biogenetically related natural products, erectones A and B. The key step in the synthesis of hyperelodione D forms six stereocentres and three rings in a bioinspired cascade reaction that features an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, an intramolecular Prins reaction and a terminating cycloetherification.

         <title>Designing a Network of Crystalline Polymers for a Scalable, Nonfluorinated, Healable and Amphiphobic Solid Slippery Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A healable amphiphobic solid slippery coating is derived through the formation of a crystalline network of &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymers in a porous polymeric coating, where the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction provided a porous and substrate&#8208;independent polymeric coating to develop a non&#8208;fluorinated and optically transparent slippery interface for sliding beaded droplets of water, crude/refined oils and polar/non&#8208;polar solvents.







Abstract
The fluorinated&#8208;liquid infused amphiphobic slippery interfaces exhibiting superior sliding of the beaded oil/water droplets, often suffer from durability and contamination issues. Here, the ability of 1)&#8197;hexagonal packing of hydrocarbon sides in a selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer and 2)&#8197;its reversible phase transition at 51&#8201;&#176;C was rationally exploited to achieve temperature&#8208;assisted rapid (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitive (50 times) self&#8208;healable amphiphobic solid&#8208;slippery coating on both planar and geometrically&#8208;complex substrates. The selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer was strategically infused in a porous, hydrophilic and thick (&#8776;4.8&#8197;&#956;m) polymeric coating. The resultant solid and smooth interface exhibited sliding of beaded droplets of various liquids, including droplets of water, polar (ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, 1&#8208;hexanol, DMSO, DMF), and non&#8208;polar (decane, dodecane, diiodomethane) organic solvents, edible (vegetable oil), motor, engine (petrol, diesel, kerosene) and crude oils.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Promoted ZnMe/ZnPh Exchange in Eight&#8208;Coordinate [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of the 8&#8208;coordinate RuZn4 heterobimetallic complex [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2] with ZnPh2 leads to complete ZnMe/ZnPh exchange to form [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2]. Both species exhibit equilibria in solution with their alternative 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers and DFT calculations define facile isomerisation and hydride&#8208;assisted ZnMe/ZnPh exchange pathways.







Abstract
The syntheses, reactivity and electronic structure analyses of [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2], 1&#8201;a, and [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2], 2&#8201;b, are reported. 1&#8201;a exhibits an 8&#8208;coordinate Ru centre with axial phosphines and a symmetrical (2&#8201;:&#8201;2) arrangement of ZnMe ligands in the equatorial plane. The ZnMe ligands in 1&#8201;a undergo facile, sequential exchange with ZnPh2 to give 2&#8201;b, which shows a 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 arrangement of ZnPh ligands. Both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b exist in equilibrium with their respective 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers. Mechanisms for ZnMe/ZnPh exchange and isomerisation are proposed using DFT calculations. The relationships of these {Ru(ZnR)4H2} species to isoelectronic Group 8 transition metal polyhydrides and related Schlenk equilibria in the Negishi reaction are discussed.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Aminocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of simple imide&#8208;directed intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of aminocyclopropanes enabled by iridium catalysis has been developed. The reaction proceeds via six&#8208;membered metallacycles. The method could tolerate a broad spectrum of functional groups, affording a vast array of chiral aminocyclopropanes (36 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controllable C&#8722;H functionalization remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we disclose the first example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aminocyclopropanes by using simple imides as weakly coordinating directing groups under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded via a six&#8208;membered iridacycle, affording a vast range of chiral aminocyclopropyl boronates. The current method features a broad spectrum of functional groups (36 examples) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%). We also demonstrated the synthetic utility by a preparative scale C&#8722;H borylation, C&#8722;B bond transformations, and conversion of the directing group.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of simple imide-directed intermolecular enantioselective C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H functionalization of aminocyclopropanes enabled by iridium catalysis has been developed. The reaction proceeds via six-membered metallacycles. The method could tolerate a broad spectrum of functional groups, affording a vast array of chiral aminocyclopropanes (36 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal-catalyzed regio- and stereo-controllable C&#8722;H functionalization remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we disclose the first example of iridium-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H borylation of aminocyclopropanes by using simple imides as weakly coordinating directing groups under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded via a six-membered iridacycle, affording a vast range of chiral aminocyclopropyl boronates. The current method features a broad spectrum of functional groups (36 examples) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%). We also demonstrated the synthetic utility by a preparative scale C&#8722;H borylation, C&#8722;B bond transformations, and conversion of the directing group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Symmetry Breaking of Monoacylated Anhydroerythritols and meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols through Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols and acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols with a cis configuration revealed that four compounds crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. All compounds racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals of 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
We developed a chiral symmetry breaking method for monoacylated meso diols. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols, meso cyclic diols with a cis configuration, revealed that the O&#8208;(p&#8208;anisoyl) derivative crystallized as a racemic conglomerate of the P212121 crystal system. It was confirmed that the substrate racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Evaporating the solvent gradually from the solution or Viedma ripening to promote crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals. These results provide the first successful example of asymmetric expression and amplification by deracemization of sugar derivatives without an external chemical chiral source. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols. Three O&#8208;monoacylated substrates were successfully deracemized to 99&#8201;% ee by Viedma ripening. We also developed asymmetric desymmetrization of meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols by combining acylation and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Electrophile Synthesis of Di(hetero)arylmethanes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfinative C&#8722;C Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
Benzylic halides and heteroaryl halides are directly coupled using Pd&#8208;catalysis and a simple sulfinate transfer reagent. The reactions proceed by formation of an intermediate benzylic sulfinate, formed in situ, and deliver di(hetero)arylmethane products. The reactions use only commercial components, and no stoichiometric metal reductant is needed.







Abstract
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling to access medicinally relevant di(hetero)arylmethanes is reported. The method is reductant&#8208;free, and involves a sulfinate transfer reagent and a Pd&#8208;catalyst mediating the union of two electrophilic coupling partners; a (hetero)aryl halide and a benzyl halide. We establish for the first time that benzyl sulfinates, generated in situ, undergo efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl halides to generate di(hetero)arylmethanes. The reaction can be extended to benzylic pseudohalides derived from benzyl alcohols. The reactions are straightforward to perform and scalable, and all reaction components are commercially available.

         <title>Studying the Key Intermediate of RNA Autohydrolysis by Cryogenic Gas&#8208;Phase Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA autohydrolysis is a generic phenomenon in solution and proceeds via a 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic nucleotide intermediate. Cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations show that the structure of c&#8208;fragments generated by the dissociation of RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase is equal to the key intermediate of RNA autohydrolysis. Furthermore, the data show that the nucleobase in cytidine phosphate readily tautomerizes in the gas phase.







Abstract
Over the course of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, mRNA&#8208;based vaccines have gained tremendous importance. The development and analysis of modified RNA molecules benefit from advanced mass spectrometry and require sufficient understanding of fragmentation processes. Analogous to the degradation of RNA in solution by autohydrolysis, backbone cleavage of RNA strands was equally observed in the gas phase; however, the fragmentation mechanism remained elusive. In this work, autohydrolysis&#8208;like intermediates were generated from isolated RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase and investigated using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets. Data from both experiment and density functional theory provide evidence for the formation of a five&#8208;membered cyclic phosphate intermediate and rule out linear or six&#8208;membered structures. Furthermore, the experiments show that another prominent condensed&#8208;phase reaction of RNA nucleotides can be induced in the gas phase: the tautomerization of cytosine. Both observed reactions are therefore highly universal and intrinsic properties of the investigated molecules.

         <title>Estimating Phosphorescent Emission Energies in IrIII Complexes Using Large&#8208;Scale Quantum Computing Simulations**

         <dc:description>
The iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) quantum method was used to calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in phosphorescent IrIII complexes. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 logical qubits. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals studied, setting an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.







Abstract
Here we calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in nine phosphorescent iridium complexes using the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method to determine if quantum simulations have any advantages over classical methods. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 fully&#8208;connected logical qubits. Since such devices do not yet exist, we demonstrate the iQCC method using a purpose&#8208;built quantum simulator on classical hardware. The results are compared to a selection of common DFT functionals, ab initio methods, and empirical data. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals, but with a better correlation coefficient, demonstrating that it is better at predicting the structure&#8211;property relationship. Results indicate that the iQCC method has the required accuracy to design organometallic complexes when deployed on emerging quantum hardware and sets an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides Catalyzed by a Single H&#8208;Bond Donor Organocatalyst</title>

A simple prolinamide bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor urea function catalyzes the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction between tryptamines and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses.







Abstract
The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction (PSR) with aldehydes is well known. However, PSR involving ketones as electrophilic partners is far&#8208;less developed. We report herein the first examples of catalytic enantioselective PSR of tryptamines with &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. A new class of easily accessible prolyl&#8208;urea organocatalysts bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor function catalyzes the title reaction to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic isotope effect using C2&#8208;deuterium&#8208;labelled tryptamine indicates that the rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208; and the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating Colloidal Co&#8208;Assemblies That Accelerate Their Own Destruction via Chemo&#8208;Structural Feedback</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;structural feedback mechanism is introduced in co&#8208;assembling microgels (MGs), whereby the co&#8208;assemblies promote their own destruction. The key concept uses co&#8208;assembly&#8208;triggered proximity effects of enzymes immobilized on individual MGs so that the co&#8208;assembly enhances an enzymatic cascade for deactivator production.







Abstract
Biological self&#8208;assemblies self&#8208; and cross&#8208;regulate each other via chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and feedback. Although artificial transient self&#8208;assemblies have been realized via activation/deactivation CRNs, the transient structures themselves do mostly not engage in the CRN. We introduce a rational design approach for chemo&#8208;structural feedback, and present a transient colloidal co&#8208;assembly system, where the formed co&#8208;assemblies accelerate their destruction autonomously. We achieve this by immobilizing enzymes of a deactivating acid&#8208;producing enzymatic cascade on pH&#8208;switchable microgels that can form co&#8208;assemblies at high pH. Since the enzyme partners are immobilized on individual microgels, the co&#8208;assembled state brings them close enough for enhanced acid generation. The amplified deactivator production (acid) leads to an almost two&#8208;fold reduction in the lifetime of the transiently formed pH&#8208;state. Our study thus introduces versatile mechanisms for chemo&#8208;structural feedback.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Induced Emergent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral terpyridine&#8208;based ZnII complex has been developed that forms fluorescent complexes with nucleotides, but only in the presence of ATP. A chiral assembly is generated that exhibits circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum factor as high as 0.20. This discrimination of ATP from other nucleotides should allow applications in encryption.







Abstract
Biomimetic ATP&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly is important to understand various biological processes and dissipative systems. Here, we report an ATP&#8208;driven chiral assembly exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) via the interaction of an achiral terpyridine&#8208;based ZnII complex with nucleotides. It was found that while the metal complexes could co&#8208;assemble with the nucleotides to form fluorescent assemblies, only a combination of furan&#8208;substituted terpyridine complex and ATP showed an intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 0.20. This means that the complex could recognize ATP using CPL as a readout signal, thus providing an example of ATP encryption. Interestingly, when ATP was transferred into ADP or AMP under enzymatic hydrolysis, the CPL decreases or disappears. Addition of ATP generates CPL again, thus producing an ATP&#8208;induced CPL system. This work presents the first example of ATP&#8208;induced CPL and encryption.

         <title>Discovery of Two Polymorphs of TiP4N8 Synthesized from Binary Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary TiIV nitridophosphate TiP4N8 has been prepared under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions and subsequent annealing in silica ampoules. DFT calculations confirm the measured band gaps and predict the thermochemistry of two polymorphs. The synthesis of TiP4N8 shows a promising route to new ternary nitrides with semiconducting properties.







Abstract
TiP4N8 was obtained from the binary nitrides TiN and P3N5 upon addition of NH4F as a mineralizer at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. An intricate interplay of disorder and polymorphism was elucidated by in situ temperature&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, STEM&#8208;HAADF, and the investigation of annealed samples. This revealed two polymorphs, which consist of dense networks of PN4 tetrahedra (degree of condensation &#954;=0.5) and either augmented triangular TiN7 prisms or triangular TiN6 prisms for &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;TiP4N8, respectively. The structures of TiP4N8 exhibit body&#8208;centered tetragonal (bct) framework topology. DFT calculations confirm the measured band gaps of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;TiP4N8 (1.6&#8211;1.8&#8197;eV) and predict the thermochemistry of the polymorphs in agreement with the experiments.

         <title>Organoplatinum Compounds as Anion&#8208;Tuneable Uphill Hydroxide Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active and directional hydroxide transport is realized by using PtII organometallic compounds as carriers based on their hydrolysis reaction combined with the different permeability of the neutral form and the charged form PtII aqua species. These compounds can transport hydroxide selectively &#8220;uphill&#8221;, a gradient in a liposomal system producing a transmembrane pH gradient, and tuneable activity is achieved by adding anions through a ligand&#8208;exchange reaction.







Abstract
Active transport of ions uphill, creating a concentration gradient across a cell membrane, is essential for life. It remains a significant challenge to develop synthetic systems that allow active uphill transport. Here, a transport process fuelled by organometallic compounds is reported that creates a pH gradient. The hydrolysis reaction of PtII complexes results in the formation of aqua complexes that established rapid transmembrane movement (&#8220;flip&#8208;flop&#8221;) of neutral Pt&#8722;OH species, leading to protonation of the OH group in the inner leaflet, generating OH&#8722; ions, and so increasing the pH in the intravesicular solution. The organoplatinum complex effectively transports bound hydroxide ions across the membrane in a neutral complex. The initial net flow of the PtII complex into the vesicles generates a positive electric potential that can further drive uphill transport because the electric potential is opposed to the chemical potential of OH&#8722;. The OH&#8722; ions equilibrate with this transmembrane electric potential but cannot remove it due to the relatively low permeability of the charged species. As a result, effective hydroxide transport against its concentration gradient can be achieved, and multiple additions can continuously drive the generation of OH&#8722; against its concentration gradient up to &#916;pH&gt;2. Moreover, the external addition of different anions can control the generation of OH&#8722; depending on their anion binding affinity. When anions displayed very high binding affinities towards PtII compounds, such as halides, the external anions could dissipate the pH gradient. In contrast, a further pH increase was observed for weak binding anions, such as sulfate, due to the increase of positive electric potential.

As a result, effective hydroxide transport against its concentration gradient can be achieved, and multiple additions can continuously drive the generation of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; against its concentration gradient up to &#916;pH&amp;gt;2. Moreover, the external addition of different anions can control the generation of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; depending on their anion binding affinity. When anions displayed very high binding affinities towards Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; compounds, such as halides, the external anions could dissipate the pH gradient. In contrast, a further pH increase was observed for weak binding anions, such as sulfate, due to the increase of positive electric potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MOF Synthesis Prediction Enabled by Automatic Data Mining and Machine Learning**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to rationalize and accelerate MOF discovery by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure is reported. The prediction is based on machine learning models, trained on the SynMOF database, constructed via automatic data mining of synthesis parameters from the literature. The model outperforms human expert predictions according to a synthesis survey.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress in the field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the potential of using machine learning (ML) methods to predict MOF synthesis parameters is still untapped. Here, we show how ML can be used for rationalization and acceleration of the MOF discovery process by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure. Our approach is based on: i)&#8197;establishing the first MOF synthesis database via automatic extraction of synthesis parameters from the literature, ii)&#8197;training and optimizing ML models by employing the MOF database, and iii)&#8197;predicting the synthesis conditions for new MOF structures. The ML models, even at an initial stage, exhibit a good prediction performance, outperforming human expert predictions, obtained through a synthesis survey. The automated synthesis prediction is available via a web&#8208;tool on https://mof&#8208;synthesis.aimat.science.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new strategies to advance the fundamental understanding of electrochemistry is crucial to mitigating multiple contemporary technological challenges. In this regard, magnetoelectrochemistry offers many strategic advantages in controlling and understanding electrochemical reactions that might be tricky to regulate in conventional electrochemical fields. However, the topic is highly interdisciplinary, combining concepts from electrochemistry, hydrodynamics, and magnetism with experimental outcomes that are sometimes unexpected. In this review, we survey recent advances in using a magnetic field in different electrochemical applications organized by the effect of the generated forces on fundamental electrochemical principles and focus on how the magnetic field leads to the observed results. Finally, we discuss the challenges that remain to be addressed to establish robust applications capable of meeting present needs by overcoming existing limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries towards practical working conditions through cathode&#8208;electrolyte synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is still hindered by the unsatisfactory cell performance under practical working conditions, which is mainly caused by the sluggish cathode redox kinetics, severe polysulfide shuttling, and poor Li striping/platting reversibility. Herein, we reported an effective strategy by combining Se&#8208;doped S hosted in an ordered macroporous framework with highly fluorinated ether (HFE)&#8208;based electrolyte to simultaneously address the afore&#8208;mentioned issues in both cathode and anode. A reversible and stable high areal capacity of &gt; 5.4 mAh cm  &#8208;2&#160;  with high coulombic efficiency &gt; 99.2% can be achieved under high areal Se/S loading (5.8 mg cm  &#8208;2  ), while the underlying mechanism was further revealed through synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes and Time&#8208;of&#8208;Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). The practical application potential was further evaluated at low (0&#160; &#730; C) and high (55&#160; &#730; C) temperatures under high areal Se/S loading (&gt; 5.0 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) and thin Li metal (40&#160; &#181; m).</dc:description>

         <title>Multicolor Zinc(II)&#8208;coordinated Hydrazone&#8208;based Bistable Photoswitches for Rewritable Transparent Luminescent Labels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Repeatable printing of invisible multicolor luminescence patterns with long retention times on transparent substrates is of significant importance, but it remains a formidable challenge. Here, two novel hydrazone&#8208;based on/off fluorescent photoswitches with decent emission quantum efficiencies, good reversible photoisomerization properties, and extremely long thermal half&#8208;lives, were designed and synthesized. Excitingly, X&#8208;ray crystallography data of both Z and E isomers of one hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitch were obtained. Multiple emission colors of blue, cyan, green, yellow, and orange can be obtained readily for these two photoswitches upon coordination with various zinc salts. Moreover, the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of invisible multicolor images with high resolution was achieved by using these photoswitches. Importantly, the legibility of the printed patterns can last at least over 3 months without detectable emission intensity loss under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Sequence High&#8208;Specificity Dual&#8208;Reporter Unlocking of Fluorescent Probe Enables the Precise Identification of Atherosclerotic Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of atherosclerotic&#160;plaques is the root cause of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Effective CVD interventions thus call for precise identification of the plaques to aid clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of such diseases. In this study, we introduce a dual&#8208;target sequentially activated fluorescence reporting system, termed  i  n&#8208;  s  equence  h  igh&#8208;sp  e  cificity dual&#8208;  r  eporter un  lock  ing (iSHERLOCK), to precisely identify the&#160; atherosclerotic plaques  in vivo  and  ex vivo  . ISHERLOCK was achieved by creating a three&#8208;in&#8208;one fluorescent probe that permits highly specific and sensitive detection of lipid droplets and hypochlorous acid via &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; and ratiometric readouts, respectively. Based on this format, the upregulated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress&#8212;the two hallmarks of atherosclerosis (AS)&#8212;were specifically measured in the atherosclerotic&#160;plaques, breaking through the barrier of precise tissue biopsy of AS and thus aiding effective CVD stewardship.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Alloy PtWMn as a Mn Nanoreservoir for High&#8208;field MRI Monitoring and Highly Selective Ferroptosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis exhibits a potential to damage drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. However, it is still restricted with the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity from the undesirable leakage of metal ions from ferroptosis agents, and lack of reliable imaging for monitoring ferroptosis process in living system. Herein, we develop a novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanocube as a Mn reservoir, and further design a microenvironment&#8208;triggered nanoplatform that can accurately release Mn ions within tumor to increase ROS generation, produce O  2  and consume excess glutathione for synergistically enhancing nonferrous ferroptosis. Moreover, this nanoplatform exerts the responsive signal in high&#8208;field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enables the real&#8208;time report of Mn release and the monitoring of ferroptosis initiation through the signal changes of T  1  &#8208;/T  2  &#8208;MRI. Thus, our nanoplatform provides a novel strategy to reserve, deliver and precisely release Mn ions for MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocaging of Activity&#8208;based Ubiquitin Probes via a C&#8208;Terminal Backbone Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaged, activity&#8208;based ubiquitin (Ub) probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) have been developed for the time&#8208;resolved probing of deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activities, but many Ub&#8208;ABPs are still challenging to photocage because their warheads (e.g. propargylamide (PA) or dehydroalanine (Dha)) are difficult to temporally block and activate. Here, we describe a new C&#8208;terminal backbone modification strategy for the construction of photocaged Ub&#8208;ABPs in which a light&#8208;sensitive group is placed at the backbone amide bond of the Ub Gly75. This strategy enabled the facile generation of cell&#8208;permeable photocaged Ub&#8208;PA and Dha probes that could be activated to capture DUBs after photo&#8208;irradiation, and were used to profile DUBs in cells under specially designed conditions (e.g. in cells experiencing oxidative stress) or DUBs with isopeptide linkage selectivity. This backbone modification strategy is anticipated to provide a general solution to the development of photocaged Ub ABPs bearing any warheads for DUB profiling.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Phase Mechanism of O&#8226;&#8722;/Ni2+&#8208;mediated Methane Conversion to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The gas phase reaction of NiAl  2  O  4  +  with CH  4  is studied by mass spectrometry in combination with vibrational action spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Two product ions, NiAl  2  O  4  H  +  and NiAl  2  O  3  H  2  +  , are identified in the mass spectra. The DFT calculations predict that the global minimum&#8208;energy isomer of NiAl  2  O  4  +  contains Ni in the +II oxidation state and features a terminal Al&#8211;O  &#8226;&#8722;  oxygen radical site. They show that methane can react along two competing pathways leading to formation of either a methyl radical (CH  3  &#8226;  ) or formaldehyde (CH  2  O). Both reactions are initiated by hydrogen atom transfer from methane to the terminal O  &#8226;&#8722;  site, followed by either CH  3  &#8226;  loss or CH  3  &#8226;  migration to an O  2&#8722;  site next to the Ni  2+  center. The CH  3  &#8226;  attaches as CH  3  +  to O  2&#8722;  and its unpaired electron is transferred to the Ni&#8208;center reducing it to Ni  +  . The proposed mechanism is experimentally confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy of the reactant and two different product ions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The most pristine material of the Solar System is assumed to be preserved in comets in the form of dust and ice as refractory matter. ESA&#8217;s mission Rosetta and its lander Philae had been developed to investigate the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov&#8208;Gerasimenko&#160;in situ. Twenty&#8208;five minutes after the initial touchdown of Philae on the surface of comet 67P in November 2014, a mass spectrum was recorded by the time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer COSAC onboard Philae. The new characterization of this mass spectrum through non&#8208;negative least squares fitting and Monte Carlo simulations reveals the chemical composition of comet 67P. A suite of 12 organic molecules, 9 of which also found in the original analysis of this data, exhibit high statistical probability to be present in the grains sampled from the cometary nucleus. These volatile molecules are among the most abundant in the comet&#8217;s chemical composition and represent an inventory of the first raw materials present in the early Solar System.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with predicted structure has been a long&#8208;term challenge. Herein, by using the efficient, simple, low&#8208;cost, and scalable mechanosynthesis, we demonstrate that reticular chemistry is applicable to HOF assemblies based on building blocks with different geometry, connectivity, and functionality. The obtained crystalline HOFs show uniform nano&#8208;size morphology, which is challenging or unachievable for conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Furthermore, the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis generated a series of Pd@HOF composites with noticeably different CO oxidation activities. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS studies indicate that the most efficient composite, counterintuitively, shows the weakest CO affinity to Pd sites while the strongest CO affinity to HOF matrix, revealing the vital role of porous matrix to the catalytic performance. This work paves a new avenue for rational synthesis of HOF and HOF&#8208;based composites for broad application potential.</dc:description>
