         <title>Homologous and Heterologous Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization from Exclusively Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the enticing issues of chiral origin has caused attractive topics: how chirality is born from the initial achiral units and the involved mechanisms for the transfer of chiral information. In this work, by combining physical vortex and seeds, a general process is revealed to generate chiral supramolecular polymers from achiral  C  3  &#8208;symmetric molecules. The symmetry&#8208;broken assemblies from the achiral molecules could work as chiral seeds to initiate the polymerization of either homologous or heterologous achiral monomers. Concomitantly, the fragmentation of polymer driven by the vortex in the nucleation&#8208;elongation model is confirmed to enlarge the domains of chiral nuclei and then guide the polymer to grow into the predominant helicity with a high reactivity ratio. Moreover, the chiral information of structure can be well stored in different forms of assemblies. These new polymerization modes will provide more meaningful guidance for the preparation of chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkynylation of Cyclic Amines by Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a mild and general method for C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of cyclic amines has been an ongoing challenge. In this work, we described the copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkynylation of unactivated cyclic 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;benzamide under photo&#8208;irradiation by intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The employment of a new bisoxazoline diphenylamine ligand, in conjunction with 1,1'&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol, which significantly improved the reduction potential of the copper complex, was the key to success of this chemistry. Mechanistic and computational studies supported that the new copper complex served dual role as a photoredox and coupling catalyst, the reaction went through a radical process, and the intramolecular 1,5&#8208;HAT process was involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step. Apart from broad substrate scope including unprecedented benzocyclic amines, this method also showed excellent diastereoselectivity in 2&#8208;monosubstituted cyclic amines via substrate control.</dc:description>

         <title>SuFEx&#8208;enabled&#160;Elastic&#160;Polysulfates for Efficient Removal of Radioactive&#160;Iodomethane&#160;and Polar Aprotic&#160;Organics through Weak Intermolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capturing radioactive iodomethane and its vapors is a major challenge due to its low adsorption capacity. Herein, we have developed for the first time a pyridine&#8208;entrapped elastic crosslinked polysulfate gel (pyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS) as an efficient absorbent for iodomethane capture. Each pyridine&#8208;encased TPC&#8208;cPS network cell acts as a mini&#8208;reactor for salt formation between pyridine and iodomethane. The yield reaches up to 96.65% and traps saturated iodomethane vapor of 1.573 g  pyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS  &#8722;1  (equivalent to 18.103 g g  TPC&#8208;cPS  &#8722;1  ), which is the highest capacity reported to date. Both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the unusual adsorption of polysulfate for polar aprotic organics can be attributed to the fact that the electrostatic interactions&#160;&#160;between the polar group (O=S=O) in the polymer backbone and the polar groups in the organic molecules fixed the solvent in the polymer matrix, while the van der Waals forces between the nonpolar groups in the polymer and molecules induced swelling.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chimeric Conjugate of Antibody and Programmable DNA Nanoassembly Smartly Activates T cell for Precise Cancer Cell Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetically directing T&#8208;cell against tumor emerges as a promising strategy in immunotherapy, while it remains challenging to smartly engage T cells with tunable immune response. Herein, we report an intelligent molecular platform to engineer T&#8208;cell recognition for selective activation to potently kill cancer cells. To this end,&#160;we fabricated a hybrid conjugate that uses a click&#8208;type DNA&#8208;protein conjugation to equip the T cell&#8208;engaging antibody with two distinct programmable DNA nanoassemblies.  By integrating multiple aptameric antigen&#8208;recognitions within a dynamic DNA circuit, we achieved combinatorial recognition of triple&#8208;antigens on cancer cells for selective T&#8208;cell activation after high&#8208;order logic operation. Moreover, by coupling a DNA nanostructure, we precisely defined the valence of the antigen&#8208;binding aptamers to tune avidity, realizing effective tumor elimination  in vitro  and  in vivo.&#160;Together, we present a versatile and programmable strategy for synthetic immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthetic Potential of Thiophenium Ylide Cycloadducts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl sulfides were shown to participate in thermal (3+2) cycloadditions with tethered alkynes. The resulting thiophenium ylide cycloadducts led to a variety of polysubstituted thiophenes by trapping with diverse electrophiles.







Abstract
(3+2) cycloaddition reactions are undeniably one of the most robust and versatile synthetic tools in heterocyclic chemistry. The classically required 1,3&#8208;dipoles are however limited to three&#8208;atom sequences bearing stabilized formal charges in their Lewis structure. The scope of three&#8208;atom groupings possible in (3+2) cycloadditions can be greatly expanded by taking of advantage neutral three&#8208;atom components (TACs). These groupings result in zwitterionic (3+2) cycloadducts adaptable to multiple outcomes depending on structure and conditions. Herein, the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between alkynyl sulfides (neutral TAC) and alkynes to provide key thiophenium ylide intermediates is first reported. These reactive species provide access to highly substituted fused thiophenes following predictable chemical sequences. Structural features on the obtained thiophenes were highly configurable by judicious choice of both alkynyl sulfide substitution and reaction conditions.

         <title>Evolution and Single&#8208;Droplet Analysis of Fuel&#8208;Driven Compartments by Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics were used to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate&#8208;based droplets. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. The nucleation, growth, and dissolution of active coacervate&#8208;based droplets were investigated with this setup.







Abstract
Active droplets are a great model for membraneless organelles. However, the analysis of these systems remains challenging and is often limited due to the short timescales of their kinetics. We used droplet&#8208;based microfluidics to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate&#8208;based droplets to overcome this challenge. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. We discovered that the fuel concentration dictates the formation of the coacervate&#8208;based droplets and their properties. We observed that coacervate&#8208;based droplets grow through fusion, decay simultaneously independent of their volume, and shrinkage rate scales with their initial volume. This method helps to further understand the regulation of membraneless organelles, and we believe the analysis of individual coacervate&#8208;based droplets enables future selection&#8208; or evolution&#8208;based studies.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Dynamic RGB (Red&#8208;Green&#8208;Blue) Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence in an Anti&#8208;Kasha Organic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic ultra&#8208;long persistence luminescent material with dynamic RGB&#8208;tunable and high&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) based on a triamino&#8208;s&#8208;triazine derivative was designed and prepared for information encryption and decryption.







Abstract
Organic LPL (long&#8208;persistent luminescence) materials have sparked extensive research interest due to the ultralong&#8208;lived triplet states. Although numerous organic LPL materials have been reported, most of the triplet emission was static and monotonous. Therefore, LPL materials with dynamic triplet emission are urgently required. A triamino&#8208;s&#8208;triazine derivative 1 with dynamic LPL was fabricated. The single&#8208;crystal structure shows that the abundant intermolecular interactions and small free volume restrict the molecular motion and avoid the quenchers. Spectral and theoretical calculations upheld the existence of multiple excited states in 1, and the migration of electrons between multiple excited states is very sensitive to external stimuli. By modulating the stimulus, the residence of electrons in different triplet states can be manipulated to achieve RGB LPL. Importantly, blue LPL was achieved by manipulating the anti&#8208;Kasha emission. And the red LPL can still be observed at high temperature.

         <title>Selective Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyser Based on Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline CeO2 Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective conversion of CH4 to C2H4 at the anode and the electrolysis of CO2 to CO at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser is presented. Well&#8208;defined interfaces were constructed that function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths.







Abstract
Catalytic conversion of CH4 to C2H4 plays an important role in the light olefin industry. Here, we report the electrochemical conversion of CH4 to C2H4/C2H6 at the anode with the electrolysis of CO2 to CO at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser. We constructed well&#8208;defined interfaces that function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths. We engineered the chemical states and flux of active oxygen species for the oxidation of CH4 at the anode by controlling voltage and temperature. We show the unprecedented C2 selectivity (C2H4 and C2H6) of &#8805;99.5&#8201;% at a CH4 conversion of &#8776;7&#8201;%. The electrolyser exhibits excellent durability without performance degradation being observed in a continuous operation of 100&#8197;hours. Our work enables a novel path for the selective conversion of CH4/CO2 into useful chemicals, and the technique of building well&#8208;defined interfaces may find potential applications in other fields.

         <title>Fast Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Reveals the Evasive Hepatitis&#8197;B Virus Capsid C&#8208;Terminal Domain
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of proton&#8208;detected fast MAS NMR &gt;100&#8197;kHz and specific labelling schemes reveals the formerly invisible domain of the Hepatitis&#8197;B virus capsid. Since the evasiveness of this domain lies in its dynamic behavior, it is expected that this methodology will be of use to characterize flexible domains in a wider range of proteins.







Abstract
Experimentally determined protein structures often feature missing domains. One example is the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of the hepatitis&#8197;B virus capsid protein, a functionally central part of this assembly, crucial in regulating nucleic&#8208;acid interactions, cellular trafficking, nuclear import, particle assembly and maturation. However, its structure remained elusive to all current techniques, including NMR. Here we show that the recently developed proton&#8208;detected fast magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning solid&#8208;state NMR at &gt;100&#8197;kHz MAS allows one to detect this domain and unveil its structural and dynamic behavior. We describe the experimental framework used and compare the domain's behavior in different capsid states. The developed approaches extend solid&#8208;state NMR observations to residues characterized by large&#8208;amplitude motion on the microsecond timescale, and shall allow one to shed light on other flexible protein domains still lacking their structural and dynamic characterization.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Melanin&#8211;Protein&#8211;Fe/Cu Conjugates Derived from Norepinephrine as Reliable Models for Neuromelanin of Human Brain Locus Coeruleus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melanin&#8211;protein conjugates derived from norepinephrine fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin were synthesized as soluble models of neuromelanin from human brain locus coeruleus. This pigment contains a significant amount of iron and copper. The synthetic models show that the two metals exhibit a strong tendency to remain coupled to each other in dinuclear or multinuclear aggregates.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble melanin&#8208;protein&#8208;Fe/Cu conjugates derived from norepinephrine and fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin are reliable models for neuromelanin (NM) of human brain locus coeruleus. Both iron and copper promote catecholamine oxidation and exhibit strong tendency to remain coupled in oligonuclear aggregates. The Fe&#8208;Cu clusters are EPR silent and affect the 1H NMR spectra of the conjugates through a specific sequence of signals. Derivatives containing only Fe or Cu exhibit different NMR patterns. The EPR spectra show weak signals of paramagnetic FeIII in conjugates containing Fe or mixed Fe&#8208;Cu sites due to small amounts of mononuclear centers. The latter derivatives exhibit EPR signals for isolated CuII centers. These features parallel the EPR behavior of NM from locus coeruleus. The spectral data indicate that FeIII is bound to the melanic fraction, whereas CuII is bound on the protein fibrils, suggesting that the Fe&#8208;Cu clusters occur at the interface between the two components of the synthetic NMs.

The EPR spectra show weak signals of paramagnetic Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; in conjugates containing Fe or mixed Fe-Cu sites due to small amounts of mononuclear centers. The latter derivatives exhibit EPR signals for isolated Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centers. These features parallel the EPR behavior of NM from &lt;i&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/i&gt;. The spectral data indicate that Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; is bound to the melanic fraction, whereas Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; is bound on the protein fibrils, suggesting that the Fe-Cu clusters occur at the interface between the two components of the synthetic NMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1,5&#8208;Allyl Shift by a Sequential Achmatowicz/Oxonia&#8208;Cope/Retro&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is discovered for allyl furfuryl alcohol through two&#8208;step sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangement at room temperature, which could be considered as a Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann&#8208;forbidden formal [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. Mechanistically, it involves Achmatowicz rearrangement, oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement, and an unprecedented &#8220;retro&#8208;Achmatowicz&#8221; rearrangement.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Allyl and 1,2&#8208;allyl shifts through [3,3]&#8208; and [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements are well&#8208;established and widely used in organic synthesis. In contrast, 1,5&#8208;allyl shift through related [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is unknown because [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is thermally Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann forbidden. Herein, we report an unexpected discovery of a formal 1,5&#8208;allyl shift of allyl furfuryl alcohol through a 2&#8208;step sequential rearrangement. Mechanistically, this formal 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is achieved through a sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangement: 1) Achmatowicz rearrangement (ring expansion), and 2) cascade oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement/retro&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement (ring contraction). This new 1,5&#8208;allyl shift method is demonstrated with &gt;20 examples and expected to find applications in organic synthesis and materials chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis and Visualization of Entangled 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with High&#8208;Valency Stereoscopic Molecular Nodes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic molecular node is used synthesize two isoreticular 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy unravels their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrating networks with a bcu topology. The unique pore architectures and strong binding sites enable excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The high&#8208;valency molecular node may lead to new 3D COF topologies.







Abstract
The structural diversity of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are limited as there are only a few choices of building units with multiple symmetrically distributed connection sites. To date, 4 and 6&#8208;connected stereoscopic nodes with Td, D3h, D3d and C3 symmetries have been mostly reported, delivering limited 3D topologies. We propose an efficient approach to expand the 3D COF repertoire by introducing a high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic node with a connectivity of eight, based on which two isoreticular 3D imine&#8208;linked COFs can be created. Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy allows the direct visualization of their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated bcu networks. These 3D COFs are endowed with unique pore architectures and strong molecular binding sites, and exhibit excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The introduction of high&#8208;valency stereoscopic nodes would lead to an outburst of new topologies for 3D COFs.

         <title>Optimizing Pt Electronic States through Formation of a Schottky Junction on Non&#8208;reducible Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum nanoparticles are supported on different MOFs, including non&#8208;reducible ZIF&#8208;8 and reducible UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125. Unexpectedly, the Pt/ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits higher activity than Pt/UiO&#8208;66 and Pt/MIL&#8208;125 in the photocatalytic benzylamine oxidative coupling reaction. The different electron transfer behaviors among these photocatalysts lead to the highest Pt electron density on ZIF&#8208;8 toward O2 activation, accounting for its superior activity.







Abstract
Charge transfer between metal sites and supports is crucial for catalysis. Redox&#8208;inert supports are usually unfavorable due to their less electronic interaction with metal sites, which, we demonstrate, is not always correct. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are chosen to mimic inert or active supports for Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and the photocatalysis is studied. Results demonstrate the formation of a Schottky junction between Pt and the MOFs, leading to the electron&#8208;donation effect of the MOFs. Under light irradiation, both the MOF electron&#8208;donation effect and Pt interband excitation dominate the Pt electron density. Compared with the &#8220;active&#8221; UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125 supports, Pt NPs on the &#8220;inert&#8221; ZIF&#8208;8 exhibit higher electron density due to the higher Schottky barrier, resulting in superior photocatalytic activity. This work optimizes metal catalysts with non&#8208;reducible supports, and promotes the understanding of the relationship between the metal&#8211;support interaction and photocatalysis.

         <title>An endo&#8208;Directing&#8208;Group Strategy Unlocks Enantioselective (3+1+2) Carbonylative Cycloadditions of Aminocyclopropanes</title>

An endo&#8208;directing group strategy enables enantioselective (3+1+2) cycloadditions that are triggered by carbonylative C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanes. These processes are rare examples of cycloadditions where C&#8722;C bond oxidative addition is enantiodetermining.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroxylation of Dihydrosilanes to Si&#8208;Chiral Silanols Catalyzed by In Situ Generated Copper(II) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;mediated &#963;&#8208;metathesis with prochiral dihydrosilanes has been successfully leveraged to efficiently synthesize Si&#8208;chiral silanols as well as many other related Si&#8208;chiral skeletons. The reaction hinges on the continuous generation of catalytically active copper(II) species via single&#8208;electron transfer oxidation of copper(I) by alkyl halides and the efficient stereocontrol with multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective hydroxylation of prochiral dihydrosilanes with water is expected to be a highly efficient way to access Si&#8208;chiral silanols, yet has remained unknown up to date. Herein, we describe a strategy for realizing this reaction: using an alkyl bromide as a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidant for invoking CuII species and chiral multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands for effective enantiocontrol. The reaction readily provides a broad range of Si&#8208;chiral silanols with high enantioselectivity and excellent functional group compatibility. In addition, we manifest the synthetic potential by establishing two synthetic schemes for transforming the obtained products into Si&#8208;chiral compounds with high structural diversity. Our preliminary mechanistic studies support a mechanism involving SET for recruiting chiral CuII species as the active catalyst and its subsequent &#963;&#8208;metathesis with dihydrosilanes.

&lt;p&gt;Copper(II)-mediated &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-metathesis with prochiral dihydrosilanes has been successfully leveraged to efficiently synthesize Si-chiral silanols as well as many other related Si-chiral skeletons. The reaction hinges on the continuous generation of catalytically active copper(II) species via single-electron transfer oxidation of copper(I) by alkyl halides and the efficient stereocontrol with multidentate anionic N,N,P-ligands.
&lt;/p&gt;

The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce functionalizable P(MVL)ROP is presented. It can recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (ca. 96&#8201;%). P(MVL)ROP with high molar mass behaves as a tough thermoplastic with good mechanical properties, which is comparable to isotactic polypropylene (PP) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE).







Abstract
It is a highly attractive strategy to develop chemically recyclable polymers to establish a circular plastic economy. Despite the recent advancements, chemically recyclable polymers still face challenges including high energy cost for polymer preparation or recycling, poor monomer recovery selectivity and efficiency as well as undesired material performance. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization of bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce exclusive functionalizable polyester using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained polyester with high molar mass exhibits good tensile strength comparable to that of some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained polyester can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a 96&#8201;% yield by thermolysis, thus successfully establishing a closed&#8208;loop life cycle.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Overproduction of Biofuels in Microorganisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photo&#8208;biosynthesis system was constructed for the overproduction of jet fuel farnesene by interfacing engineered E.&#8197;coli with persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3). meso&#8208;Al2O3 with rich defects prolonged the lifetime of photo&#8208;excited electrons that were passed to E.&#8197;coli and improved the farnesene production by a factor of over 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Microbial cell factories reinvigorate current industries by producing complex fine chemicals at low costs. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the main reducing power to drive the biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. However, insufficient intrinsic NADPH limits the productivity of microorganisms. Here, we report that supplying microorganisms with long&#8208;lived electrons from persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3) can elevate the NADPH level to facilitate efficient fine chemical production. The defects in meso&#8208;Al2O3 were demonstrated to be highly efficient in prolonging electrons&#8217; lifetime. The long&#8208;lived electrons in meso&#8208;Al2O3 can pass the material&#8211;microorganism interface and power the biosynthetic pathways of E.&#8197;coli to produce jet fuel farnesene. This work represents a reliable strategy to design photo&#8208;biosynthesis systems to improve the productivity of microorganisms with solar energy.

         <title>A Lattice&#8208;Matching Strategy for Highly Reversible Copper&#8208;Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;metal anodes. Benefiting from the high lattice matching between Cu anodes and Ni substrates, Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes exhibit superior deposition/striping reversibility, lower nucleation overpotential and uniform deposition on the Ni substrates in comparison with other typical substrates.







Abstract
Copper metal is an attractive anode material for aqueous rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity (844&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good environmental compatibility and high earth abundance. However, the Cu anodes often suffer from poor deposition/stripping reversibility and nonuniform deposition during the charge/discharge process, degrading the lifetime of aqueous Cu&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a lattice&#8208;matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;metal anodes. In such a strategy, Ni substrates that exhibit high lattice matching with Cu were selected to support the Cu anodes. The high lattice matching endows Cu anodes with high deposition/stripping reversibility, low nucleation overpotential as well as a uniform and dense electrodeposition on Ni substrates. Based on the Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes, the full cells paired with lead dioxide cathodes show a stable cycling behavior. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu electrodes in aqueous rechargeable batteries.

         <title>The Microscopic Diamond Anvil Cell: Stabilization of Superhard, Superconducting Carbon Allotropes at Ambient Pressure</title>

DAC&#8208;carbon: A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. The superhard sp3 carbon framework serves as a microscopic diamond anvil cell, in which the sp2 chains are compressed to establish metallicity and superconductivity.







Abstract
A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. It is composed of an sp3 carbon framework that acts as a diamond anvil cell by constraining the distance between parallel cis&#8208;polyacetylene chains. The distance between these sp2 carbon atoms renders the phase metallic, and yields two well&#8208;nested nearly parallel bands that cross the Fermi level. Calculations show this phase is a conventional superconductor, with the motions of the sp2 carbons being key contributors to the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The sp3 carbon atoms impart superior mechanical properties, with a predicted Vickers hardness of 48&#8197;GPa. This phase, metastable at ambient conditions, could be made by on&#8208;surface polymerization of graphene nanoribbons, followed by pressurization of the resulting 2D sheets. A family of multifunctional materials with tunable superconducting and mechanical properties could be derived from this phase by varying the sp2 versus sp3 carbon content, and by doping.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. It is composed of an &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; carbon framework that acts as a diamond anvil cell by constraining the distance between parallel &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-polyacetylene chains. The distance between these &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; carbon atoms renders the phase metallic, and yields two well-nested nearly parallel bands that cross the Fermi level. Calculations show this phase is a conventional superconductor, with the motions of the &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; carbons being key contributors to the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; carbon atoms impart superior mechanical properties, with a predicted Vickers hardness of 48&#8197;GPa. This phase, metastable at ambient conditions, could be made by on-surface polymerization of graphene nanoribbons, followed by pressurization of the resulting 2D sheets. A family of multifunctional materials with tunable superconducting and mechanical properties could be derived from this phase by varying the &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; versus &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; carbon content, and by doping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Relaxation of the Plant Cell Wall Barrier via Zwitterionic Liquid Pretreatment for Micelle&#8208;Complex&#8208;Mediated DNA Delivery to Specific Plant Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique strategy to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery is presented. This strategy leverages the synergistic effects of a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid and an organelle&#8208;targeting micelle complex, allowing greatly augmented DNA delivery to target organelles, such as chloroplasts, in living plants.







Abstract
Targeted delivery of genes to specific plant organelles is a key challenge for fundamental plant science, plant bioengineering, and agronomic applications. Nanoscale carriers have attracted interest as a promising tool for organelle&#8208;targeted DNA delivery in plants. However, nanocarrier&#8208;mediated DNA delivery in plants is severely hampered by the barrier of the plant cell wall, resulting in insufficient delivery efficiency. Herein, we propose a unique strategy that synergistically combines a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) with a peptide&#8208;displaying micelle complex for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery in plants. We demonstrated that ZIL pretreatment can enhance cell wall permeability without cytotoxicity, allowing micelle complexes to translocate across the cell wall and carry DNA cargo into specific plant organelles, such as nuclei and chloroplasts, with significantly augmented efficiency. Our work offers a novel concept to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for nanocarrier&#8208;mediated cargo delivery to specific organelles in living plants.

         <title>Amine&#8208;directed Formation of B&#8211;N Bonds for BN&#8208;fused Polycyclic Aromatic Multiple Resonance Emitters with Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable multiple resonances (MR) optoelectronic properties of  organic nanographenes  with boron and  nitrogen atoms disposed  para  to each other, the synthetic procedures are sophisticated with low yields and the molecular skeletons are limited. Here, a new paradigm of easy&#8208;to&#8208;access MR emitter is constructed by simplifying the  multiborylation  through the amine&#8208;directed formation of B&#8208;N bonds while introducing  an additional  para  &#8208;positioned nitrogen atom to trigger the MR effect  . The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecules exhibit narrowband emissions at 480 and 490 nm, with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of only 29 and 34 nm. The devices based on them showed external quantum efficiencies (EQE) values &gt;33.0%, which remained to exceed 24.0% even at a high brightness of 5000 cd m  &#8722;2  . This is the first example of MR emitters with B&#8208;N covalent bond, not only decreasing the synthesis difficulty but also increasing the diversity of MR skeletons for emerging new optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermophoretic AND Gate Operation on Extracellular Vesicles Improves Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a valuable source of cancer biomarkers. However, the high degree of EV heterogeneity and the complexity of clinical samples pose a challenge in the sensitive identification of tumor&#8208;derived EVs. Here we introduce a one&#8208;step thermophoretic AND gate operation (Tango) assay that integrates polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs and simultaneous AND gate operation on EV membranes by dual&#8208;aptamers recognition. By using the Tango assay to detect tumor&#8208;derived EVs with&#160;co&#8208;presence&#160;of EpCAM and PSMA directly from serum in a homogeneous, separation&#8208;free format, we can discriminate prostate cancer (PCa) patients from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients in the diagnostic gray zone with an accuracy of 91 % in 15 min. Our approach streamlines EV enrichment and AND gate operation on EVs in a single assay, providing a rapid, straightforward, and powerful method for precise and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Cis&#8208;Trans Reisomerization Precedes Reprotonation of the Retinal Chromophore in the Photocycle of Schizorhodopsin 4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent discoveries of light&#8208;driven inward proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins have opened new avenues to exploring the mechanism of unidirectional transport because these proteins transport protons in the opposite direction to conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, despite their similar protein structure and membrane topology. Schizorhodopsin (SzR) is a newly discovered rhodopsin family of light&#8208;driven inward proton pumps. Here, we report time&#8208;resolved resonance Raman spectra showing that cis&#8208;trans thermal reisomerization precedes reprotonation at the Schiff base of the retinal chromophore in the photocycle of SzR AM_5_00977. This sequence has not been observed for the photocycles of conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, in which reisomerization follows reprotonation, and thus provides insights into the mechanism of proton uptake to the chromophore during inward proton pumping. The present findings are expected to contribute to controlling the direction of proton transport in engineered proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence and Length Control in Nonchelated d8&#8208;Metallosupramolecular Polymers through Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) of d  8  transition metal complexes have received considerable attention by virtue of their rich photophysical properties arising from metal&#8208;metal interactions. However, thus far, the molecular design is restricted to complexes with chelating ligands due to their advantageous preorganization and strong ligand fields. Herein, we demonstrate unique pathway&#8208;controllable metal&#8208;metal&#8208;interactions and remarkable  3  MMLCT luminescence in SPs of a non&#8208;chelated Pt  II  complex. Under kinetic control, self&#8208;complementary bisamide H&#8208;bonding motifs induce a rapid self&#8208;assembly into non&#8208;emissive H&#8208;type aggregates (  1A  ). However, under thermodynamic conditions, a more efficient ligand coplanarization leads to superiorly stabilized SP  1B  with extended Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions and remarkably long  3  MMLCT luminescence (&#964;  77 K  = 0.26 ms). The metal&#8208;metal interactions could be subsequently exploited to control the length of the emissive SPs using the seeded&#8208;growth approach.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylbenziodoxolones have recently been identified as efficient hypervalent iodine(III) reagents for electrophilic vinylations under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Their unique reactivity allows synthesis of either internal or terminal alkenes, depending on the nucleophile class. This paper constitutes the first mechanistic investigation of VBX vinylations, and makes use of NMR studies, deuterium labelling and computations to rationalize the observed regio&#8208; and stereochemical outcome. Internal alkene formation in S&#8208;vinylation was found to proceed through the ligand coupling mechanism typical of diaryliodonium salts, whereas terminal alkene formation in P&#8208;vinylations took place via a phosphinous acid&#8208;coordinated VBX complex, which underwent concerted deprotonation and Michael&#8208;type addition. Subsequent base&#8208;assisted protonation and E2 elimination delivered the terminal alkene. The findings can be used to predict the regioselectivity in vinylations of other nucleophile classes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Impact of Boron Hybridisation on Photocatalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently the fruitful merger of organoboron chemistry and photocatalysis has come to the forefront of organic synthesis resulting in the development of new technologies to access complex (non)borylated frameworks. Central to the success of this combination is control of boron hybridisation. Contingent on the photoactivation mode, boron as its neutral planar form or tetrahedral boronate can be used to regulate reactivity. This minireview highlights the current state of the art in photocatalytic processes utilising organoboron compounds paying particular attention to the role of boron hybridisation for the target transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Platinum(II) Tweezers and a Guest System: From Discrete Molecules to High&#8208;Ordered Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of platinum(II) calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular tweezers was synthesized. The studies of the host&#8208;guest association with a charge&#8208;neutral cyclometalated platinum(II) complex showed a drastic color change and the turning on of near&#8208;infrared emission resulting from Pt&#8943;Pt and &#960;&#8722;&#960; interactions. Control of the host&#8208;guest assembly process by varying the solvent composition can lead to a change from discrete host and guest molecules to high&#8208;ordered host&#8208;guest oligomers with the formation of sheet&#8208;like nanostructures, demonstrating a rare example of three&#8208;state supramolecular host&#8208;guest system with high solubility in solvents of diverse polarity. The change in host&#8208;guest assembly behaviors could be probed by drastic color changes from yellow to orange to green. The present study provides insights into the systematic design of solvent&#8208;responsive molecular materials using molecular tweezers&#8208;directed host&#8208;guest assembly, with potential applications in colorimetric sensing of changes in the micro&#8208;environment.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here fast A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange between APbX  3  perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) made of different A&#8208;cations (Cs (Cesium), FA (formamidinium), and MA (methylammonium)) at room temperature. Surprisingly, the A&#8208;cation cross&#8208;exchange proceeds as fast as the halide (X=Cl, Br, or I) exchange with the help of free A&#8208;oleate complexes present in the freshly prepared colloidal perovskite NC solutions. It enabled the preparation of double (MACs, MAFA, CsFA)&#8208; and triple (MACsFA)&#8208;cation perovskite NCs with an optical bandgap that is finely tunable by their A&#8208;site composition. The optical spectroscopy together with structural analysis using XRD and atomically resolved high angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) STEM indicates the homogeneous distribution of different cations in the mixed perovskite NC lattice. Unlike halide ions, the A&#8208;cations do not phase segregate under light illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Crystalline Coordination Catalyst for Hybrid Electrocatalytic Full Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid CO  2  electroreduction in which carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) is coupled with a thermodynamically more favorable anodic oxidation reaction is recognized as a very important strategy to improve the total value of redox products and energy conversion efficiency. In this work, a coordination catalyst model system for hybrid electrocatalytic full reaction, including Ni  8  &#8208;TET with active oxidation sites, Ni&#8208;TPP with active reduction sites and PCN&#8208;601 with redox&#8208;active sites, was established for the first time. Compared with the other two compounds, PCN&#8208;601 can complete both anodic methanol oxidation reaction and cathodic CO  2  RR with FE  HCOOH  and FE  CO  over 90%. Furthermore, due to the photosensitivity of metalloporphyrins, the performances of PCN&#8208;601 can be further improved with light irradiation (FE  HCOOH  over 90% at 1.8 &#8208; 2.5 V and FE  CO  nearly 100% at 2 &#8208; 2.4 V), which is the first crystalline coordination catalyst that can complete oxidation and reduction reactions, simultaneously. DFT calculation shows that the electrons transferring from Ni  8  clusters to Ni ions in the porphyrin under electric fields results in the raised oxidability of Ni  8  clusters and raised reducibility of metalloporphyrin, which is responsible for the improved electrocatalytic performance of PCN&#8208;601. Significantly, it is the first report to use one crystalline coordination catalyst to achieve the hybrid electrocatalytic full reaction. Moreover, this work serving as a well&#8208;defined model system puts forward a new design idea for establishing efficient catalysts for hybrid CO  2  electroreduction reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Ammonia Activation Through Coordination Induced Bond Weakening in Molybdenum Complexes of a Dianionic Pentadentate Ligand Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia oxidation catalyzed by molecular compounds is of current interest as a carbon free source of dihydrogen. Activation of N&#8208;H bonds through coordination to transition metal centers is a key reaction in this process. We report the substantial activation of ammonia  via  reaction with low valent molybdenum complexes of a diborate pentadentate ligand system. Spontaneous loss of hydrogen atoms from (B  2  Pz  4  Py)Mo(II)&#8208;NH  3  at room temperature to produce H  2  and the dinuclear &#956;&#8208;nitrido compound (B  2  Pz  4  Py)Mo&#8208;N&#8208;Mo(B  2  Pz  4  Py) is observed due to substantial N&#8208;H bond weakening upon coordination to Mo. Mechanistic details are supported through the experimental observation/characterization of terminal amido, imido and nitrido complexes and density functional theory computations. The generally under&#8208;appreciated role of bridging nitrido intermediates is revealed and discussed, providing guidance for further catalyst development for this process.</dc:description>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Orientation of Magnetic Double Stacks for Patterned Anisotropic Hydrogels with Multiple Responses and Modulable Motions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported here is a multi&#8208;response anisotropic poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel developed by using a rotating magnetic field to align magnetic double stacks (MDSs) that are fixed by polymerization. The magneto&#8208;orientation of MDSs originates from the unique structure with g&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles sandwiched by two silicate nanosheets. The resultant gels not only exhibit anisotropic optical and mechanical properties but also show anisotropic responses to temperature and light. Gels with complex ordered structures of MDSs are further devised by multi&#8208;step magnetic orientation and photolithographic polymerization. These gels show varied birefringence patterns with potentials as information materials, and can deform into specific configurations upon stimulations. Multi&#8208;gait motions are further realized in the patterned gel through dynamic deformation under spatiotemporal light and friction regulation by imposed magnetic force. The magneto&#8208;orientation assisted fabrication of hydrogels with anisotropic structures and additional functions should bring opportunities for gel materials in biomedical devices, soft actuators/robots, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aldehydes and Ketones by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation of aldehydes and ketones via their readily prepared silyl enol ethers has been achieved by dual nickel and photoredox catalysis. This reaction features broad scope and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalization of ketones and aldehydes has been intensively explored in organic synthesis. The functionalization of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in such carbonyl compounds is less well investigated and developing a general method for their &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation remains challenging. Herein we report a method that uses cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis for the formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aldehydes and ketones with (hetero)aryl bromides. The method features mild conditions, remarkable scope and wide functional group tolerance. Importantly, the introduced synthetic strategy also allows the &#946;&#8208;alkenylation, &#946;&#8208;alkynylation and &#946;&#8208;acylation of aldehydes under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that this transformation proceeds through a single electron oxidation/Ni&#8208;mediated coupling/reductive elimination cascade.

         <title>Straightforward Access to Multifunctional &#960;&#8208;Conjugated P&#8208;Heterocycles Featuring an Internal Ylidic Bond
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple synthesis of P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond is reported. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization (direct arylation) and the strategy is also compatible with the preparation of polyaromatic scaffolds (acenes, helicenes). Molecular engineering allows tuning the optical and redox properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.







Abstract
We report the straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;membered P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond: P&#8208;containing acenaphthylenes and phenanthrenes. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization through direct arylation to introduce electron&#8208;rich/poor substituents and the synthetic strategy is also compatible with the preparation of more elaborate polyaromatic scaffolds such as acenes and helicenes. Using a joint experimental (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical approach, we perform a full structure&#8211;property relationships study on these new platforms. In particular, we show that molecular engineering allows not only tuning their absorption/emission across the entire visible range but also endowing them with chiroptical or non&#8208;linear optical properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Fe2+/Fe3+ Cycling for Coupling Self&#8208;Powered Hydrogen Evolution and Preparation of Electrode Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling system has been established for efficient self&#8208;powered hydrogen evolution, in which a Zn&#8722;Fe battery with Fe3+ reduction reaction coupled Zn oxidation powers the electrolyzers of Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR) coupled hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, this Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling is used to prepare a multifunctional catalyst by the Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on siloxene nanosheets.







Abstract
A novel Zn&#8722;Fe flow battery featuring an Fe3+ reduction reaction (Fe3+RR)&#8208;coupled zinc oxidation, and an Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR)&#8208;coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) system as well, was established. This battery is capable of driving two Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER systems in series based on the above Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling, for efficient self&#8208;powered hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, this Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling enables the preparation of a multifunctional catalyst, Pt&#8208;3@SXNS (siloxene nanosheet), by the Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on SXNS; alternatively, this support could be obtained by Fe3+RR&#8208;assisted exfoliation using Fe3+ from the anolyte of Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER. The Pt&#8208;3@SXNS catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities toward Fe3+RR in the Zn&#8722;Fe flow battery, HER, and Fe2+OR in the electrolyzer, which is attributed to the strong electronic interaction between Pt and Si. This work offers a new strategy for energy storage and low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from acidic wastewater.

         <title>Accelerated Degradation of Microplastics at the Liquid Interface of Ice Crystals in Frozen Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally rapid degradation of microplastics (MPs) in frozen solution was discovered. The activity is ascribed to selective generation of singlet oxygen in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals. The findings offer a highly efficient degradation pathway for MPs and shed light on mechanisms of disposal of MPs in nature.







Abstract
Microplastics (MPs) are one of the emerging contaminants in environmental media, and they have raised great concern because they are resistant to degradation and persist in ecosystems. Although numerous advanced technologies have been developed, suitable technologies are still lacking for degradation of widespread MPs in the natural environment. We have discovered that MPs can be degraded exceptionally rapidly in frozen environments. Taking polystyrene (PS) as an example, its degradation rate in ice (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) is surprisingly competitive to most artificial technologies. PS particles are trapped and squeezed to achieve excited state (3PS*) in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals, which further react with the highly concentrated dioxygen to selectively produce singlet oxygen (1O2). The 1O2 boosts PS oxidation in the liquid layer thus further causing accelerated degradation at freezing temperature. This finding offers a highly efficient pathway for degradation of MPs and it sheds light on an unusual MPs disposal mechanisms in nature.

&lt;p&gt;The exceptionally rapid degradation of microplastics (MPs) in frozen solution was discovered. The activity is ascribed to selective generation of singlet oxygen in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals. The findings offer a highly efficient degradation pathway for MPs and shed light on mechanisms of disposal of MPs in nature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics (MPs) are one of the emerging contaminants in environmental media, and they have raised great concern because they are resistant to degradation and persist in ecosystems. Although numerous advanced technologies have been developed, suitable technologies are still lacking for degradation of widespread MPs in the natural environment. We have discovered that MPs can be degraded exceptionally rapidly in frozen environments. Taking polystyrene (PS) as an example, its degradation rate in ice (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) is surprisingly competitive to most artificial technologies. PS particles are trapped and squeezed to achieve excited state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;PS*) in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals, which further react with the highly concentrated dioxygen to selectively produce singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; boosts PS oxidation in the liquid layer thus further causing accelerated degradation at freezing temperature. This finding offers a highly efficient pathway for degradation of MPs and it sheds light on an unusual MPs disposal mechanisms in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Porous Organic Polymer Films for High&#8208;Performance Memristors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical preparation of porous organic polymer films for high&#8208;performance memristors is presented. This work will stimulate the development of porous organic polymer films in the field of advanced electron devices.







Abstract
Porous organic polymer films (PFs) with intrinsical porosity and tuneable pore environment are ideally suited for application in electronic devices. However, the huge challenges still exist for construction of electronic devices based on PFs owing to lack of robustness, processability, and controllable preparation. Herein, we report the electrochemical preparation of carbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer films (eCPFs) as switchable materials for the memristors. These eCPFs possess the characteristics of controllable thickness/size, high stability, and excellent porosity. Carbazole and cyano groups are introduced into the eCPFs to constructing electron transfer systems. Thus, the memristors constructed based on these eCPFs exhibit excellent switching performance, reliability, and reproducibility. The electrochemically controllable preparation method of porous organic polymer membranes proposed in this paper provides a feasible idea for the developments of electronic devices.

         <title>Ball Milling Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Prussian Blue Analogue Na2&#8722;xMnFe(CN)6 Cathodes for All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, cost&#8208;efficient, and general programmable ball&#8208;milling synthesis process without any additives was designed to prepare highly crystalline MnHCF&#8208;S&#8208;170. The constructed sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) based on the above MnHCF&#8208;S&#8208;170 can adapt to the complex and fickle working environment, and demonstrate possible practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems.







Abstract
With a series of merits, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been considered as superior cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Their commercialization, however, still suffers from inferior stability, considerable [Fe(CN)6] defects and interstitial water in the framework, which are related to the rapid crystal growth. Herein, a &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; nanoreactor is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs with decreased defects and water, which show both superior specific capacity and rate capability in SIBs. The air&#8208;stability, all&#8208;climate, and full&#8208;cell properties of our PBA have also been evaluated, and it exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and higher volume yield than its counterpart synthesized via the water&#8208;based co&#8208;precipitation method. Furthermore, their highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage behavior has been measured and identified via multiple in situ techniques. This work could pave the way for the PBA&#8208;based SIBs in grid&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Nitric&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Releasing aza&#8208;BODIPY: A New Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregate with Multiple Antibacterial Modalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent attachment of nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine moieties to aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives affords the first NO&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate of BDP&#8208;NO. The delicate modulation of the aggregation states of BDP&#8208;NO enables different antibacterial modalities, and the combination of NO release and photothermal therapy (PTT) can synergistically treat MRSA infections while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammatory responses.







Abstract
The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) J&#8208;aggregates has received increasing attention due to their broad applications. Here, we report the nitrosation of an amine&#8208;containing aza&#8208;BODIPY precursor (BDP&#8208;NH2), affording the first nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate (BDP&#8208;NO). The introduction of N&#8208;nitrosamine moieties efficiently inhibits the aromatic interactions of BDP&#8208;NH2, which instead promotes the formation of J&#8208;aggregates within micellar nanoparticles with a remarkable bathochromic shift of &#8776;109&#8197;nm to the NIR window (820&#8197;nm). Interestingly, the NO release and photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) can be delicately tuned by the loading contents of BDP&#8208;NO within micellar nanoparticles, thereby enabling multiple antibacterial modalities by exploring either NO release, photothermal therapy (PTT), or both. We demonstrate the combination of NO and PTT can elevate antibacterial activity while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammation for the in vivo treatment of MRSA infection.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cochlearol&#8197;B by an Approach Based on a Catellani Reaction and Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled [2+2] Cycloaddition

         <dc:description>
A 14&#8208;step approach to (+)&#8208;cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. The strategy involves an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation, Catellani reaction, and visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] cycloaddition to rapidly access the core of this natural product. Careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions, and [4+2] cycloadditions.







Abstract
A 14&#8208;step synthesis of (+)&#8208;cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. This renoprotective meroterpenoid features a unique core structure containing a densely substituted cyclobutane ring with three stereocenters. Our strategy employed an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation in route to the key chromenyl triflate. A subsequent Catellani reaction incorporated the remaining carbon atoms featured in the skeleton of cochlearol&#8197;B. An ensuing visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition closed the cyclobutane and formed the central bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane core. Notably, careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions and [4+2] cycloadditions.

Unlike other Ru&#8208;containing compounds whose active sites are Ru sites, the Si sites in LaRuSi function as real active sites. The unusual negative valence Ru in this compound has excessively tight adsorption for hydrogen, according to both theoretical calculations and in situ Raman observations, but the Si sites have excellent hydrogen adsorption properties.







Abstract
The discovery and identification of novel active sites are paramount for deepening the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and driving the development of remarkable electrocatalysts. Here, we reveal that the genuine active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in LaRuSi are Si sites, not the usually assumed Ru sites. Ru in LaRuSi has a peculiar negative valence state, which leads to strong hydrogen binding to Ru sites. Surprisingly, the Si sites have a Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption that is near zero (0.063&#8197;eV). The moderate adsorption of hydrogen on Si sites during the HER process is also validated by in situ Raman analysis. Based on it, LaRuSi exhibits an overpotential of 72&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, which is close to the benchmark of Pt/C. This work sheds light on the recognition of real active sites and the exploration of innovative silicide HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Traceless Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation on Native Antibodies Enables Efficient One&#8208;Step Payload Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct chemical modification of native antibodies in a site&#8208;specific manner remains a great challenge due to the complicated structural characteristics of antibodies. Ligand&#8208;directed conjugation can achieve the selective modification of antibodies, but usually requires multiple extra steps for ligand release and cargo assembly. Herein, we report a novel, traceless strategy to enable the facile and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) by harnessing a thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer reagent. The designed reagent, consisting of an optimized Fc&#8208;targeting ligand, a thioester bridge and a toxin payload, directly assembles the toxin precisely onto the K251 position of native IgGs and simultaneously self&#8208;releases the affinity ligand in one step. With this traceless, one&#8208;step method, we successfully synthesized a series of K251&#8208;linked ADCs from native Trastuzumab. These ADCs demonstrated excellent homogeneity, thermal stability, and both  in vitro  and  in vivo  anti&#8208;tumor activity. This strategy is equally efficient for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subtypes. The current work presents a robust, traceless, site&#8208;specific antibody functionalization via a self&#8208;releasing strategy, and offers a novel acyl transfer design for broad potential application in ligand&#8208;directed protein modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Distorted Antimony (III) Chloride [Sb2Cl8]2&#8208; Dimers for Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence up to 1070 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with unique compositional and structural tunability appear as an emerging class of luminescent materials, but near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters therein are largely unexplored to date. This study presents three novel 0D hybrid antimony chlorines with edge&#8208;sharing [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers, showing the unusual room&#8208;temperature broadband NIR emission with the maximum emission wavelength even up to 1070 nm. Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory calculation analysis demonstrate that the emissions originate from the highly localized excitons, and the confined [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in these structures show low symmetry and a large degree of structural freedom. The reported hybrid antimony chlorines with [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers herein expand the paradigm for discovering new NIR materials in 0D metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule CRISPR machines for spatially resolved searching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Repurposing the RNA&#8208;guided endonuclease Cas9 to develop artificial CRISPR molecular machines represents a new direction toward synthetic molecular information processing. The operation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9&#8208;based machines, nevertheless, relies on the molecular recognition of freely diffused sgRNA/Cas9, making it practically challenging to perform spatially regulated localized searching or navigation. Here, we develop a DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule CRISPR machine that can perform spatially resolved DNA cleavage via either free or localized searching modes. When triggered at a specific site on the DNA origami with nanoscale accuracy, the free searching mode leads to searching activity that gradually decays with the distance, whereas the localized mode generates spatially&#8208;confined searching activity. Our work expands the function of CRISPR molecular machines and lays foundations to develop integrated molecular circuits and high&#8208;throughput nucleic acid detection.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers presents a promising anticancer strategy. However, the molecular crowding conditions within cells diminish the potency of current G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers. Herein, chiral Ru(II)&#8208;Pt(II) dinuclear complexes were developed as highly potent G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers even under challenging molecular crowding conditions. The compounds were encapsulated with biotin&#8208;functionalized DNA cages to enhance sub&#8208;cellular localization and provide cancer selectivity. The nanoparticles were able to efficiently inhibit the endogenous activities of telomerase in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells and cause cell death by apoptosis. The nanomaterials demonstrated high antitumor activity towards cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells as well as tumor&#8208;bearing mice. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first example of a Ru(II)&#8208;Pt(II) dinuclear complex as a G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer with an anti&#8208;cancer effect towards drug&#8208;resistant tumors inside an animal model.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Alloy PtWMn as a Mn Nanoreservoir for High&#8208;Field MRI Monitoring and Highly Selective Ferroptosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanoplatform is developed as a Mn reservoir that exhibits efficient storage, specific delivery and accurate release of Mn ions for high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy. Such a smart nanoplatform can exert a responsive imaging signal in dual&#8208;mode (T1&#8208; or T2&#8208;weighted) high&#8208;field MRI, which enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of Mn release within the tumor microenvironment and of ferroptosis initiation.







Abstract
Ferroptosis exhibits potential to damage drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. However, it is still restricted with the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity from the undesirable leakage of metal ions from ferroptosis agents, and the lack of reliable imaging for monitoring the ferroptosis process in living systems. Herein, we develop a novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanocube as a Mn reservoir, and further design a microenvironment&#8208;triggered nanoplatform that can accurately release Mn ions within the tumor to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, produce O2 and consume excess glutathione for synergistically enhancing nonferrous ferroptosis. Moreover, this nanoplatform exerts a responsive signal in high&#8208;field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enables the real&#8208;time report of Mn release and the monitoring of ferroptosis initiation through the signal changes of T1&#8208;/T2&#8208;MRI. Thus, our nanoplatform provides a novel strategy to store, deliver and precisely release Mn ions for MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis therapy.

         <title>Precision Synthesis of Various Low&#8208;Bandgap Donor&#8211;Acceptor Alternating Conjugated Polymers via Living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to Professor Chung&#8208;Mo Park at Seoul National University on the occasion of his retirement and his life&#8208;long achievement in research and educationDonor&#8211;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers with various electronic characteristics, including strong donor&#8211;strong acceptor, are synthesized via living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization in a controlled manner. The polymerization also works with a complex quateraryl monomer and allows for one&#8208;pot di(tri)block copolymer synthesis. The resulting polymers have tunable optical and electrochemical properties based on the combination of building units.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) using a RuPhos Pd G3 precatalyst is a versatile method for the precision synthesis of various donor&#8211;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers (DA ACPs). First, the living SCTP of biaryl monomers with combinations of both medium to strong A and D were optimized to produce DA ACPs with controlled number average molecular weight (Mn), narrow dispersity (&#208;, 1.05&#8211;1.29), and high yield (&gt;87&#8201;%). Moreover, its expansion to controlled polymerization (Mn=9.2&#8211;40.0&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) of an A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2&#8208;D quateraryl monomer containing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP; strong A) was successful. The living SCTP also enabled the efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of various diblock and triblock copolymers. Lastly, the DA ACPs showed tunable optical band gap (Egopt, from 1.29 to 1.77&#8197;eV) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (from &#8722;5.57 to &#8722;4.75&#8197;eV), while their block copolymers exhibited broad absorption ranges and promising visible light&#8208;harvesting properties.

         <title>Alkyl/Glycosyl Sulfoxides as Radical Precursors and Their Use in the Synthesis of Pyridine Derivatives
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides are shown to be suitable precursors to radicals. Alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which, upon visible&#8208;light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to give various pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
We report here the use of simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides as precursors to radicals and their application in the preparation of pyridine derivatives. We show that alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes in solution, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to afford various pyridine derivatives smoothly. This reaction displays broad scope with respect to both sulfoxides and N&#8208;methoxy pyridiniums. The synthetic versatility of sulfoxides as a handle in chemistry adds to their power as radical precursors. Glycosyl sulfoxides are converted to the corresponding pyridyl C&#8208;glycosides with high stereoselectivities. Computational and experimental studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclopentyl Boronic Esters Bearing Contiguous Fully Substituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes enables the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, fully substituted stereocenters with excellent levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.







Abstract
The synthesis of molecules bearing two or more contiguous, quaternary stereocenters is challenging, owing to the difficulty in controlling stereochemistry whilst simultaneously constructing a sterically congested motif. Herein, we report the electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes for the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, fully substituted stereocenters with high levels of stereocontrol. Remarkably, simple variation of the reaction solvent enabled their diastereodivergent construction with facile access to complementary diastereomeric pairs. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scanning Potential&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Sensing of Dopamine in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated the first fast&#8208;scanning potential&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (FSP&#8208;OECT) for in vivo dopamine (DA) sensing, featuring high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. It was successfully applied for in vivo DA sensing at low basal levels as well as the electrically stimulated release of DA.







Abstract
Developing techniques for the highly sensitive assay of neurotransmitters is essential for understanding physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate a fast&#8208;scanning potential (FSP)&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (OECT): for the highly sensitive sensing of dopamine (DA) in a living rat brain. The configuration combines the selectivity of fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with the high sensitivity of an OECT. The combined use of FSP as a gating mode and transconductance (gm) as a sensing parameter further improve the sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, limit of detection, reproducibility, and stability. The FSP&#8208;OECT exhibits a sensitivity of 0.899&#8197;S&#8201;M&#8722;1 and a low limit of detection down to 5&#8197;nM and was validated for in vivo monitoring of the basal level and electrically stimulated release of DA.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu+ via Strong Electronic Interaction for Selective and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong electronic interactions between hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) and Cu2O protect the Cu&#8722;O bonds against electron attack through the transfer of accumulated electrons from Cu2O to h&#8208;BN. This effect stabilizes the active Cu+ species during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Copper oxide&#8208;based materials effectively electrocatalyze carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR). To comprehend their role and achieve high CO2RR activity, Cu+ in copper oxides must be stabilized. As an electrocatalyst, Cu2O nanoparticles were decorated with hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets to stabilize Cu+. The C2H4/CO ratio increased 1.62&#8208;fold in the CO2RR with Cu2O&#8722;BN compared to that with Cu2O. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed strong electronic interactions between the two components in Cu2O&#8722;BN, which strengthens the Cu&#8722;O bonds. Electrophilic h&#8208;BN receives partial electron density from Cu2O, protecting the Cu&#8722;O bonds from electron attack during the CO2RR and stabilizing the Cu+ species during long&#8208;term electrolysis. The well&#8208;retained Cu+ species enhanced the C2 product selectivity and improved the stability of Cu2O&#8722;BN. This work offers new insight into the metal&#8208;valence&#8208;state&#8208;dependent selectivity of catalysts, enabling the design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Metathesis Reactions of a NHC&#8208;Stabilized Phosphaborene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable compounds with a genuine B=P double bond are rare and have limited applications given their protecting groups&#8242; bulky nature. The preparation of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene with a B=P double bond and a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal is reported, which exhibits an unprecedented ability for B=P&#8208;unit transfer reactions, allowing the isolation of B=P&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
The BP unsaturated unit is a very attractive functional group as it provides novel reactivity and unique physical properties. Nonetheless, applications remain limited so far due to the bulky nature of B/P&#8208;protecting groups, required to prevent oligomerization. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene, bearing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal, as a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable crystalline solid accessible via facile NHC&#8208;induced trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) elimination from its phosphinoborane precursor. This phosphaborene compound, bearing a genuine B=P bond, exhibits a remarkable ability for undergoing P&#8208;centre metathesis reactions, which allows the isolation of a series of unprecedented phosphaborenes. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations provide insights into the B=P bonding situation.

Abstract
A critical step in advancing the practical application of copper&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to bridge the large gap between device efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance. Described is a panel of air&#8208; and thermally stable two&#8208;coordinate CuI emitters featuring bulky pyrazine&#8208; (PzIPr) or pyridine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PyIPr*) and carbazole (Cz) ligands with enhanced amide&#8208;Cu&#8208;carbene bonding interactions. These CuI emitters display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from the 1LL&#8242;CT(Cz&#8594;PzIPr/PyIPr*) excited states across the blue to red regions with exceptional radiative rate constants of 1.1&#8211;2.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Back&#8208;Gated van der Waals Heterojunction Manipulates Local Charges toward Fine&#8208;Tuning Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microcell&#8208;based in&#8197;situ electronic/electrochemical system was designed to unlock the fixed charge transfer of a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction under an electric field. The charges across the van der Waals (vdW) channel distribute to three Mo atoms adjacent to S vacancies and strengthen Mo&#8722;H bonding. The catalyst design enables precise regulation of the electronic configuration.







Abstract
Charge redistribution plays a prominent role in interpreting the intrinsic electrocatalytic mechanism. Establishing a quantitative relationship between the local charges and electrochemical performance can fundamentally update the design philosophies beyond conventional methods. We describe exertion of an external electric field in the cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction to finely manipulate intermolecular charge transfer. The injected charges (e&#8722;) from CoPc to MoS2 migrate to natural S vacancies and enhance Mo&#8722;H bonding. Moreover, the band gap of MoS2 and CoPc can be readily tuned by the electric field, verifying band engineering at the heterointerface. In&#8197;situ photoluminescence spectra and gate&#8208;dependent electrochemical measurement reveal a linear correlation between the charge accumulation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity.

&lt;p&gt;A microcell-based in&#8197;situ electronic/electrochemical system was designed to unlock the fixed charge transfer of a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction under an electric field. The charges across the van der Waals (vdW) channel distribute to three Mo atoms adjacent to S vacancies and strengthen Mo&#8722;H bonding. The catalyst design enables precise regulation of the electronic configuration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge redistribution plays a prominent role in interpreting the intrinsic electrocatalytic mechanism. Establishing a quantitative relationship between the local charges and electrochemical performance can fundamentally update the design philosophies beyond conventional methods. We describe exertion of an external electric field in the cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction to finely manipulate intermolecular charge transfer. The injected charges (e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) from CoPc to MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; migrate to natural S vacancies and enhance Mo&#8722;H bonding. Moreover, the band gap of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CoPc can be readily tuned by the electric field, verifying band engineering at the heterointerface. In&#8197;situ photoluminescence spectra and gate-dependent electrochemical measurement reveal a linear correlation between the charge accumulation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. This approach provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts, enabling precise regulation of the electronic configuration to improve catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Mapping of Efficient Chiral Induction by Helicene&#8208;Type Additives in Copolymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special class of helicene&#8208;type additives, which are straightforward to synthesize in large amounts, induce strong chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films. Advanced chirality&#8208;sensitive microscopy techniques and ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods based on transient circular dichroism and transient circularly polarized luminescence reveal the supramolecular origin of the chiroptical properties.







Abstract
We observed efficient induction of chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films by mixing with helicene&#8208;type chiral additives based on the dibenzo[c,h]acridine motif. Images obtained from circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) microscopy provide information about the chiral arrangements in the thin films with diffraction&#8208;limited resolution. The CD signal shows a characteristic dependence on the film thickness, which supports a supramolecular origin of the strong chiral response of the copolymer. In particular, we demonstrate the discrimination between films of opposite chirality based on their ultrafast transient chiral response through the use of femtosecond broadband CD spectroscopy and a newly developed setup for transient CPL spectroscopy with 28&#8197;ps time resolution. A systematic variation of the enantiomeric excess of the chiral additive shows that the &#8220;Sergeants and Soldiers&#8221; concept and &#8220;Majority Rules&#8221; are not obeyed.

         <dc:description>Herein, we develop a novel bacteria&#8208;based drug delivery system, termed as the Trojan nanobacteria system, which is made of nanoagents internalized into engineered bacteria through bacteria&#8208;specific maltodextrin&#160;(MD) transporters. Compared with the system of attaching nanoagents to bacterial surfaces, the presented Trojan system features higher payloads and better stability.&#160;In cancer therapy, Trojan nanobacteria can specifically discriminate the tumor region and then penetrate deep tumor tissues. Afterwards, Trojan nanobacteria systems are able to destroy deep tumor tissues, which is due to the synergistic effects of antitumor protein (  e.g.,  tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945;, TNF&#8208;&#945;) expression and photothermal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung AlaB Reagents for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;Proteogenic Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amino acid synthon in the form of boronoalanine (AlaB) suitable for umpolung peptide/protein functionalization is described. It is demonstrated that AlaB can be incorporated into peptides and proteins, and remains stable under solid&#8208;phase synthesis, native chemical ligation, and radical desulfurization. Furthermore, AlaB is a competent partner in inter(intra)molecular C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids and functionalized peptides are important motifs in modern drug discovery. Here we report that AlaB can serve as universal building blocks in the synthesis of a diverse collection of modified amino acids, peptides, and proteins. First, we develop the synthesis of AlaB from redox&#8208;active esters of aspartic acid resulting in a series of &#946;&#8208;boronoalanine derivatives. Next, we show that AlaB can be integrated into automated oligopeptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis. AlaB is compatible with common transformations used in preparative peptide chemistry such as native chemical ligation and radical desulfurization as showcased by total synthesis of AlaB&#8208;containing ubiquitin. Furthermore, AlaB reagents participate in Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, including C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings and macrocyclizations. Taken together, AlaB synthons are practical reagents to access modified peptides, proteins, and in the synthesis of cyclic/stapled peptides.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Reductive Elimination of Chlorine from a Carbene&#8208;Xanthylium Gold(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex combining an ambiphilic carbene/xanthylium ligand and a gold trichloride supports the efficient green&#8208;light&#8208;induced extrusion of chlorine radicals en route to the corresponding gold(I) complex. The photolability of this gold(III) complex originates from excitation of a carbene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad, the excited state of which challenges the inherent stability of the gold(III) moiety.







Abstract
With the discovery of late transition metal platforms that support clean photoreductive halogen eliminations, we now describe an indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene gold trichloride complex ([7]+) decorated at the 4&#8208;position by a xanthylium unit. This orange complex features a low energy band in the visible part of the spectrum, assigned to the charge transfer excitation of the indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad. Green&#8208;light irradiation of this complex in the presence of a chlorine trap elicits the clean photoelimination of chlorine radicals, producing the corresponding gold(I) complex. This visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreduction is very efficient, reaching quantum yields close to 10&#8201;%. A neutral analog of [7]+ featuring an anthryl group rather than a xanthylium unit proved to be perfectly photostable, supporting the importance of the xanthylium&#8208;based photoredox unit present in [7]+.

         <title>A Planar Five&#8208;Membered Aromatic Ring Stabilized by Only Two &#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although doubted in the past, two &#960;&#8208;electrons are just enough to stabilize five&#8208;membered aromatic compounds that are even stable at room&#8208;temperature, as shown by the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene. This compound is a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths.







Abstract
Many chemicals known today are partially or fully aromatic, since a ring framework experiences additional stabilization through the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons. While aromatic rings with equal numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons and ring atoms such as benzene are particularly stable, those with the minimally required two &#960;&#8208;electrons are very rare and yet remain limited to three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered rings if not stabilized in the coordination sphere of heavy metals. Here we report the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene, a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths, which together with computational and spectroscopic data confirm its aromatic character. Our results prove that aromatic stabilization goes far beyond what has previously been assumed as minimum &#960;&#8208;electron count in a five&#8208;atom ring fragment.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol at Close to Theoretical Potential via Engineering Abundant Electron&#8208;Donating Cu&#948;+ Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2S1&#8722;x hollow nanocubes with abundant and stable Cu&#948;+ species are designedly synthesized and achieve ethanol&#8208;selective electrosynthesis. The abundant Cu&#948;+ sites have electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to liquid multi&#8208;carbon alcohols provides a promising way for intermittent renewable energy reservation and greenhouse effect mitigation. Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can produce ethanol, but the in situ formed Cu&#948;+ is insufficient and easily reduced to Cu0. Here a Cu2S1&#8722;x catalyst with abundant Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species is designedly synthesized and exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V for ethanol production. The catalyst not only delivers an outstanding ethanol selectivity of 86.9&#8201;% and a Faradaic efficiency of 73.3&#8201;% but also provides a long&#8208;term stability of Cu&#948;+, gaining an economic profit based on techno&#8208;economic analysis. The calculation and in situ spectroscopic results reveal that the abundant Cu&#948;+ sites display electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.

         <title>Bioinspired and Ligand&#8208;Regulated Unnatural Prenylation and Geranylation of Oxindoles with Isoprene under Pd Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy has been developed for the bioinspired and ligand&#8208;regulated chemoselective unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles with isoprene under Pd catalysis. The selectivity was governed by modulating the coordination geometry of the Pd catalyst.







Abstract
In nature, prenylation and geranylation are two important metabolic processes for the creation of hemiterpenoids and monoterpenoids under enzyme catalysis. Herein, we have demonstrated bioinspired unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles using the basic industrial feedstock isoprene through ligand regulation under Pd catalysis. Pentenylated oxindoles (with C5 added) were attained with high selectivity when using a bisphosphine ligand, whereas upon switching to a monophosphine ligand, selectivity toward geranylated oxindoles (with C10 added) was achieved. Moreover, the head&#8208;to&#8208;head product could be further isomerized to an internal skipped diene under Pd&#8722;H catalysis. No stoichiometric by&#8208;product was formed in the process.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Layered Lithium Oxides through Cation Vacancies for Enhanced Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beginning with cation&#8208;vacancy controllable LiNiO2, the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations was studied. The results indicate that lattice oxygen activated by cation vacancies triggered charge disproportionation to form high&#8208;activity Ni4+, resulting in facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.







Abstract
Despite the fact that high&#8208;valent nickel&#8208;based oxides exhibit promising catalytic activity for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the fundamental questions concerning the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations remain to be elucidated. Here, we unveil the underlying enhanced mechanism of UOR by employing a series of prepared cation&#8208;vacancy controllable LiNiO2 (LNO) model catalysts. Impressively, the optimized layered LNO&#8208;2 exhibits an extremely low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 along with excellent stability after the 160&#8197;h test. Operando characterisations combined with the theoretical analysis reveal the activated lattice oxygen in layered LiNiO2 with moderate cation vacancies triggers charge disproportion of the Ni site to form Ni4+ species, facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrocarbamoylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes enabled by copper hydride and palladium cooperative catalysis was developed. Utilizing readily available carbamoyl chlorides, this method can be applied to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, providing &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields with excellent levels of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation of olefins represents a straightforward approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched amides, but is hampered by the necessity to employ CO gas, often at elevated pressures. We herein describe, as an alternative, an enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes leveraging dual copper hydride and palladium catalysis to enable the use of readily available carbamoyl chlorides as a practical carbamoylating reagent. The protocol is applicable to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Substrates containing a diverse range of functional groups as well as heterocyclic substructures undergo functionalization to provide &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Reductive Carbon&#8211;Carbon Coupling on Metal Sites Regulates Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Water Using ZnSe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive carbon&#8211;carbon coupling was used to block H2 evolution in CO2 photoreduction in water. Furfural, one of the biomass platform molecules, adsorbs on Zn&#8208;sites consuming electrons and protons originally used for H2 production, but the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies remains. Therefore, CO was evolved with a CO/H2 ratio of 265&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the gas phase and furfural was upgraded to value&#8208;added hydrofuroin.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) consisting of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements show attractive potentials towards solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. However, the inhibition of hydrogen (H2) production in aqueous solution remains a challenge. Here, we describe the first example of a carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling reaction to block the competing H2 evolution in photocatalytic CO2 reduction in water. In a specific system taking ZnSe QDs as photocatalysts, the introduction of furfural can significantly suppress H2 evolution leading to CO evolution with a rate of &#8776;5.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a turnover number (TON) of &gt;7500 under 24&#8197;h visible light. Meanwhile, furfural is upgraded to the self&#8208;coupling product with a yield of 99.8&#8201;% based on the consumption of furfural. Mechanistic insights show that the reductive furfural coupling reaction occurs on surface Zn&#8208;sites to consume electrons and protons originally used for H2 production, while the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies from CO2 remains.

         <dc:description>A facile method for the construction of the aspidosperma core from indole functionalized with a nonterminal  N  &#8208;allenamides and dimethyl methylenemalonate is described. Various polysubstituted tetracyclic spiroindolines (27 examples) were afforded in good yields (61&#8208;90%) with &gt;99:1 dr and &gt;99:1 Z/E selectivity under mild conditions. The annulation reaction provides straightforward access to the tetracyclic spiroindoline skeleton with substitutes at the C5 position occurring in many natural products.

         <title>Injectable Granular Hydrogels as Colloidal Assembly Microreactors for Customized Structural Colored Objects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While structural coloration has captured considerable interests across different areas in the past decades, the development of macroscopic objects with tailorable structural colors remains a challenge due to the difficulty of large&#8208;scale fabrication of finely ordered nanostructures and poor processability of their constituent materials. In this work, a type of photonic granular hydrogels is developed as a novel printable ink for constructing customized structural colored objects. The magnetchromatic ink exhibits dynamic properties such as shear thinning and self&#8208;healing, enabling direct writing of macroscopic structural colored patterns by extrusion 3D printing. Further, the modularity of the photonic ink allows additive color mixing, which obviates the need for arduous nano&#8208;synthesis and expands on the color abundance of structural colored materials in a simple yet efficient manner. These characteristics grant novel photonic inks with great applicability to a variety of fields including switchable color displays, sensors,  etc  .</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report reversible high capacity adsorption of SO2 in robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Zr&#8208;bptc (H4bptc = biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid) shows a high SO2 uptake of 6.2 mmol g&#8208;1 at 0.1 bar and 298 K, reflecting excellent capture capability and removal of SO2 at low concentration (2500 ppm). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the introduction of amine, atomically&#8208;dispersed Cu(II) or heteroatomic sulphur sites into the pores enhance the capture of SO2 at low concentrations. The captured SO2 can be converted quantitatively to a pharmaceutical intermediate, aryl N&#8208;aminosulfonamide, thus converting waste to chemical values. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared micro&#8208;spectroscopic and inelastic neutron scattering &#160;enable the visualisation of the binding domains of adsorbed SO2 molecules and host&#8208;guest binding dynamics in these materials at the atomic level. The refinement of pore environment plays a critical role in designing efficient sorbent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Dihydrogen Activation by Mononuclear Iridium(II) Compounds: A Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organometallic chemistry of 4d and 5d transition metals has been vastly dominated by closed&#8208;shell states. The reactivity of their metalloradical species is though remarkable, albeit yet poorly understood and with limited mechanistic investigations available. In this work we report the synthesis and characterization of two mononuclear Ir(II) species, including the first dinitrogen adduct. These compounds activate dihydrogen at a dissimilar rate, in the latter case several orders of magnitude faster than its Ir(I) precursor. A combined experimental/computational investigation to ascertain the mechanism of this transformation in Ir(II) compounds is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hybrid Ultramicroporous TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni under Humid Conditions Using Non&#8208;Equilibrium Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs, pore size &lt; 7 &#197;) are benchmark physisorbents for trace&#160;carbon dioxide&#160;(CO2)&#160;capture under dry conditions, their affinity for&#160;water&#160;(H2O)&#160;mitigates their carbon capture performance in humid conditions. Herein, we&#160;report on the co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2&#160;by TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni&#8212;a high CO2&#160;affinity HUM&#8212;and&#160;find that slow H2O sorption kinetics can enable CO2&#160;uptake and release using shortened adsorption cycles with retention of&#160;ca.&#160;90% of dry CO2&#160;uptake. Insight into co&#8208;adsorption is provided by&#160;in situ&#160;infrared spectroscopy and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations. The binding sites and sorption mechanisms reveal that both CO2&#160;and H2O molecules occupy the same ultramicropore through favorable interactions between CO2&#160;and H2O at low water loading. An energetically favored water network displaces CO2&#160;molecules at higher loading. Our results offer bottom&#8208;up design principles and insight into co&#8208;adsorption of CO2&#160;and H2O that is likely to be relevant across the full spectrum of carbon capture sorbents to better understand and address the challenge posed by humidity to gas capture.</dc:description>

The binding sites and sorption mechanisms reveal that both CO2&#160;and H2O molecules occupy the same ultramicropore through favorable interactions between CO2&#160;and H2O at low water loading. An energetically favored water network displaces CO2&#160;molecules at higher loading. Our results offer bottom-up design principles and insight into co-adsorption of CO2&#160;and H2O that is likely to be relevant across the full spectrum of carbon capture sorbents to better understand and address the challenge posed by humidity to gas capture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radiotherapy&#8208;Induced Cleavage of Quaternary Ammonium Groups Activates Prodrugs in Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cleavage chemistry offers a new chance to activate chemotherapeutic prodrugs in a tumor&#8208;selective manner, yet developing spatiotemporally controllable cleavage chemistry with deep tissue penetration is still a great challenge. Herein, we present a novel radiotherapy&#8208;triggered cleavage chemistry that enables controlled drug release in tumors. Quaternary ammonium groups are identified as masking groups that can be efficiently removed by hydrated electrons (e  &#8208;  aq  ) from water radiolysis. The subsequently released tertiary amines can be anti&#8208;cancer toxins or readily release functional molecules via 1,6&#8208;elimination. This radiotherapy&#8208;induced cleavage works successfully in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, showing remarkable treatment efficacy when the mice are given carfilzomib prodrug and radiotherapy. This strategy provides a new perspective for combinational radiochemotherapy, which is the first&#8208;line treatment for over 50% of cancer patients.</dc:description>

         <title>para&#8208;Selective Radical Trifluoromethylation of Benzamide Derivatives via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arenes via a radical pathway has attracted considerable attention recently. However, a major challenge of C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation is the lack of site&#8208;selectivity on the phenyl ring especially para&#8208;selectivity. Here we show a new strategy for para&#8208;selective C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives using iminium activation. We suppose the reaction undergoes a radical&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution instead of a radical&#8208;type electrophilic substitution commonly recognized due to iminium activation through LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) lowering. A wide range of substrates are compatible with this protocol giving almost exclusive para&#8208;trifluoromethylated products.</dc:description>

         <title>Periphery&#8208;Core Strategy to Access a Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecule Bearing Multiple Heteroatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of the bowl&#8208;shaped molecules are synthesized via a core&#8208;periphery strategy with the bowl rim closed at the final stage. However, the construction of heteroatom doped buckybowls by the periphery&#8208;core method with the bowl bottom sealed by inserting new atoms in the last step is quite limited. Herein we report the synthesis of a bowl&#8208;shaped compound containing four sulfur atoms and two embedded N&#8208;B bonds with the ratio of carbon atom and heteroatom as low as four through the periphery&#8208;core strategy. Crystallographic analysis confirms the formation of bowl&#8208;shaped structure. The multiple heteroatoms alter the molecular electronic structure, thus resulting in the distinct aromaticity when compared with its all&#8208;carbon congener. The electron&#8208;rich buckybowl shows a strong interaction with the electron&#8208;deficient fullerene C60 by forming a 1:1 complex in toluene.</dc:description>

         <title>Simulating the  Structure of Carbon Dots via Crystalline &#960; &#8208;aggregated  Organic Nanodots Prepared by Kinetically Trapped Self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports the successful preparation of a new type of crystalline luminescent organic nanodot (&lt;3.5&#160;nm) by kinetically trapped self&#8208;assembly, which is then used as  a simplified  &#960;&#8208;packing model to simulate the structure of CDs.  The precise structure and J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced photoluminescence (PL) of the nanodots are revealed by investigating the structural relationship between the nanodots and the corresponding single crystals and their properties.  Compared with the single crystals, crystalline organic nanodots show longer PL lifetime, higher PL quantum yield, and narrower PL peak, indicating that they are potential organic quantum nanodots. In addition, the efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking environment in the corresponding single crystals can promote &#960;&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced PL anisotropy. This work indicates crystalline organic nanodots with precise structures to be potentially useful for understanding the structures of CDs and to be attractive potential luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysosome Interference Enabled by Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Assembly of DNA Nanoframework inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing material chemistry systems coupled with biological processes is a promising way to rationally modulate lysosomal functions. Herein, we report a proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of DNA nanoframework inside cells coupled with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation, achieving the rational modulation of lysosomal functions, which we termed as lysosome interference. Through lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis, DNA nanoframework with acid&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;i&#8208;motif entered into lysosome and assembled into aggregate triggered by lysosomal acidity, which performed a long&#8208;term retention. Meanwhile, the consumption of protons resulted in lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thereby alleviating the degradation of nucleic acid drugs in interfered lysosomes and improving gene silencing effect. This study explores a new avenue to achieve lysosome interference by coupling subcellular microenvironment and precisely&#8208;programmable assembly system.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Activation and Ni&#8208;S Stabilization in NiO/NiS2 for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the active species and improving the structural stabilization of sulfur&#8208;containing catalysts during the OER process remain a tremendous challenge. Herein, we constructed NiO/NiS  2  and Fe &#8208; NiO/NiS  2  as catalyst models to study the effect of Fe doping. As expected, Fe &#8208; NiO/NiS  2  exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  . The accumulation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of materials after Fe doping can promote the formation of high active NiOOH at a lower OER potential. Moreover, we investigated the level of corrosion of M&#8208;S bonds and compared the stability variation of M&#8208;S bonds with Fe at different locations. Interestingly, Fe bonded with S in the bulk as the sacrificial agent can alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial Ni&#8208;S bonds and thus endow Fe &#8208; NiO/NiS  2  long&#8208;term durability. This work would motivate the community to focus more on resolving the corrosion of sulfur&#8208;containing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Local Free Water Enriched Microenvironment for Surpassing Platinum Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface to push reactants into inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) is desirable for efficient electrocatalysts, however, has rarely been implemented due to the elusive electrochemical IHP and inert catalyst surface. Here, we propose the introduction of local force fields by surface hydroxyl group to engineer the electrochemical microenvironment and enhance alkaline hydrogen evolution activity. Taking hydroxyl group immobilized Ni/Ni  3  C heterostructure as a prototype, we revealed that the local hydrogen bond induced by the surface hydroxyl group drag 4&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded H  2  O molecules across the IHP to become free H  2  O and thus continuously supply reactants for catalytic sites. In addition, the hydroxyl group coupled with Ni/Ni  3  C heterostructure further lowers the water dissociation energy by polarization effect. As a direct outcome, hydroxyl&#8208;rich catalysts surpass Pt/C activity at high current density (500 mA cm  &#8208;2  @ ~276 mV) in alkaline medium.</dc:description>

         <title>PEG&#8208;Functionalized Hollow Multishelled Structures with On&#8208;Off Switch and Rate&#8208;Regulation for Controllable Antimicrobial Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of responsive antimicrobial carriers with multifunctional and controllable release is an attractive but challenging proposition. Recently developed hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) possess intrinsic structural advantages such as easily modifiable surfaces and mutually influenced shells. Therefore, significant efforts have been devoted to realize their potential in drug&#8208;delivery systems. Herein, we report a novel pH&#8208;responsive antimicrobial carrier having hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features are present in the form of rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell by electrostatic interaction, respectively, resulting in a long&#8208;lasting mildew resistance for up to 71 days. The versatility of the hierarchical interactions of HoMSs will inspire the design of promising smart drug carriers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Plurizyme with Transaminase and Hydrolase Activity Catalyzes Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering dual&#8208;function single polypeptide catalysts with two abiotic or biotic catalytic entities (or combinations of both) supporting cascade reactions is becoming an important area of enzyme engineering and catalysis. Here we present the development of a  PluriZyme  , TR  2  E  2  , with efficient native transaminase (  k  cat  : 69.49&#177;1.77 min  &#8208;1  ) and artificial esterase (  k  cat  : 3908 to 0.41 min  &#8208;1  ) activities, integrated into a single scaffold and evaluate its utility in a cascade reaction. TR  2  E  2  (pH  opt  : 8.0&#8208;9.5; T  opt  : 60&#8208;65 &#176;C) efficiently converts methyl 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoate into 3&#8208;(  R  )&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid, a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs. The reaction proceeds through the conversion of the &#946;&#8208;keto ester to the &#946;&#8208;keto acid at the hydrolytic site and subsequently to the &#946;&#8208;amino acid (e.e. &gt;99%) at the transaminase site. The catalytic power of the TR  2  E  2  PluriZyme  was proved with a set of &#946;&#8208;keto esters, demonstrating the potential of such designs to address bioinspired cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Multivalent Porphyrin&#8211;Peptide Conjugates by Direct Porphyrin Construction on Resin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional porphyrin&#8211;peptide conjugates with different propensities for self&#8208;assembly into various supramolecular nanoarchitectures play important roles in advanced materials and biomedical research. However, preparing prefunctionalized core porphyrins by traditional low&#8208;yielding statistical synthesis and purifying them after peptide ligation through many rounds of HPLC purification is tedious and unsustainable. Herein, we report a novel integrated solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for the construction of porphyrin moieties from simple aldehydes and dipyrromethanes on resin&#8208;bound peptides directly to form mono&#8208;, cis/trans&#8208;di&#8208;, and trivalent porphyrin&#8211;peptide conjugates in a highly efficient and controllable manner; moreover, only single final&#8208;stage HPLC purification of the products is needed. This efficient strategy enables the rapid, greener, and substrate&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of multivalent porphyrin&#8208;(long) peptide conjugate libraries for multifarious biological and materials applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence&#8208;Boosted Escape of DNAzyme from Endosomes for Enhanced Gene&#8208;Silencing Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the enormous potential of DNAzyme for gene therapy, its efficacy is hampered by the limited endosomal escape capability. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNAzyme delivery platform to achieve enhanced gene&#8208;silencing efficacy. The nanoplatform is composed of therapeutic DNAzyme, photosensitizers (PSs) and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that can convert NIR light to visible light. The system allows NIR light&#8208;activatable generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species due to the energy transfer from the UCNPs to PSs, which boosts the endosomal escape of DNAzyme for an improved gene&#8208;silencing efficacy. We demonstrate that the nanocomposites represent a promising platform to integrate DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy with NIR light&#8208;triggered photodynamic therapy for combinational tumor treatment. This work highlights a robust approach to combat the current limitations of DNAzyme delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Photostability and Dynamic Helical Behavior in Chiral Poly(phenylacetylene)s with a Preferred Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) are interesting materials due to the possibility of tuning their helical scaffold (sense and elongation) once they have been prepared and by the presence of external stimuli. The main limitation in the application of PPAs is their poor photostability. These polymers degrade under visible light exposure through a photochemical electrocyclization process. In this work, it was demonstrated, through a selected example, how the photochemical degradation in PPAs is directly related to their dynamic helical behavior. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic helical structures show poor photostability under UV&#8208;vis light exposure, poly&#8208;(  R  )&#8208;  1  , bearing an enantiopure sulfoxide group as pendant group and designed to have a quasi&#8208;static helical behavior, shows a large photostability due to the restricted conformational composition at the polyene backbone, needed to orient the conjugated double bonds prior to the photochemical electrocyclization process and the subsequent degradation of the material.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper Cage&#8208;Complex as Mimic of the pMMO CuC Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and its mechanism of action are not known. Recently, the Cu  C  site emerged as a potential active site, but to date it lacks any study on biomimetic resemblance of the coordination environment provided by the enzyme. Here, the synthesis of a cage ligand providing such environment is reported. Copper is incorporated, and coordination occurs by the two imidazole and one carboxylate group offered by the ligand. Depending on the oxidation state, it can adopt different coordination modes, evidenced by solid state structures and computational investigation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The active site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and its mechanism of action are not known. Recently, the Cu  C  site emerged as a potential active site, but to date it lacks any study on biomimetic resemblance of the coordination environment provided by the enzyme. Here, the synthesis of a cage ligand providing such environment is reported. Copper is incorporated, and coordination occurs by the two imidazole and one carboxylate group offered by the ligand. Depending on the oxidation state, it can adopt different coordination modes, evidenced by solid state structures and computational investigation. The copper(I) state readily reacts with dioxygen and thereby undergoes CH activation. On top, the catalytic aerobic oxidation of hydroquinones as ubiquinol mimics is shown. Clean one electron oxidation occurs under mild conditions and EPR analysis of the copper(II) state in the presence of water reveals striking similarities to the data obtained from pMMO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Nanostructured 3D Printed Materials by Controlling Macromolecular Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured polymeric materials play important roles in many advanced applications, however, controlling the morphologies of polymeric thermosets remains a challenge. This work uses multi&#8208;arm macroCTAs to mediate polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) and prepare nanostructured materials via photoinduced 3D printing. The characteristic length scale of microphase&#8208;separated domains is determined by the macroCTA arm length, while nanoscale morphologies are controlled by the macroCTA architecture. Specifically, using 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; arm macroCTAs provides materials with different morphologies compared to analogous monofunctional linear macroCTAs at similar compositions. The mechanical properties of these nanostructured thermosets can also be tuned while maintaining the desired morphologies. Using multi&#8208;arm macroCTAs can thus broaden the scope of accessible nanostructures for extended applications, including the fabrication of actuators and potential drug delivery devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Crucial Roles of a Pendant Imidazole Ligand of a Cobalt Porphyrin Complex in the Stoichiometric and Catalytic Reduction of Dioxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cobalt porphyrin complex with a pendant imidazole base ([(L1)CoII]) is an efficient catalyst for the homogeneous catalytic two&#8208;electron reduction of dioxygen by 1,1&#8242;&#8208;dimethylferrocene (Me2Fc) in the presence of triflic acid (HOTf), as compared with a cobalt porphyrin complex without a pendant imidazole base ([(L2)CoII]). The pendant imidazole ligand plays a crucial role not only to provide an imidazolinium proton for proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) from [(L1)CoII] to O2  in the presence of HOTf but also to facilitate electron transfer (ET) from [(L1)CoII] to O2  in the absence of HOTf. The kinetics analysis and the detection of intermediates in the stoichiometric and catalytic reduction of O2  have provided clues to clarify the crucial roles of the pendant imidazole ligand of [(L1)CoII] for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Aptamers with Selectively Enhanced Biostability in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer sgc8c equipped with an ATP&#8208;responsive protection module, termed ARP&#8208;sgc8c, was designed. ARP&#8208;sgc8c could be selectively protected from nuclease degradation in the tumor microenvironment through specific incorporation along with high&#8208;concentration ATP, while its rapid degradation was maintained in healthy tissues.







Abstract
Aptamers are emerging as promising molecular tools in cancer&#8208;targeted theranostics. Improving their in vivo stability has been a critical issue in promoting clinical translation, but such efforts could lead to more serious side effects resulting from prolonged retention in healthy organs. To address this problem, we developed an environment&#8208;responsive stabilization strategy for the selective enhancement of aptamer biostability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Briefly, by means of the end extension of an ATP&#8208;responsive protection (ARP) module, the designed aptamer could be protected from nuclease degradation through the specific incorporation of ATP. Based on our in vivo results, this ARP&#8208;aptamer probe was effectively accumulated in tumors via aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition. It showed selectively prolonged tumor retention time, but rapid digestion in healthy organs. Our strategy should provide a new paradigm for the development of organ&#8208;specific nucleic acid&#8208;based imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Native Ambient Mass Spectrometry of an Intact Membrane Protein Assembly and Soluble Protein Assemblies Directly from Lens Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integral membrane protein assembly Aquaporin&#8208;0 was analysed by native ambient mass spectrometry of eye lens tissue. Membrane protein assemblies were solubilised by detergent micelles. Spatially&#8208;resolved analysis for mapping protein assembly distributions, accurate intact mass determination, and the identification of assemblies approx. 100&#8197;kDa in molecular weight are demonstrated.







Abstract
Membrane proteins constitute around two&#8208;thirds of therapeutic targets but present a significant challenge for structural analysis due to their low abundance and solubility. Existing methods for structural analysis rely on over&#8208;expression and/or purification of the membrane protein, thus removing any links back to actual physiological environment. Here, we demonstrate mass spectrometry analysis of an intact oligomeric membrane protein directly from tissue. Aquaporin&#8208;0 exists as a 113&#8197;kDa tetramer, with each subunit featuring six transmembrane helices. We report the characterisation of the intact assembly directly from a section of sheep eye lens without sample pre&#8208;treatment. Protein identity was confirmed by mass measurement of the tetramer and subunits, together with top&#8208;down mass spectrometry, and the spatial distribution was determined by mass spectrometry imaging. Our approach allows simultaneous analysis of soluble protein assemblies in the tissue.

         <title>Tailored Multivalent Targeting of Siglecs with Photosensitizing Liposome Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising approach towards optically active biohybrid systems that selectively bind receptors of the sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins (siglecs) family is described. To this end, siglec&#8208;modified supported lipid bilayers act as cell membrane mimics that interact in a multivalent fashion with photosensitizer&#8208;loaded vesicles, showing a potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.







Abstract
The modification of surfaces with multiple ligands allows the formation of platforms for the study of multivalency in diverse processes. Herein we use this approach for the implementation of a photosensitizer (PS)&#8208;nanocarrier system that binds efficiently to siglec&#8208;10, a member of the CD33 family of siglecs (sialic acid (SA)&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins). In particular, a zinc phthalocyanine derivative bearing three SA moieties (PcSA) has been incorporated in the membrane of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), retaining its photophysical properties upon insertion into the SUV's membrane. The interaction of these biohybrid systems with human siglec&#8208;10&#8208;displaying supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) has shown the occurrence of weakly multivalent, superselective interactions between vesicle and SLB. The SLB therefore acts as an excellent cell membrane mimic, while the binding with PS&#8208;loaded SUVs shows the potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.

Nonradiative decay invariably competes with radiative decay during the deexcitation process of matter. In the community of luminescence research, nonradiative decay has been deemed less attractive than radiative decay. However, all things in their being are good for something and so is nonradiative decay. As the molecular motion&#8208;facilitated nonradiative decay (MMFND) effect is inevitable in photophysical processes, it provides a new avenue to convert the harvested light energy into exploitable forms by harnessing molecular motion. In many cases, active molecular motion enables thermal deactivation from excited states. In this Minireview, recent advances in photothermal and photoacoustic systems with MMFND character are summarized. We believe that this presentation of the rational engineering of molecular motion for efficient photothermal generation will deepen the understanding of the relationship between molecular motion and nonradiative decay and navigate people to rethink the positive aspects of nonradiative decay for the establishment of new light&#8208;controllable techniques.

         <title>VPO4F Fluorophosphates Polyanion Cathodes for High&#8208;Voltage Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal criterion for proton cathodes was put forward combining experimental results and theoretical simulations, which might pave a new way for exploiting electrode materials for proton batteries. As a result, vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO4F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with high capacity.







Abstract
Proton batteries are emerging in electrochemical energy storage because of the associated fast kinetics, low cost and high safety. However, their development is hindered by the relatively low energy density due to the limited choice of cathode materials. Herein, metal phosphate polyanion cathodes are proposed as the proton cathode for the first time. Combining experimental results and theoretical simulations, a universal criterion for the proton cathode was put forward. Vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO4F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with a specific capacity of 116&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high potential of 1.0&#8197;V (vs. SHE). The proton insertion/extraction mechanism in the VPO4F electrode was also verified through X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the stability of VPO4F was investigated in various electrolytes and the optimized electrolyte enabled the stable operation of VPO4F for 300&#8197;cycles. This work provides new inspiration in the exploitation of new electrode materials for electrochemical proton storage devices.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of a Fluorinated&#8208;Squaramide Covalent Organic Framework for the Highly Efficient and Board&#8208;Spectrum Removal of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of molecular recognition and materials science, a multi&#8208;functional two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) is prepared and applied as a board&#8208;spectrum adsorbent for the high&#8208;efficiency removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl pollutants.







Abstract
The escalating contamination by per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has become an urgent issue in recent years, and the structural diversity of PFAS is the major challenge for effective pollution control. Herein, we take the intrinsic advantages of squaramide and prepare a new two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (FSQ&#8208;1) that exhibits board&#8208;spectrum PFAS affinity. The tailor&#8208;made linker forges hydrogen&#8208;bond donors, hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors, and fluorophilic segments into one framework. The obtained material exhibits multipoint and multitype affinity to PFAS with different structures, by which high&#8208;efficient and board&#8208;spectrum removal of various PFAS can be simultaneously achieved. Notably, the thermodynamic profiles provided by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments further illustrate the underlying mechanism of the board&#8208;spectrum affinity. FSQ&#8208;1 can also be applied for efficient PFAS extraction in trace&#8208;level PFAS analysis.

         <title>Reversible Switchability of Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetodielectric Effect Induced by Intermolecular Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triggered by thermally assisted intermolecular motion via hydrogen bonds, a CoII compound undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition near room temperature, accompanied by reversible switching of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, magnetic anisotropy and magnetodielectric effect.







Abstract
Introducing magnetic switchability into artificial molecular machines is fascinating for precise control of magnetism via external stimuli. Herein, a field&#8208;induced CoII single&#8208;molecule magnet was found to exhibit the reversible switch of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion near room temperature, along with thermal conformational motion of the 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 rotor, which pulls the coordinated H2O to rotate through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and triggers a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition with Twarm=282&#8197;K and Tcool=276&#8197;K. Interestingly, the molecular magnetic anisotropy probed by single&#8208;crystal angular&#8208;resolved magnetometry revealed the reorientation of easy axis by 14.6&#176;. Moreover, ON/OFF negative magnetodielectric effects were respectively observed in the high&#8208;/low&#8208;temperature phase, which manifests the spin&#8208;lattice interaction in the high&#8208;temperature phase could be stronger, in accompanied by the hydrogen bonding between the rotating 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 and the coordinated H2O.

         <title>Methylamine Lithium Borohydride as Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion conductor based on methylamine lithium borohydride is reported. The new compound crystallizes in a layered two&#8208;dimensional structure with fast Li&#8208;ion migration in the interlayers. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as electrolyte is demonstrated with Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS2 as the cathode material.







Abstract
Fast Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature is a major challenge for utilization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries. Metal borohydrides with neutral ligands are a new emerging class of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors, and here we report the discovery of a new mono&#8208;methylamine lithium borohydride with very fast Li+ conductivity at room temperature. LiBH4&#8901;CH3NH2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, forming a two&#8208;dimensional unique layered structure. The layers are separated by hydrophobic &#8722;CH3 moieties, and contain large voids, allowing for fast Li&#8208;ionic conduction in the interlayers, &#963;(Li+)=1.24&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The electronic conductivity is negligible, and the electrochemical stability is &#8776;2.1&#8197;V vs Li. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as the electrolyte, Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS2 as the cathode is demonstrated.

         <title>Intramolecular Energy and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Transfer within a BINOL&#8208;Perylene Hetero&#8208;Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) hetero&#8208;cyclophane comprising a chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) dye and a dynamically racemic PBI dye shows quantitative energy and solvent&#8208;dependent chirality transfer among its components, thereby leading to an amplified bright red circularly polarized luminescence from PBI.







Abstract
Multichromophoric macrocycles and cyclophanes are important supramolecular architectures for the elucidation of interchromophoric interactions originating from precise spatial organization. Herein, by combining an axially chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) and a bay&#8208;substituted conformationally labile twisted perylene bisimide (PBI) within a cyclophane of well&#8208;defined geometry, we report a chiral PBI hetero&#8208;cyclophane (BBI&#8208;PBI) that shows intramolecular energy and solvent&#8208;regulated chirality transfer from the BBI to the PBI subunit. Excellent spectral overlap and spatial arrangement of BBI and PBI lead to efficient excitation energy transfer and subsequent PBI emission with high quantum yield (80&#8211;98&#8201;%) in various solvents. In contrast, chirality transfer is strongly dependent on the respective solvent as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The combination of energy and chirality transfer affords a bright red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from the PBI chromophore by excitation of BBI.

         <title>Discovery and Genetic Code Expansion of a Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Hydrolase from the Human Saliva Metagenome for the Degradation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization of PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MG8, a novel polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome, with robust PET degradation activity, was discovered and characterized. It was further repurposed into a covalent binder of PET through genetic code expansion, enabling its use to attach protein payloads to PET and other polyesters under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report a bioinformatic workflow and subsequent discovery of a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase, which we named MG8, from the human saliva metagenome. MG8 has robust PET plastic degradation activities under different temperature and salinity conditions, outperforming several naturally occurring and engineered hydrolases in degrading PET. Moreover, we genetically encoded 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP) in place of the catalytic serine residue of MG8, thereby converting a PET hydrolase into a covalent binder for bio&#8208;functionalization of PET. We show that MG8(DAP), in conjunction with a split green fluorescent protein system, can be used to attach protein cargos to PET as well as other polyester plastics. The discovery of a highly active PET hydrolase from the human metagenome&#8212;currently an underexplored resource for industrial enzyme discovery&#8212;as well as the repurposing of such an enzyme into a plastic functionalization tool, should facilitate ongoing efforts to degrade and maximize reusability of PET.

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Thermomorphic Multiphasic System for Biocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applicability of a deep eutectic solvent thermomorphic multiphasic system (DES&#8208;TMS) within biocatalysis was successfully demonstrated. Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was simply recycled using the DES&#8208;TMS. At increased temperatures, the system splits into an aqueous&#8208;enriched and a DES&#8208;enriched phase. In this way, the product and the catalyst were separated in a single unit operation step.







Abstract
The applicability of a thermomorphic multiphasic system (TMS) composed of a hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (DES) and an aqueous potassium phosphate buffer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase change for homogeneous biocatalysis was investigated. A lidocaine&#8208;based DES with the fatty acid oleic acid as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor was studied. Phase diagrams were determined and presented within this study. We tested different additional components to the solvent system and observed a decrease in the cloud point of approximately 0.026&#8201;&#176;C per concentration unit. Distribution studies revealed a clear distribution of the protein in the aqueous buffer phase (&gt;95&#8201;%), whereas the hydrophobic substrate and educt accumulated (&gt;95&#8201;%) in the DES&#8208;enriched layer. Finally, a reduction catalyzed by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was performed in a larger&#8208;scale experiment, and the biocatalyst could be recycled by simply removing the DES phase for three recycling runs.

         <title>Enzymatic Enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydration of Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene monooxygenase catalyzed enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of aryl alkenes, rather than epoxidation, was made possible by simply removing oxygen from the reaction mixture. An acid&#8211;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate enabled the reaction with excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity.







Abstract
The addition of water to alkenes is an important method for the synthesis of alcohols, but the regioselectivity of acid&#8208;catalyzed hydration of terminal alkenes yields secondary alcohols according to Markovnikov's rule, making it difficult to obtain primary alcohols. Here we report a styrene monooxygenase that catalyzes the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of the terminal aryl alkenes under anaerobic conditions. This hydration provides primary alcohols in good yields (up to 100&#8201;%), excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1), and good enantiomeric purity (60&#8211;83&#8201;% ee). Residues Asn46, Asp100, and Asn309 are essential for catalysis suggesting an acid&#8211;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate that could account for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity. Our work reveals a new enzymatic tool with unusual regioselectivity based on the promiscuous catalytic activity of a monooxygenase.

         <title>Mild Acidosis&#8208;Directed Signal Amplification in Tumor Microenvironment via Spatioselective Recruitment of DNA Amplifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based strategy is developed for spatially&#8208;selective amplification of acidic signals in the extracellular milieu of tumors. Amplified imaging of the tumor microenvironment with improved sensitivity was achieved by acidity&#8208;responsive engineering of the cell surface with DNA receptors for controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers.







Abstract
DNA biotechnology offers intriguing opportunities for amplification&#8208;based sensitive detection. However, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled manipulation of signal amplification for in situ imaging of the tumor microenvironment remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a DNA&#8208;based strategy that can spatial&#8208;selectively amplify the acidic signal in the extracellular milieu of the tumor to achieve specific imaging with improved sensitivity. The strategy, termed mild acidosis&#8208;targeted amplification (MAT&#8208;amp), leverages the specific acidic microenvironment to engineer tumor cells with artificial DNA receptors through a pH (low) insertion peptide, which permits controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers via a hybridization chain reaction. The acidosis&#8208;responsive amplification cascade enables significant fluorescence enhancement in tumors with a reduced background signal in normal tissues, leading to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. These results highlight the utility of MAT&#8208;amp for in situ imaging of the microenvironment characterized by pH disequilibrium.

         <title>Expeditious Access to Morphinans by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphinan alkaloids, especially codeine and morphine, are derived from the opium poppy and have been used for millennia for pain management. They remain vital medicines today, but climate change and geopolitical uncertainties threaten existing supply chains. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203186), Martin&#8197;G. Banwell, Ping Lan et&#8197;al. detail by far the shortest synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;codeine reported to date, which involves a total &#8220;in&#8208;flask&#8221; time of fewer than twenty&#8208;four hours.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Bipyrrole&#8208;Based Tetra&#8208;BF2 Flag&#8208;Hinge Chromophores: Achieving Multicolor and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing the construction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials by molecular design has become an important target in this research area. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202204358), Yoshio Hisaeda, Toshikazu Ono, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a new bipyrrole&#8208;based boron difluoride family exhibiting intense multicolor luminescence with easy synthetic access. Tuning the rotational barrier around the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrole affords CPL, and multi&#8208;colored CPLs are observed by controlling the aggregation state.

         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reductive carbonylation of alkyl halides, aryl halides, and ethyl chloroformate is described. Ethyl chloroformate is utilized as a safe and readily available source of CO in this multi&#8208;component protocol, providing an efficient and practical alternative for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies highlight the complexity the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and provide insight into the sequence of the three consecutive oxidative additions  of aryl halide, chloroformate and akyl halide.</dc:description>

         <title>In Operando Visualization and Dynamic Manipulation of Electrochemical Processes at the Electrode&#8208;Solution Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Revealing the dynamic processes at the electrode&#8208;solution interface is imperative for understanding electrochemical phenomena. Most techniques have been developed to sense the electrode surface changes at the nanoscale, but provide limited information on potential&#8208;induced interfacial ion redistribution at the mesoscale. Herein, we present an in operando visualization method utilizing a microfabricated electrochemical cell combined with a laser scanning confocal microscope to observe high&#8208;resolution and fast&#8208;response interfacial processes. We report potential&#8208;induced formation and transformation of the Nernst diffusion layer, demonstrating that pulsed voltage dynamically perturbs the interface and promotes ion diffusion. This provides an additional insight into developing a dynamic manipulation method to control the electrochemical process. Our novel visualization method can easily be applied to monitor different ionic behaviors in electrochemical reactions at the mesoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>A PEGylated Tin&#8208;Porphyrin Complex for Electrocatalytic Proton Reduction: Mechanistic Insights into Main&#8208;Group Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic proton reduction to form dihydrogen (H2) is an effective way to store energy in the form of chemical bonds. In this study, we validate the applicability of a main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;based tin porphyrin complex as an effective molecular electrocatalyst for proton reduction. A PEGylated Sn porphyrin complex (SnPEGP) displayed high activity (&#8211;4.6 mA/cm2 at &#8211;1.7 V vs. Fc/Fc+) and high selectivity (H2 Faradaic efficiency of 94% at &#8211;1.7 V vs. Fc/Fc+) in acetonitrile (MeCN) with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the proton source. The maximum turnover frequency (TOFmax) for H2 production was obtained as 1099 s&#8211;1. Spectroelectrochemical analysis, in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations, suggest that proton reduction occurs via an Electron&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Electron&#8208;Chemical (ECEC) pathway. This study reveals that the tin porphyrin catalyst serves as a novel platform for investigating molecular electrocatalytic reactions and provides new mechanistic insights into proton reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Rational Design and Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral C2&#8208;Arylpyrrole&#8208;Derived Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral biaryl diol BINOLs have achieved great success in asymmetric catalysis. By contrast, axially chiral biaryl amino alcohols, such as NOBIN, are far less developed. Herein, we have rationally designed a versatile  C  1  &#8208;symmetric biaryl amino alcohol scaffold 1&#8208;(1&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (NPNOL) on the basis of axially chiral C2&#8208;arylpyrrole framework. For its enantioselective synthesis, the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Attanasi reaction between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and azoalkenes had been established. By using this practical method, a wide range of NPNOLs were readily prepared in high yields and excellent atroposelectivities (38 examples, up to 89% yield and 99%  ee  ). DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity. The easy transformations of NPNOL&#8208;derived products into organo&#8208;catalysts/ligands and their preliminary applications in asymmetric catalytic reactions demonstrated the promising utility of NPNOL.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon&#8208;Induced Post&#8208;Ionization to Boost Ion Yields in MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI&#8208;MSI) is a rapidly growing method in the life sciences. However, for many analyte classes, its sensitivity is limited due to poor ionization efficiencies. To mitigate this problem, we here introduce a novel postionization scheme based on single&#8208;photon induced chemical ionization using pulsed RF&#8208;Kr lamps. The fine&#8208;vacuum conditions of a dual ion&#8208;funnel ion source effectively thermalize the evolving MALDI plume and enable ample gas&#8208;phase reactions. Injected chemical dopants crucially support fragment&#8208;less ionization to [M+H]  +  /[M&#8208;H]  &#8208;  species. Based on this interplay, numerous glycerophospho&#8208;, sphingo&#8208;, and further lipids, registered from mammalian tissue sections, were boosted by up to three orders of magnitude, similar to results obtained with laser&#8208;based postionization (MALDI&#8208;2). Experiments with deuterated matrix and dopant, however, indicated complex chemical ionization pathways different from MALDI&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohols as Alkylating Agents: Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Alkylation via In Situ Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid exploration of sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space is facilitated by fragment&#8208;coupling technologies that utilize simple and abundant alkyl precursors, among which alcohols are a highly desirable, commercially accessible, and synthetically versatile class of substrate. Herein, we describe an operationally convenient, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;mediated deoxygenative Giese&#8208;type addition of alcohol&#8208;derived alkyl radicals to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes under mild photocatalytic conditions. The fragment coupling accommodates a broad range of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohol partners, as well as structurally varied Michael acceptors containing traditionally reactive sites, such as electrophilic or oxidizable moieties. We demonstrate the late&#8208;stage diversification of densely functionalized molecular architectures, including drugs and biomolecules, and we further telescope our protocol with metallaphotoredox cross&#8208;coupling for step&#8208;economic access to sp3&#8208;rich complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Brook Rearrangement: Concept and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brook rearrangement has already established as one of the important molecular rearrangements in synthetic chemistry and been applied in the complex generation, drug discovery, material science and natural products synthesis. Comparing to its widely known ionic mechanism, radical Brook rearrangement is less explored due to the difficult generation of alkoxyl radical species. This minireview will summarize the early development and general concept of radical Brook rearrangement, highlight the recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal catalysed cross&#8208;couplings involving radical Brook rearrangement. Furthermore, we hope this survey will inspire further development in this emerging area.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Access to &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;Branched/Linear Aliphatic Amines by Catalyst&#8208;Tuned Regiodivergent Hydroalkylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linear, &#945;&#8208;branched, and &#946;&#8208;branched aliphatic amines are widespread in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fine chemicals. Thus, the development of direct and efficient methods to these structures in a tunable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Herein, a catalyst&#8208;controlled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched, &#946;&#8208;branched and linear aliphatic amines from Ni/Co&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective hydroalkylations of alkenyl amines with alkyl halides is developed. This catalytic protocol features the reliable prediction and control of the coupling position of alkylation to provide orthogonal access to &#945;&#8208;branched, &#946;&#8208;branched and linear alkyl amines from identical starting materials. This platform unlocks orthogonal reactivity and selectivity of nickel hydride and cobalt hydride chemistry to catalytically repurpose three types of alkyl amines under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly and Linearly Polarized Luminescence from AIE Luminogens Induced by Super&#8208;aligned Assemblies of Sub&#8208;1 nm Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;1 nm nanowires (SNWs) combine the properties of inorganic materials and polymers. They can be highly oriented through assembly, and can also be easily processed. Meanwhile, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) show high potential for optical applications, but they are usually hard to be processed. The combination of SNWs and AIEgens can enrich both of their applications. In this study, we reported the fluorescence emission intensity of the AIEgens&#8208;SNW dispersion was dramatically enhanced due to the flexibility of SNWs. Furthermore, we fabricated two kinds of functional films with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL) activities. The construction of CPL materials didn&#8217;t require any chiral chemicals. The construction of LPL materials didn&#8217;t require an additional stretching process. As a result, we endowed common achiral AIEgens with a high dissymmetry factor of 0.033 and a polarization ratio of 0.44, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel AgI&#8208;DNA Rod Comprising a One&#8208;Dimensional Array of 11 Silver Ions within a Double Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AgI&#8208;DNA rod comprising a one&#8208;dimensional array of 11 silver ions within a double&#8208;helical structure was obtained by mixing an oligonucleotide and silver ions in appropriate solutions. Furthermore, formations of the rod structure in solutions were determined by UV/Vis, CD, NMR, and mass spectrometry.







Abstract
DNA/RNA duplexes containing metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated base pairs (metallo&#8208;base pairs) have potential applications in developing nucleic acid&#8208;based nanodevices and genetic code expansion. Many metallo&#8208;base pairs are formed within duplexes stabilized by Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. Recently, the crystal structure of an AgI&#8208;DNA nanowire with an uninterrupted one&#8208;dimensional silver array was determined. Here, we present a new DNA helical wire, the &#8220;AgI&#8208;DNA rod&#8221;, containing an uninterrupted array of 11&#8197;AgI ions. The AgI&#8208;DNA rod consisted of only C&#8208;AgI&#8208;C, G&#8208;AgI&#8208;G, G&#8208;AgI&#8208;5&#8208;bromouracil (BrU), and BrU&#8208;AgI&#8208;BrU metallo base pairs, with no Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. The AgI&#8208;DNA rods were connected by non&#8208;canonical G&#8211;G pairs in crystals. Notably, data from our absorbance, circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry analyses suggested that the AgI&#8208;DNA rods formed in solution, as well as within crystals.

         <title>Intrinsic Ability of the &#223;&#8208;Oxidation Pathway To&#160;Produce Bioactive Styrylpyrones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring &#945;&#8208;pyrones with biological activities are mostly synthesised by polyketide synthases (PKSs) via iterative decarboxylative Claisen condensations. Remarkably, we found that some enzymes related to the fatty acid &#223;&#8208;oxidation pathway in  Escherichia coli  , namely the CoA&#8208;ligase FadD and the thiolases FadA and FadI, can synthesise styrylpyrones with phenylpropionic acids in vivo. The two thiolases directly utilise acetyl&#8208;CoA as an extender unit for carbon&#8208;chain elongation through non&#8208;decarboxylative Claisen condensation, thus making the overall reaction more efficient in terms of carbon and energy consumption. Moreover, using a cell&#8208;free approach, different styrylpyrones were synthesised in vitro. Finally, targeted feeding experiments led to the detection of styrylpyrones in other species, demonstrating that the intrinsic ability of the &#223;&#8208;oxidation pathway allows for the synthesis of such molecules in bacteria, revealing an important biological feature hitherto neglected.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#183;H2O Perovskite for Flexible Transparent X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free perovskites have arisen great interest for their chemical diversity and eco&#8208;friendly properties, and recently expanded into X&#8208;ray detection for superior carrier behavior.&#160;&#160;However, the size and shape complexity of organic components results in the difficulties on evaluating their stability from theoretical considerations in high&#8208;energy radiation. Herein, we introduce multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonds metal&#8208;free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#183;H2O perovskite, where H2O leads to more hydrogen bonds appearing between organic molecules and perovskite host. Suggested by the theoretical calculations, multiple hydrogen bonds promote the stiffness of lattice, and increase the diffusion barrier to inhibit ionic migration. Then, low trap density, high &#956;&#964; products and structural flexibility of PAZE&#8208;NH4Br3&#183;H2O impel us to expand it into the flexible X&#8208;ray detector with the highest sensitivity of 3708 &#956;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 0.19 &#956;Gyair&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 and superior spatial resolution of 5.0 lp mm&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission from Lead&#8208;Free Halide Double Perovskite Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials are the most important component of NIR light&#8208;emitting devices (LED) and are crucial for their performance in food detection, medical and bio&#8208;sensing applications. A major challenge at this stage is to design novel NIR luminescent materials to replace the traditional Cr3+&#8208;doped systems. This work reports an all&#8208;inorganic bismuth halide perovskite&#160;Cs2AgBiCl6  single crystal that achieves efficient broadband NIR emission by introducing Na ions. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the NIR emission originates from self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission, which can be enhanced by weakening the strong coupling between electrons and phonons. The high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) of 51%, the extensive full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 270 nm and the outstanding stability provide important advantages of Cs2Ag0.05Na0.95BiCl6  single crystal as a NIR luminescent material. The single crystal based NIR LED demonstrated its potential applications in NIR spectral detection as well as night vision. This work demonstrates that the bismuth halide perovskites are promising candidates for broadband NIR luminescent materials and provides new application directions for luminescent metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineered Crown&#8208;Ether&#8211;Protein with Strong Adhesion over a Wide Temperature Range from &#8208;196 to 200&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherently tenuous adhesion strength and limited environmental tolerance of supramolecular adhesives severely restrict their application scenarios. It is challenging for the development of robust adhesives with extreme temperature tolerance. Herein, we report a new type of temperature&#8208;resistant crown&#8208;ether&#8211;protein (CEP) adhesive by harnessing synergistic host&#8211;guest molecular interactions between engineered crown ether and protein building blocks. The outputs of CEP adhesive demonstrate ultrahigh shearing adhesion strength of ~22 MPa over a wide temperature range from &#8208;196 to 200&#176;C, superior to other established supramolecular or polymeric adhesives. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition and internal bound water stablized the system and led to superb adhesion under extreme conditions. Thus, this work pioneers a molecular engineering approach for the generation of adhesives with tailored applications in extreme settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic N18 Macrocycles and a Polynitrogen Double Helix in Novel Yttrium Polynitrides YN6 and Y2N11 at 100 GPa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel yttrium nitrides, YN  6  and Y  2  N  11  , were synthesized by direct reaction between yttrium and nitrogen at &#8764;100&#160;GPa and &#8764;3000 K in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. High&#8208;pressure&#160;synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that the crystal&#160;structures of YN  6  and Y  2  N  11  feature a unique organization of nitrogen&#160;atoms&#8212;a previously unknown anionic N  18  macrocycle and a&#160;polynitrogen double helix, respectively. Density functional theory&#160;calculations, confirming the dynamical stability of the YN  6  and Y  2  N  11  &#160;compounds, show an anion&#8208;driven metallicity, explaining the unusual&#160;bond orders in the polynitrogen units. As the charge state of the&#160;polynitrogen double helix in Y  2  N  11  is different from that previously&#160;found in Hf  2  N  11  and because N  18  macrocycles have never been

predicted or observed, their discovery significantly extends the&#160;chemistry of polynitrides.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Materials as Highly Efficient Host for White Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A New Molecular Design Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, all efficient host materials reported for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) are constructed with heteroatoms, which have a crucial role in the device performance. However, it has been shown in recent years that the heteroatoms not only increase the design complexity but can also be involved in the instability of the PhOLED, which is nowadays the most important obstacle to overcome. Herein, we design pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHC) as very efficient hosts in high&#8208;performance white and blue PhOLEDs. With EQE of 27.7 %, the PHC&#8208;based white PhOLEDs display similar efficiency as the best reported with heteroatom&#8208;based hosts. Incorporated as a host in a blue PhOLED, which are still the weakest links of the technology, a very high EQE of 25.6 % is reached, overpassing, for the first time, the barrier of 25&#160;% for a PHC and FIrpic blue emitter. These performance show that the PHC strategy represents an effective alternative for the future development of the OLED industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Chemical Mediators Regulating Specialized Metabolism in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nostovalerolactones are a novel class of cyanobacterial natural products that are derived from a tetronate&#8208;like biosynthesis pathway and team up with nostoclides to orchestrate the specialized metabolism in a symbiotic cyanobacterium. The data show how an understanding of regulation can be used to achieve high&#8208;titer production of bioactive specialized metabolites in cyanobacteria.







Abstract
Genomes of cyanobacteria feature a variety of cryptic biosynthetic pathways for complex natural products, but the peculiarities limiting the discovery and exploitation of the metabolic dark matter are not well understood. Here we describe the discovery of two cell density&#8208;dependent chemical mediators, nostoclide and nostovalerolactone, in the symbiotic model strain Nostoc punctiforme, and demonstrate their pronounced impact on the regulation of specialized metabolism. Through transcriptional, bioinformatic and labeling studies we assigned two adjacent biosynthetic gene clusters to the biosynthesis of the two polyketide mediators. Our findings provide insight into the orchestration of specialized metabolite production and give lessons for the genomic mining and high&#8208;titer production of cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence in Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Double Perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 Phosphors via Te4+ Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of NIR emitters was developed based on tellurium and lanthanide co&#8208;doped perovskite&#8208;derivative Cs2ZrCl6 phosphors. Through sensitization by the spin&#8208;orbital allowed 1S0&#8594;3P1 transition of Te4+, intense and multi&#8208;wavelength NIR luminescence from Er3+, Nd3+, and Yb3+ was achieved upon excitation with a near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;derivative metal halides have shown great promise in optoelectronics, however, it remains challenging to realize efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence in these materials. Herein, we report a novel strategy based on Te4+/Ln3+ (Ln=Er, Nd, and Yb) co&#8208;doping to achieve efficient NIR luminescence in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 phosphors, which are excitable by a low&#8208;cost near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) chip. Through sensitization by the spin&#8208;orbital allowed 1S0&#8594;3P1 transition of Te4+, intense and multi&#8208;wavelength NIR luminescence originating from the 4f&#8594;4f transitions of Er3+, Nd3+, and Yb3+ was acquired, with a quantum yield of 6.1&#8201;% for the Er3+ emission. These findings provide a general approach to achieve efficient NIR emission in lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal and lanthanide ion co&#8208;doping, thereby opening up a new avenue for exploring NIR&#8208;emitting perovskite derivatives towards versatile applications such as NIR&#8208;LEDs and bioimaging.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Activatable Phototheranostic Probe for Biomarker&#8208;Regulated Photodynamic and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe is developed to turn on its near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signal for real&#8208;time imaging. Additionally, the probe can activate photodynamic therapy in response to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase in the tumor periphery and switch to photothermal therapy triggered by nitroreductase in the hypoxic tumor core.







Abstract
Activatable phototheranostics holds promise for precision cancer treatment owing to the &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signals and therapeutic effects. However, most activatable phototheranostic probes only possess photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photothermal therapy (PTT), which suffer from poor therapeutic efficacy due to deficient cellular oxygen and complex tumor microenvironment. We herein report a dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe that activates near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) signals in tumor, triggers PDT in response to a tumor&#8208;periphery biomarker, and switches from PDT to PTT upon detecting a tumor&#8208;core&#8208;hypoxia biomarker. This PDT&#8208;PTT auto&#8208;regulated probe exhibits complete tumor ablation under the photoirradiation of a single laser source by producing cytotoxic singlet oxygen at the tumor periphery and generating hyperthermia at tumor&#8208;core where is too hypoxic for PDT. This dual&#8208;locked probe represents a promising molecular design approach toward precise cancer phototheranostics.

         <title>Tuning Surface&#8208;Electron Spins on Fe3O4 (111) through Chemisorption of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The way that CO adsorption affects the ground state magnetic ordering for a typical magnetic surface Fe3O4 (111) has been effectively demonstrated using a genetic algorithm magnetic order searching approach. As CO adsorption is increased, there is a gradual destabilization of the magnetic moment with an abrupt increase of the magnetic entropy due to the surface existing at a nearly degenerate magnetic state.







Abstract
The adsorption&#8208;induced flip of electron spin at interfaces is an important but poorly understood phenomenon for magnetic devices, sensors, and heterogeneous catalysis, due to the difficulties in determining the surface spins at atomic resolution. We present an evolutionary magnetic order searching method that allows efficient identification of the ground state spin configuration of magnetic bulk and surfaces. Using this approach, we have discovered for the first time a set of adsorption&#8208;induced near&#8208;degenerate surface magnetic states on the Fe3O4 (111) surface. Molecular adsorption of CO causes a destabilization of the magnetic states of the clean surface leading to a set of near&#8208;degenerate surface magnetic states at medium coverage, which causes an abrupt increase of the magnetic entropy on the surface. The empty 2&#960;* orbital of CO, which could accommodate the back donation of the spin density in the Fe d orbitals, plays a key role for the CO adsorption&#8208;induced spin transition.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes in Water: Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Stereoregular Telechelic Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization of phenylacetylenes in water was achieved by the development of a water&#8208;soluble rhodium&#8208;based multicomponent catalytic system. The obtained water&#8208;soluble polymers have high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The present polymerization method enables control of molecular weights of the polymers and functionalization of both polymer chain ends and the synthesis of novel block copolymers in water.







Abstract
Well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of water&#8208;soluble phenylacetylene derivatives in water was achieved for the first time using a multicomponent catalytic system consisting of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, an aryl boronic acid, diphenylacetylene having carboxy groups, a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, and a water&#8208;soluble triphenylphosphine. This catalytic system enables a direct synthesis of various water&#8208;soluble cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s having a narrow molecular weight distribution, the molecular weight of which can be controlled by the initial feed ratio of the monomer to the catalyst. Moreover, the syntheses of water&#8208;soluble telechelic poly(phenylacetylene)s having various functional groups at both chain ends as well as a water&#8208;soluble block copolymer were achieved.

         <title>Photothermal Nanoconfinement Reactor: Boosting Chemical Reactivity with Locally High Temperature in a Confined Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) comprised of hollow carbon nanospheres boosts the overall chemical reaction rate of an otherwise large reaction volume during peroxydisulfate&#8208;mediated oxidation of micropollutants. The reaction pathway, which would ordinarily involve radical species, is directed through a non&#8208;radical pathway because of the local heat in the nanoconfined space.







Abstract
A photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) system is proposed and demonstrated by using hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) to enhance the performance of the chemical reaction. Under light irradiation, the local temperature of the HCN inner void space was much higher than the bulk solution temperature because the confined space concentrates heat and inhibits heat loss. Using the temperature&#8208;sensitive model reaction, peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation to oxidize micropollutant, it is shown that the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole in the PNCR system is 7.1&#8197;times of that without nanoconfinement. It is further discovered that the high&#8208;quality local heat inside the nanoconfined space shifted the model reaction from an otherwise non&#8208;radical pathway to a radical&#8208;based pathway.

     alt="Photothermal Nanoconfinement Reactor: Boosting Chemical Reactivity with Locally High Temperature in a Confined Space"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) comprised of hollow carbon nanospheres boosts the overall chemical reaction rate of an otherwise large reaction volume during peroxydisulfate-mediated oxidation of micropollutants. The reaction pathway, which would ordinarily involve radical species, is directed through a non-radical pathway because of the local heat in the nanoconfined space.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) system is proposed and demonstrated by using hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) to enhance the performance of the chemical reaction. Under light irradiation, the local temperature of the HCN inner void space was much higher than the bulk solution temperature because the confined space concentrates heat and inhibits heat loss. Using the temperature-sensitive model reaction, peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation to oxidize micropollutant, it is shown that the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole in the PNCR system is 7.1&#8197;times of that without nanoconfinement. It is further discovered that the high-quality local heat inside the nanoconfined space shifted the model reaction from an otherwise non-radical pathway to a radical-based pathway. This work provides an interesting strategy to produce a locally high temperature, which has a wide range of applications to energy and environmental fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protocellular CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Based Diffusive Communication Using Transcriptional RNA Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering synthetic biochemical machinery for information processing and communication is essential for the construction of artificial protocells with complex dynamic behaviors. Here we use synthetic transcriptional circuits to produce diffusive RNA signal that can regulate CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing and localization in a binary community of synthetic protocells.







Abstract
Protocells containing enzyme&#8208;driven biomolecular circuits that can process and exchange information offer a promising approach for mimicking cellular features and developing molecular information platforms. Here, we employ synthetic transcriptional circuits together with CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing inside semipermeable protein&#8208;polymer microcompartments. We first establish a transcriptional protocell that can be activated by external DNA strands and produce functional RNA aptamers. Subsequently, we engineer a transcriptional module to generate RNA strands functioning as diffusive signals that can be sensed by neighboring protocells and trigger the activation of internalized DNA probes or localization of Cas nucleases. Our results highlight the opportunities to combine CRISPR/Cas machinery and DNA nanotechnology for protocellular communication and provide a step towards the development of protocells capable of distributed molecular information processing.

         <title>Chemiexcitation&#8208;Triggered Prodrug Activation for Targeted Carbon Monoxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new prodrug strategy, namely chemiexcitation triggered prodrug activation, is proposed herein to achieve targeted CO delivery to the tumor site. The CO release from a photoresponsive CO prodrug is activated by chemical energy transfer instead of by UV irradiation. As such, the inherent limitations with light irradiation are perfectly addressed.







Abstract
Photolysis&#8208;based prodrug strategy can address some critical drug delivery issues, which otherwise are very challenging to tackle with traditional prodrug strategy. However, the need for external light irradiation significantly hampers its in vivo application due to the poor light accessibility of deep tissue. Herein, we propose a new strategy of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation, wherein a photoresponsive prodrug is excited for drug payload release by chemiexcitation instead of photoirradiation. As such, the bond&#8208;cleavage power of photolysis can be employed to address some critical drug delivery issues while obviating the need for external light irradiation. We have established the proof of concept by the successful development of a chemiexcitation responsive carbon monoxide delivery platform, which exhibited specific CO release at the tumor site and pronounced tumor suppression effects. We anticipate that such a concept of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation can be leveraged for the targeted delivery of other small molecule&#8208;based drug payloads.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Under Visible Light Enabled by a Particulate Conjugated Polymer Loaded with Palladium and Iridium
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone) loaded with Pd/IrO2 facilitates stoichiometric overall water splitting for an extended period after the system stabilized, albeit currently with low activities. The study demonstrates the importance of co&#8208;catalysts for polymer photoatalysts and results were rationalized by transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Polymer photocatalysts have received growing attention in recent years for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Most studies report hydrogen production with sacrificial electron donors, which is unsuitable for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy production. Here we show that the palladium/iridium oxide&#8208;loaded homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (P10) facilitates overall water splitting to produce stoichiometric amounts of H2 and O2 for an extended period (&gt;60&#8197;hours) after the system stabilized. These results demonstrate that conjugated polymers can act as single component photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting when loaded with suitable co&#8208;catalysts, albeit currently with low activities. Transient spectroscopy shows that the IrO2 co&#8208;catalyst plays an important role in the generation of the charge separated state required for water splitting, with evidence for fast hole transfer to the co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Switch from Anionic Polymerization to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization: A Valuable Strategy to Make Olefin Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive anionic polymerization and transmetallation reaction were used to design in situ macromolecular chain transfer agents involved in coordinative chain transfer copolymerization (CCTcoP) of ethylene and butadiene. Olefin block copolymers were formed for the first time by the switch from anionic polymerization to CCT(co)P.







Abstract
Anionic polymerization of butadiene or/and styrene is performed with lithium initiators, functional or not. The polymer chains are subsequently transferred to magnesium. The resulting polymeryl&#8208;magnesium compounds were combined with {(Me2Si(C13H8)2)Nd(&#956;&#8208;BH4)[(&#956;&#8208;BH4)Li(THF)]}2 metallocene complex to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macroCTAs) in coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of ethylene (E) or its copolymerization (CCTcoP) with butadiene (B). Block copolymers were produced for the first time by this switch from anionic polymerization to CCTP. Hard and soft blocks such as PB, polystyrene (PS), poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (SBR) obtained by anionic polymerization and PE or poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (EBR) produced by CCT(co)P were combined and the corresponding structures were characterized.

         <title>Sterically Demanding Flexible Phosphoric Acids for Constructing Efficient and Multi&#8208;Purpose Asymmetric Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of counterion enhanced catalysis to promote the asymmetric functionalization of enones was demonstrated. Combining the use of sterically demanding phosphoric acids with simple chiral diamines allowed for the preparation of simple ion&#8208;paired and highly tunable organocatalysts. The latter could be applied in four different asymmetric transformations, providing a highly enantioselective access to both product antipodes in all cases.







Abstract
Herein, we present a novel approach for various asymmetric transformations of cyclic enones. The combination of readily accessible chiral diamines and sterically demanding flexible phosphoric acids resulted in a simple and highly tunable catalyst framework. The careful optimization of the catalyst components led to the identification of a particularly powerful and multi&#8208;purpose organocatalyst, which was successfully applied for asymmetric epoxidations, aziridinations, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated cyclizations, as well as for a novel Robinson&#8208;like Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure/aldol cyclization. High catalytic activities and excellent stereocontrol was observed for all four reaction types, indicating the excellent versatility of our catalytic system. Furthermore, a simple change in the diamine's configuration provided easy access to both product antipodes in all cases.

     alt="Sterically Demanding Flexible Phosphoric Acids for Constructing Efficient and Multi-Purpose Asymmetric Organocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of counterion enhanced catalysis to promote the asymmetric functionalization of enones was demonstrated. Combining the use of sterically demanding phosphoric acids with simple chiral diamines allowed for the preparation of simple ion-paired and highly tunable organocatalysts. The latter could be applied in four different asymmetric transformations, providing a highly enantioselective access to both product antipodes in all cases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present a novel approach for various asymmetric transformations of cyclic enones. The combination of readily accessible chiral diamines and sterically demanding flexible phosphoric acids resulted in a simple and highly tunable catalyst framework. The careful optimization of the catalyst components led to the identification of a particularly powerful and multi-purpose organocatalyst, which was successfully applied for asymmetric epoxidations, aziridinations, aza-Michael-initiated cyclizations, as well as for a novel Robinson-like Michael-initiated ring closure/aldol cyclization. High catalytic activities and excellent stereocontrol was observed for all four reaction types, indicating the excellent versatility of our catalytic system. Furthermore, a simple change in the diamine's configuration provided easy access to both product antipodes in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Bound Inward&#8208;Growth of Artificial Cytoskeletons and Their Selective Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth strategy is presented to construct membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs) consisting of convergent&#8208;arranged nanofibers grown from a capsule membrane. Furthermore, this method enables the light&#8208;controlled integration of dynamic covalent bonds into the MAC and to realize two modes of selective disassembly behaviors.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is one of the most important cellular components. Up to now, most of the reported artificial cytoskeletons are based on a gel&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle strategy. Herein, we report a membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth pathway to prepare cytoskeleton&#8208;like and radially aligned nanofibers grown from capsule membranes to get membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs). The mechanism therein is disclosed through the direct observation of the intermediates in both dried and liquid states. Furthermore, the as&#8208;prepared MACs show a selective disassembly behavior in the presence of reductants: both capsule membranes and MACs can be disassembled or only MACs can be disassembled through the selective introduction of dynamic disulfide bonds (DS) into them and by the switch of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The present work provides a new hierarchical self&#8208;assembly way to construct artificial cytoskeletons with controlled compositions and orientations.

Chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by an in situ growth route, which provides a powerful driving force, abundant atomic&#8208;level charge flow highways and a decreased energy barrier for directional migration and spatial separation of photocharges, greatly improving the photocatalytic activity for selective photo&#8208;oxidation of aromatic alcohols.







Abstract
Inferior contact interface and low charge transfer efficiency seriously restrict the performance of heterojunctions. Herein, chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by an in situ growth route. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the internal electric field provides a powerful driving force for vectorial migration of photocharges between Bi4MO8Cl and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, and the interfacial Fe&#8722;O bond not only serves as an atomic&#8208;level charge flow highway but also lowers the charge transfer energy barrier, thereby accelerating Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and realizing effective spatial charge separation. Impressively, &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl manifests a significantly improved photocatalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols into aldehydes (Con. &#8805;92&#8201;%, Sel. &#8805;96&#8201;%), with a performance improvement of one to two orders of magnitude. This work presents atomic&#8208;level insight into interfacial charge flow steering.

         <title>Correlative Electrochemical Microscopy for the Elucidation of the Local Ionic and Electronic Properties of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining feedback (FB) and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current (AC) SECM methodologies is proposed as a unique approach that provides the two essential properties namely the ionic and electronic conductivity of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Li&#8208;ion batteries quantitatively. The influence of the electrolyte composition and the SEI formation protocol on the properties of the resulting SEI was derived.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the SEI prevents the continuous degradation of the electrolyte at the anode. The SEI acts as an insulating layer for electron transfer, still allowing the ionic flux through the layer. We combine the feedback and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current modes of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the first time to assess quantitatively the local electronic and ionic properties of the SEI varying the SEI formation conditions and the used electrolytes in the field of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Correlations between the electronic and ionic properties of the resulting SEI on a model Cu electrode demonstrates the unique feasibility of the proposed strategy to provide the two essential properties of an SEI: ionic and electronic conductivity in dependence on the formation conditions, which is anticipated to exhibit a significant impact on the field of LIBs.

A general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine is reported. Amongst lead compounds, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent nanomolar inhibition against endogenous ABL kinase, with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets.







Abstract
Despite recent interests in developing lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors, no general approach is available to create such compounds. We report herein a general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine residue using key SuFEx and salicylaldehyde&#8208;based imine chemistries. We validated the strategy by successfully developing (irreversible and reversible) covalent inhibitors against BCR&#8208;ABL kinase. Our lead compounds showed high levels of selectivity in biochemical assays, exhibited nanomolar potency against endogenous ABL kinase in cellular assays, and were active against most drug&#8208;resistant ABL mutations. Among them, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent ABL inhibition with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets in K562 cells. Bioinformatics further suggested the generality of our strategy against the human kinome.

Inspired by the functions of biological motors, a light&#8208;driven motor molecule was designed that inserts into the lipid membrane and transports ions with high ion selectivity and gating function. The light&#8208;driven motor rotation accelerates K+ efflux and induces caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis of cancer cells.







Abstract
The design of artificial ion channels with high activity, selectivity and gating function is challenging. Herein, we designed the light&#8208;driven motor molecule MC2, which provides new design criteria to overcome these challenges. MC2 forms a selective K+ channel through a single molecular transmembrane mechanism, and the light&#8208;driven rotary motion significantly accelerates ion transport, which endows the irradiated motor molecule with excellent cytotoxicity and cancer cell selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the rotary motion of MC2 promotes K+ efflux, generates reactive oxygen species and eventually activates caspase&#8208;3&#8208;dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. Combined with the spatiotemporally controllable advantages of light, we believe this strategy can be exploited in the structural design and application of next&#8208;generation synthetic cation transporters for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Alteration of the Catalytic Reaction Trajectory of a Vicinal Oxygen Chelate Enzyme by Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of ChaP, a novel vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme, afforded bifunctional enzymes designated as &#8220;ChaP variants&#8221;, which catalyzed regioselective intradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone cleavage and o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylation of the ring&#8208;opened molecules. This activity expands the VOC catalytic repertoire to bring us closer to artificial VOC enzymes of broad biotechnological significance.







Abstract
The vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme superfamily catalyzes a highly diverse set of reactions with the mechanism characterized by the bidentate coordination of vicinal oxygen atoms to metal ion centers, but there remains a lack of a platform to steer the reaction trajectories, especially for o&#8208;quinone metabolizing pathways. Herein, we present the directed&#8208;evolution&#8208;enabled bifunctional turnover of ChaP, which is a homotetramer and represents an unprecedented VOC enzyme class. Unlike the ChaP catalysis of extradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone cleavage and concomitant &#945;&#8208;keto acid decarboxylation, a group of ChaP variants (CVs) catalyze intradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone deconstruction and CO2 liberation from the resulting o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid scaffolds with high regioselectivity. Enzyme crystal structures, labeling experiments and computational simulations corroborated that the D49L mutation allows the metal ion to change its coordination with the tyrosine phenoxy atoms in different monomers, thereby altering the reaction trajectory with the regiospecificity further improved by the follow&#8208;up replacement of the Y92 residue with any of alanine, glycine, threonine, and serine. The study highlights the unpredicted catalytic versatility and enzymatic plasticity of VOC enzymes with biotechnological significance.

A new acceptor core, obtained by fusing dithiafulvalene with benzothiadiazole, was utilized to construct near&#8208;infrared AIEgen luminophores, in which TBSMCN emitted at 820&#8197;nm in the solid state and featured a high quantum yield of 10.7&#8201;%. The doped and non&#8208;doped NIR OLEDs achieved excellent external quantum efficiencies of 14.3&#8201;% and 2.2&#8201;% peaking at 750 and 804&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens have attracted intensive attention considering their vast potential applications in areas like bioimaging, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and night&#8208;vision telecommunication. However, organic NIR luminogens with high solid quantum efficiencies are scarce, limiting their applications. Here, we reported an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, BSM, based on dithiafulvalene and benzothiadiazole, which could work as a strong acceptor to produce highly efficient NIR emitters with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. One of the AIEgens, TBSMCN emitted at 820&#8197;nm with a solid quantum yield of 10.7&#8201;%. When applied to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs, an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.4&#8201;% was achieved with a peak wavelength at 728&#8197;nm. Moreover, its non&#8208;doped device could achieve an extraordinary EQE of 2.2&#8201;% peaking at 804&#8197;nm. In the further optimized configuration, when an extra sensitizer was added to harvest triplet excitons, the EQE unprecedentedly soared up to 14.3&#8201;% with a peak wavelength of 750&#8197;nm.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Oxo Cluster Assisted Fabrication of a Defect&#8208;Rich Ti&#8208;MOF Membrane Showing Versatile Gas&#8208;Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the titanium&#8208;oxo cluster Ti8(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(OOCC6H5)16 as the titanium source, a MIL&#8208;125 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane was prepared under mild reaction conditions through combining single&#8208;mode microwave heating with tertiary growth. Using this titanium source and maintaining a lower reaction temperature increased the missing&#8208;linker number in the MIL&#8208;125 framework and therefore enhanced the CO2/N2 selectivity.







Abstract
Although having shown great promise for efficient gas separation, relevant study of Ti&#8208;MOF membranes remains very scarce, owing to limited Ti source types and uncertain factors which dominate the separation properties. In this work, we pioneered the use of the Ti8(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(OOCC6H5)16 cluster as the Ti source of MIL&#8208;125 membranes, which led to lower reaction temperature and higher missing&#8208;linker number within the framework and therefore, enhanced CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity. The MIL&#8208;125 membrane prepared by combining single&#8208;mode microwave heating with tertiary growth displayed an ideal CO2/N2 selectivity of 38.7, which ranked the highest among all pristine pure MOF membranes measured under comparable conditions. In addition, the ideal H2/N2 and H2/CH4 selectivity was as high as 64.9 and 40.7, thus showing great promise for versatile utility in gas separation.

         <title>Formation of LiF&#8208;rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase by Electrolyte Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is successfully constructed on LiCoO2 cathode by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at 1.7&#8197;V. LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration and Co dissolution during cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, demonstrating an excellent cyclability with high capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5C.







Abstract
The capacity of transition metal oxide cathode for Li&#8208;ion batteries can be further enhanced by increasing the charging potential. However, these high voltage cathodes suffer from fast capacity decay because the large volume change of cathode breaks the active materials and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), resulting in electrolyte penetration into broken active materials and continuous side reactions between cathode and electrolytes. Herein, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI was formed by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at a low potential of 1.7&#8197;V. By taking LiCoO2 as a model cathode, we demonstrate that the LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration at a high cut&#8208;off potential of 4.6&#8197;V. The LiCoO2 with LiF&#8208;rich CEI exhibited a capacity of 198&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5C and an enhanced capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles as compared to the LiF&#8208;free LiCoO2 with only 17.4&#8201;% of capacity retention.

     alt="Formation of LiF-rich Cathode-Electrolyte Interphase by Electrolyte Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robust LiF-rich cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) is successfully constructed on LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at 1.7&#8197;V. LiF-rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration and Co dissolution during cycling at a high cut-off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, demonstrating an excellent cyclability with high capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capacity of transition metal oxide cathode for Li-ion batteries can be further enhanced by increasing the charging potential. However, these high voltage cathodes suffer from fast capacity decay because the large volume change of cathode breaks the active materials and cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI), resulting in electrolyte penetration into broken active materials and continuous side reactions between cathode and electrolytes. Herein, a robust LiF-rich CEI was formed by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at a low potential of 1.7&#8197;V. By taking LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a model cathode, we demonstrate that the LiF-rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration at a high cut-off potential of 4.6&#8197;V. The LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with LiF-rich CEI exhibited a capacity of 198&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5C and an enhanced capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles as compared to the LiF-free LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with only 17.4&#8201;% of capacity retention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Formal Hydroamination of Allylic Alcohols: A Remarkable Macrocyclic Ligand Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of Mn&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of allylic alcohols is described by using a chiral peraza N6&#8208;macrocyclic ligand. DFT calculations revealed that multiple noncovalent interactions existed among the ligand, solvent, and substrate in the transition states, showing a remarkable macrocyclic ligand effect.







Abstract
A unique family of chiral peraza N6&#8208;macrocyclic ligands, which are conformationally rigid and have a tunable saddle&#8208;shaped cavity, is described. Utilizing their manganese(I) complexes, the first example of earth&#8208;abundant transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of allylic alcohols was realized, providing a practical access to synthetically important chiral &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;% ee). The single&#8208;crystal structure of a MnI complex indicates that the manganese atom coordinates with the chiral dialkylamine moiety in a bidentate fashion. Further DFT calculations revealed that five of the six nitrogen atoms in the ligand were engaged in multiple noncovalent interactions with Mn, an isopropanol molecule, and a &#946;&#8208;amino ketone intermediate via coordination, hydrogen bonding, and/or CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the transition state, showing a remarkable role of the macrocyclic framework.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Metastable Species in Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented mechanism for the supramolecular polymerization (SP) of H&#8208;bonding synthons has been unravelled. Remarkably, a new on&#8208;pathway metastable dimer state (D*) incorporating both intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8208;bonds was discovered that allows spatiotemporal and length control of the SP through a consecutive mechanism.







Abstract
We reveal unique hydrogen (H&#8208;) bonding patterns and exploit them to control the kinetics, pathways and length of supramolecular polymers (SPs). New bisamide&#8208;containing monomers were designed to elucidate the role of competing intra&#8208; vs. intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions on the kinetics of supramolecular polymerization (SP). Remarkably, two polymerization&#8208;inactive metastable states were discovered. Contrary to previous examples, the commonly assumed intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded monomer does not evolve into intermolecularly H&#8208;bonded SPs via ring opening, but rather forms a metastable dimer. In this dimer, all H&#8208;bonding sites are saturated, either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly, hampering elongation. The dimers exhibit an advantageous preorganization, which upon opening of the intramolecular portion of the H&#8208;bonding motif facilitates SP in a consecutive process. The retardation of spontaneous self&#8208;assembly as a result of two metastable states enables length control in SP by seed&#8208;mediated growth.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Management for High&#8208;Temperature Mesoporous SnO2 Electron Transport Layers in Printable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>

Oxygen vacancies (OVs) were managed by the lattice Mg and the interstitial Mg which modulated the formation and ionization of OVs for self&#8208;doping in SnO2. OV management optimized the capability of high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO2 to serve as well&#8208;performed ETLs for printable PSCs with efficiency enhanced from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.







Abstract
The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed to the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO2 ETL (mp&#8208;SnO2) brings poor device performance. Herein, we report the application of mp&#8208;SnO2 for efficient printable PSCs via oxygen vacancy (OV) management by introducing magnesium (Mg) into the paste. We find that high&#8208;temperature annealing suppresses self&#8208;doping of SnO2 by reducing OVs. The introduced Mg occupies both the Sn site and interstitial site of SnO2 and promotes the formation of OVs. Lattice Mg tends to induce neutral OVs and interstitial Mg could promote the ionization of neutral OVs for self&#8208;doping. The synergy effect on OVs increases the carrier density and upshifts the Fermi level energy of mp&#8208;SnO2, ensuring its capability as the well&#8208;performed ETL with trap&#8208;less charge transport and suppressed surface recombination for dramatic improved device PCE from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.

         <title>Sequential Allylic Alcohol Formation by a Multifunctional Cytochrome&#8197;P450 Monooxygenase with Rare Redox Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional cytochrome&#8197;P450 monoxygenase CayG plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the cytotoxic fatty acid caryoynencin in pathogenic bacteria. CayG promotes an unusual desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence to install an allylic alcohol with the help of rare ferredoxin/rubredoxin redox partners. This enzyme system may inspire new multifunctional (bio)catalysts for regio&#8208; and stereoselective modifications of saturated carbon backbones.







Abstract
Caryoynencin is a toxic and antifungal fatty acid derivative produced by a number of plant&#8208;pathogenic and insect&#8208;protective bacteria (Trinickia caryophylli and Burkholderia spp.). In addition to the reactive tetrayne unit, the presence of an allylic alcohol moiety is critical for antimicrobial activities. By a combination of mutational analyses, heterologous expression and in vitro reconstitution experiments we show that the cytochrome&#8197;P450 monooxygenase CayG catalyzes the complex transformation of a saturated carbon backbone into an allylic alcohol. Unexpectedly, CayG employs a ferritin&#8208;like protein (CayK) or a rubredoxin (CayL) component for electron transport. A desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence was deduced from a time&#8208;course study and in vitro biotransformations with pathway intermediates, substrate analogues, protegencin congeners from Pseudomonas protegens Pf&#8208;5, and synthetic derivatives. This unusual multifunctional oxygenase may inspire future biocatalytic applications.

         <title>In Situ Prodrug Activation by an Affibody&#8208;Ruthenium Catalyst Hybrid for HER2&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid (Ru&#8208;HER2) binds to the HER2 receptor on cancer cells and catalyzes the in situ activation of gemcitabine prodrug, resulting in enhanced anticancer activity via the synergism between the HER2 signaling pathway blockade and gemcitabine&#8208;induced DNA damage. Therefore, the catalytic chemotherapy selectively inhibits the growth of HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells and significantly reduces the side effects to normal cells.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalysts exhibit great potential as therapeutic agents to inhibit tumor growth. However, the precise delivery and in situ catalysis are challenging in catalytic medicine. Herein, we report an anti&#8208;HER2 affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid, named Ru&#8208;HER2 for selective and effective killing of cancer cells. Ru&#8208;HER2 binds to the HER2 receptor on a tumor cell and in situ catalyzes the activation of gemcitabine prodrug, resulting in enhanced selectivity in suppression of tumor growth and reduction of side effects. Immunoblotting reveals that Ru&#8208;HER2 in combination with gemcitabine prodrug can not only induce DNA damage, but also effectively block the HER2 signaling pathway in cancer cells. Therefore, the HER2&#8208;targeted chemotherapy exhibits substantially high anticancer activity toward HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In a word, we report the first affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid and reveal its potential for effective HER2&#8208;targeted cancer chemotherapy.

         <title>A Rare Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based on a Tailorable Mn8&#8208;Cluster Showing Smart Responsiveness to Aromatic Guests and Capacity for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extra degree of freedom to framework flexibility contributed by size&#8208; and shape&#8208;tailorable metal clusters is established, leading to three&#8208;dimensional variations of the framework that are smartly responsive to varied aromatic molecules.







Abstract
The design and creation of soft porous crystals combining regularity and flexibility may promote potential applications for gas storage and separation due to their deformable framework's responsiveness to external stimuli. The flexibility of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) relies on alterable degrees of freedom that are mainly provided by organic linkers or the junctions linking organic and inorganic building units. Herein, we report a new dynamic MOF whose flexibility originates from an unprecedented tailorable Mn8O38&#8208;cluster and shows simultaneous coordination geometry changes and ligand migration that are reversibly driven by guest exchange. This provides an extra degree of freedom to the framework's deformation, resulting in three&#8208;dimensional variations in the framework that subtly respond to varied aromatic molecules. The gas adsorption behavior of this flexible MOF was evaluated, and the selective separation of light hydrocarbons and Freon gases is achieved.

Oxyfluorides are widely studied functional solids that show great potential as nonlinear optical materials, while only few examples with a wide bandgap exist. In their Communication (e202203104), Chao Wu, Chi Zhang, and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;rich oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2 by a fluorine&#8208;enrichment strategy. The crystalline oxyfluoride exhibits a wide bandgap and large second&#8208;harmonic generation response. The key role of the fluorine content in affecting the optical activity is disclosed.

Enantioenriched chromanone lactones were prepared by copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous addition of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones, as reported by Jin Cui, Masakatsu Shibasaki, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202203128). The catalytic system features the use of chiral ligands to control the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective addition of copper vinylogous enolates to chromones. The cover illustrates superimposed product structures, dropping a hint about the ligand&#8208;controlled diastereodivergence.

         <title>Back Cover: Trapping X&#8208;ray Radiation Damage from Homolytic Se&#8722;C Bond Cleavage in BnSeSeBn Crystals (Bn=benzyl, CH2C6H5) (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiation damage in the form of radical formation by homolytic Se&#8722;C bond cleavage was trapped by high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray and EPR experiments, as reported by Dietmar Stalke and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202203665). Orange dibenzyl diselenide single crystals were exposed to X&#8208;rays with various intensities, and the benzyl radical formation was monitored by multipole refinement and quantum/molecular mechanics. In any interpretation of selenium&#8208;containing structures, particularly in life science experiments from synchrotrons, it is important to consider those radical&#8208;induced processes.

         <title>Enzyme Catalysis for Reversible Deactivation Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>

The development, roles, and applications of enzymes in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) are summarized in this Minireview. A reflection on the challenges and future directions of this promising field are also given.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis has been increasingly utilized in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) on account of its mildness, efficiency, and sustainability. In this Minireview we discuss the key roles enzymes play in RDRP, including their ATRPase, initiase, deoxygenation, and photoenzyme activities. We use selected examples to highlight applications of Enz&#8208;RDRP in surface brush fabrication, sensing, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, and high&#8208;throughput synthesis. We also give our reflections on the challenges and future directions of this emerging area.

         <title>Superchaotropic Boron Clusters as Membrane Carriers for the Transport of Hydrophilic Cargos</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Montenegro, Nau and co&#8208;workers abandoned the typical amphiphilic model of membrane transport and proposed a new chaotrope&#8208;mediated transport principle. They utilized superchaotropic boron clusters as membrane carriers to transport a broad range of hydrophilic cargo. This groundbreaking work is a conceptual innovation and may have a profound impact on cell&#8208;biological, neurobiological, physiological, and pharmaceutical studies.







Abstract
Design of membrane transporters is important in pharmaceutical drug delivery and bioimaging. Traditionally, the amphiphilic transport mechanism has governed the design of membrane carriers over the last 50&#8197;years. Recently, Montenegro, Nau and co&#8208;workers discarded classical amphiphilic models and proposed a new transport principle based on the chaotropic effect. They utilized globular boron clusters as membrane carriers to transport a broad range of hydrophilic cargo. Herein, we highlight this recent pioneering work, which is a landmark for membrane transport.

         <title>Sulfur in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical versatility of sulfur allows the formation of several dynamic sulfur&#8208;based bonds (DSBs). This Review summarizes the advances achieved with each DSB, together with some applications. In addition, dynamic multilevel systems in which two or more DSBs are combined in the same system are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfur has been important in dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) since the beginning of the field. Mainly as part of disulfides and thioesters, dynamic sulfur&#8208;based bonds (DSBs) have a leading role in several remarkable reactions. Part of this success is due to the almost ideal properties of DSBs for the preparation of dynamic covalent systems, including high reactivity and good reversibility under mild aqueous conditions, the possibility of exploiting supramolecular interactions, access to isolable structures, and easy experimental control to turn the reaction on/off. DCC is currently witnessing an increase in the importance of DSBs. The chemical flexibility offered by DSBs opens the door to multiple applications. This Review presents an overview of all the DSBs used in DCC, their applications, and remarks on the interesting properties that they confer on dynamic chemical systems, especially those containing several DSBs.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Evolution of G Protein&#8208;Biased &#956;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
cryoEM structures of the &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) bound to the lead compound PZM21 and the newly developed agonist FH210 were obtained to understand the mechanism of their biased signaling and to guide the evolution of next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.







Abstract
The &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) is the major target for opioid analgesics. Activation of &#956;OR initiates signaling through G protein pathways as well as through &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment. &#956;OR agonists that are biased towards G protein signaling pathways demonstrate diminished side effects. PZM21, discovered by computational docking, is a G protein biased &#956;OR agonist. Here we report the cryoEM structure of PZM21 bound &#956;OR in complex with Gi protein. Structure&#8208;based evolution led to multiple PZM21 analogs with more pronounced Gi protein bias and increased lipophilicity to improve CNS penetration. Among them, FH210 shows extremely low potency and efficacy for arrestin recruitment. We further determined the cryoEM structure of FH210 bound to &#956;OR in complex with Gi protein and confirmed its expected binding pose. The structural and pharmacological studies reveal a potential mechanism to reduce &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment by the &#956;OR, and hold promise for developing next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.

         <title>Electronic Regulation of Nickel Single Atoms by Confined Nickel Nanoparticles for Energy&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>

A cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;nanoparticle catalyst was developed. With electron donation from the Ni nanoparticle to single atoms via a carbon network, the catalyst achieves a high CO current density of 310&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V with an overall energy efficiency of 57&#8201;% for electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of atomically dispersed active sites is promising to boost catalytic activity but is challenging to achieve. Here we show a cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;nanoparticle catalyst (NiSA/NP) prepared via direct solid&#8208;state pyrolysis, where Ni nanoparticles donate electrons to Ni(i)&#8722;N&#8722;C sites via a network of carbon nanotubes, achieving a high CO current density of 346&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs RHE in an alkaline flow cell. When coupled with a NiFe&#8208;based anode in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrolyzer, the catalyst delivers an industrially relevant CO current density of 310&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V, corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 57&#8201;%. The superior CO2 electroreduction performance is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of key intermediate COOH* on the electron&#8208;rich Ni single atoms, as well as a high density of active sites.

         <title>Modular Introduction of endo&#8208;Binding Sites in a Macrocyclic Cavity towards Selective Recognition of Neutral Azacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles with functionalized interiors are relatively hard to synthesize. Here, a versatile and modular strategy to customize endo&#8208;binding sites in the macrocycle cavity is reported. This new family of macrocyclic receptors, with diverse binding sites across the inner surface, exhibit well&#8208;defined structures, facile post&#8208; and pre&#8208;modification, and excellent host&#8211;guest recognition.







Abstract
Macrocycles with a functionalized interior, which is a general cavity feature of bioreceptors, are relatively hard to synthesize. Here we report a modular strategy to customize diverse endo&#8208;binding sites in the macrocycle cavity. Only two steps are needed. First, one V&#8208;shaped functional module bearing an embedded binding site and two 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyls as reaction modules are connected. Then the condensation of the resulting monomer and paraformaldehyde directly produces the designed macrocycle. V&#8208;shaped monomers are deliberately used to guarantee the binding sites equatorially directing inward into the cavity and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyls standing axially as macrocycle sidewalls. More than a dozen endo&#8208;functionalized macrocyclic receptors have been constructed. Host&#8211;guest complexation studies show that macrocycle BP1&#8208;decorated interior OH moieties can strongly encapsulate neutral azacycles by forming inner hydrogen bonds, giving a high association constant of 4.59&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in non&#8208;polar media.

         <title>Activation of Main&#8208;Group Antimony Atomic Sites for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single antimony sites functionalized by epoxy groups in N&#8208;doped graphene were designed to activate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electron&#8208;rich epoxy group can adjust the electronic structure of the Sb&#8722;N4 active moieties, optimizing the adsorption of the intermediates to approach the top of the volcano plot. This discovery provides new way to improve the catalytic activity of main&#8208;group&#8208;element electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of main&#8208;group metal is hard to promote because of the intrinsic lack of host d orbitals available to be combined. Herein, under the guidance of theoretical predictions, we find atom&#8208;dispersed antimony sites (Sb&#8722;N4 moieties) can be activated to achieve high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity using a functional group regulation strategy. Correspondingly, we manage to synthesize a main&#8208;group Sb single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) that comprises Sb&#8722;N4 active moieties functionalized by epoxy groups in the second microenvironment and incorporated in N&#8208;doped graphene (Sb1/NG(O)). The electron&#8208;rich epoxy group can adjust the electronic structure of Sb&#8722;N4 active moieties, thereby optimizing the adsorption of the intermediate. The Sb SACs are comparable to industrial Pt/C under alkaline conditions. This discovery provides new opportunities to manipulate and improve the catalytic activity of main&#8208;group&#8208;element electrocatalysts.

         <title>Sulfate&#8208;Enabled Nitrate Synthesis from Nitrogen Electrooxidation on a Rhodium Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfate is demonstrated to enhance the nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) over an Rh electrocatalyst. A series of electrochemical in&#8197;situ characterizations show that sulfate promotes nitrogen chemical adsorption and NO intermediate formation. Theoretical calculations further reveal that sulfate enhances nitrogen adsorption and reduces the reaction energy barrier and activation energy of nitrogen oxidation.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to generate nitrate is gaining increasing attention as an alternative approach to the conventional industrial manufacture. But, current progress in NOR is limited by the difficulties in activation and conversion of the strong N&#8801;N bond (941&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Herein, we designed to utilize sulfate to enhance NOR performance over an Rh electrocatalyst. After the addition of sulfate, the inert Rh nanoparticles exhibited superior NOR performance with a nitrate yield of 168.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The 15N isotope&#8208;labeling experiment confirmed the produced nitrate from nitrogen electrooxidation.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfate is demonstrated to enhance the nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) over an Rh electrocatalyst. A series of electrochemical in&#8197;situ characterizations show that sulfate promotes nitrogen chemical adsorption and NO intermediate formation. Theoretical calculations further reveal that sulfate enhances nitrogen adsorption and reduces the reaction energy barrier and activation energy of nitrogen oxidation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to generate nitrate is gaining increasing attention as an alternative approach to the conventional industrial manufacture. But, current progress in NOR is limited by the difficulties in activation and conversion of the strong N&#8801;N bond (941&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Herein, we designed to utilize sulfate to enhance NOR performance over an Rh electrocatalyst. After the addition of sulfate, the inert Rh nanoparticles exhibited superior NOR performance with a nitrate yield of 168.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N isotope-labeling experiment confirmed the produced nitrate from nitrogen electrooxidation. A series of electrochemical in&#8197;situ characterizations and theoretical calculation unveiled that sulfate promoted nitrogen adsorption and decreased the reaction energy barrier, and in situ formed sulfate radicals reduced the activation energy of the potential-determining step, thus accelerating NOR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Chiral Terminal Allylic Alcohols with a Titanium Salalen Catalyst and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation/kinetic resolution provides access to anti&#8208;configured terminal epoxy alcohols with high selectivity, no analogous syn&#8208;selective epoxidation process has been available. We report that this &#8220;missing link&#8221; is provided by a readily available titanium salalen catalyst. Besides allylic alcohols, allylic ethers are epoxidized with extreme syn&#8208;selectivity, at low catalyst loading, with aqueous H2O2 as oxidant.







Abstract
In the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of chiral secondary allylic alcohols, one substrate enantiomer is predominantly converted to the anti&#8208;epoxy alcohol. We herein report the first highly syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of terminal allylic alcohols using a titanium salalen complex as catalyst, at room temperature, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. With enantiopure terminal allylic alcohols as substrates, the epoxy alcohols were obtained with up to 98&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr (syn). Catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% can be applied without eroding the syn&#8208;diastereoselectivity. Modification of the allylic alcohol to an ether does not affect the diastereoselectivity either [&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr (syn)]. Inverting the catalyst configuration leads to the anti&#8208;product, albeit at lower dr (ca. 20&#8201;:&#8201;1). The synthetic potential is demonstrated by a short, gram&#8208;scale preparation of a tetrahydrofuran building block with three stereocenters, involving two titanium salalen catalyzed epoxidation steps.

         <title>Enhancing Metalating Efficiency of the Sodium Amide NaTMP in Arene Borylation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;nucleophilic amide NaTMP, in combination with PMDETA and B(OiPr)3 have allowed the deprotonative borylation of unactivated arenes under mild conditions. The study of its reaction pathway and the characterisation of the intermediates by X&#8208;Ray crystallography and 1H DOSY enabled the development of this protocol, which forms boronates in a direct and easy way, enabling Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings to obtain biaryls in an efficient manner.







Abstract
Though LiTMP (TMP=2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) is a commonly used amide, surprisingly the heavier NaTMP has hardly been utilised. Here, by mixing NaTMP with tridentate donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), we provide structural, and mechanistic insights into the sodiation of non&#8208;activated arenes (e.g. anisole and benzene). While these reactions are low yielding, adding B(OiPr)3 has a profound effect, not only by intercepting the CAr&#8208;Na bond, but also by driving the metalation reaction towards quantitative formation of more stabilized sodium aryl boronates. Demonstrating its metalating power, regioselective C2&#8208;metalation/borylation of naphthalene has been accomplished contrasting with single&#8208;metal based protocols which are unselective and low yielding. Extension to other arenes allows for in situ generation of aryl boronates which can then directly engage in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings, furnishing a range of biaryls in a selective and efficient manner.

         <title>Anisotropy in a 2D Perovskite Ferroelectric Drives Self&#8208;Powered Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photoresponse for Ultraviolet Solar&#8208;Blind Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind polarized&#8208;light detection has been demonstrated for the first time in a new wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite&#8208;type ferroelectric and closely involves the inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect.







Abstract
Polarized&#8208;light detection in the deep ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind region is indispensable for optoelectronic applications. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics with inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) have become a robust candidate in this portfolio. We here report a wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (isobutylammonium)2(methylamium)Pb2Cl7 (1), in which the BPVE behaves as self&#8208;driving source for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarized&#8208;light detection. It exhibits a large dichroism ratio (&#8776;15.7) and superior BPVE&#8208;directed photocurrent (&#8776;3.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, under 266&#8197;nm). These attributes facilitate excellent self&#8208;powered polarized&#8208;light detection of high on/off contrast (&#8776;103) and polarization ratio (&#8776;2.5), beyond those of inorganic oxides (e.g., ZnO, 1.47; GaN, 1.38). This study highlights potential of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics for new optoelectronic application.

         <title>Alumina&#8208;Supported Alpha&#8208;Iron(III) Oxyhydroxide as a Recyclable Solid Catalyst for CO2 Photoreduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widespread soil mineral, alpha&#8208;iron(III) oxyhydroxide, which is loaded onto an alumina support, works as a recyclable catalyst for CO2 reduction. In the presence of a RuII photosensitizer, the catalyst produces formic acid with 80&#8211;90&#8201;% selectivity and an apparent quantum yield of 4.3&#8201;% at 460&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into transportable fuels such as formic acid (HCOOH) under sunlight is an attractive solution to the shortage of energy and carbon resources as well as to the increase in Earth's atmospheric CO2 concentration. The use of abundant elements as the components of a photocatalytic CO2 reduction system is important, and a solid catalyst that is active, recyclable, nontoxic, and inexpensive is strongly demanded. Here, we show that a widespread soil mineral, alpha&#8208;iron(III) oxyhydroxide (&#945;&#8208;FeOOH; goethite), loaded onto an Al2O3 support, functions as a recyclable catalyst for a photocatalytic CO2 reduction system under visible light (&#955;&gt;400&#8197;nm) in the presence of a RuII photosensitizer and an electron donor. This system gave HCOOH as the main product with 80&#8211;90&#8201;% selectivity and an apparent quantum yield of 4.3&#8201;% at 460&#8197;nm, as confirmed by isotope tracer experiments with 13CO2. The present work shows that the use of a proper support material is another method of catalyst activation toward the selective reduction of CO2.

This system gave HCOOH as the main product with 80&#8211;90&#8201;% selectivity and an apparent quantum yield of 4.3&#8201;% at 460&#8197;nm, as confirmed by isotope tracer experiments with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The present work shows that the use of a proper support material is another method of catalyst activation toward the selective reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylation and Alkene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8722;NiI catalyst promotes regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling of polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides to afford trisubstituted borylalkenes and styrenes. The reaction proceeds through branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation followed by trans&#8208;selective allyl isomerization.







Abstract
Catalytic strategies that provide stereoselective access to highly substituted alkenes from abundant monosubstituted substrates are exceedingly sought&#8208;after but rare. Here, we show that a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;NiI catalytic species mediates efficient union of electronically polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides, in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate and trimethylamine additives, to generate trisubstituted boron&#8208; and arene&#8208;containing trans alkenes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Control experiments provide evidence for a mechanism involving branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation that overrides substrate control, followed by trans&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift. The method represents a significant addition to the toolbox of reactions for the concise synthesis of unsaturated biologically active compounds.

         <title>Chemical Recycling of Poly(Cyclohexene Carbonate) Using a Di&#8208;MgII Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the chemical recycling of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC) to cyclohexene oxide (CHO) with 98&#8201;% selectivity using a dinuclear MgII catalyst is reported. The chemical recycling and recovery of CHO under mild conditions further advances the utilization of CO2&#8208;polycarbonates as recyclable materials.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of polymers to true monomers is pivotal for a circular plastics economy. Here, the first catalyzed chemical recycling of the widely investigated carbon dioxide derived polymer, poly(cyclohexene carbonate), to cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide is reported. The reaction requires dinuclear catalysis, with the di&#8208;MgII catalyst showing both high monomer selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and activity (TOF=150&#8197;h&#8722;1, 0.33&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 120&#8201;&#176;C). The depolymerization occurs via a chain&#8208;end catalyzed depolymerization mechanism and DFT calculations indicate the high selectivity arises from Mg&#8208;alkoxide catalyzed epoxide extrusion being kinetically favorable compared to cyclic carbonate formation.

         <title>Repeatedly Regenerating Mechanically Robust Polymer Brushes from Persistent Initiator Coating (PIC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic&#8208;hybrid persistent initiator coating (PIC) was fabricated by the introduction of initiator into a mechanically robust sol&#8208;gel layer for surface initiated polymerization. This strategy enables polymerization repeatedly when polymer brushes on the surface were worn off and both PIC and surface grafted brushes show excellent anti&#8208;abrasive property compared to conventional brushes.







Abstract
In this study, a novel surface initiated polymerization (SIP) method was developed from organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid persistent initiator coating (PIC) that embeds initiator molecules into inorganic silica sol&#8208;gel layer. Comparing with traditional silane initiator surface that prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, the PIC can effectively improve the mechanical stability of initiator that was able to endure ten&#8208;thousand times of friction cycles. Besides, it allows polymer grafting from sub&#8208;surface and so the grafted brushes, poly 3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (pSPMA) on the PIC were also much more wear&#8208;resisting than those prepared by the traditional ways. More importantly, the PIC could still trigger new polymerization reaction when the grafted brushes were worn off. In addition, the PIC is universal and can be covered on different substrates including glass, metals and plastics, etc. to realize functionalization of these materials. The approach may pave technological way for the application of surface grafted polymer brushes.

         <title>Asymmetric Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Racemic Allylic Alcohols for the Synthesis of Chiral Amino Acid Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
Racemic allylic alcohols are converted into chiral amino acid derivatives via asymmetric hydroalkylation enabled by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggested that a single ruthenium chiral catalyst controls the stereoselectivity of two remote chiral centers through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation and a diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols has been developed for the synthesis of chiral amino acid derivatives with two remote chiral centers by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. The stereoselectivities are controlled by a single chiral Ru catalyst via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process and an interesting diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product. The method could be used for the synthesis of several types of biologically important molecules, including stereodivergent synthesis of chiral pyrrolidine derivatives.

         <title>Transfer of Axial Chirality to the Nanoscale Endows Carbon Nanodots with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropoisomeric precursors have been employed to prepare chiral carbon dots using a straightforward bottom&#8208;up approach. Chirality is retained in the nanoparticle, endowing carbon nanodots with intrinsic circularly polarized luminescence. The obtained material combines chiroptical activity with excellent processability in organic solvents and thermal stability.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, purification and characterization of chiral carbon nanodots starting from atropoisomeric precursors. The obtained atropoisomeric carbon nanodots are soluble in organic solvents and have good thermal stability, which are desirable features for technological applications. The synthetic protocol is robust, as it supports a number of variations in terms of molecular doping agents. Remarkably, the combination of axially chiral precursors and 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone as doping agent results in green&#8208;emissive carbon dots displaying circularly polarized luminescence. Dissymmetry factors of |3.5|&#215;10&#8722;4 are obtained in solution, without the need of any additional element of chirality. Introducing axial chirality expands the strategies available to tailor the properties of carbon nanodots, paving the way for carbon nanoparticles that combine good processability in organic solvents with engineered advanced chiroptical properties.

         <title>Concise and Stereodivergent Approach to Chromanone Lactones through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Addition of Siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;Ester&#8208;Substituted Chromones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous addition of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones is described. This method generated enantioenriched chromanone lactones with divergent diastereoselectivities depending on the ligand used and enabled a concise and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;blennolide&#8197;B with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Vicinal oxygen&#8208;containing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted stereocenters exist widely in chromanone lactone and tetrahydroxanthone natural products. Their enantioselective construction in a single step remains elusive and poses a formidable challenge for chemical synthesis. Here, we report the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous additions of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones, which enable concise and enantioselective assembly of chromanone lactones. Both syn and anti adducts can be accessed with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity by judicious choice of the chiral ligands. Our approach allowed for the efficient synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;blennolide&#8197;B with precise stereochemical control, which provides a formal synthesis of secalonic acid&#8197;A.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Addition for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Pyrrolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of photoredox catalysis and Lewis base catalysis has been developed to realise the first example of asymmetric radical conjugate addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides and esters. The chemistry, mastered by a chiral isothiourea organocatalyst, enables the synthesis of enantioenriched pyrrolidinones, with application to the synthesis of biologically&#8208;active &#947;&#8208;amino butyric acids.







Abstract
We report a catalytic asymmetric protocol for the preparation of chiral pyrrolidinones proceeding via a radical pathway. The chemistry exploits the combination of photoredox catalysis and Lewis base catalysis to realise the first example of asymmetric radical conjugate addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides and esters. The reaction is initiated by photoredox activation of N&#8208;arylglycines to generate, upon decarboxylation, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals. These radicals are then intercepted stereoselectively by &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediates, whose formation is mastered by a chiral isothiourea organocatalyst. Cyclisation leads to catalyst turnover and formation of enantioenriched pyrrolidinones. The utility of the protocol was demonstrated with application to the synthesis of biologically&#8208;active &#947;&#8208;amino butyric acids.

         <title>Dynamic Interconversions of Single Molecules Probed by Recognition Tunneling at Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Functionalized Supramolecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic conversions of single molecules can be monitored at doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized supramolecular junctions. Through this intermolecular recognition tunneling technique, the molecular conductance of different analytes and analyte mixtures can be finger&#8208;printed in dependence on pH and competitive salts, showcasing the first examples of direct as well as displacement titrations of single host&#8211;guest complexes at electronic junctions.







Abstract
We introduce a versatile recognition tunneling technique using doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized electrodes to form supramolecular junctions that capture analytes dynamically by host&#8211;guest complexation. This results in characteristic changes in their single&#8208;molecule conductance. For structurally related drug molecules (camptothecin, sanguinarine, chelerythrine, and berberine) and mixtures thereof, we observed distinct current switching signals related to their intrinsic conductance properties as well as pH&#8208;dependent effects which can be traced back to their different states (protonated versus neutral). The conductance variation of a single molecule with pH shows a sigmoidal distribution, allowing us to extract a pKa value for reversible protonation, which is consistent with the reported macroscopic results. The new electronic method allows the characterization of unmodified drug molecules and showcases the transfer of dynamic supramolecular chemistry principles to single molecules.

         <title>Strong Proton&#8208;Electron Coupling in &#960;&#8208;Planar Metal Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong proton&#8208;electron coupling behavior of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel(II) complex with redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands was demonstrated using optical and electrochemical methods as well as theoretical calculations. The potential&#8208;pH diagram shows a significant shift in the acidity&#8208;dependent redox potential, which is supported by the calculated energetic stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal complexes has been widely studied, especially in biochemistry and catalytic chemistry. Although metal complexes bearing redox&#8208;active ligands play a part in these research areas, those with &#960;&#8208;planar structure remain entirely unexplored, which are vital for future development of iono&#8208;electronics. Here, proton&#8208;electron coupling of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel complex bearing redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands, Ni(itsq)2, was investigated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. Strong proton&#8208;electron coupling was manifested in a large potential shift, which is twice greater than that of a typical PCET&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;planar metal complex with redox&#8208;inactive ligands, [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8722;. Theoretical calculations affirmed that the stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation is greater in Ni(itsq)2 than that in [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8722;. These results indicate that &#960;&#8208;planar metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands are promising for developing novel PCET&#8208;type materials.

         <title>Enlightening the &#8220;Spirit Molecule&#8221;: Photomodulation of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor by a Light&#8208;Controllable N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) was made photoswitchable following an &#8220;azo&#8208;extension&#8221; approach on the indole moiety. A library of azo&#8208;DMTs was synthesized out of which 5&#8208;(4&#8208;MeO)&#8208;azo&#8208;DMT (Photo&#8208;DMT) acted as cis&#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221;.







Abstract
Classical psychedelics are a group of hallucinogens which trigger non&#8208;ordinary states of consciousness through activation of the 5&#8208;HT2A receptor (5&#8208;HT2AR) in the brain. However, the exact mechanism of how 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism alters perception remains elusive. When studying receptor signaling, tools which work at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the receptor are exceptionally useful. To create such a tool, we designed a set of photoswitchable ligands based on the classical psychedelic N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine (DMT). By incorporation of the DMT&#8208;indole ring into the photoswitchable system, we obtained red&#8208;shifted ligands which can be operated by visible light. Among these azo&#8208;DMTs, compound 2&#8201;h (&#8220;Photo&#8208;DMT&#8221;) stands out as its cis isomer exhibits DMT like activity while the trans isomer acts as weak partial agonist. Such a cis&#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5&#8208;HT2AR signaling.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) was made photoswitchable following an &#8220;azo-extension&#8221; approach on the indole moiety. A library of azo-DMTs was synthesized out of which 5-(4-MeO)-azo-DMT (Photo-DMT) acted as &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical psychedelics are a group of hallucinogens which trigger non-ordinary states of consciousness through activation of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) in the brain. However, the exact mechanism of how 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R agonism alters perception remains elusive. When studying receptor signaling, tools which work at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the receptor are exceptionally useful. To create such a tool, we designed a set of photoswitchable ligands based on the classical psychedelic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). By incorporation of the DMT-indole ring into the photoswitchable system, we obtained red-shifted ligands which can be operated by visible light. Among these azo-DMTs, compound &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;h&lt;/b&gt; (&#8220;Photo-DMT&#8221;) stands out as its &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomer exhibits DMT like activity while the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer acts as weak partial agonist. Such a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Myrioneuron alkaloid (&#177;)&#8208;myrioneurinol was synthesized in 14 steps from a readily available compound. The synthesis features efficient sequential [2+2] cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich fragmentation/Mannich reaction to assemble the tricyclic core of myrioneurinol.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;myrioneurinol has been achieved in 14 steps. An efficient AgSbF6/t&#8208;BuCl&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the alkynone&#8208;tethered enamine was developed to prepare the highly strained cyclobutene. It was used in combination with a subsequent retro&#8208;Mannich fragmentation/Mannich reaction to efficiently construct the tricyclic core of myrioneurinol.

         <title>Stereoinvertive Nucleophilic Substitution at Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters of Cyclopropyl Ketones and Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis&#8208;acid catalyzed stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl ketones and cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives is reported. A variety of tertiary alkyl bromides, chlorides and azides are prepared in good yields with excellent stereopurity via a postulated bicyclobutonium intermediate.







Abstract
A highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl ketones and cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using TMSBr, DMPSCl and TMSN3 as nucleophiles has been developed. A variety of acyclic tertiary alkyl bromides, chlorides and azides were therefore prepared with excellent diastereopurity. The substitution occurs at the most substituted quaternary carbon center in a stereoinvertive manner, which may be attributed to the existence of a bicyclobutonium species.

         <title>A Simple Fluorescence Affinity Assay to Decipher Uranyl&#8208;Binding to Native Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent uranyl probe was designed and validated for the reliable determination of uranyl&#8211;protein affinities, at equilibrium and in biologically relevant conditions.







Abstract
Determining the affinity of proteins for uranyl is key to understand the toxicity of this cation and to further develop decorporation strategies. However, usual techniques to achieve that goal often require specific equipment and expertise. Here, we propose a simple, efficient, fluorescence&#8208;based method to assess the affinity of proteins and peptides for uranyl, at equilibrium and in buffered solution. We first designed and characterized an original uranyl&#8208;binding fluorescent probe. We then built a reference scale for uranyl affinity in solution, relying on signal quenching of our fluorescent probe in presence of high&#8208;affinity uranyl&#8208;binding peptides. We finally validated our approach by re&#8208;evaluating the uranyl&#8208;binding affinity of four native proteins. We envision that this tool will facilitate the reliable and reproducible assessment of affinities of peptides and proteins for uranyl.

         <title>Ligand Fluorination to Mitigate the Raman Relaxation of DyIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets: A Combined Terahertz, Far&#8208;IR and Vibronic Barrier Model Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination at the axial position of pentagonal&#8208;bipyraimdal dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnets is shown to effectively reduce the anharmonic phonon&#8208;assisted Raman relaxation process, as validated by THz, far&#8208;IR, ab initio, and DFT calculations using a newly established vibronic&#8208;barrier model.







Abstract
The fast Raman relaxation process via a virtual energy level has become a puzzle for how to chemically engineer single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with better performance. Here, we use the trifluoromethyl group to systematically substitute the methyl groups in the axial position of the parent bis&#8208;butoxide pentapyridyl dysprosium(III) SMM. The resulting complexes&#8212;[Dy(OLA)2py5][BPh4] (LA=CH(CF3)2&#8722; 1, CH2CF3&#8722; 2, CMe2CF3&#8722; 3)&#8212;show progressively enhanced TBhys (@100&#8197;Oe&#8201;s&#8722;1) from 17&#8197;K (for 3), 20&#8197;K (for 2) to 23&#8197;K (for 1). By experimentally identifying the varied under barrier relaxation energy in the 5&#8211;500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 regime, we are able to identify that the C&#8722;F bond related vibration energy of the axial ligand ranging from 200 to 350&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is the key variant for this improvement. Thus, this finding not only reveals a correlation between the structure and the Raman process but also provides a paradigm for how to apply the vibronic barrier model to analyze multi&#8208;phonon relaxation processes in lanthanide SMMs.

         <title>Controlling Thermal Expansion in Supramolecular Halogen&#8208;Bonded Mixed Cocrystals through Synthetic Feed and Dynamic Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy has been developed for controlling thermal expansion using a mixed cocrystal approach, wherein thermal expansion is tuned by controlling the synthetic feed and functionality of the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor molecules. The appearance and composition of the bulk material is similar across the series, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction and SEM&#8208;EDS; however, expansion behaviors differ due to the dynamic motion ability of the acceptor molecules.

Control over thermal expansion (TE) behaviors in solid materials is often accomplished by modifying the molecules or intermolecular interactions within the solid. Here, we use a mixed cocrystal approach and incorporate molecules with similar chemical structures, but distinct functionalities. Development of mixed cocrystals is at a nascent stage, and here we describe the first mixed cocrystals sustained by one&#8208;dimensional halogen bonds. Within each mixed cocrystal, the halogen&#8208;bond donor is fixed, while the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor site contains two molecules in a variable ratio. X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates isostructurality across the series, and SEM&#8208;EDS shows equal distribution of heavy atoms and similar atomic compositions across all mixed cocrystals. The acceptor molecules differ in their ability to undergo dynamic motion in the solid state. The synthetic equivalents of motion capable and incapable molecules were systematically varied to yield direct tunabililty in TE behavior.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy has been developed for controlling thermal expansion using a mixed cocrystal approach, wherein thermal expansion is tuned by controlling the synthetic feed and functionality of the halogen-bond acceptor molecules. The appearance and composition of the bulk material is similar across the series, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDS; however, expansion behaviors differ due to the dynamic motion ability of the acceptor molecules.

         <title>Engineering eg Orbital Occupancy of Pt with Au Alloying Enables Reversible Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the eg occupancy of Pt with M alloying (M=Au, Ru) is reported to tune the charge overpotentials for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Lowering eg occupancy of Pt in PtAu can elevate the antibonding orbitals and enhance the adsorption strength towards LiO2, resulting in high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries with a low overpotential.







Abstract
Constructing well&#8208;designed catalysts to accelerate OER catalytic activity and alleviate the charge overpotential is prevailing for achieving sophisticated Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Herein, we report a concept for engineering the eg occupancy of Pt with M alloying (M=Au, Ru) to tune the charge overpotentials for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy results coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the highly electronegative Au can capture more eg electrons from Pt, leading to less eg electrons of Pt in PtAu than that in PtRu. The lower eg occupancy of Pt atoms in PtAu alloys entails the upward shift of the Pt d band, which causes a strong binding strength towards the intermediates (LiO2), thereby decreasing the OER energy barrier. As a consequence, the Li&#8722;O2 battery with a PtAu cathode delivers a low charge overpotential of 0.36&#8197;V and superior cycle life of 220&#8197;cycles at a cutoff capacity of 1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is among the best in the reported noble metal&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Chiral Arene Ligand as Stereocontroller for Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of facilely tunable, [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived chiral arene ligands has been developed, by which a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;methoxybenzamides with alkynes was achieved, affording a series of axially chiral isoquinolones in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to 96&#8201;% ee. This work opens up a new avenue to achieve asymmetric C&#8722;H activation by using a chiral arene ligand as stereocontroller.







Abstract
Development of chiral ligands is the most fundamental task in metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis. In the last 60&#8197;years, various kinds of ligands have been sophisticatedly developed. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to develop practically useful chiral &#951;6&#8208;arene ligands, thereby seriously hampering the asymmetric synthesis promoted by arene&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a class of readily tunable, C2&#8208;symmetric chiral arene ligands derived from [2.2]paracyclophane. Its ruthenium(II) complexes have been prepared and successfully applied in the enantioselective C&#8722;H activation to afford a series of axially chiral isoquinolones (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee). This study not only lays chemists&#8217; longstanding doubts about whether it is possible to use chiral arene ligands to stereocontrol ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation, but also opens up a new avenue to achieve asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Soft Electrodes for Electrochemical and Electrophysiological Monitoring of Beating Cardiomyocytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft electrode with a PEDOT&#8208;based nanomesh with excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical performance and cellular biocompatibility is reported. It allowed the real&#8208;time monitoring of both biomolecule release and electrophysiological activity of beating cardiomyocytes. This work provides a versatile platform for the simultaneous characterization of the chemical and electrical responses from dynamically pulsing cells.







Abstract
Many cells in vivo have their inherent motions, which involve numerous biochemical and biophysical signals synergistically regulating cell behavior and function. However, existing methods offer little information about the concurrently chemical and physical responses of dynamically pulsing cells. Here, we report a soft electrode with an electrospun poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)&#8208;based nanomesh to fully comply with spontaneous motions of cells. Moreover, this electrode demonstrated excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical performance and cellular biocompatibility. Cardiomyocytes cultured thereon exhibited autonomous and rhythmic contractility, and synchronously induced mechanical deformation of the underlying electrode, which allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of nitric oxide release and electrophysiological activity of cardiomyocytes. This work provides a promising way toward recording chemical and electrical signals of biological systems with their natural motions.

         <title>Ultrawide Bandgap and Outstanding Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response by a Fluorine&#8208;Enrichment Strategy at a Transition&#8208;Metal Oxyfluoride Nonlinear Optical Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual fluorine&#8208;rich oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2, which exhibits an extremely wide band gap (5.88&#8197;eV) and a strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (4.0&#215;KH2PO4), both being the largest values for transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;centered oxyfluorides, has been successfully constructed by a fluorine&#8208;enrichment strategy for simultaneously enhancing band gap and SHG response.







Abstract
The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by competing microstructure requirements: the need to simultaneously engineer a large hyperpolarizability (a large second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)) and a wide HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (a wide band gap). Herein, a non&#8208;centrosymmetric transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2 (KNOF) with an extremely high F/O ratio is constructed in high yield. KNOF exhibits an extremely wide band gap (5.88&#8197;eV) and a strong powder SHG response (4.0&#215;KH2PO4)&#8212;both being the largest values for TM&#8208;centered oxyfluorides&#8212;as well as a birefringence sufficient for applications. The dominant roles of the partially fluorinated [NbO2F4] and totally fluorinated [NbF7] groups in achieving the enlarged band gap in KNOF have been clarified by first&#8208;principles calculations. Our results suggest that maximizing the fluorine content of oxyfluorides may unlock the promise of short&#8208;wavelength&#8208;transparent materials with exceptional NLO performance.

         <title>Trapping X&#8208;ray Radiation Damage from Homolytic Se&#8722;C Bond Cleavage in BnSeSeBn Crystals (Bn=benzyl, CH2C6H5)</title>

         <dc:description>
Irradiation of dibenzyl diselenide BnSeSeBn with X&#8208;ray or UV&#8208;light homolytically cleaves the Se&#8722;C and Se&#8722;Se bonds inducing stable and metastable radical states. Structural changes due to X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced Se&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage could be pin&#8208;pointed in various high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments.







Abstract
Irradiation of dibenzyl diselenide BnSeSeBn with X&#8208;ray or UV&#8208;light cleaves the Se&#8722;C and the Se&#8722;Se bonds, inducing stable and metastable radical states. They are inevitably important to all natural and life sciences. Structural changes due to X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced Se&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage could be pin&#8208;pointed in various high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments for the first time. Extended DFT methods were applied to characterize the solid&#8208;state structure and support the refinement of the observed residuals as contributions from the BnSeSe&#8901; radical species. The X&#8208;ray or UV&#8208;irradiated crystalline samples of BnSeSeBn were characterized by solid&#8208;state EPR. This paper provides insight that in the course of X&#8208;ray structure analysis of selenium compounds not only organo&#8208;selenide radicals like RSe&#8901; may occur, but also organo diselenide BnSeSe&#8901; radicals and organic radicals R&#8901; are generated, particularly important to know in structural biology.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Formamides by Integrating CO2 Capture and Morpholine Formylation on Supported Iridium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morpholine is used as CO2 capture and formylation reagent to get value&#8208;added N&#8208;formylmorpholine under relatively mild reaction conditions. Morpholine can capture CO2 in air efficiently and be further hydrogenated to formamides on isolated Ir/ND@G catalysts with a TON up to 817&#8201;000.







Abstract
Herein we report an efficient and recyclable catalytic system for tandem CO2 capture and N&#8208;formylation to value&#8208;added chemicals. CO2 is apt to be captured by morpholine solution, while a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst, isolated iridium atoms supported over nanadiamond/graphene, is discovered to be highly reactive for the formylation of morpholine, leading to the formation of N&#8208;formylmorpholine with excellent productivity (with a turnover number of 5&#8201;120&#8201;000 in a single batch reaction) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). In addition, the CO2 captured by morpholine under atmospheric conditions can be converted to N&#8208;formylmorpholine with decent conversion (51&#8201;%), which realizes the integration of CO2 capture and conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiroketals and Spiroaminals via Gold and Iridium Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric cascade reaction of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols/2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines with alkynyl alcohols/amides was realized by using a novel Au/Ir sequential catalytic system, which enables the facile synthesis of structurally diverse spiroketals and spiroaminals with up to high diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The enantioselective cascade reaction between racemic 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols and alkynols/alkynamides was realized by using a gold and iridium sequential catalytic system. In this procedure, the in situ generated exocyclic vinyl ethers or enamides undergo the asymmetric allylation/spiroketalization with &#960;&#8208;ally&#8208;Ir amphiphilic species, which provides an efficient and straightforward access to spiroketals and spiroaminals with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, racemic 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines were also suitable in this reaction along with a kinetic resolution process, affording enantioenriched spiroaminals and 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines in good yields. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated by efficient enantioselective synthesis of the analogue of Paecilospirone.

Abstract
Herein, we report the development of a method for highly regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes generated from 1&#8208;silylcyclopropenes in the presence of a chiral copper(I)/bisoxazoline catalyst for the construction of chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic gem&#8208;silylboranes, which cannot be prepared by any other known methods. This reaction is the first highly enantioselective carbene insertion reaction of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes ever to be reported. The method shows general applicability for various 3,3&#8208;disubstituted silylcyclopropenes and exclusively affords E&#8208;products. The novel chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic gem&#8208;silylborane products are versatile allylic bimetallic reagents with high stability and have great synthetic potential, especially for the construction of complex molecules with continuous chiral centers.

         <title>Stereodefined Skipped Dienes through Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Addition of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds to Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal addition of allylic C&#8722;H bond to alkyne is reported. A tertiary C&#8722;H bond was cleaved at the site of which a quaternary carbon center was formed. This atom&#8208;economical process provided a straightforward synthetic route to skipped dienes containing a C3&#8208;quaternary carbon. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters through enantio&#8208;convergent vinylation of tertiary C&#8722;H bond was also feasible.







Abstract
Preparation of skipped dienes with a quaternary carbon center at the C&#8208;3 position remains a synthetic challenge. We report here an iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal addition of tertiary sp3 C&#8722;H bond to alkyne for the facile preparation of skipped dienes. The tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bond is cleaved regioselectively, at the site of which a new C&#8722;C bond is formed.

     alt="Stereodefined Skipped Dienes through Iridium-Catalyzed Formal Addition of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds to Alkynes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An iridium-catalyzed formal addition of allylic C&#8722;H bond to alkyne is reported. A tertiary C&#8722;H bond was cleaved at the site of which a quaternary carbon center was formed. This atom-economical process provided a straightforward synthetic route to skipped dienes containing a C3-quaternary carbon. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters through enantio-convergent vinylation of tertiary C&#8722;H bond was also feasible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation of skipped dienes with a quaternary carbon center at the C-3 position remains a synthetic challenge. We report here an iridium-catalyzed formal addition of tertiary sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; C&#8722;H bond to alkyne for the facile preparation of skipped dienes. The tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bond is cleaved regioselectively, at the site of which a new C&#8722;C bond is formed. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters is also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Persistent Ambipolar Heptacenes and Their Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble heptacenes are stabilized via TIPS&#8208;ethynylation and halogenation. TIPS&#8208;ethynylation on every second ring is critical for longevity. The most stable derivative is characterized in thin&#8208;film transistors and post&#8208;functionalized via Stille coupling to a nonarene.







Abstract
Sixfold TIPS&#8208;ethynylation combined with fourfold bromination of the armchair edges furnishes a long&#8208;lived, soluble heptacene; &#960;&#8208;extension via Stille coupling accesses a persistent tetrabenzononacene. Both types of acenes were stabilized best by double TIPS&#8208;ethynylation on every other benzene ring. Tetrabromoheptacene is an ambipolar transistor material (up to 0.036&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 n&#8208;channel), which was corroborated by generation of its monoanion and monocation.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation of (Hetero)Arenes with Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alkylation of alkenes with indoles, thiophenes and electron rich arenes has been developed. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles via hydrogen atom transfer.







Abstract
An efficient and general intermolecular Cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of styrenes with (hetero)arenes including indoles, thiophene and electron rich arenes has been developed, providing straightforward access to enantioenriched alkyl(hetero)arenes with high enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction underwent a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst&#8208;controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and aromatic nucleophiles. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles, providing a new strategy for asymmetric Friedel&#8211;Crafts type alkylation.

         <title>Catalytic Desymmetric Dicarbofunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The desymmetric dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes by a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed to access pyrrolidinones bearing multi&#8208;stereocenters with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. The utilization of the 8&#8208;Quinox ligand is crucial for maintaining high enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The construction of multi&#8208;stereocenters by a transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction is a major challenge. The catalytic desymmetric functionalization of unactivated alkenes remains largely unexplored. Herein, we disclose &#8208;a desymmetric dicarbofunctionalization of 1,6&#8208;dienes via a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The leverage of the underdeveloped chiral 8&#8208;Quinox enables the Ni&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric carbamoylalkylation of both unactivated mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes to form pyrrolidinone bearing two nonadjacent stereogenic centers in high enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivitives with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. The synthetic application of pyrrolidinones allows the rapid access to complex chiral fused&#8208;heterocycles.
