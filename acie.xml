      <title>autodE: Automated Calculation of Reaction Energy Profiles &#8211; Application to Organic and Organometallic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Calculating reaction energy profiles to aid in mechanistic elucidation has long been the domain of the expert computational chemist. Here, we introduce autodE (https://github.com/duartegroup/autodE), an open&#8208;source Python package capable of locating transition states and minima and delivering a full reaction energy profile from 1D or 2D chemical representations. autodE is broadly applicable to study organic and organometallic reaction classes, including addition, substitution, elimination, migratory insertion, oxidative addition and reductive elimination; it accounts for conformational sampling of both minima and TSs, and is compatible with many electronic structure packages. The general applicability of autodE is demonstrated in complex multi&#8208;step reactions, including metal&#8208;catalyzed cobalt&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation, and an Ireland&#8208;Claisen rearrangement.</dc:description>

      <title>Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalytic Systems for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Where Are We Now?</title>
      <dc:description>
Mimicking natural photosynthesis: The latest progress on Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction is comprehensively discussed in this Review. Particular attention is given to modification strategies that improve photocatalytic performance as well as confirmation methods to assess the Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Transforming CO2 into fuels by utilizing sunlight is promising to synchronously overcome global warming and energy&#8208;supply issues. It is crucial to design efficient photocatalysts with intriguing features such as robust light&#8208;harvesting ability, strong redox potential, high charge&#8208;separation, and excellent durability. Hitherto, a single&#8208;component photocatalyst is incapable to simultaneously meet all these criteria. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing artificial Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts provides a facile way to conquer these bottlenecks. In this review, we firstly introduce the fundamentals of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and Z&#8208;scheme systems. Thereafter we discuss state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic CO2 reduction, whereby special attention is placed on the predominant factors that affect photoactivity. Additionally, further modifications that are important for efficient photocatalysis are reviewed.

      <title>Inhibiting Solvent Co&#8208;Intercalation in Graphite Anode by Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte in Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as the leading contenders in energy storage devices. However, the batteries with routine carbonate electrolytes cannot exhibit satisfactory fast&#8208;charging performance and lithium plating is widely observed at low temperatures. Herein we demonstrate that a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte consisting of 1.5 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in dimethoxyethane with bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) ether as the diluent, enables fast&#8208;charging of working batteries. A uniform and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be achieved on graphite surface through the preferential decomposition of anions. The established SEI can significantly inhibit solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite and achieve highly reversible Li+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. The graphite | Li cells exhibit fast&#8208;charging potential (340 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 220 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 C), excellent cycling stability (~85.5% initial capacity retention for 200 cycles at 4 C), and impressive low temperature performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery and biosynthetic investigation of a new antibacterial dehydrated non&#8208;ribosomal tripeptide</title>

      <title>Adsorption Site Selective Occupation Strategy within a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Sieving Acetylene from Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <dc:description>The separation of C  2  H  2  /CO  2  is an essential but challenging process owing to their similar molecular sizes and physical properties.

      <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Alcohols by Enantioselective Silylation Enabled by Two Orthogonal Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
The combination of a chiral copper catalyst and a bifunctional ruthenium pincer complex enables the nonenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of acyclic and cyclic benzylic alcohols. The enantioselective Cu&#8208;H&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative Si&#8208;O coupling and the rapid transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alcohol racemization are perfectly orthogonal. By this, high yields and good levels of enantioselection are achieved.







Abstract
A nonenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of acyclic and cyclic benzylic alcohols is reported. The approach merges rapid transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alcohol racemization and enantioselective Cu&#8208;H&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative Si&#8208;O coupling of alcohols and hydrosilanes. The catalytic processes are orthogonal, and the racemization catalyst does not promote any background reactions such as the racemization of the silyl ether and its unselective formation. Often&#8208;used ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes are not suitable but a bifunctional ruthenium pincer complex perfectly fulfills this purpose. By this, enantioselective silylation of racemic alcohol mixtures is achieved in high yields and with good levels of enantioselection.

      <title>Synergy between Metallic and Oxidized Pt Sites Unravelled during Room Temperature CO Oxidation on Pt/Ceria</title>
      <dc:description>Pt&#8208;based materials are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, in particular for pollutant removal applications. The nature of the active Pt phase responsible for CO oxidation has long been investigated with a view at designing more efficient formulations. The state of Pt has often been proposed to differ depending on experimental conditions, e.g. metallic Pt poisoned with CO being present at lower temperature before light&#8208;off, while an oxidized Pt surface prevails above light&#8208;off temperature.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pt&#8208;based materials are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, in particular for pollutant removal applications. The nature of the active Pt phase responsible for CO oxidation has long been investigated with a view at designing more efficient formulations. The state of Pt has often been proposed to differ depending on experimental conditions, e.g. metallic Pt poisoned with CO being present at lower temperature before light&#8208;off, while an oxidized Pt surface prevails above light&#8208;off temperature. In stark contrast with all previous reports, we show here that both metallic and oxidized Pt are present in similar proportions under reaction conditions at the surface of ca. 1 nm nanoparticles showing high activity at 30 &#176;C. The simultaneous presence of metallic and oxidized Pt enables a synergy between these phases. The main role of metallic Pt phase is to provide strong adsorption sites for CO, while that of oxidized Pt supposedly supplies reactive oxygen.

      <title>Exploiting Ru&#8208;induced Lattice Strain in CoRu Nanoalloys for Robust Bifunctional Hydrogen Production</title>
      <dc:description>Designing bifunctional catalysts capable of driving the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and also H  2  evolution via the hydrolysis of hydrogen storage materials such as ammonia borane (AB) is of considerable practical importance for future hydrogen economies. Herein, we systematically examined the effect of tensile lattice strain in CoRu nanoalloys supported on carbon quantum dots (CoRu/CQDs) on hydrogen generation by HER and AB hydrolysis. By varying the Ru content, the lattice parameters and Ru&#8208;induced lattice strain in the CoRu nanoalloys could be tuned. The CoRu  0.5  /CQDs catalyst with an ultra&#8208;low Ru content (1.33 wt.%) exhibited excellent catalytic activity for HER (&#951; = 18 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  in 1 M KOH) and extraordinary activity for the hydrolysis of AB with a turnover frequency of 3255.4 mol  (H2)  mol  &#8722;1  (Ru)  min  &#8722;1  or 814.7 mol  (H2)  mol  &#8722;1  (cat)  min  &#8722;1  at 298 K, respectively, representing one of the best activities yet reported for AB hydrolysis over a ruthenium alloy catalyst. Moreover, the CoRu  0.5  /CQDs catalyst displayed excellent stability during each reaction, including seven alternating cycles of HER and AB hydrolysis. Theoretical calculations revealed that the remarkable catalytic performance of CoRu  0.5  /CQDs resulted from the optimal alloy electronic structure realized by incorporating small amounts of Ru, which enabled fast interfacial electron transfer to intermediates, thus benefitting H  2  evolution kinetics. Results support the development of new and improved catalysts HER and AB hydrolysis.</dc:description>

      <title>New Insight into Transition Metal Hydroxide Cover Layer for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Depositing transition metal hydroxide (TMH) layer on photoanode has been demonstrated as a promising approach for enhancing photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation, however, the controversial understanding for the improvement origin remains a key challenge to unlock the PEC performance. Herein, by taking BiVO4/iron&#8208;nickel hydroxide (BVO/FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H) as a prototype, we decoupled the PEC process into two processes including charge transfer and surface catalytic reaction. The kinetic information at the BVO/FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H and FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H/electrolyte interfaces was systematically evaluated by employing scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) model. It was found that FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H acts as a charge transporter rather than a sole electrocatalyst.

      <title>Kinetic Resolution of Aziridines Enabled by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Car&#8208;bene/Copper Cooperative Catalysis: Carbene Dose&#8208;Controlled Chemo&#8208;Switchability</title>

      <dc:description>Replacement of the&#160;  meso  &#160;methine carbon atoms of porphyrins with heteroatoms represents a powerful strategy for tuning their optical and electronic properties. In particular, 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin is an attractive target due to its importance as an intermediate in heme catabolism.

This free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation exhibits dual fluorescence originating from its unique NH tautomerism. In contrast to normal porphyrins, the&#160;  cis  &#160;form of the 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation is more stable than the&#160;  trans  &#160;form due to the effective delocalization of its positive charge.

      <title>A Design Principle for Polar Assemblies with C3&#8208;Sym Bowl&#8208;Shaped &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Polar materials attract wide research interest due to their&#160;unique properties, such as ferroelectricity and the bulk photovoltaic&#160;effect (BPVE), which are not accessible with nonpolar&#160;materials.&#160;However, in general, rationally designing polar materials is difficult&#160;because nonpolar materials are more favorable in terms of dipoledipole&#160;interactions. Here, we report a rational strategy to form polar&#160;assemblies with bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and a&#160;molecular design principle for this strategy. We synthesized and&#160;thoroughly characterized 12 single&#160;crystals with the help of various&#160;theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that it can be&#160;possible to predict whether polar assemblies become more favorable&#160;or not by estimating their lattice energies. We believe that this study&#160;contributes to the development of organic polar materials and their&#160;related studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Redox Reactions via Defects on CoS2&#8208;x for Sustainable Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
      <dc:description>Compared with adding a large amount of H  2  O  2&#160;  artificially to the traditional advanced oxidation system, it is particularly important to develop self&#8208;producing reactive oxygen species (ROSs) system and maintain the continuous and effective degradation of organic pollutants. Herein, for the first time, a system of ultrasound&#8208;treated CoS  2&#8208;x  mixed with Fe  2+  is constructed to sustainably release singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) for the effective degradation of various organic pollutants, including dyes, phenols and antibiotics. Ultrasonic treatment can produce a large number of defects on the surface of CoS  2  , which promote the production of ROSs and the circulation of Fe  3+  /Fe  2+  . With the help of Co  4+  /Co  3+&#160;  exposed on the surface of CoS  2&#8208;x  , the directional conversion of superoxide radical (  &#183;  O  2  &#8208;  ) to  1  O  2  is realized. The CoS  2&#8208;x  /Fe  2+&#160;  system can degrade organic pollutants efficiently for up to 30 days, which is significantly better than the currently recognized CuP  x  system (&lt;3 days). Therefore, CoS  2&#8208;x&#160;  provides a new choice for the long&#8208;term remediation of organic pollutants in controlling large area river pollution.</dc:description>

      <title>17.1%&#8208;Efficient Eco&#8208;Compatible Organic Solar Cells from a

      <dc:description>To elevate the perf&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;ormance of polymer solar cells (PSC) processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents, a dissymmetric fused&#8208;ring acceptor BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 with chlorine and trifluoromethyl end groups has been designed and synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data suggests that BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 has a 3D network packing structure as a result of synergistic H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregations between adjacent molecules, which will strengthen its charge transport as an acceptor material. When PBDB&#8208;TF was used as a donor, the toluene&#8208;processed binary device realized a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.31%, which was further improved to 17.12% when PC71ThBM was added as the third component. An efficiency of over 17% is currently the highest record among polymer solar cells processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents. Compared to its symmetric counterparts BTIC&#8208;4Cl and BTIC&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#947;, the dissymmetric BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 integrates their merits, having further optimized the molecular aggregations with excellent storage and photo&#8208;stability, and also extending the maximum absorption peak in film to 852 nm. As a low band&#8208;gap acceptor with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, the BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3&#8208;based semitransparent PSCs (ST&#8208;PSCs) with 24.45% average transmittance (AVT) yields a high PCE of 13.06% from same halogen&#8208;free solvent. The devices exhibit good transparency from the outdoor image through the ST&#8208;PSCs, indicating a promising utilization potential of semitransparent building integrated photovoltaics (ST&#8208;BIPV). This study demonstrates that the collaborative application of chlorination and trifluoromethylation is a practical approach to promote evolution of a low band&#8208;gap acceptor for eco&#8208;compatible processed and efficient photovoltaic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Coenzymes and Their Role in the Evolution of Life</title>
      <dc:description>
Although coenzymes play key roles in biotic metabolism, they have not been in the focus as elements in protometabolism nor has their possible prebiotic generation been discussed in detail. This Review provides a conceptual view of the role of coenzymes with respect to known theories of protometabolism and their incorporation into the RNA world hypothesis.







Abstract
The evolution of coenzymes, or their impact on the origin of life, is fundamental for understanding our own existence. Having established reasonable hypotheses about the emergence of prebiotic chemical building blocks, which were probably created under palaeogeochemical conditions, and surmising that these smaller compounds must have become integrated to afford complex macromolecules such as RNA, the question of coenzyme origin and its relation to the evolution of functional biochemistry should gain new impetus. Many coenzymes have a simple chemical structure and are often nucleotide&#8208;derived, which suggests that they may have coexisted with the emergence of RNA and may have played a pivotal role in early metabolism. Based on current theories of prebiotic evolution, which attempt to explain the emergence of privileged organic building blocks, this Review discusses plausible hypotheses on the prebiotic formation of key elements within selected extant coenzymes. In combination with prebiotic RNA, coenzymes may have dramatically broadened early protometabolic networks and the catalytic scope of RNA during the evolution of life.

In combination with prebiotic RNA, coenzymes may have dramatically broadened early protometabolic networks and the catalytic scope of RNA during the evolution of life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Sulfonyl Hydrazides</title>
      <dc:description>A highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with sulfonyl hydrazides has been realized by using palladium catalyst containing monodentate chiral spiro phosphoramidite ligand. The reaction provided efficient approach to the synthetically useful chiral allylic sulfones. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a formation of allyl hydrazine intermediate and subsequent rearrangement to the chiral allylic sulfone product. The transformation of the allyl hydrazine intermediate to the product is enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

      <title>Evidence of phenolic pool as a key intermediate for zeolite&#8208;catalyzed lignin pyrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Phenolic pool is considered to be an important intermediate during&#160;catalytic conversion of biomass.

      <title>Flow Electrolyzer Mass Spectrometry with a Gas Diffusion Electrode Design</title>
      <dc:description>Operando mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to probe reaction intermediates near the surface of catalyst in electrochemical systems. For electrochemical reactions involving gas reactants, conventional operando mass spectrometry struggles in detecting reaction intermediates because the batch&#8208;type electrochemical reactor can only handle a very limited current density due to the low solubility of gas reactant(s). Herein, we developed a new technique, namely flow electrolyzer mass spectrometry (FEMS), by incorporating a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode design, which enables the detection of reactive volatile or gaseous species at high operating current densities (&gt;100 mA cm&#8208;2). As a case study, we investigated the electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (eCORR) on polycrystalline copper and elucidated the oxygen incorporation mechanism in the acetaldehyde formation. Combining FEMS and isotopic labelling, we showed that the oxygen in the as&#8208;formed acetaldehyde intermediate originates from the reactant CO, while ethanol and n&#8208;propanol contained mainly solvent oxygen. The observation highlights the complexity of Cu&#8208;catalyzed eCORR and provides direct experimental evidence into an isotopic scrambling mechanism, where acetaldehyde is going through oxygen exchange before further reduction to ethanol.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Single&#8208;Site Nanozyme for Tumor&#8208;Specific Amplified Cascade Enzymatic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity (nanozyme) are at the targeted frontier for therapeutic interventions. However, it still remains a formidable challenge to selectively kill tumor cells through enzymatic reactions, while leaving normal cells unharmed. Herein, a new strategy is presented by developing single&#8208;site cascade enzymatic reaction for tumor&#8208;specific therapy while avoiding off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. Copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu&#8208;HCF) nanozyme with active single&#8208;site copper exhibits cascade enzymatic activity (i.e., glutathione oxidase and peroxidase) within tumor microenvironment. Results show that Cu&#8208;HCF single&#8208;site nanozymes (SSNEs) first exert tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase ability through depleting intracellular glutathione and converting single&#8208;site CuII species to CuI for subsequent amplified peroxidase activity via Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8208;Weiss reaction, and thus substantial highly toxic hydroxyl radicals are generated for tumor cell apoptosis. Our work demonstrates that SSNEs could amplify the killing efficacy of singlet oxygen species and suppress the tumor growth in vivo, providing a promising self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;site nanozyme for amplified cascade enzymatic anticancer application.</dc:description>

      <title>How Oxygen&#8208;binding Enhances Long&#8208;range Electron Transfer: Lessons from Reduction of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases by Cellobiose Dehydrogenase</title>
      <dc:description>Long&#8208;range electron transfer (ET) in metalloenzymes is a general and fundamental process governing activation and O  2  reduction. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes for the oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides, but their reduction mechanism by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), one of the most used enzymatic electron donors, via long&#8208;range ET, is still an enigma. Using multiscale simulations, we reveal that interprotein ET between CDH and LPMO is mediated by the heme propionates of CDH and solvent waters. Interestingly, we find that oxygen binding to the copper center of LPMO is coupled with the long&#8208;range interprotein ET. This process, which is spin&#8208;regulated and enhanced by the presence of O  2  , directly leads to LPMO&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;O  2  &#8226;  , bypassing formation of the generally suggested LPMO&#8208;Cu(I) species. The uncovered ET mechanism rationalizes experimental observations and has far&#8208;reaching implications in LPMO catalysis, as well as the O  2  or CO binding&#8208;enhanced long&#8208;range ET processes in other metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes for the oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides, but their reduction mechanism by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), one of the most used enzymatic electron donors, via long&#8208;range ET, is still an enigma. Using multiscale simulations, we reveal that interprotein ET between CDH and LPMO is mediated by the heme propionates of CDH and solvent waters. Interestingly, we find that oxygen binding to the copper center of LPMO is coupled with the long&#8208;range interprotein ET. This process, which is spin&#8208;regulated and enhanced by the presence of O  2  , directly leads to LPMO&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;O  2  &#8226;  , bypassing formation of the generally suggested LPMO&#8208;Cu(I) species. The uncovered ET mechanism rationalizes experimental observations and has far&#8208;reaching implications in LPMO catalysis, as well as the O  2  or CO binding&#8208;enhanced long&#8208;range ET processes in other metalloenzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sub&#8208;3 nm Ultrafine Cu2O for Visible Light&#8208;driven Nitrogen Fixation</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic N  2  fixation to NH  3  with water as the reducing agent represents a promising future strategy for ammonia synthesis, motivating the discovery of efficient photocatalysts that offer high sunlight utilization and catalytic efficiency to N  2  fixation. Cu  2  O, a low&#8208;cost, visible light&#8208;responsive semiconductor photocatalyst represents an ideal candidate for visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of N  2  to NH  3  from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, but remaining unexplored in this field yet. Noticeably, a majority of Cu  2  O photocatalysts synthesized to date with large lateral sizes (typically tens to hundreds of nanometers) generally suffer from severe electron&#8208;hole recombination and limited surface sites, restricting its photocatalytic activity for potential N  2  fixation. Ultrafine photocatalysts with lateral dimensions ~1&#8208;3 nm offer distinct advantages over conventional nanoparticle&#8208;based photocatalysts in this context, though the controlled synthesis of ultrafine photocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of uniformly sized and ultrafine Cu  2  O platelets with lateral size &lt; 3 nm  via  the  in&#8208;situ  topotactic reduction of a Cu(II)&#8208;containing layered double hydroxide with ascorbic acid. The supported ultrafine Cu  2  O offered excellent performance and stability for the visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of N  2  to NH  3  (the Cu  2  O&#8208;mass&#8208;normalized rate as high as 4.10 mmol gCu  2  O  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  at &#955; &gt; 400 nm), with the origin of the high activity being long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;excited electrons in trap states, an abundance of exposed active sites and the underlying support structure. This work guides the future design of ultrafine catalysts for NH  3  synthesis and other applications.</dc:description>

      <title>&#963;&#8208;Conjugation and H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly: Key Features for Efficient Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescent Organic Molecular Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic molecular crystals attracts great attention. The features of the persistent luminescence strongly depend on the electronic properties of the molecular components, mainly p&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) chromophores, and on their molecular packing in the crystal. Here, a new strategy is developed by rationally designing two isomeric molecular phosphors incorporating and combining for the first time a bridge for &#963;&#8208;conjugation between the D and A units and a structure&#8208;directing unit for H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Quantum chemical calculations highlight the critical role played by the two degrees of freedom of the s&#8208;conjugated bridge, on the chromophore optical properties. The molecular crystals exhibit RTP quantum yields up to 20% and lifetimes up to 520 ms. On the other hand, the crystal structures of the efficient phosphorescent materials establish the existence of an unprecedented well&#8208;organization of the emitters into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rectangular &#8216;columnar&#8208;like&#8217; supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding.

      <title>Spectroscopic and electrokinetic evidence for a bifunctional mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential anodic reaction in many energy storage processes. OER is most often proposed to occur via a mechanism involving four consecutive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps, which imposes a performance limit due to the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates. A bifunctional OER mechanism, in which the energetically demanding step of the attack of hydroxide on a metal oxo unit is facilitated by a hydrogen atom transfer to a second site, has the potential to circumvent the scaling relationship. However, the bifunctional mechanism has hitherto only been supported by theoretical computations. Here we describe an operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The data support two distinct mechanisms for the two catalysts: FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate&#8208;determining O&#8208;O bond forming step is the OH  &#8208;  attack on a Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a Ni  III  &#8208;O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive PCET steps. The experimental validation of the bifunctional mechanism enhances the understanding of OER catalysts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We report the one&#8208;step syntheses, X&#8208;ray structures, and spectroscopic characterization of synthetic iron clusters bearing inorganic sulfides or thiolate with interstitial carbide motifs. Treatment of historical iron&#8208;carbide&#8208;carbonyl clusters [Fe  n  (  &#956;  n  &#8208;C)(CO)  m  ]  x  (  n  = 5,6;  m  = 15,16;  x  = 0,&#8211;2) with electrophilic sulfur sources (S  2  Cl  2  , S  8  ) results in the formation of several  &#956;  4  &#8208;S &#8216;dimers of clusters&#8217; (  1  and  2  ), and moreover the iron&#8208;sulfide&#8208;(sulfocarbide) clusters  3  and  4  . The core &#8216;carbide&#8217; motif in  3  and  4  is the sulfocarbide unit {C&#8211;S}  4&#8211;  , which serves as a structural model for the proposed intermediate in the radical&#8208;SAM biogenesis of the M&#8208;cluster. Furthermore, the &#8216;electrophilic sulfur&#8217; strategy has been extended to provide the first ever thiolato&#8208;iron&#8208;carbide complex: An analogous reaction with toluylsulfenyl&#8208;chloride (tolS&#8211;Cl) affords the cluster [Fe  5  (  &#956;  5  &#8208;C)(SC  7  H  7  )(CO)  13  ]  &#8212;  (  5  ).

      <title>Acquiring High&#8208;Tc Layered Metal Halide Ferroelectrics via Cage&#8208;Confined Ethylamine Rotators</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) ferroelectrics have attracted widespread interest in the field of optoelectronics, due to the combination of excellent semiconducting and ferroelectric properties. Curie temperature (  T  c  ) below which ferroelectricity exists, is a crucial parameter for ferroelectrics. However, the lack of research on  T  c  tuning of 2D OIHP ferroelectrics hinders their further progress. Here, through incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, we obtained two 2D OIHP ferroelectrics, (IBA)  2  (EA)Pb  2  Br  7  (  2L  ; IBA =  isob  utylammonium), and (IBA)  2  (EA)  2  Pb  3  Br  10  (  3L  ). Intriguingly,  T  c  is successfully tuned from 326 K (  2L  ) to 370 K (  3L  ) with increased layer&#8208;thickness. Structural and computational analyses suggest that  the improvement of  T  c  is due to the higher phase transition energy barrier triggered by cage&#8208;confined EAs rotators with increased layer&#8208;thickness.  This work suggests that EA is an effective &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; to rationally design high&#8208;  T  c  2D OIHP ferroelectrics. In light of &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; strategy, one can expect more 2D OIHP ferroelectrics with promising performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Biomimetic Recognition and Optical Sensing of Carboxylic Acids in Water by Using a Buried Salt Bridge and the Hydrophobic Effect</title>

      <title>The Origin of Selective Adsorption of CO2 on Merlinoite Zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we describe the CO2  adsorption behavior at 25&#8208;75 &#176;C and 0&#8722;1.0 bar of various alkali cation&#8208;exchanged forms of merlinoite (framework type MER) zeolites with Si/Al = 2.3 and 3.8. The adsorption isotherms at 25 &#176;C on the Na+  , K+  , Rb+  , and Cs+  forms of MER zeolite with Si/Al = 2.3 are characterized by a clear step, the CO2  pressure of which differs notably according to the type of their extraframework cations. Structural analysis shows that CO2  adsorption on the former three zeolites includes the relocation of gating cations with high site occupancy and the remarkable concomitant structural breathing. We define this unusual adsorption phenomenon as a cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing mechanism. The overall results suggest that the actual mechanism of selective CO2  adsorption on intermediate&#8208;silica small&#8208;pore zeolites can change from cation gating to cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing to breathing, depending on a combination of their topological and compositional (framework Al content and extraframework cation type and concentration) flexibilities.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Materials with tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties have wide applications in security signs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encrypting and other fields, which have attracted great attention. However, the majority of reported tunable LPL materials are pure organic molecules or polymers. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic coordination polymers displaying color&#8208;tunable LPL were synthesized by the self&#8208;assembly of HTzPTpy ligand with different cadmium halides (X = Cl, Br, and I). In solid state, their LPL emission colors can be tuned by the time&#8208;evolution, as well as excitation and temperature variation, realizing multi&#8208;mode dynamic color tuning from green to yellow or green to red, and representing the first example in single component coordination polymer materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the modification of LPL is due to the balanced action from single molecule and aggregate triplet excited states aroused by external heavy&#8208;atom effect. The results suggest that the rational introduction of different halide anions into coordination polymers to realize multi&#8208;color LPL is promising for different domain applications, including imaging, anti&#8208;counterfeiting and security protection.</dc:description>

      <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Organic Mass Cytometry: Simultaneous Analysis of Proteins and Metabolites on Single Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Mass cytometry is attracting significant attention for its spatiotemporal high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis. As the first demonstration of simultaneous detection of single&#8208;cell proteins and untargeted metabolites, a multi&#8208;dimensional organic mass cytometry system was established by a simple microfluidic chip connected to a nanoelectrospray mass spectrometer, providing useful cell heterogeneous information. A series of mass probes with online&#8208;dissociated mass tags were developed, ensuring the semi&#8208;quantification of cell surface proteins and compatibility of endogenous metabolite detection at single&#8208;cell level. Six cell surface antigens and ~100 metabolites from three ovarian cancer cell types and two breast cancer cell types were successfully monitored, and contributed to highly sensitive and specific cell typing. Doxorubicin&#8208;resistant cancer cell analysis confirmed its applications in distinguishing rare cell phenotypes. As a new generation of mass cytometry, the proposed system is simple, extensible, and promising for cell typing, drug&#8208;resistance analysis of tumor cells, and clinical diagnosis and therapy at single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

      <title>Carboxyboronate as a Versatile in situ CO surrogate in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>The application of carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate as an in situ CO surrogate for various palladium&#8208;catalyzed transformations is described. Carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate was previously shown to be a bench&#8208;stable boron&#8208;containing building block for the synthesis of borylated heterocycles. The present study demonstrates that, in addition to its utility as a precursor to heterocycle synthesis, carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate is an excellent in situ CO surrogate that is tolerant of reactive functionalities such as amines, alcohols, and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. Its wide functional group compatibility is highlighted in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, carbonylative Sonogashira coupling, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of aryl halides. A variety of amides, esters, (hetero)aromatic ynones, and bis(hetero)aryl ketones were synthesized in good to excellent yields in a one&#8208;pot fashion.</dc:description>

      <title>Delivery of a Masked Uranium(II) by an Oxide&#8208;Bridged Diuranium(III) Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Oxide is an attractive linker for building polymetallic complexes that provide molecular models for metal oxides activity, but studies of these systems are limited to metals in high oxidation states. Herein, we synthesized and characterized the molecular and electronic structure of diuranium bridged U(III)/U(IV) and U(III)/U(III) complexes. Reactivity studies of these complexes revealed that the U&#8208;O bond is easily broken upon addition of N&#8208;heterocycles resulting in the delivery of a formal equivalent of U(III) and U(II), respectively, along with the uranium(IV) terminal&#8208;oxo coproduct. In particular, the U(III)/U(III) oxide complex effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and two&#8208;electron reduction of 4,4'&#8208;bipyridine affording unique examples of diuranium(III) complexes bridged by N&#8208;heterocyclic redox&#8208;active ligands. These results provide insight into the chemistry of low oxidation state metal oxides and demonstrate the use of oxo&#8208;bridged U(III)/U(III) complexes as a strategy to explore U(II) reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Diarylacetnitrile as a Molecular Probe for the Detection of Polymeric Mechanoradicals in the Bulk State via a Radical Chain&#8208;transfer Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>Since the beginning of the history of polymer science, understanding the influence of mechanical stress on polymer chains has been a fundamental and important research topic. The detection of mechanoradicals generated by homolytic cleavage of the polymer chains in solution has been studied in many cases. However, the detection of mechanoradicals in the bulk is still limited due to their high reactivity. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy to detect mechanoradicals visually and quantitatively using a chain&#8208;transfer agent that generates relatively stable fluorescent radicals as a molecular probe. Mechanoradicals generated by ball milling of polystyrene samples were successfully detected by using diarylacetonitrile as a fluorescent molecular probe via this radical chain&#8208;transfer mechanism. This probe enables the visualization and quantitative evaluation of mechanoradicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission.</dc:description>

Among them, double perovskites with Cs  2  AgInCl  6  composition, often doped with various elements, have been under the spotlight for their intriguing optical properties, viz., self&#8208;trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant&#8208;induced photoluminescence. This interest has sparked different synthesis approaches towards crystals and nanocrystals, also aiming at exploring many alloy compositions with various monovalent and trivalent cations other than Ag  +  and In  3+  . Hence, we offer this perspective on the recent developments on Cs  2  AgInCl  6  bulk crystals and nanocrystals and take a close look at their synthesis strategies, intrinsic optical properties and tunable photoluminescence originating from different alloying and doping effects. We also discuss progress on computational studies aiming at understanding the thermodynamic stability, the role of defects, and the origin of photoluminescence in relation to the STEs and the direct bandgap character.

      <title>Selective transformation of Nickel&#8208;bound formate to CO or C&#8208;C coupling products triggered by deprotonation and steered by alkali metal ions</title>
      <dc:description>The complexes [LtBuNi(OCO&#8209;&#954;2O,C)]M3[N(SiMe3)2]2 (M = Li, Na, K) that were synthesized by deprotonation of a nickel formate complex [LtBuNiOOCH] with the corresponding amides M[N(SiMe3)2] feature a NiII&#8208;CO22&#8208; core surrounded by Lewis acidic cations (M+), and the influence of the latter on the behavior and reactivity was studied. Structural as well as spectroscopic investigations point to a decrease of CO2 activation within the series Li, Na and K, which is also reflected in the reactivity with Me3SiOTf leading to the liberation of CO and formation of a Ni&#8208;OSiMe3 complex: the K3 complex proved to be the least reactive. Furthermore, in case of K+ the {[K3[N(SiMe3)2]2}+ shell around the Ni&#8208;CO22&#8208; entity was shown to have a large impact on its stabilization and behavior. If the number of K[N(SiMe3)2] equivalents used in the reaction with [LtBuNiOOCH] is decreased from three to half an equivalent, the deprotonated part of the precursor enters into a complex reaction sequence with formation of [LtBuNiI(&#181;&#8209;OOCH)NiILtBu]K and [LtBuNi(C2O4)NiLtBu]. The same reaction at higher concentrations additionally led to the formation of a unique hexanuclear NiII complex containing both oxalate and mesoxalate ([O2C&#8208;CO2&#8208;CO2]4&#8208;) ligands.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The complexes [LtBuNi(OCO&#8209;&#954;2O,C)]M3[N(SiMe3)2]2 (M = Li, Na, K) that were synthesized by deprotonation of a nickel formate complex [LtBuNiOOCH] with the corresponding amides M[N(SiMe3)2] feature a NiII&#8208;CO22&#8208; core surrounded by Lewis acidic cations (M+), and the influence of the latter on the behavior and reactivity was studied. Structural as well as spectroscopic investigations point to a decrease of CO2 activation within the series Li, Na and K, which is also reflected in the reactivity with Me3SiOTf leading to the liberation of CO and formation of a Ni&#8208;OSiMe3 complex: the K3 complex proved to be the least reactive. Furthermore, in case of K+ the {[K3[N(SiMe3)2]2}+ shell around the Ni&#8208;CO22&#8208; entity was shown to have a large impact on its stabilization and behavior. If the number of K[N(SiMe3)2] equivalents used in the reaction with [LtBuNiOOCH] is decreased from three to half an equivalent, the deprotonated part of the precursor enters into a complex reaction sequence with formation of [LtBuNiI(&#181;&#8209;OOCH)NiILtBu]K and [LtBuNi(C2O4)NiLtBu]. The same reaction at higher concentrations additionally led to the formation of a unique hexanuclear NiII complex containing both oxalate and mesoxalate ([O2C&#8208;CO2&#8208;CO2]4&#8208;) ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>AIEgen&#8208;Lipid Conjugate for Rapid Labeling of Neutrophils and Monitoring of Their Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>Studies on neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutic engineering have shown great potentials in treating infection and inflammation disorders. Conventional neutrophil labeling methods are time&#8208;consuming and often result in undesired contamination and activation since neutrophils are terminal&#8208;differentiated cells with a half&#8208;life span of only 7 h. A simple, fast and biocompatible strategy to construct engineered neutrophils is highly desirable but remains difficult to achieve. In this study, we present an AIEgen&#8208;lipid conjugate, which can efficiently label harvested neutrophils in 30&#8208;second with no washing step required. This fast labeling method does not affect the activation and transmigration property of neutrophils, which has been successfully used to monitor neutrophil behaviors such as the chemotaxis process and migrating function towards inflammation sites both in vitro and in vivo, offering a tantalizing prospect for neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutics studies.</dc:description>
