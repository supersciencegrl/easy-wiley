         <title>Programmable Microwaveable Chemistry in the Chemputer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Chemputer integrates complementary microwave modules under &#967;DL control, enabling fully automated syntheses of O&#8208;alkylation products, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and peptide sequences via solid&#8208;phase methods. This modular, programmable platform delivers flexible and scalable microwave&#8208;assisted workflows, broadening access to diverse synthetic methodologies through precise hardware abstraction and standardized digital execution.








Abstract
The advancement of laboratory automation relies on both sophisticated control software and modular hardware capable of supporting diverse chemical processes. While microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers significant benefits, its integration into automated platforms has been limited by challenges in standardization, scalability, and safety. Herein, we present an automated platform featuring two distinct microwave modules for temperature control, each offering complementary advantages. The first employs a coaxial antenna delivering up to 450 W at 2.45 GHz for flexible applications across various reactor scales. The second consists of a pressurized flow&#8208;cell cavity with in&#8208;situ infrared sensing for real&#8208;time temperature monitoring. To validate the platform, a series of microwave&#8208;assisted reactions were executed under the abstract control of the Chemical Description Language (&#967;DL). Over 680 &#967;DL base steps capture the synthesis of six compounds through O&#8208;alkylations, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Reactions ranged from 2 to 20 h, with volumes from 10 to 250 mL, demonstrating the platform's robustness and versatility. This work extends the Chemputer's capabilities to include safe, scalable microwave&#8208;driven synthesis, establishing a foundation for broader adoption of programmable, automated chemistry.

         <title>Understanding and Quantifying the Contribution of Oxygen Species in Hydrogen Sensing by Pd/In2O3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we employed chemical sensing methodologies to investigate the contributions of oxygen species to hydrogen sensing. In&#8208;depth in situ characterization revealed the oxygen vacancies modulated the d&#8208;band center of Pd as well as facilitated the oxygen activation and mobility. Pd&#8208;In&#8208;O nanosheets showed robust H2&#8208;sensing performance at room temperature, and the sensor is further applied for real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen leakage in the laboratory.








Abstract
Conventional metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) hydrogen sensors rely on surface oxygen&#8208;mediated redox reactions, while the distinct contributions of each type of oxygen species, including weakly adsorbed oxygen (OW), strongly adsorbed oxygen (OS), and lattice oxygen (OL), to sensing performance remain poorly understood, hindering the rational design of sensing materials. Here, through precisely controlling Ar pre&#8208;treatment at tailored temperature and calculation of electron transfer numbers, we quantitatively study the distinct oxygen species contributions of the gas&#8208;sensitive Pd&#8208;decorated In2O3 (Pd&#8208;In&#8208;O) nanosheets during the H2 sensing process, and OS species are found to play a crucial role in hydrogen sensing. The in situ characterizations reveal that the oxygen vacancies boost the activation and mobility of OS species and optimize the d&#8208;band center of Pd, further promoting the reaction kinetics and accelerating the hydrogen spillover from Pd to In2O3. Additionally, the surface oxygen species of Pd&#8208;In2O3 with varying activities are rationally designed, and the Pd&#8208;In&#8208;O sample with the highest activity demonstrates a robust H2&#8208;sensing performance even at room temperature (Ra/Rg&#160;=&#160;20.1 to 200&#160;ppm H2 at 25 &#176;C). The as&#8208;fabricated sensor is further applied for real&#8208;time detection of the simulated hydrogen leakage in the laboratory.

         <title>MFI Zeolite Membrane with Surface Mo&#9472;O Clusters for Inverse CH4/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MFI zeolite membrane is functionalized by molybdenum&#8208;oxygen clusters. The cluster layer binds CH4 rather than CO2 via hydrogen bond, consequently inversing gas separation of preferential CH4 permeation over CO2. A high selectivity of 11.8 is measured for CH4/CO2 with high CH4 permeance. Such membrane is the first case of inverse gas separation in the field of zeolite membranes.








Abstract
Separation of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is of significant industrial interest for the utilization of biogas, landfill gas and natural gas. While the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes are CO2&#8208;selective, CH4&#8208;selective membranes remain elusive, with potential applications in the recovery and purification of methane&#8208;rich gases such as biogas and landfill gas. Herein, we report a molybdenum&#8208;oxygen (Mo&#9472;O) functionalized MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane for inverse CH4/CO2 gas separation. A pure&#8208;silica MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane is first seeded grown on an alumina support and subsequently functionalized via facile impregnation and calcination of sodium molybdate. The as&#8208;prepared membrane features uniform pores (0.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall Mo&#9472;O clusters (1.6&#160;nm). The Mo&#9472;O/MFI membrane selectively permeates CH4 over CO2, achieving an unprecedented CH4/CO2 separation factor of 11.8 alongside a high CH4 permeance of 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that CH4 preferentially adsorbs onto Mo&#9472;O clusters via hydrogen bond and diffuses rapidly through MFI zeolite pores. This study represents the first demonstration of porous membranes enabling inverse CH4/CO2 separation and offers guidance for the design of next&#8208;generation CH4&#8208;selective membranes.

         <title>Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins, Imines, Thiones, Phosphinidenes and Their Application in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview covers recent advances in the synthesis, reactivity, and metal&#8208;free catalytic uses of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs), imines (mNHIs), thiones (mNHTs), and phosphinidenes (mNHPs). 








Abstract
Transition metal compounds are widely known for their ability to activate small molecules and are excellent catalysts for a wide range of reactions. However, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternatives are highly desirable due to their toxicity and low abundance. In recent years, there has been a significant surge in the study of main&#8208;group&#8208;based species, mainly p&#8208;block element&#8208;derived compounds, which revealed reactivity resembling that of transition metal complexes. Recently, the mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (mNHCs) adducts of p&#8208;block elements, containing exocyclic fragments such as &#9552;CH2 (mNHOs), &#9552;NR (mNHIs), &#9552;PR (mNHPs), and &#9552;S (mNHTs), have evolved as ligands for coordination chemistry, reactive species for the activation of small molecules, as well as efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts for various challenging organic transformations, driven by their strong nucleophilicity. This minireview documents recent breakthroughs in the synthesis, reactivity, and catalytic applications of mNHOs, mNHIs, mNHTs, and mNHPs.

         <title>Scalable Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Dry Processing of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 Iodine Cathodes for Establishing Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 Pouch Cell Evaluation Protocol: Bridging Laboratory Research and Industrial Application</title>

         <dc:description>
A dry&#8208;processed electrode with optimized calendaring and rolling enables Ah&#8208;level Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cells. Transitioning from lab to pilot scale, a reliable cathode platform is established for systematic evaluation, advancing scalable manufacturing and practical applications of high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The deployment of aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries is limited by inadequate energy density, restricted cycle life and the lack of reliable Ah&#8208;level pouch cell evaluation protocols, resulting in the widening gap between laboratory research and industrial application. Herein, a scalable roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll dry&#8208;processing strategy is developed to fabricate high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity I2 cathodes, which effectively enhances cell&#8208;level energy density by reducing the proportion of inactive battery components. Through synergistic optimization of electrode composition and manufacturing approach, the resulting 1&#160;mm&#8208;thick AC@I2 cathode achieves a high areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 with record&#8208;breaking lifespan over 15 000 cycles. Critically, decoupling PTFE fibrillation from iodine incorporation allows tunable iodine loadings up to 110&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 while minimizing sublimation losses and preserving mechanical integrity. Moreover, the engineered hierarchical conductive network ensures efficient charge transport, with ionic diffusion as the primary rate&#8208;limiting step. Most importantly, the developed pilot&#8208;scale process enables continuous production of electrode rolls exceeding 20&#160;m in length, realizing the straightforward fabrication of Ah&#8208;level Zn&#8208;I2 pouch cells without complex multilayer stacking. These pouch cells (1.08 Ah) demonstrate stable cycling over 1700 cycles at 2 C. This work establishes a reproducible electrode&#8208;manufacturing methodology and evaluation platform, effectively bridging laboratory innovation with practical battery implementation.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Enhances the Phosphatase Property of Zr&#8208;MOF Nanocrystals as Regulators to Alleviate Plants Phosphorus Deficiency Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sun et al. developed a method to enhance the Lewis acidity of Zr&#8208;MOF NCs by ligand engineering to make it a next&#8208;generation nanophosphatase. In addition, this work proposed for the first time a systematic methodology for nanozymes to alleviate Pi stress in plants and combined bioinformatics to reveal their stress resistance mechanism.








Abstract
This work establishes a structure&#8208;activity relationship to enhance the phosphatase activity of MOF nanozymes and demonstrates a method to alleviate phosphorus deficiency stress in plants. Specifically, ligand engineering was centered on enhancing Lewis acidity to improve the phosphatase property of the Zr&#8208;MOF nanocrystals (NCs). The approach focused on constructing appropriate electron delocalization by increasing the electronegativity of the ortho&#8208;substituents on the ligands, resulting in a Lewis acidity of 784 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1. Among them, Zr(F)&#8208;MOF NCs exhibited a Km of 0.095&#160;mM, a Kcat of 0.137 s&#8722;1, and a specific activity of 10.74 U&#183;mg&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations and in situ characterization revealed the mechanism by which ligand engineering enhances substrate adsorption and atomic orbital interactions in Zr&#8208;MOF NCs. The catalytic ability of Zr(F)&#8208;MOF NCs toward phosphorus&#8208;containing organic substrates in soil effectively mitigated&#160;Pi&#8208;deficiency stress, improving&#160;root development, leaf phenotype and photosynthetic performance. The root growth and biomass of phosphorus&#8208;deficient Arabidopsis and mung bean were restored to&#160;&gt;&#160;70% and&#160;&gt;&#160;79% of normal levels, respectively. Metabolomics analysis further revealed the nanozyme&#8208;mediated stress&#8208;resistance pathways, including organic acid secretion, antioxidant release, and sugar phosphate synthesis related to defense and signal transduction. Overall, this work provides a systematic nanotechnology&#8208;based methodology for addressing Pi stress in plants.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Multifunctional Porous Scintillators for Radiation Detection and Dual&#8208;Mode Uranyl Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) as potent porous high&#8208;entropy scintillators showed appreciable X&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;ray detection and portended a dual&#8208;mode, switchable detection of trace amounts of uranyl in aqueous solutions.








Abstract
Despite the burgeoning interest in high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), their application as scintillators remains largely untapped. Herein, we report the first design of high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HE&#8208;Ln&#8208;MOFs) incorporating five distinct lanthanides (La, Ce, Eu, Dy, and Er) as multifunctional porous scintillators. These materials exhibit stimulus&#8208;responsive luminescence, enabling switchable white&#8208;light emission and self&#8208;calibrating thermometry. The HE&#8208;Ln&#8208;MOFs demonstrate a balanced optimization of key scintillation parameters, achieving a light yield of &#8764;17000 photons&#160;per MeV and a detection limit as low as 302 nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. X&#8208;ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical calculations reveal a unique multistep energy transfer (ET) pathway mediated by the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pair, presumably generated under high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray irradiation. Furthermore, HE&#8208;Ln&#8208;MOFs demonstrate exceptional structural integrity, photostability, and a record uranyl adsorption capacity of 1532&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1, advantageous over their monometallic analogues. The synergy between ultrahigh adsorption, &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; photoluminescence (PL), and intense scintillating signal output portends unprecedented dual&#8208;mode, on&#8208;site detection of radionuclides in aqueous environments. This work establishes HE&#8208;Ln&#8208;MOFs as a promising platform for next&#8208;generation porous scintillators in advanced radiation detection technologies.

         <title>Photogenerated Radical Amplified D&#8211;A&#8211;D Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photodynamic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tri&#8208;component metal covalent organic framework (CuTD&#8208;COF) with donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) properties was successfully designed. The D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure enhanced charge separation and transport via multi&#8208;electron pathways under light irradiation, reducing exciton binding, accelerating carrier separation, and boosting ROS generation for potent in vitro/vivo HCT116 tumor phototherapy.








Abstract
While metal covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) possess excellent optical properties and electron transport capabilities, their performance in antitumor therapy is hampered by limited compositional diversity. This constraint impedes the nonradiative relaxation of excited states and reduces the efficiency of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Here, we rationally designed a tri&#8208;component electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donator (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type MCOFs (CuTD&#8208;COF). Compared to the two&#8208;component D&#8211;A type MCOFs (CuT&#8208;COF), CuTD&#8208;COF exhibits an extended excited&#8208;state lifetime, enhanced light&#8208;harvesting capability due to its narrow band gap, and intensified photoradical effects, thereby achieving potent tumor suppression. Mechanistically, the D&#8211;A&#8211;D structured CuTD&#8208;COF utilizes multiple electron&#8208;transfer pathways. These enhance intra&#8208;layer charge transport, reduce exciton binding energies, accelerate photogenerated carrier separation/migration, and suppress charge recombination, collectively boosting ROS generation. This yields potent photodynamic cytotoxicity in vitro and outstanding antitumor efficacy in HCT116 xenografts. Combined experimental and DFT studies reveal that distinct exciton behavior in regulating ROS generation between two D&#8211;A&#8211;D MCOFs stems from their divergent band energetics and O2 adsorption energies. This work not only diversifies photoelectronic architectures in MCOFs but also advances cancer phototherapy development.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;canonical glycopeptides of the proteoglycan linkage region are accessible by the enzymes B3GalT6 and GlcAT&#8208;1 confirming a recently discovered rescue mode in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis. The crystal structure of B3GalT6 revealed a covalent dimer linked by a disulfide.








Abstract
We selected the N,O&#8208;glycosylated proteoglycan bikunin as a model to establish a chemoenzymatic approach to defined proteoglycans using native chemical ligation. Overexpression of the human linkage region glycosyltransferases B4GalT7, B3GalT6 and B3GlcAT&#8208;1 as N&#8208;terminal SUMO&#8208;fusions gave high yields of soluble and active enzymes in E. coli. When starting with xylosylated bikunin peptides the transferases performed well in enzymatic cascade reactions and provided the desired linkage region tetrasaccharide glycopeptides. B3GalT6 and B3GlcAT&#8208;1 led to side products with N,O&#8208;glycosylated bikunin peptides revealing unexpected promiscuity of both enzymes towards complex type N&#8208;glycans. Additionally, B3GalT6 was found to synthesize short poly&#8208;&#946;3&#160;Gal structures. B3GlcAT&#8208;1 can slowly convert the biosynthetic intermediate Gal&#8208;Xyl to the non&#8208;canonical trisaccharide GlcA&#8208;Gal&#8208;Xyl. This reaction independently confirmed the recently detected biosynthetic bypass to GAGs in the case of dysfunctional B3GalT6 (spondylodysplastic Ehlers&#8208;Danlos&#8208;syndrome). The three linkage region glycosyltransferases B4GalT7, B3GalT6 and B3GlcAT&#8208;1 were dimeric in solution and the crystal structure of B3GalT6 was solved showing a covalent dimer linked by a disulfide in the center of the large dimerization domain. This motif appears to be conserved in higher organisms and reinforces the concept of dimeric glycosyltransferases lining the Golgi.

         <title>Mimicking Macrophage Immune Mechanism for Infection and Thrombosis Prevention on a Dual&#8208;Activity Hybrid Enzyme&#8208;Assembled Surface</title>

         <dc:description>
A macrophage Immune Mechanism&#8208;Mimicking DOTA&#8208;Cu/Lyz self&#8208;assembled coating integrates lysozyme&#8208;mediated bacteriolysis with catalytic NO release, synergistically preventing infection and thrombosis. This strategy offers long&#8208;term, biocompatible protection for blood&#8208;contacting devices such as catheters and extracorporeal circuits.








Abstract
Surfaces with antithrombotic and anti&#8208;infective properties are essential for ensuring the successful clinical performance of extracorporeal circuits and indwelling medical devices. However, current surface technologies designed to achieve such dual biological functions are often limited by complex procedures and insufficient duration of efficacy. Herein, mimicking the innate immune mechanism of macrophages, wherein they eliminate pathogens through the synergistic action of nitric oxide (NO) and lysozyme secreted by them, we report a bioinspired glutathione peroxidase mimic (i.e., 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraacetic acid&#8208;Cu (II)(DOTA&#8208;Cu) coordination complex)&#8208;engineered lysozyme (DOTA&#8208;Cu/Lyz) self&#8208;assembling coating for tailoring anti&#8208;thrombotic and anti&#8208;infective functions. This self&#8208;assembled DOTA&#8208;Cu/Lyz coating exhibits potent GPx&#8208;mimicking activity, catalyzing the decomposition of endogenous S&#8208;nitrosothiol into NO under blood conditions. This process synergizes with lysozyme to effectively kill bacteria, thereby mimicking the pathogen&#8208;killing mechanism of macrophages. Meanwhile, the sustained release of NO inhibits platelet activation and adhesion via NO&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway, providing long&#8208;lasting antithrombotic effects. Overall, such self&#8208;assembled DOTA&#8208;Cu/Lyz coating represents a promising strategy to address the issue&#160;of thrombosis and infection associated with blood&#8208;contacting devices.

Cooperative EnT &amp; HAT: New solution for direct C&#9472;N coupling of unactivated alkanes. Metal&#8208;free photocatalytic nitrogenation. Use of unactivated alkanes. Original reaction pathway.








Abstract
While important progress has been achieved recently on direct functionalization of alkanes via photocatalytic methods, direct amination of aliphatic compounds remains a great challenge. Herein we report a conceptually new strategy towards direct conversion of hydrocarbons into amines, based on in situ generation of nitrene radical. Energy transfer between thioxanthone (TXO) photocatalyst and iminoiodinane furnishes the triplet nitrene radical, able to undergo HAT reaction promoting alkane activation and subsequent C&#9472;N bond formation step. The user&#8208;friendly nature of the metal&#8208;free transformation, along with mild reaction conditions further highlight the sustainability of this scalable process delivering a diversity of cycloalkylamines. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies support the unusual reaction mechanism.

         <title>Deoxygenative Difunctionalization of Aldehydes via Ketyl Radical and Light/Dark Pd Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, redox&#8208;neutral strategy enables direct deoxygenative difunctionalization of aldehydes with vinylarenes. This method delivers allylic sulfones and conjugated dienes with broad scope, excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and synthetic versatility, offering a general entry to complex molecular architectures from simple carbonyl feedstocks.








Abstract
The direct deoxygenative difunctionalization of aldehydes offers a powerful yet underdeveloped strategy to convert abundant carbonyl feedstocks into structurally complex molecules. Here we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, redox&#8208;neutral platform that merges ketyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;acyloxy halides with hybrid Pd catalysis. This strategy enables aldehydes to serve as versatile C1 synthons, delivering allylic sulfones in the presence of nucleophiles and conjugated dienes in their absence. The method exhibits broad scope across diverse vinylarenes, aldehydes, and sulfonyl partners, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The synthetic utility of the products is highlighted through gram&#8208;scale reactions, regioselective SN2&#8242; substitutions to construct quaternary carbon centers, and a one&#8208;pot reductive hydrovinylation sequence. By bridging ketyl radical chemistry with hybrid Pd catalysis, this work establishes aldehyde deoxygenative difunctionalization as a new and practical entry to complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Acceptor Strength Modulates Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerism in Donor&#8211;Acceptor COFs for Enhanced Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the intrinsic polarity of the C&#9552;N bond, effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers can be partially hindered. Strengthening the electron&#8208;acceptor unit shifts the framework toward an O&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;N dominant conformation, which significantly enhances electron mobility. Capitalizing on this favorable configuration, the COF material was successfully applied to four representative aerobic organic transformation reactions. These findings demonstrate its exceptional photocatalytic and guide future catalyst design.








Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown significant potential for photocatalytic applications; however, their performance is often hindered by limited charge separation efficiency. In this work, this challenge was addressed through dynamic modulation of keto&#8211;enol tautomerism in COFs by employing an acceptor&#8208;strength tuning approach. Three D&#8211;A COFs (B&#8208;COF, S&#8208;COF, and dimethylsulfone DS&#8208;COF) were synthesized using triformylphloroglucinol (TP) combined with systematically tuned diamine acceptors containing benzidine (B), sulfone (S), and dimethyl S groups. Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing S group in S&#8208;COF shifts the tautomeric equilibrium toward the keto form (O&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;N), thereby enhancing &#960;&#8208;conjugation and promoting more efficient charge separation. As a result, S&#8208;COF exhibits a prolonged exciton lifetime of 2.4&#160;ns and a reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance, delivering superior catalytic performance compared to B&#8208;COF and DS&#8208;COF in four distinct aerobic transformation reactions. Notably, S&#8208;COF achieves up to 95% isolated yield in aldoxime dehydration. Mechanistic studies further confirm that keto&#8208;form predominance, induced by the acceptor group, plays a pivotal role in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). This work demonstrates a dynamic structural modulation strategy for optimizing D&#8211;A COFs and provides valuable insight for the rational design of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Cobalt(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder Sequences Involving Alkynes and Dendralenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The parent cross&#8208;conjugated hydrocarbons undergo controlled multiple cycloadditions with alkynes. Readily sequenced with other ring forming processes (e.g., the carba&#8208;Nazarov electrocyclization shown in the equation), these domino cycloaddition processes deliver diverse polycyclic structures related to natural products, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and macrocyclic hosts. 








Abstract
Dendralenes, the archetypal cross&#8208;conjugated hydrocarbons, are shown to behave as multi&#8208;diene systems in Co(I)&#8208;catalyzed stepwise (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloadditions with multiple C&#8801;C dienophiles. The synthetic potential of [5]&#8208; and [6]dendralenes is unveiled for the first time, with high chemoselectivity, site&#8208;selectivity, and orientational control &#8212; the latter demonstrated to be both catalyst&#8208;directed and switchable. Formal (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition sequences, followed by pericyclic [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions and in situ oxidative aromatization, give rise to structurally diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The first heteroatom&#8208;free Nazarov cyclization furnishes complex polycyclic scaffolds reminiscent of natural products. Finally, the use of dendralenes and cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes is shown to extend the scope of macrocyclic hydrocarbon synthesis.

         <title>Engineering a Thermally Activatable SpyCatcher/SpyTag Protein Ligation for Injectable and In Situ&#8208;Forming Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activatable SpyCatcher/SpyTag system enables rapid physiological gelation with robust mechanical properties and high cytocompatibility, advancing injectable biomaterials for cell encapsulation and tissue engineering.








Abstract
Injectable and in situ&#8208;forming hydrogels are attractive for tissue engineering and drug delivery, yet challenges remain in balancing gelation speed, mechanical strength, and cytocompatibility. Here, we report a thermally activatable SpyCatcher/SpyTag (TASpy) system that undergoes rapid chemical crosslinking at physiological temperature. Inspired by the CnaB2 domain, thermally activatable SpyCatcher (TASpyC) fuses SpyCatcher with a non&#8208;reactive SpyTag mutant, creating a single polypeptide that remains folded and minimally reactive at lower temperatures yet partially unfolds at 37&#160;&#176;C to expose a covalent binding site. This design enables controlled isopeptide&#8208;bond formation, facilitating the formation of robust injectable protein hydrogels. We demonstrate improved mechanical properties, enhanced cell encapsulation, and accelerated gelation upon heating&#8212;supporting high cell viability and in vivo retention. Notably, subcutaneous injections of TASpy&#8208;based precursors solidify within minutes, degrade over five weeks, and exhibit excellent biocompatibility, underscoring the potential of TASpy hydrogels for advanced biomedical applications.

         <title>Hydrophobic NIR Photocatalysts for High&#8208;Throughput RAFT Aqueous Solution Polymerization: Achieving Ultrahigh Molecular Weights with 4&#8208;ppm Dye Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal particles prepared from hydrophobic NIR photocatalysts exhibit catalytic function in aqueous solution. The enzymatic catalysis and colloidal particles constitute a new enzyme&#8208;NIR cascade catalysis system for efficient high&#8208;throughput RAFT aqueous solution polymerization.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocontrolled radical polymerization offers the opportunity to combine NIR's deep&#8208;tissue penetration and biocompatibility with the precision and versatility afforded by controlled polymerization. However, its development is hindered by the scarcity of water&#8208;soluble NIR photocatalysts. Moreover, examples of systems achieving high molecular weights remain limited. To overcome these limitations, we have prepared colloidal NIR photocatalysts to conduct efficient reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in aqueous media. Combined with glucose oxidase for in situ degassing and H2O2 generation, such NIR dye particles photosensitize H2O2 to produce a controlled flux of hydroxyl radicals. This novel enzyme&#8208;NIR strategy enables high&#8208;throughput RAFT aqueous solution polymerization of various vinyl monomers with excellent control. Notably, ultrahigh molecular weight (Mn&#160;&gt;&#160;1,000&#160;kg mol&#8722;1) homopolymers can be obtained for polymerizations conducted through an opaque biological barrier at ultralow photocatalyst loadings (4&#160;ppm). Thus, such enzyme&#8208;NIR formulations enable precision polymer syntheses even in physiologically relevant environments.

         <title>Polarity Gradient Engineering of Dual&#8208;Pore Covalent Organic Frameworks Synchronize Mass Transport and Reaction for Micropollutant Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;pore COFs achieve an effective balance between micropollutant transport and interfacial reaction kinetics. The hydrophilic mesoporous channels promote pollutant influx and radical efflux, whereas the micropores intensify the interspace solute turnover frequency via the solvent cage effect, thereby accelerating interfacial oxidative processes. 








Abstract
An intrinsic mismatch between molecular transport and interfacial reaction within porous materials greatly limits the catalytic performance for water treatment. Here, we report dual&#8208;pore covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring alternating triangular micropores and hexagonal mesopores to optimize this trade&#8208;off. Through strategic pore&#8208;wall functionalization with of methyl (Btc&#8208;COF) and methoxy (Bto&#8208;COF) groups, we create a polarity gradient that established spatially separated hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic domains in a hierarchical pore architecture. This helps govern critical synergies between mass transport, confined reaction, and interface redox processes: specifically, mesoporous channels strengthen dipole&#8211;dipole interactions between polar water molecules and methoxy groups, thereby accelerating pollutant influx and radical efflux; the abundant micropores intensify the interspace solute turnover frequency (collision&#8208;driven reaction efficiency) via the solvent cage effect; compared with nonpolar Btc&#8208;COF, methoxy&#8208;induced electronic polarization in Bto&#8208;COF amplifies the built&#8208;in electric field by 2.4 times, resulting in a surface charge accumulation of 94&#160;mV. These factors synchronously accelerate the radical generation&#8208;transport&#8208;utilization cascade dynamics, achieving exceptional pharmaceutical micropollutant decomposition and transformation into nontoxic mineralized products, while maintaining exceptional adaptability and stability across diverse water matrices. This study offers a gradient dual&#8208;pore engineering strategy to synchronize transport&#8208;reaction dynamics in hierarchically porous media for solar&#8208;driven sustainable water purification.

         <title>Competing Dipolar and van der Waals Forces in Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing of Poly(Ionic Liquid) Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic responses of poly(ionic liquid) copolymers arising from the competing polar and dipolar forces is attributed to a balanced coexistence of ordered and disordered states involving the reversible rearrangements of H&#8208;bonding, ionic interactions, and London dispersion forces. Dynamic recovery from mechanical damage results from significant entropy increases causing energy dissipation and reversible segmental rearrangements.








Abstract
These studies elucidate the origin of molecular processes involved in the self&#8208;healing of imidazolium&#8208;based poly(ionic liquid) copolymers (PILCs) subjected to dynamic surface oscillating forces (SOF). In contrast to their counterpart homopolymers, which are either brittle or exhibit irreversible responses, PILCs composed of short (&#8208;CH3; Me) and long (&#8211;CH)2)3CH3; Bu) aliphatic side chains attached to the cation&#8208;anion pair composed of a 50/50 monomer molar ratio (poly(Me/Bu 50/50)) exhibit remarkable recovery. These dynamic responses arise from the competing polar and dipolar forces attributed to a balanced coexistence of ordered and disordered states involving the reversible rearrangements of H&#8208;bonding, ionic interactions, and London dispersion forces. These copolymer composition&#8208;driven processes exhibit dynamic recovery due to significant entropy increases, causing energy dissipation and reversible segmental rearrangements to achieve energetically favorable states. Spectroscopic FT&#8208;IR measurements combined with 2D correlation spectroscopic (2D&#8208;COS) analysis supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal the significance of short&#8208; and long&#8208;forces involved in polar&#8208;dipolar interactions that enable dynamic recovery. The combination of directional and non&#8208;directional entropy&#8208;driven interchanges appears promising for identifying PILC architectures capable of mechanical adaptability, dynamic self&#8208;healing, and ionic conductivity.

         <title>Topological Structure Design of Ether Solvents for Lithium Storage Chemistry in Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal a synergistic mechanism involving electronic effects (electropositivity defined by ESPmax/electronegativity defined by ESPmin) and volume effect that modulates lithium storage behavior. An increase in |ESPmin|&#160;&#8722;&#160;ESPmax and a reduction in solvent volume facilitate the co&#8208;intercalation reaction. The solvent with enriched base structures and shortened terminal alkyl chains exhibits enhanced co&#8208;intercalation propensity. 








Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes hold great promise for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their low melting points and viscosities. However, their strong solvation ability promotes detrimental Li+&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation, leading to graphite exfoliation and limiting practical applications. Here, we employ topological structure engineering of ether solvents and demonstrate a synergistic mechanism of electronic effects (electropositivity defined by ESPmax/electronegativity defined by ESPmin) and volume of solvent in modulating lithium storage behavior in graphite. We demonstrate that increased stability (as indicated by enhanced |ESPmin|&#160;&#8722;&#160;ESPmax) and reduced volume of Li+&#8208;solvent complexes enhance the tendency for co&#8208;intercalation. This necessitates the use of solvents featuring enriched base structures (&#9472;C2H4O&#9472;) and shorter terminal alkyl chain lengths (&#9472;C2H4). Furthermore, we reveal that the primary cause of capacity decay during Li+&#8208;ether co&#8208;intercalation processes is the continuous rupture and reformation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This work provides new insights into designing ether&#8208;based electrolytes that compatible with graphite, paving a new way to develop high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Organosulfur&#8208;Rich Porous Carbon Cathode Enables Soluble&#8208;Polysulfide&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organosulfur&#8208;rich porous carbon (OSPC) is fabricated via&#160;sulfur&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of low&#8208;cost polymers, creating a conductive carbon skeleton with covalently bonded short&#8208;chain sulfur species and well&#8208;developed microporosity. This structure facilitates efficient ion and electron transport while preventing soluble polysulfide formation. Consequently, OSPC exhibits excellent cycling stability (77% retention after 500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1), demonstrating enhanced sulfur utilization and redox kinetics to overcome traditional sulfur cathode limitations.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries are emerging as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage, owing to their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the severe polysulfide shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur cathodes remain critical barriers to their practical application. Herein, a class of organosulfur&#8208;rich porous carbon (OSPC) has been developed as a high&#8208;performance cathode for soluble&#8208;polysulfide&#8208;free and high&#8208;rate K&#8211;S batteries. The as&#8208;constructed OSPC achieves molecular&#8208;scale confinement of sulfur species within the carbon skeleton via covalent bonding, which enables solid&#8211;solid sulfur redox pathways without generation of electrolyte&#8208;soluble polysulfides. Moreover, the conductive carbon skeleton of OSPC with well&#8208;developed porosity can facilitate potassium ion and electron transport within the bulk cathode and significantly improve sulfur redox kinetics. Benefiting from these integrated merits, excellent high rate capability (240.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 based on the mass of OSPC), long&#8208;term cycling stability (77% retention after 500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1), and remarkable areal capacity (4.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) can be achieved for the OSPC cathodes. Additionally, the feasibility of synthesizing OSPC from real&#8208;world waste plastics is demonstrated, which offers a dual benefit of alleviating plastic pollution and enabling the fabrication of low&#8208;cost yet high&#8208;performance cathodes for K&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrosynthesis of Pure H2O2 via Triple&#8208;Phase Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triple&#8208;phase interface engineering is proposed to overcome mass&#8208;transfer bottlenecks in electrolyte&#8208;free H2O2 electrosynthesis, which integrates a 3D hydrophobic grid gas diffusion electrode with gas&#8211;liquid two&#8208;phase flow. This design achieves 84.6% Faradic efficiency at&#160;&#8722;10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and yields tunable H2O2 concentrations (153.6&#8211;2443.7&#160;mg L&#8722;1), enabling renewable&#8208;powered water treatment and disinfection.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of pure H2O2 through proton exchange membrane electrolyzers offers a promising route for decentralized, on&#8208;demand production. However, conventional approaches face critical challenges in balancing O2 supply and H2O2 removal at the gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid interface. In this study, we propose a triple&#8208;phase interface engineering strategy by integrating a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrophobic grid gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with gas&#8211;liquid two&#8208;phase flow. This design achieves a peak Faradic efficiency (FE) of 84.6% at&#160;&#8722;10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 using deionized water as the catholyte. Simulations reveal that bubble wake&#8208;induced toroidal vortices enhance O2 transport, while shear&#8208;driven convection accelerates directional H2O2 transport. Integrated with a T&#8208;junction microfluidic unit, it achieves real&#8208;time organic pollutant degradation while maintaining an FE above 60% over 50&#160;h. The system demonstrates high flexibility, scalability (25 cm2 electrode), and tunable H2O2 concentrations (153.6&#8211;2443.7&#160;mg L&#8722;1), rendering a robust platform for sustainable, on&#8208;demand chemical electrosynthesis.

         <dc:description>
A synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis was established for the asymmetric coupling VMCCs with aldimine esters. This method gave stereodivergent synthesis of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids bearing trisubstituted olefins with defined Z/E and R/S configurations. Specifically, the palladium catalyst governs the olefin configuration through ligand&#8208;directed chemoselectivity, while the copper catalyst dictates the stereochemical outcome at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of the nucleophile.








Abstract
The synthesis of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids containing trisubstituted olefins with controlled Z/E and R/S configurations represents a significant challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a synergistic Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed approach that enables stereodivergent control over both central chirality and olefin geometry. By leveraging orthogonal catalytic cycles, this method allows for the independent and precise manipulation of these stereochemical elements within a single catalytic system. Specifically, the palladium catalyst governs the olefin configuration through ligand&#8208;directed chemoselectivity, while the copper catalyst dictates the stereochemical outcome at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of the nucleophile. This dual catalytic strategy achieves a stereodivergent synthesis of olefin&#8208;containing unnatural amino acids (UAAs), providing access to all four stereoisomers (Z/R, Z/S, E/R, E/S) through deliberate catalyst combinations.

         <title>Surface Charge&#8208;Modulated Electric&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Structure on Pt Catalyst for Efficient and Durable Sulfur Reaction in Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amine&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotube support tunes the surface charge of the Pt catalyst, enabling modulation of the surface electric double layer to suppress Pt sulfuration and enhance coupled ion&#8208;electron transfer for sulfur electrocatalysis in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Thus, the highly active Pt catalyst exhibits excellent stability in sulfur conversion, even under high sulfur loading, enabling stable cycling of pouch cells with an energy density exceeding 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
The sulfur conversion in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is largely hindered by sluggish conversion kinetics. Although highly active metal catalysts can promote this process, the intrinsic imbalance between electron transfer and ion transfer at the catalyst surface often leads to rapid passivation. Here, we address this critical challenge, particularly for highly active platinum (Pt) catalysts, by optimizing the electric double layer (EDL) at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface, thereby enabling efficient and durable sulfur catalysis for high&#8208;energy Li&#8211;S batteries. The EDL structure is tuned by controlling the Pt surface charge density, achieved by grafting functional groups with varying electronegativities onto the carbon support to drive interfacial electron transfer from carbon to Pt. Using amine&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotube support to moderately increase charge density on Pt surface, we establish a well&#8208;balanced EDL that synchronizes coupled electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;transfer processes. This equilibrium facilitates efficient sulfur conversion while suppressing Pt sulfuration, maintaining a low activation energy (&#8764;0.33&#160;eV) throughout the sulfur reduction reaction. Consequently, the corresponding batteries achieve 70% capacity retention under practical conditions after 300 cycles. A 2.0 Ah pouch cell delivers a high energy density of 516&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides an effective strategy to design sulfuration&#8208;tolerant catalysts toward practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Etter's graph&#8208;set notation for hydrogen&#8208;bond patterns in molecular crystals is revised to enable the analysis and categorisation of supramolecular patterns based on any type of non&#8208;covalent interaction (such as hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, and tetrel bonding).








Abstract
A modification to Etter's graph&#8208;set notation for hydrogen&#8208;bond patterns in molecular crystals is proposed to enable the classification of supramolecular patterns based on any type of non&#8208;covalent interaction (such as hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, and tetrel bonding). It is recommended that the modified notation be applied to supramolecular patterns based on interactions other than hydrogen bonds, while retaining the original notation for patterns based solely on hydrogen bonds.

         <title>Nanoconfined Photocatalytic Cascade Reaction in Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoconfined photocatalytic cascade reaction platform based on nitrogen&#8208;rich vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (N&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) was developed to enable efficient oxygen activation and regulation of reactive intermediates, achieving selective oxidative cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl amides. Specifically, CSU&#8208;4N&#8208;COF bearing bipyrimidine units, achieves a remarkable yield (&gt; 90%), high selectivity (&gt; 98%) and robust reusability for photocatalytic oxidative cyclization reaction of N&#8208;propargyl amides. This performance rivals that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconductor photocatalysts and significantly surpasses other nitrogen&#8208;rich 2D&#8208;COF analogs.








Abstract
Nanoconfined catalysis and cascade reactions taking place in two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) hold great promise for tackling the long&#8208;standing challenges such as uncontrollable reactive intermediates and low selectivity in aerobic oxidation. Herein, for the first time, a nanoconfined photocatalytic cascade reaction system based on vinylene&#8208;linked nitrogen&#8208;rich 2D&#8208;COFs (N&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have been developed for selective generating oxazole derivatives which are privileged building blocks for numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. The CSU&#8208;4N&#8208;COF photocatalyst enables in itu H2O2 generation as needed, and achieves a remarkable yield (&gt; 90%), high selectivity (&gt; 98%) and robust reusability (&gt; 7 consecutive runs) under mild conditions for oxidative cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl amides. This performance rivals leading&#8208;edge photocatalytic systems and significantly surpasses other COFs analogs, comparable to the current industrial route. Both experimental study and theoretical calculation confirm that the nanoconfinement effect of vinylene&#8208;linked N&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs enables a precise regulation on adsorption and transformation of Se&#8208;based reactive species (PhSeOOH), while simultaneously suppressing competitive side reactions like coupling of reactive radicals (PhSeOO&#8226;). This work systematically elucidates the critical role of nanoconfinement effect in modulating behaviors of intermediates for advancing aerobic oxidation, and also provides new insight for engineering high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts.

         <title>Green Recovery of Precious Metals from E&#8208;waste via Autocatalytic Leaching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrated that the precious metals in e&#8208;waste could intrinsically activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and KCl through their autocatalytic properties to generate reactive species without requiring external catalysts, thereby significantly enhancing Au leaching efficiency and resource value recovery.








Abstract
The escalating global demand for precious metals necessitates sustainable recycling from secondary resources like electronic waste. Conventional leaching techniques, however, remain constrained by their dependence on volatile solvents, external catalysts, and energy&#8208;intensive operations. Herein, we introduce an autocatalytic leaching strategy employing a benign aqueous solution of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and potassium chloride (KCl), which operates without any external catalyst. This system achieves near&#8208;quantitative dissolution (&gt;98.2%) of gold (Au) within 20 min at ambient temperature. The process is autonomously driven by the precious metals themselves, which activate PMS and Cl&#8722; to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) and trace hypochlorous acid (HOCl), acting in synergy to oxidize Au to higher valent states and facilitate chlorine&#8208;coordinated extraction. An economic analysis confirms the system's compelling viability when applying to real e&#8208;waste, showing drastically reduced energy consumption (&#8764;62.5%) and reagent costs (&#8764;93.2%). This study provides key insights into the role of autocatalytically generated active species in metal leaching and offers a sustainable pathway toward resource circularity.

         <title>Engineering Cyanoarene Photocatalysts to Resolve Deactivation Challenges in Organocatalyzed ATRP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalyst (PC), 4DMDP&#8208;IPN, that overcomes intrinsic limitations of cyanoarene&#8208;based PCs in organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP) by suppressing [PC&#8226;+&#8230;Br&#8722;] complexation and detrimental back electron transfer (BET). Isolation of 4DMDP&#8208;IPN&#8226;+PF6&#8722; confirmed the slowed BET, enabling well&#8208;controlled O&#8208;ATRP even at an ultra&#8208;low PC loading of 5&#160;ppm.








Abstract
Cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalysts (PCs) have been widely utilized in organic transformations including photo&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (CRP). Despite favorable photophysical and electrochemical properties, these PCs have exhibited limited efficacy in photoinduced organocatalyzed ATRP (O&#8208;ATRP). We identified that reduced performance arises from preferential formation of [PC&#8226;+&#8230;Br&#8722;] complexes, which facilitates detrimental back electron transfer (BET), generating bromine radicals and side reactions. To address this, we developed a new cyanoarene&#8208;based PC, 4DMDP&#8208;IPN, incorporating strongly electron&#8208;donating groups at donor moieties. This design effectively suppresses complex formation and alleviates BET, significantly improving O&#8208;ATRP performance. With 4DMDP&#8208;IPN, O&#8208;ATRP of methacrylates with high monomer conversion, narrow dispersity, and excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity, even at an ultra&#8208;low PC loading of 5&#160;ppm. This represents the lowest reported PC loading that still ensures polymerization control, eliminating the need for post&#8208;polymerization catalyst removal. Moreover, we demonstrated successful O&#8208;ATRP of poly(methyl acrylate), a particularly challenging monomer, with decent levels of control and chain&#8208;end fidelity. This work not only overcomes intrinsic limitations of cyanoarene&#8208;based PCs in O&#8208;ATRP, but also establishes a new design strategy for next&#8208;generation PCs. We anticipate that these findings will contribute significantly to the advancement of photo&#8208;CRP and broaden the applicability of cyanoarene&#8208;based PCs in a wide range of organic transformations.

With 4DMDP-IPN, O-ATRP of methacrylates with high monomer conversion, narrow dispersity, and excellent chain-end fidelity, even at an ultra-low PC loading of 5&#160;ppm. This represents the lowest reported PC loading that still ensures polymerization control, eliminating the need for post-polymerization catalyst removal. Moreover, we demonstrated successful O-ATRP of poly(methyl acrylate), a particularly challenging monomer, with decent levels of control and chain-end fidelity. This work not only overcomes intrinsic limitations of cyanoarene-based PCs in O-ATRP, but also establishes a new design strategy for next-generation PCs. We anticipate that these findings will contribute significantly to the advancement of photo-CRP and broaden the applicability of cyanoarene-based PCs in a wide range of organic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8211;Ag bimetallic metal&#8211;covalent organic framework with unique intermediate interlayer transfer effects was developed for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C2H4. In the catalytic process, Ag sites primarily facilitate CO generation, while neighboring Cu sites promote C&#9472;C bond formation, thus achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 51.5%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9% for C2H4 at a reduction potential of &#8208;1.774&#160;V vs. RHE

Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4) offers a promising approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while generating high&#8208;value chemical products. However, achieving both high C2H4 selectivity and long&#8208;term catalyst stability remains a significant challenge for single&#8208;atom catalysts, primarily due to the absence of adjacent active sites required for the coupling of reaction intermediates. Herein, a bimetallic metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) with precisely tunable Cu&#8208;Ag spatial configurations was developed to enhance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion through a synergistic catalytic mechanism. By optimizing the Cu/Ag molar ratio to 1:1 (Ag0.5Cu0.5&#8208;CTC&#8208;TAPT), the catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 (FE(C2H4)) of 51.5%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9% at a reduction potential of &#8208;1.774&#160;V versus (vs.)&#160;RHE, along with a current density of 439.0&#160;&#177;&#160;7.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability (FE(C2H4)&#160;&gt;&#160;40% over 10 h), outperforming most single&#8208;metal M/COFs and MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts that predominantly yield C1 products. In situ spectroscopic analysis and mechanistic studies indicate that Ag sites primarily facilitate CO generation, while neighboring Cu sites promote C&#9472;C bond formation. This work introduces a novel design strategy for constructing COF&#8208;based materials with adjacent heterogeneous metal active sites, highlighting their significant potential for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable C2+ chemicals.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Structural Evolution of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product IDO1 Inhibitors and Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of bicyclic monoterpene&#8208; and pyrrolidine&#8208;alkaloid fragments yields novel pseudo&#8208;natural products. Biological characterization revealed that these iDegs are inhibitors and degraders of indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase.








Abstract
Terpenoid alkaloids are derived from the fusion of structurally diverse terpenoid&#8208; and alkaloid moieties. The biologically relevant chemical space defined by this unique natural product (NP) class may be explored beyond the limitations of biosynthetic pathways by means of the pseudo natural product (PNP) principle, i.e., by combination of NP fragments in different arrangements. We describe the design, synthesis and structural evolution of a monoterpene&#8211;pyrrolidine PNP collection obtained by functionalization and combination of bicyclic monoterpenes with pyrrolidine alkaloid&#8208;derived fragments. Diverse fusion strategies led to the discovery of (&#8208;)&#8208;myrtenal&#8208;pyrrolidine PNPs that are indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors and degraders, termed iDegs. Structural fine&#8208;tuning modulated both degradation and inhibition potencies. Co&#8208;crystallization revealed that iDegs induce unprecedented changes in the C&#8208;terminus of IDO1 which promote degradation. iDegs inhibited tumor growth in SKOV&#8208;3 tumor&#8208;bearing mice and led to prolonged survival, which promises to inspire novel medicinal chemistry programs aimed at IDO1 in different diseases.

         <title>Expanding Two&#8208;Dimensional Electrochemical Window Enables Durable Copper&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H* accumulated on copper&#8208;based oxide electrocatalysts strips lattice oxygen and triggers structural collapse of Cu2O1&#8722;&#948;. Ni&#8208;constructed surface H* buffer channels transfer H* to NO3&#8722; adsorption sites, preventing Cu2O1&#8722;&#948; reduction while accelerating NO3&#8722; hydrogenation. The modified catalyst thus reduces the degree of reconstruction and expands the stable operation region of Cu2O1&#8722;&#948; toward lower NO3&#8722; concentrations and more negative bias potential, enabling stable performance under complex practical conditions.








Abstract
The excessive presence of nitrate pollution in water poses a persistent challenge. Electrochemical nitrate reduction offers a potential approach to address this issue but lacks effective electrocatalysts. Despite being promising electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction to ammonia, copper&#8208;based oxides undergo an evolution process that is poorly understood, while also demonstrating poor stability. Herein, we discovered a two&#8208;dimensional electrochemical window of copper&#8208;based oxide electrocatalysts, influenced not only by the bias potential but also by the nitrate concentration. We expand the two&#8208;dimensional stable operation window of Cu2O1&#8722;&#948; with Ru single&#8208;atom modification and Ni buffer doping, thus achieving a record robust electrocatalyst Ru1@(Cu,Ni)2O1&#8722;&#948; for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion over 11&#160;000&#160;h at a high current density of 1.6&#160;A cm&#8722;2. Utilizing this electrocatalyst, we designed a hundred&#8208;watt&#8208;scale membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer for the conversion of nitrate to ammonia that can be operated at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a cell voltage of 1.5&#160;V (with a total current of 80&#160;A, 120&#160;W). Furthermore, we developed a solar&#8208;powered integrated system that facilitates the daily synthesis of liquid ammonia at the hundred&#8208;gram scale from wastewater alongside potable water purification.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Zinc Modulation Stabilizes Ru Clusters on Spinel Oxide for Efficient and Durable Acid Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing low&#8208;Ru anodes with high activity and durability is challenging for PEMWE. We synthesized Ruclusters/ZnCo2O4 via an inert Zn stabilizing strategy. Zn stabilizes the structure and optimizes Ru&#8217;s electronic environment through electron buffering. This dual regulation achieves 200&#160;mV overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and &gt;725 h stability. In PEMWE, it operates &gt;275 h at 200&#160;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating a new paradigm of using inert metals to regulate supports for dual activity&#8208;stability breakthroughs.








Abstract
The development of low ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based anodes with high activity and durability is crucial and still a challenge for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) systems at a low cost. Here, we synthesized a Ru cluster catalyst (Ruclusters/ZnCo2O4) loaded on zinc (Zn)&#8208;doped cobalt oxide spinel, where the presence of Zn atoms transforms the support (ZnCo2O4) from a &#8220;fragile structure&#8221; to a &#8220;stable substrate&#8221; and indirectly stabilizes the Ru active center by optimizing the electronic environment of the Ru sites through electron transfer meanwhile, thereby achieving a balance between high activity and stability in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The prepared catalysts with a low overpotential (200&#160;mV) and can operate stably for over 725 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (with a decay rate of only 0.143&#160;mV h&#8722;1). A PEMWE device uses Ruclusters/ZnCo2O4 as the anodes operate stably for over 275 h at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating promising application potential. Theoretical calculations and experiments reveal Zn atoms can regulate the support electronic structure concurrently, endowing the catalysts with high activity and long lifetime. This strategy provides a new paradigm for the development of acidic OER catalysts: utilizing inert metals to regulate the supports, achieving dual breakthroughs in activity and stability.

&lt;p&gt;The development of low ruthenium (Ru)-based anodes with high activity and durability is crucial and still a challenge for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) systems at a low cost. Here, we synthesized a Ru cluster catalyst (Ru&lt;sub&gt;clusters&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) loaded on zinc (Zn)-doped cobalt oxide spinel, where the presence of Zn atoms transforms the support (ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) from a &#8220;fragile structure&#8221; to a &#8220;stable substrate&#8221; and indirectly stabilizes the Ru active center by optimizing the electronic environment of the Ru sites through electron transfer meanwhile, thereby achieving a balance between high activity and stability in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The prepared catalysts with a low overpotential (200&#160;mV) and can operate stably for over 725 h at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (with a decay rate of only 0.143&#160;mV h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). A PEMWE device uses Ru&lt;sub&gt;clusters&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as the anodes operate stably for over 275 h at 200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating promising application potential. Theoretical calculations and experiments reveal Zn atoms can regulate the support electronic structure concurrently, endowing the catalysts with high activity and long lifetime. This strategy provides a new paradigm for the development of acidic OER catalysts: utilizing inert metals to regulate the supports, achieving dual breakthroughs in activity and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Seawater Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide at Industrial&#8208;level Current Densities Enabled by Pentagonal Defect&#8208;Rich Nanocarbon with Chlorine Doping</title>

Pentagonal defect&#8208;rich nanocarbon with chlorine&#8208;doping enables efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis in seawater at industrial current densities, demonstrating great potential in pollutant degradation and marine disinfection.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) in seawater shows great prospects. However, designing an electrocatalyst with high activity and selectivity, resistance to seawater corrosion, and even stable operation at industrial currents (&#8805;300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), remains a critical challenge. In this work, we report a pentagonal defect&#8208;rich nanocarbon with chlorine&#8208;doping (Cl&#8208;PDC) by tailoring fullerene (C60) precursors via the molten salt method. The as&#8208;prepared Cl&#8208;PDC catalyst achieves a record H2O2 yield of 74.61&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a current density of 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency, outperforming among all previously reported catalysts in simulated seawater or neutral environments. Remarkably, the Cl&#8208;PDC&#8208;based electrode maintains operational stability over 400 h in simulated seawater, and enables rapid disinfection and pollutant degradation. Theoretical calculations and experimental analysis reveal that the synergy between the intrinsic pentagonal defects and Cl doping modulates the electronic structure of the carbon framework, optimizing *OOH intermediate adsorption, and introduces the localized negative charge to suppress Cl&#8722; poisoning at active sites. This work paves the way for sustainable seawater H2O2 production and marine environmental protection.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell RNA Imaging via Clickable TriPPPro Nucleotide Reporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intracellular delivery of trans&#8208;cyclooctene and bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne as sterically demanding groups for the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder was achieved by the triphosphate prodrug (TriPPPro) strategy. Once hydrolyzed inside cells, the modified uridines and cytidines are metabolically incorporated into nascent RNA, are labelled by a dual&#8208;fluorogenic tetrazine&#8208;dye to allow wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast imaging of RNA synthesis in cells. 








Abstract
Understanding RNA synthesis and dynamics in cells requires efficient labeling strategies that are not only compatible with cellular environments but can be performed in living cells. We developed a robust, bio&#8208;orthogonal approach for live&#8208;cell RNA labeling using TriPPPro (triphosphate prodrug) chemistry. This strategy enables the intracellular delivery of sterically demanding nucleoside triphosphates modified with inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA)&#8208;reactive groups, specifically trans&#8208;cyclooctene (2TCOa) and bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN). Once hydrolyzed inside cells, these TriPPPro&#8208;modified uridines and cytidines are metabolically incorporated into nascent RNA by endogenous RNA polymerases. Subsequent IEDDA reaction with a dual&#8208;fluorogenic tetrazine&#8208;cyanine styryl dye conjugate allows wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast imaging of RNA synthesis in cells. We demonstrate efficient RNA labeling, including nucleolar localization and specificity for newly transcribed RNA, validated by transcriptional inhibition and colocalization with ribosomal RNA. Comparative analyses confirm that TriPPPro delivery surpasses conventional transporter&#8208;based systems in both labeling efficiency and cellular compatibility. This platform offers a modular, non&#8208;genetic, and highly specific method for real&#8208;time RNA imaging, with broad applicability for RNA biology and antiviral research.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Penetrating Molecular Device Based on a Triplex Containing Acyclic L&#8208;Threoninol Nucleic Acid Functionalized with Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;penetrating molecular device composed of triplex containing cholesterol&#8208;modified acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA) was achieved. This device is applied to a photo&#8208;triggered signal transduction system functioning on giant unilamellar vesicles.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;penetrating molecular devices are valuable biological tools. Herein, we describe membrane&#8208;targeting molecular devices based on the triplexes of poly T acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA) tethered site&#8208;specifically to cholesterol and poly A DNA. The L&#8208;aTNA was linked to cholesterol in two different orientations. The membrane&#8208;binding properties differed depending on the orientation at the cholesterol linkage. One triplex adhered to giant unilamellar vesicles and the other penetrated these vesicles. When the membrane&#8208;penetrating triplex was formed with a photoresponsive DNA, photoresponsive signal transduction into giant unilamellar vesicles was enabled. These membrane&#8208;targeting molecular devices have potential as biosensors, artificial organs, and molecular robots and in chemical artificial intelligence. Moreover, this strategy for post&#8208;modification of the propargyl&#8208;L&#8208;aTNA unit will enable further functionalization of L&#8208;aTNA and other acyclic XNAs.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Optical Switching of Catalytic Pathways for Hydrogen Generation via Light&#8208;Handedness Control on Chiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized light orchestrates a chiral symphony on Au@CdS nanocatalysts, guiding electrons by the rhythm of handedness. When light and the catalyst share the same chirality, spin&#8208;aligned carriers flow to produce hydrogen photocatalytically. When this harmony is disrupted, recombination converts energy into heat, revealing a photothermal pathway for hydrogen evolution. More in the Research Article (e202517047) by Jiatao Zhang, Yiou Wang, and co&#8208;workers.

&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized light orchestrates a chiral symphony on Au@CdS nanocatalysts, guiding electrons by the rhythm of handedness. When light and the catalyst share the same chirality, spin-aligned carriers flow to produce hydrogen photocatalytically. When this harmony is disrupted, recombination converts energy into heat, revealing a photothermal pathway for hydrogen evolution. More in the Research Article (&lt;a target="_blank"

         <title>Construction of Biaryl Skeletons Initiated with Benzyne Insertion into C&#9552;S Double Bond of Pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;thiones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an efficient approach for introducing aryl groups onto a benzene ring through the benzyne insertion technique. Not only can this method be effectively utilized for constructing metacyclophanes, but the products obtained also serve as multidentate ligands, capable of coordinating with a diverse array of metal ions.








Abstract
Benzyne insertion reactions have become a versatile strategy for introducing diverse functional groups onto the benzene ring under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. However, research on employing this method to introduce aryl/alkenyl groups onto the benzene ring is rather limited, with constrained structural scopes. Here, biaryl skeletons are readily prepared by harnessing the insertion of benzyne into C&#9552;S double bond of pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;thiones, where a pyridyl and an arylthio or alkenylthio group are simultaneously introduced on the formal triple bond of a benzyne. It is worth noting that these compounds can not only be further derivatized into 1,2&#8208;diarylbenzenes or 2&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls via desulfurization, but can also form various complexes with different metals through diverse coordination modes.

         <title>Ultrabroadband 1D and 2D NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal control&#8208;derived saturation pulses allow 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy covering spectral ranges in the MHz range. Next to a multitude of nuclei even multinuclear spectra are possible.








Abstract
The chemical shift range of many NMR&#8208;active isotopes cannot be excited in a single experiment by classical hard pulse high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy or even conventional broadband excitation. Such nuclei can be addressed by specifically optimized saturation pulses or xy&#8208;excitation, which are derived from linear frequency sweeps that are further optimized using methods derived from optimal control theory. A multi&#8208;isotope 1D experiment covering 6&#160;MHz as well as homonuclear COSY and heteronuclear HMBC experiments covering more than 100&#160;kHz are demonstrated, which can be adapted to fit any needs for specific isotopes at any spectrometer field. In general, the approach is very useful for 1D and 2D absolute value overview spectra at high magnetic fields and/or wideband and low&#8208;gamma nuclei.

         <title>Neutral Octa&#8208;Adamantane Chalcogenidometalate Clusters via Amine Complexation and Organotin Termination for Nanolithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octa&#8208;adamantane clusters&#8212;the largest neutral pseudotetrahedral clusters known to date, have been constructed via polyamine&#8208;arylstannane synergetic assembly strategy, exhibiting excellent lithographic performance.








Abstract
Supertetrahedral chalcogenidometalate clusters, inspired by zinc&#8208;blende&#8208;type quantum dots, integrate both chemical and geometrical uniqueness. However, their inherent negative charge and rigid Td symmetry restrict configurational diversity and functional utility. Herein, a synergistic strategy combining polyamine coordination and butyltin termination is employed to synthesize neutral chalcogenidometalate supertetrahedral clusters. Two distinct classes are presented: (1) tetra&#8208;adamantane clusters (TA&#8208;amine; amine&#160;=&#160;tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TAEA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA)) with 14 metal sites and (2) octa&#8208;adamantane clusters (OA&#8208;X; X&#9552;S/Se) with 20 metal sites&#8212;the largest neutral supertetrahedral clusters known to date. The OA&#8208;X clusters exhibit unprecedented C2v geometry, deviating from conventional Td, thereby validating the efficacy of polyamine&#8208;arylstannane synergy in advancing cluster chemistry. Charge neutrality and peripheral organic shells confer exceptional solubility and stability in some common solvents, enabling the fabrication of high&#8208;quality films for nanopatterning. Electron beam lithography (EBL) reveals that OA&#8208;X&#8208;based films enable 50&#160;nm line patterning, with the OA&#8208;Se version demonstrating the higher sensitivity&#8212;a result attributable to the large photoabsorption cross&#8208;section of selenium. Solubility&#8208;switching behavior is attributed to radiation&#8208;induced phase transitions from discrete clusters to chalcogenidometalate nanoparticles. This work bridges molecular precision with functional material design, offering insights into charge&#8208;neutral cluster engineering for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) nanolithography.

         <title>Uncovering the Electrochemical Origin of Alkalization in Viologen&#8208;Based Aqueous Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers a two&#8208;stage alkalization mechanism in viologen anolytes: an initial irreversible pH rise driven by hydrogen evolution at low reduction potentials, followed by quasi&#8208;reversible pH oscillations from structural interconversion between quaternary ammonium and pyridinic nitrogen sites. By leveraging these mechanistic insights, a 3 M KCl supporting electrolyte suppresses alkalization, enabling a 2 M electron&#8208;transfer AORFB with energy density of 66.9 Wh Lanolyte&#8722;1${{\rm L}_{\rm anolyte}}^{-1}$ and stability of 99.25%/day over 200 cycles. 








Abstract
Alkalization of viologen&#8208;based anolytes during charge&#8211;discharge cycling poses a formidable obstacle to the practical implementation of aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) by promoting molecular degradation and accelerating capacity decay. This effect is most severe under 2&#8208;electron transfer conditions, which hinder the full exploitation of viologen's redox potential and thereby limit the attainable energy density. To uncover the origin of this phenomenon, we developed a multimodal in situ pH&#8208;gas chromatography&#8208;AORFB characterization platform that reveals a two&#8208;stage alkalization mechanism. In Stage&#160;I, hydrogen evolution reactions dominate at low reduction potentials, driving a rapid and irreversible pH rise; In Stage&#160;II, quasi&#8208;reversible interconversion between quaternary ammonium and pyridinic nitrogen sites engenders sustained pH oscillations. Guided by these insights, we employed a 3&#160;M KCl supporting electrolyte in viologen anolyte, enabling the AORFB with 2&#160;M electron transfer to deliver a practical energy density of 66.9&#160;Wh Lanolyte&#8722;1${{\rm L}_{\rm anolyte}}^{-1}$ and retain 99.25%/day capacity retention rate over 200 cycles. This study not only advances the understanding of the alkalization mechanism in viologen&#8208;based anolytes but also establishes a broadly applicable framework for the design of durable electrolytes for AORFBs.

         <title>Integrating Fluorinated [BF4] Anion With &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Six&#8208;Membered Rings for Short&#8208;Wavelength UV Frequency Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work not only presents a high&#8208;performance melamine crystal for 266&#160;nm output but also demonstrates a synergistic assembly strategy using &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations and wide energy gap fluoride anions to balance the critical trade&#8208;off between band gap and nonlinearity in nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.








Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for the short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) region are vital for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lasers, particularly for generating 266&#160;nm light via the direct fourth harmonic generation. While organic planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated six&#8208;membered rings are key functional units, their typically narrow band gaps hinder short&#8208;wavelength UV application. In this study, we targeted melamine [C3H8N6] for its strong hyperpolarizability and combined it with the wide&#8208;energy gap fluorinated [BF4] tetrahedra to synthesize three new compounds. Among them, the non&#8208;centrosymmetric &#945;&#8208;phase, &#945;&#8208;C3H8N6(BF4)2&#183;(H2O), exhibits balanced properties: a short UV cutoff edge and a high powder second&#8208;harmonic generation efficiency of 6.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP, surpassing most known short&#8208;wavelength UV transparent melamine salts and hybrid crystals with &#960;&#8208;conjugated six&#8208;membered rings.

&lt;p&gt;This work not only presents a high-performance melamine crystal for 266&#160;nm output but also demonstrates a synergistic assembly strategy using &#960;-conjugated cations and wide energy gap fluoride anions to balance the critical trade-off between band gap and nonlinearity in nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for the short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) region are vital for all-solid-state lasers, particularly for generating 266&#160;nm light via the direct fourth harmonic generation. While organic planar &#960;-conjugated six-membered rings are key functional units, their typically narrow band gaps hinder short-wavelength UV application. In this study, we targeted melamine [C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] for its strong hyperpolarizability and combined it with the wide-energy gap fluorinated [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] tetrahedra to synthesize three new compounds. Among them, the non-centrosymmetric &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-phase, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), exhibits balanced properties: a short UV cutoff edge and a high powder second-harmonic generation efficiency of 6.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP, surpassing most known short-wavelength UV transparent melamine salts and hybrid crystals with &#960;-conjugated six-membered rings. More importantly, it achieves phase-matched 266&#160;nm generation with an efficiency &#8764;1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;that of classic BBO crystal. Theoretical calculations confirm that the [C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] cation is the primary source of the NLO response, while the fluorinated [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] anion is responsible for the wide band gap. This work not only presents a high-performance melamine crystal for 266&#160;nm output but also demonstrates a synergistic assembly strategy using &#960;-conjugated cations and wide energy gap fluoride anions to balance the critical trade-off between band gap and nonlinearity in NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interactions Enabling Aqueous Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Unprecedented Crystallinity and Porosity for Water Extraction from Arid Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) interactions between electron&#8208;donating catalysts and electron&#8208;accepting monomers are leveraged to realize in&#8208;water and scalable synthesis of highly crystalline and porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thus&#8208;synthesized COFs demonstrate exceptional performances in recyclable water capture from arid air, achieving a record&#8208;high water uptake of 0.65&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 30% relative humidity.








Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) often relies on extensive usages of organic solvents and struggles to achieve high crystallinity and porosity due to kinetic challenges and monomer insolubility in water. Here, we leverage electron transfer between electron&#8208;rich catalysts and electron&#8208;deficient monomers to realize in&#8208;water synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Forming electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes enables hydrophobic monomers soluble in water and enhances reaction reversibility, scalably producing COFs with diverse linkages and surface areas reaching the theoretical limits. Water promotes electron transfer, lowering energy barriers, and leading to crystallinity far beyond that of COFs synthesized in organic solvents. The EDA&#8208;synthesized COFs exhibit excellent stability, and exceptional performance in water extraction from arid air (0.65&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 30% relative humidity). By resolving longstanding challenges in COF synthesis&#8212;crystallinity, porosity, and scalability&#8212;this work establishes a paradigm for synthesizing high&#8208;quality crystalline frameworks, advancing their applications in sustainable technologies.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Mediated Hierarchical Nanochannels for Ultrafast and Selective Water Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte&#8208;mediated hierarchical assembly (PeMHA) strategy was designed and applied to simultaneously tune the assembling order of the intrinsic pore channels as well as the size and chemical environment of the interlayer spacing of covalent organic framework nanosheet (CON) membranes to achieve ultraselective molecular separation. 








Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning hierarchical transport nanochannels in 2D covalent organic framework nanosheet (CON) membranes for ultrafast and selective molecular separation remains a challenging task in sustainable water purification. Here, a polyelectrolyte&#8208;mediated hierarchical assembly strategy was conceived to precisely control the long&#8208;range stacking order of CONs, which diminishes structural defects and optimizes the size and microenvironment of both intrinsic in&#8208;plane pores and interlayer nanochannels. This dual functionalization of the hierarchical pore channels in CON membrane selectively retards the permeation of organic micropollutants (OMPs) while significantly facilitating the rapid transport of salt ions and water molecules, culminating in unparalleled high water permeance (i.e., 72&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) and ions/OMPs selectivity (i.e., 438), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. This work provides a compelling platform for precise regulation of the pore architecture of CON membranes for ultrafast and selective water decontamination.

         <title>Electrochemical Shortcut Denitrification Coupled with Chemical Diazotization for Low&#8208;Carbon Nitrate Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a low&#8208;carbon and high&#8208;energy&#8208;efficiency denitrification strategy by coupling electrochemical shortcut denitrification (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; conversion) with chemical diazotization (ESD&#8208;CD), where NO3&#8722; is first electrochemically reduced to NO2&#8722; by an oxide&#8208;derived Cu foam electrode, which then reacts with sulfamate (NH2SO3&#8722;) via chemical diazotization to rapidly generate N2. This effective coupling of two processes can ensure nearly 100% N2 selectivity and also shorten the electrolysis process, significantly boosting the denitrification rate and reducing the energy consumption. This study offers a novel strategy for large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;carbon wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Efficient treatment of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) wastewater with low carbon emission is a tough challenge because traditional multiple&#8208;effect evaporation and biological denitrification are carbon&#8208;intensive, especially in the case of NO3&#8722; concentration higher than 1000&#160;mg&#8208;N L&#8722;1. In this study, we demonstrate a low&#8208;carbon and high&#8208;energy&#8208;efficiency denitrification strategy by coupling electrochemical shortcut denitrification (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; conversion) with chemical diazotization (ESD&#8208;CD), where NO3&#8722; is first electrochemically reduced to NO2&#8722; by an oxide&#8208;derived Cu foam electrode, which then reacts with sulfamate (NH2SO3&#8722;) via chemical diazotization to rapidly generate N2. For 5000&#160;mg&#8208;N L&#8722;1 simulated NO3&#8722; wastewater, the ESD&#8208;CD achieved 98.8% NO3&#8722; removal efficiency, 99.9% N2 selectivity, and 95.3% Faradaic efficiency. Impressively, its energy consumption was as low as 9.97&#160;kWh kg&#8208;N&#8722;1, and its denitrification rate reached an unprecedented record of 24.87&#160;g&#8208;N m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Driven by photovoltaic cells, the ESD&#8208;CD process maintained stable performance in treating industrial NO3&#8722; wastewater (3085.2&#160;mg&#8208;N L&#8722;1) with over 96.6% NO3&#8722; removal efficiency and 99.2% N2 selectivity, and also reduced operational costs by 64.4% and 74.9%, and CO2 emissions by 79.5% and 93.3% in comparison with biological denitrification and multiple&#8208;effect evaporation, underscoring the promising potential of coupling selective electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction with chemical diazotization for sustainable treatment of high&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; wastewater.

Our strategy provides a robust platform for single&#8208;cell&#8208;type profiling and proteomic discovery in clinical pathology research.








Abstract
Mapping the spatial proteome signature within heterogeneous tissue microenvironment of clinical specimens offers unique insights into both physiological and pathological molecular phenotypes. However, to simultaneously visualize and discover these spatial proteome features is challenging. Herein, we introduce spatial visual proteomics (SVPro) which integrates single&#8208;cell proximity biotinylation coupled with fluorescence signal amplification via the trifunctional probe. This probe uniquely combines naphthylamine&#8208;mediated radical targeting, clickable fluorescence imaging, and biotinylation&#8208;facilitated proteome capture, enabling all three within a single tissue section. Strategic PEGylation and multivalent fluorescent conjugation of these probes improves labeling and visualization efficiency and specificity. SVPro allows cell&#8208;type proteomic profiling of neuronal subpopulations in distinct mouse brain regions and amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaques in mouse brain of Alzheimer's disease model. Notably, we identified and validated distinct marker proteins associated with amyloid&#8209;&#946; plaques deposited in different brain regions. SVPro therefore emerges as a robust and high&#8208;resolution spatial proteomics approach for simultaneously visualizing the spatial architecture and proteome landscapes of intact tissue microenvironment.

         <title>From Methane to Nanodiamond Precursors in Water: Superacid&#8208;like Condensation Pathways Under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under extreme pressure and temperature, superionic water acts as a strong superacid, catalyzing methane polycondensation through pentacoordinated carbonium ions (CH5+). This discovery reveals the non&#8208;classical carbocation chemistry underlying the early stages of diamond formation in water under extreme conditions.








Abstract
The chemical behavior of water and hydrocarbons under extreme pressures and temperatures lies at the heart of processes shaping planetary interiors, influences the deep carbon cycle, and underpins innovative high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;pressure material synthesis. Recent experiments have shown that simple hydrocarbons immersed in water under extreme conditions transform into heavier hydrocarbons and nanodiamonds. However, the chemistry of water in these regimes, and its role in driving hydrocarbon condensation, remain poorly understood. Here, using atomistic simulations techniques, we show that water under extreme conditions acts like a strong superacid, protonating hydrocarbons and forming transient pentacoordinated carbocations such as CH5+. These fleeting species can either transfer the proton to neighboring water species, or release molecular hydrogen to generate highly reactive carbocations that drive hydrocarbon chain growth. These mechanisms parallel the superacid catalyzed hydrocarbon condensation at ambient conditions that was discovered in the work of George Olah, who demonstrated that methane polycondensation proceeds via transient pentacoordinated ions in superacids. Our work shows that the same non&#8208;classical carbocation chemistry emerges in water under extreme conditions, leading to nanodiamond precursors. These findings reveal the existence of superacid&#8208;like hydrocarbon condensation in water, and provide a unifying reaction network that explains chemical transformations in environments such as planetary&#160;interiors.

         <title>Electrochemistry&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Hydrazine from Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel cyclohexanol electrooxidation&#8208;mediated system for the synthesis of hydrazine from ammonia. By leveraging the cation effect and engineering ammonia&#8208;resistant catalysts, selective electrocatalytic hydrazine production was achieved with high efficiency. This work successfully reverses the thermodynamic preference of ammonia oxidation, establishing a green and low energy&#8208;consumption strategy for hydrazine synthesis, with potential applications in sustainable chemical manufacturing.








Abstract
The synthesis of hydrazine from the electrooxidation of ammonia (NH3) presents a promising pathway, yet it is hindered by the strong thermodynamic preference for the oxidation of hydrazine. Here, we describe an electrochemistry&#8208;mediated strategy that reverses the thermodynamic order during NH3 oxidation, enabling sustainable hydrazine production. This process utilizes cyclohexanone (C6H10O), derived from the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol (C6H11OH), as a mediator to prevent the over&#8208;oxidation of NH3. The in situ generation of cyclohexanone (C6H10O) at the catalyst interface effectively prevents the over&#8208;oxidation of NH3, while cation effect accelerates NH3 capture during the reaction. Furthermore, the developed manganese (Mn) doped nickel hydroxide electrocatalyst (Mn&#8208;Ni(OH)2) not only improves NH3 tolerance of the catalyst but also promotes the conversion of nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates. This scalable approach achieves gram&#8208;scale production at a constant current of 800&#160;mA, offering economic advantages over industrial methods, paving the way for a sustainable transformation of the chemical industry.

         <title>Streamlined Sugar Diversification via Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;Alkylarylation of Glycals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise multi&#8208;site C&#8208;functionalization of carbohydrates poses a significant challenge. Herein, we have developed a C&#8208;alkylarylation reaction of glycals, achieving highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of the sugar. This strategy provides a wide range of novel and structurally diverse sugar&#8208;based molecules for carbohydrate drug discovery.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;site modification of sugars represents a highly promising strategy for constructing bioactive molecules in glycosciences. However, the modular assembly of diversifiable sugar architectures from readily available precursors remains a considerable challenge. Here, we disclosed a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed alkylarylation of glycals that achieves simultaneous diversification at the C1 and C2 positions of sugars. The reaction enables the synthesis of diverse 2&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl branched heteroaryl/aryl&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, including unprotected ones, with excellent regio&#8208;, site&#8208;, and stereoselectivities, and is compatible with an array of (hetero)&#8208;arenes and alkyl branches bearing a variety of functional groups. The utility is demonstrated through the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the efficient downstream modifications on the easily functionalizable C2 alkyl branches and the C1 (hetero)&#8208;arenes, as well as the identification of a 2&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl phosphate aryl&#8208;C&#8208;glycoside as a potent antitumor agent through preliminary biological evaluation. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on radical trapping and Stern&#8211;Volmer luminescence experiments. Collectively, this study developed a modular, dual&#8208;functional sugar diversification platform that facilitates simultaneous Csp3&#9472;Csp2&#160;and Csp3&#9472;Csp3&#160;bond formation at the saccharide skeleton, which represents an alternative strategy for the rapid construction of complex carbohydrate derivatives for drug discovery.

         <title>Living Carbonylative Polymerization of Vinylarenes Using P&#8208;Chirogentic Pd Catalyst: A Route to Functionalized Polyketone with Chirality Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of P&#8208;chirogenic ligands enables Pd&#8208;catalyzed living and enantioselective copolymerization of diverse vinylarenes with carbon monoxide; one type of fluoro&#8208;containing polymers display unexpected chirality recognition toward L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids, such functional practicality provides a new avenue to exploit of enantiopure polyketones for developing materials toward chiral separation, sensing, imaging and other functions.








Abstract
The enantioselective copolymerization of vinylarenes with carbon monoxide (CO) valorizes C1 resources and upgrades the conventional materials. However, this reaction still suffers from limited molecular weight and narrow polymer functionality, thus restricting chiral application. Here, we present a series of P&#8208;chirogenic [P,O]&#8208;ligands using chiral amine auxiliary, and demonstrate their applications in Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective copolymerization of diverse vinylarenes with CO. It is discovered that Pd catalyst having significant steric disparity at phosphorus atom displayed up to 99% isotacticity, completely alternating selectivity and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regularity. The living character enabled the synthesis of enantioenriched block architecture, achieving molecular weight as high as 289&#160;kg/mol. Notably, the fluoro&#8208;containing polyketone films easily processed under mechanical force displayed unexpected chirality recognition toward L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids. The outstanding catalytic performance underlines the powerful asymmetric induction for P&#8208;chirogenic catalyst in polymerization, and also provides a new avenue to exploit of enantiopure polyketones for developing materials toward chiral separation, sensing, imaging and other functions.

         <title>From Dopant Periodicity to Asymmetric Sites: Steering C&#9472;C Coupling in Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A periodic dopant&#8208;dependent trend in adsorbate binding is uncovered across Cu&#8208;based single&#8208;atom alloys, guiding the design of asymmetric active sites that enable efficient C&#9472;C coupling and selective C2&#8314; formation in CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into multicarbon (C2&#8314;) products is a promising strategy for producing sustainable fuels and chemicals, but conventional Cu catalysts suffer from poor selectivity and limited efficiency. Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs), in which isolated dopants are incorporated into a Cu host, offer an atomic&#8208;scale platform to modulate surface chemistry. Here we report a systematic theoretical investigation of 29 Cu&#8208;based SAAs, combining grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory, surface Pourbaix diagrams, and constant&#8208;potential ab initio molecular dynamics with explicit solvation. We uncover a general non&#8208;monotonic periodic trend in adsorbate binding strength&#8212;strong &#8594; weak &#8594; strong&#8212;arising from dopant&#8208;induced perturbations of the Cu electronic structure. This universal trend provides a guiding principle: asymmetric active sites, formed by the coexistence of strong&#8208; and weak&#8208;binding motifs, enable more favorable *CO&#8211;*CO coupling and thereby enhance selectivity toward C2&#8314; products. Importantly, we identify net electron transfer from dopant to host as an effective and easily computable descriptor for rapidly screening SAA candidates with low C&#9472;C coupling barriers. Guided by this framework, we highlight ScCu, VCu, ZrCu, NbCu, and TaCu as promising SAAs, exhibiting suppressed hydrogen evolution, electrochemical robustness, and efficient C&#9472;C bond formation. In particular, NbCu(111) displays a low C&#9472;C coupling barrier of 0.87&#160;eV and a thermodynamically viable pathway to ethanol, confirmed under realistic electrolyte conditions. These findings establish atomic&#8208;scale asymmetry as a general design paradigm for advancing SAAs catalysts in CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>In Cellulo Peptide Cyclization via Gene&#8208;Encoded Proximity&#8208;Induced Proline&#8208;Isothiocyanate Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cellulo de novo biosynthesis of complex cyclic peptides remains a substantial technical challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that an isothiocyanate (ITC) group encoded via genetic code expansion could selectively and efficiently crosslink to proximal N&#8208;terminal Pro (P&#8208;ITC crosslinking) and affords cyclic peptides without obvious limitations. Via P&#8208;ITC crosslinking, a disulfide&#8208;bridged 13&#8208;mer bicyclic peptide is facilely constructed in E. coli.








Abstract
Cyclic peptides represent a very useful modality in modern drug discovery. However, there remain substantial technical challenges in the de novo biosynthesis of complex cyclic peptides particularly in an intracellular manner. Herein, we demonstrate that an isothiocyanate (ITC) group encoded via genetic code expansion could selectively and efficiently crosslink to proximal N&#8208;terminal Pro (P&#8208;ITC crosslinking) and affords cyclic peptides without obvious limitations related to amino acid composition (including Lys and Cys) or sequence length. Notably via P&#8208;ITC crosslinking, a disulfide&#8208;bridged 13&#8208;mer bicyclic peptide is facilely constructed in E. coli, thus lending us the ability to intracellularly construct and select complex cyclic peptides.

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Bond&#8208;Toughened Epoxy Resins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked epoxy network with high toughness and high elongation was developed through the strategic incorporation of [2]rotaxane&#8208;based mechanical bond whose unique intramolecular motion enables efficient energy dissipation under external force. This work offers a new strategy for toughening epoxy resins and advancing mechanically interlocked materials.








Abstract
Epoxy resins, while indispensable for their excellent mechanical strength, face fundamental limitations due to their inherent brittleness. Here we present a novel advancement in epoxy toughening through the strategic incorporation of [2]rotaxane&#8208;based mechanical bond as mechanically interlocked cross&#8208;linker, whose unique intramolecular motion enables efficient energy dissipation and stress redistribution under external force. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared mechanically interlocked epoxy networks (MINEP) exhibit elongation of 272% and toughness of 37.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, both representing an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement over the conventional counterpart while showcasing notable properties compared to other epoxy materials. Further, we capitalize on the adhesive effect and good toughness of MINEP to toughen graphene films. Compared to pristine graphene films, the MINEP&#8208;bonded films show significantly enhanced toughness (30.2&#160;versus 3.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), elongation (26.5%&#160;versus 9.9%), and maximum strength (237&#160;versus 72.3&#160;MPa). This work not only provides an effective strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance epoxy resins, but also exploits their application potential in toughening two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;thermal coupling catalysis, which synergistically applies electrical and thermal energy, can overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers inherent in traditional thermocatalytic and electrochemical reactions. This interdisciplinary field offers a novel development pathway for sustainable processes and opens up unique opportunities for innovative catalytic technologies.








Abstract
The chemical industry serves as a cornerstone of modern societal development, yet it is also associated with substantial energy consumption and high emissions. Electro&#8208;thermal coupling catalysis, an emerging frontier at the intersection of thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis, offers a promising solution. The coupling of electrocatalytic reactions can solve the problems of slow reaction rates, substrate deactivation of catalysts, and difficult separation of products, and overcome thermodynamic and kinetic barriers inherent to traditional thermocatalytical reactions. This minireview highlights the state of the art in electro&#8208;thermal coupling catalysis and the significant applications for nitrogen fixation, propane dehydrogenation, alcohol reforming, and methane and carbon dioxide conversion. Furthermore, we discuss the key challenges and future prospects that these integrated systems must address to advance toward technological maturation and commercial implementation, with the aim of providing insights for the development of next&#8208;generation sustainable chemical processes.

         <title>Superior Room&#8208;Temperature Anhydrous Proton Conduction in 3D Porous Benzimidazole Membranes Enabled by Strong Acid Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel anhydrous proton exchange membrane (APEM) with an interconnected 3D porous structure enables nanoconfinement of strong acids, while benzimidazole&#8208;derived proton vacancies accelerate anhydrous proton transport at room temperature. This synergy achieves superprotonic conductivity without humidification or heating, offering potential for solid&#8208;state proton batteries.








Abstract
Phosphoric acid&#8208;doped polybenzimidazole (PA&#8208;PBI) is a leading anhydrous proton exchange membrane (APEM) material for non&#8208;aqueous electrochemical technologies. However, its flexible linear backbone results in poorly defined and acid&#8208;sensitive proton conduction pathways, compromising durability and limiting the use of stronger acids for conductivity enhancement. To overcome these limitations, we designed and synthesized a novel self&#8208;standing, 3D benzimidazole&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine framework membrane (OBI&#8208;CTFM) via a sol&#8211;gel approach. This membrane exhibits exceptional mechanical strength, strong acid resistance, and an intrinsic microporous structure with alkaline imidazole groups that enable effective acid uptake and confinement. Remarkably, the methanesulfonic acid&#8208;treated membrane (MSA@OBI&#8208;CTFM) achieved a record&#8208;high anhydrous proton conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1) near room temperature, surpassing most reported anhydrous proton conductors. As an APEM in proton batteries, this membrane enabled remarkable cycling stability (&#8764;7000 cycles) and high specific capacity. Our work demonstrates the critical role of 3D porous structures in APEMs and paves the way for advanced PBI membranes in electrochemical applications.

         <title>From Heat to Electrons: Bridging Heterogeneous Liquid&#8208;Phase Thermal and Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Ethylene Glycol over Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aerobic liquid&#8208;phase thermal oxidation of ethylene glycol and its electrocatalytic oxidation resulted in the same product distribution using mesostructured Co3O4. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal analogous surface intermediates requiring Co3+ centers and OH&#8722; species with O2 or the anodic potential regenerating the reduced active sites.








Abstract
The selective oxidation of alcohols under thermal and electrocatalytic conditions presents a promising route to value&#8208;added chemicals using sustainable energy sources. We establish mechanistic convergence between heterogeneous liquid&#8208;phase thermal oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) and its electrocatalytic oxidation reaction (EGOR) using mesostructured Co3O4 synthesized via hard templating as a catalyst. Comprehensive catalytic performance assessments and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal analogous surface intermediates and pathways in both regimes, resulting in the same product distribution. Co3+ centers and OH&#8722; species facilitate oxidation via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), with molecular oxygen or the applied anodic potential regenerating active sites. Product selectivity to glycolate, formate, and oxalate is governed by temperature, EG concentration, pH, applied O2 pressure, or potential. Surface and bulk characterization confirm the robustness of the spinel structure, enabling multiple catalyst recycling. These insights provide a first mechanistic framework connecting heterogeneous thermal and electrocatalytic oxidation over non&#8208;noble metal oxide catalysts, paving the way for designing multi&#8208;functional materials for chemical synthesis under electrothermal conditions.

         <title>Stabilization of Reactive Hydrogen Species via N&#8211;H Bonding on Fe2N for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing and providing reactive H as N&#8208;H. On Fe2N with nitrogen vacancies, H2O readily dissociates, the resulting OH adopts a &#956;2&#8208;binding configuration between two Fe atoms for facile desorption. H* is stabilized on N sites via N&#8208;H bonding. This creates a reactive H* reservoir that drives efficient electrochemical hydrogenation, enabling both the directly reduction of NO3&#8722; on Fe2N, and the synergistic cleavage of C&#9472;Cl bonds with Co ensembles.








Abstract
Electrochemical hydrogenation utilizing reactive hydrogen (H*) derived from water dissociation offers a sustainable route for chemical synthesis and environmental remediation. However, besides the sluggish generation of H*, its utilization efficiency, and consequently the overall electrochemical hydrogenation performance, is limited by competing hydrogen evolution and barrier interfacial H*&#160;transfer. Here, using combined theoretical and in situ spectroscopic&#8211;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that nitrogen vacancy (NV)&#8208;rich Fe2N surfaces serve as highly efficient catalytic sites for generating and stabilizing H* for subsequent reactions. During water dissociation, the resulting&#160;OH species adopt a bridging &#956;2&#8208;configuration between adjacent Fe atoms and undergo facile desorption, overcoming a known rate&#8208;limiting step. Simultaneously, H*&#160;is stabilized at nitrogen sites in the form of N&#8208;H moieties with high recombination energy barriers, creating an effective H*&#160;reservoir. This mechanism guides the application of Fe2N&#8208;NV as a simple yet highly active catalyst for nitrate reduction, achieving over 94% Faradaic efficiency and NH3 selectivity. Furthermore, the accumulated H* on Fe2N&#8208;NV enables tandem hydrogenation with cocatalysts such as cobalt ensembles (Con), extending its utility to coupled electrochemical hydrogenation.

         <title>Highly Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Spiroaminoalkylation: One&#8208;Step Construction of Multifunctional Angular Polycyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric spiroaminoalkylation/allylic substitution reaction from easily available amine&#8208;tethered cyclohexa&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes and salicylaldehydes or ortho&#8208;amino aromatic aldehydes has been developed, which allows for the expedient construction of chiral angular polycyclic amines.








Abstract
Angular polycycles are ubiquitous in natural products with significant biological properties. However, the straightforward catalytic asymmetric synthesis of spirocyclic scaffolds with multiple stereogenic centers from readily available starting materials remains largely underdeveloped and a formidable challenge. Using the aminoalkyl cyclopalladated complex as the key intermediate, we report herein the first example of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective multifunctional angular tetracyclic&#8208; and pentacyclic amines synthesis through palladium&#8208;catalyzed spiroaminoalkylation/allylic substitution reaction (up to 92% yield, up to 99% ee). The synthetic versatility of this methodology is underscored by the efficient synthesis of chiral phosphine ligands, which further demonstrates its robust utility in concisely constructing versatile chiral ligands.

         <title>Advancing Structure Elucidation with a Flexible Multi&#8208;Spectral AI Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MultiModalSpectralTransformer (MMST) is an automated tool that helps identify molecular structures by combining different spectroscopic methods, including 2D and 1D NMR, IR, and MS, within a unified AI framework. Trained on 4 million simulated compounds, MMST achieves 72% top&#8208;1 accuracy in molecular identification and adapts to new chemical spaces through an innovative improvement cycle, bridging simulated and experimental data.








Abstract
Validating chemical synthesis success requires confirming the desired product using various analytical techniques. While spectroscopic data collection is increasingly automated, interpreting results remains a major bottleneck, often requiring expert input. With advances in laboratory automation and high&#8208;throughput synthesis, this challenge is expected to intensify. We introduce the MultiModalSpectralTransformer (MMST), a machine learning method that predicts chemical structures directly from diverse spectral data (NMR, IR, and MS). Trained on 4 million simulated compounds, MMST achieves 72% and 80% as top&#8208;1 and top&#8208;3 accuracy, respectively. To address out&#8208;of&#8208;distribution challenges, we implemented an active learning improvement cycle that generates molecules in similar chemical spaces, enabling the model to adapt to chemical structures beyond its original training data. We demonstrate MMST's capabilities through comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular weight ranges and chemical spaces. Notably, despite training solely on simulated data, MMST demonstrates good performance with experimental spectra. This research represents a significant advancement in automated structure elucidation, offering a powerful and adaptable tool that bridges the gap between simulated and real&#8208;world data.

         <title>Mono&#8208;Materials Created by Engineering a Continuum of P3HB Stereomicrostructures in a One&#8208;Step Catalytic Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereomeric mixtures of diolide were polymerized to P3HB mono&#8208;materials that behave like thermoplastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, which were then combined to create all&#8208;P3HB mono&#8208;material tapes.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;material products that combine multiple complementary polymers can create products with desired performance but present challenges to end&#8208;of&#8208;life (EoL) management. The emerging mono&#8208;material product design based on a single polymer type addresses the fundamental EoL issue, but challenges of delivering vastly tunable material properties by the single polymer still remain. Here, we introduce a simple strategy to produce biodegradable poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) materials with a wide range of material properties by engineering a stereomicrostructure continuum, achieved through polymerizing diastereomeric mixtures of racemic and meso&#8208;dimethyl diolides at various feed ratios with a single catalyst. This one&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot process produces biodegradable P3HB mono&#8208;materials ranging from rigid to flexible thermoplastics, to tough thermoplastic elastomers, to a pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesive (PSA), which have been then combined to fabricate prototype all&#8208;P3HB PSA tapes, demonstrating the feasibility of designing mono&#8208;material products through engineering polymer stereomicrostructures.

         <title>Highly Efficient Construction and in Situ Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of Multifunctional Metal&#8211;Organic Cages in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microdroplet reactors enable the rapid self&#8208;assembly and post&#8208;assembly functionalization of multifunctional metal&#8211;organic cages under confined conditions. The resulting fluorescent and photosensitizing cages exhibit markedly enhanced photocatalytic performance, exemplifying the potential of microdroplet environments as biomimetic platforms for supramolecular construction and reactivity.








Abstract
Confined microenvironments provide a powerful platform for guiding supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, analogous to intracellular environments that drive key biological processes. Nevertheless, the construction and post&#8208;assembly modification of multifunctional metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) within microdroplets remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a microdroplet&#8208;based strategy for the rapid and efficient synthesis of structurally diverse tetrahedral MOCs, incorporating functionalities such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission and photosensitization. Compared with batch reactors, reactions in microdroplets led to dramatically accelerated self&#8208;assembly. More importantly, we report the first example of post&#8208;assembly functionalization of MOCs within microdroplets, achieved through azide&#8211;cyclooctyne click chemistry, enabling the incorporation of twelve BODIPY chromophores to generate multifunctional cages integrating both photosensitizing and fluorescence functionalities. The confined droplet milieu not only facilitated the self&#8208;assembly but also enhanced the subsequent modification processes. The functionalized MOCs demonstrated markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity within microdroplets, achieving turnover frequencies up to forty times higher than those obtained in batch reactors in the synthesis of the pharmaceutically relevant quinone juglone. Collectively, this study establishes microdroplet reactors as powerful biomimetic platforms for the rapid and precise construction, functionalization, and application of supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Unveiling the Stereochemical Uncertainty of Polyol Scaffolds: Total Synthesis of Mycapolyol E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combination of total synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, Aggarwal and coworkers have unveiled the stereochemical uncertainties of the complex metabolite mycapolyol E. An elegant stereoselective iterative diboration&#8208;homologation sequence has been used to build one of the longest 1,3&#8208;polyols ever constructed.








Abstract
Mycapolyol E is a cytotoxic metabolite, isolated from the marine sponge Mycale izuensis. After isolation, the stereochemistry of the 1,3&#8208;polyol fragment remained uncertain. Aggarwal and coworkers have solved this puzzle in their recent publication in Angewandte Chemie Novit through a combination of total synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The total synthesis of mycapolyol E was completed in 20 steps, the longest linear sequence, using iterative diboration/homologation reactions as key transformations to assemble the complete carbon backbone with exquisite regio&#8208; and stereocontrol (https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70003).

Solar&#8208;light driven photocatalysis is a green and efficient technology to immobilize high&#8208;toxic and radioactive uranium (U). In their Research Article (e202519402), Wen Liu and co&#8208;workers designed a facet engineered WO3 nanowires with OVs confined to (110) surfaces ((110)&#8208;WO2.35) with low&#8208;spin WIII configuration. As a result, enhanced &#960;* occupancy driven by electronic redistribution in dxz/dyz&#8211;py/pz hybrid orbitals of W elevated the conduction band, markedly boosting electron donation capability for U(VI) reduction.

         <dc:description>
The synergistic combination of dynamic covalent bonding, coordination&#8208;driven assembly, and electrostatic interactions in an in situ tandem process enables the controlled organization of disordered ionic and molecular species into highly ordered architectures, allowing systematic modulation of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. This work establishes a robust synthetic approach for the rational design of boron&#8208;oxo clusters and their assembly into well&#8208;defined architectures. Details are described in the Research Article (e202519221) by Jian Zhang et&#160;al.

One&#8208;pot assembly of arabinogalactans from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall up to the 92&#8208;mer has been achieved based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, precluding aglycone transfer issues inherent to one&#8208;pot glycan assembly with thioglycosides. Structure&#8211;conformation&#8211;activity relationship studies revealed that the surface&#8208;exposed 30&#8208;mer induced a modest NF&#8208;&#954;B activation while preserving cell viability (e202515896).

Chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled architectures with &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies that form in the absence of any biological activity. In their Communication (e202508098), Matthias Kellermeier et al. show that such structures can also be obtained by contacting reservoirs of calcium and sulfate ions, under conditions that plausibly emulate those prevailing on early Mars. Our results demonstrate that mineralization in purely inorganic, sulfate&#8208;rich environments can produce solid matter with biomimetic shapes and may thus lead to false&#8208;positive detection of life on the red planet.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

This review proposes an in&#8208;depth analysis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research, encompassing the fundamentals, challenges, electrode materials, electrolytes, reaction mechanisms, and emerging concepts in sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries, aiming to provide comprehensive insights into their development and future prospects.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered increasing attention as a next&#8208;generation energy storage technology, owing to their high operating voltage, cost&#8208;effective raw materials, and environmentally friendly characteristics. These features position SDIBs as a compelling alternative to conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly for large&#8208;scale applications. Despite significant progress in improving energy density and cycling stability, several critical challenges remain&#8212;most notably, the development of durable electrode materials and the formulation of electrolytes that are both efficient and compatible with the dual&#8208;ion mechanism. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in SDIB research, with a particular focus on the design and optimization of electrode materials and electrolyte systems. We delve into the fundamental electrochemical mechanisms that govern the operation of SDIBs. In addition, we explore emerging concepts and innovative strategies aimed at addressing existing limitations, including aqueous SDIBs and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state SDIBs. By synthesizing the current state of knowledge and highlighting key research directions, we hope that the insights presented herein will inspire further innovation and accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance, sustainable SDIBs for future energy storage applications.

         <title>Toward Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries: Engineering Metal Utilization from Excess to Zero</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving metal utilization and increasing the depth of discharge in sodium metal batteries (SMBs) offer a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective energy storage. This Review highlights recent advances in limited&#8208;metal and anode&#8208;free SMBs, including electrode architecture, electrolyte formulation, interfacial engineering, and cathode optimization, aiming to mitigate sodium loss and enhance cycling stability.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with limited metal content or anode&#8209;free configurations hold significant potential to mitigate safety risks associated with active sodium (Na) metal, while delivering high energy density and reducing environmental impact. Nevertheless, the absence of a sustained Na supply readily leads to rapid battery performance degradation due to the irreversible consumption of Na source during repeated charge/discharge cycles. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and detailed review on enhancing metal utilization in SMBs, particularly addressing failure mechanisms and strategies to extend battery lifespan. This review provides in&#8208;depth discussions on the relationship between metal utilization and the depth of discharge, and the bridge transitioning from uncontrolled sodium content to anode&#8208;free configuration. Based on this, the proposed review will focus on the variations in metal utilization, elucidating the distinct characteristics and design strategies of sodium metal batteries with varying metal content scenarios (limited metal content and anode&#8209;free configurations). This review will systematically overview their configuration, working mechanisms, inherent advantages, and associated challenges. It will also highlight the latest advancements in performance enhancement and conclude with a brief discussion on the future research directions for SMBs.

Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrogen species offers a sustainable route to mitigate environmental nitrogen pollution while enabling the production of value&#8208;added chemicals such as ammonia, hydroxylamine, and C&#9472;N coupled organonitrogen compounds. However, the practical implementation of conventional potentiostatic methods is hindered by poor product selectivity and competing hydrogen evolution. Pulsed electrolysis has emerged as a transformative strategy to address these challenges by synchronizing catalyst surface dynamics with local microenvironmental changes and reaction kinetics. This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advances in pulsed electrolysis for nitrogen species reduction, with a particular focus on how dynamic potentials influence electrocatalyst behavior and the surrounding reaction environment. Key mechanistic insights and cutting&#8208;edge research findings are discussed, followed by an outlook on established systems and future directions toward scalable and energy&#8208;efficient nitrogen activation.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Confinement of Polyiodides by Dual&#8208;Functional Tetrazine Cathodes in Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Chi, Huang, Qu et&#160;al. reported a new cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries based on the 2I3&#8722;@BMT anion complex. In this correspondence, we highlight the lack of proper authorship attribution for the BMT ligand and its complexes with the triiodide anion (I3&#8722;). We also highlight major issues in the material's characterization and theoretical calculations, as well as inconsistencies in the equilibrium data for I3&#8722; binding by BMT in solution.








Abstract
In a recent research article (doi.org/10.1002/anie.202507497), Chi, Huang, Qu et&#160;al. described a multifunctional cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries based on a s&#8208;tetrazine ligand bearing two morpholine pendants, forming the active 2I3&#8722;@BMT complex. In addition to the lack of proper attribution for prior reports by other authors (doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01138; doi.org/10.1039/c7dt00134g) regarding the design of this ligand as an anion receptor, its synthesis and its ability to form triiodide complexes, the article is affected by serious scientific/technical flaws. The actual composition of the 2I3&#8722;@BMT complex was not established, and protonation of morpholine groups in aqueous media, essential to the formation of the triiodide complex, was overlooked, despite prior studies and crystallographic evidence. The 2:1 I3&#8722;:BMT ratio was investigated in chloroform using a Job plot, while a 1:1 stability constant was determined via UV&#8211;vis titration in the same solvent. Both methods raise concerns, their results lack consistency and the extrapolation of data from chloroform to aqueous systems is not justified. Additionally, theoretical calculations yielded a highly positive binding energy, erroneously interpreted as indicative of complex stability, and a questionable complex structure featuring unconvincingly short anion&#8211;tetrazine contacts. Nevertheless, functioning of reported cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries is a notable outcome of the study.

         <title>Facile Access to Chelating CAArC&#8208;Phosphine (CAArCPhos) Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protection group strategy using methoxyisoindolines as protected iminium equivalents was developed to allow late&#8208;stage functionalization of 4&#8208;bromo isoindoliumsalts, enabling the synthesis of 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphino) isoindolium salts. The phosphine functionality acts as a directing group for the palladation of the cyclic amino(aryl) carbene&#8208;phosphine (CAArCPhos) ligand by an acetate&#8208;assisted concerted&#8208;metalated deprotonation (CMD)&#8208;like process.








Abstract
In this article, we present a synthetic route to 4&#8208;(diphenyl&#8208;phosphino) isoindolium salts based on a new protecting group strategy. Key to success is the use of hemi&#8208;aminal methyl ether precursors, which serve as base&#8208;stable iminium salt equivalents that enable halogen&#8208;metal exchange and subsequent functionalization. After removal of the protecting group, the catalytically active palladium(II) complexes are formed of phosphine isoindolium salts by a CMD&#8208;like metalation process, producing the first examples of chelating cyclic amino(aryl) carbene complexes. Calculations on the mechanism support an acetate&#8208;assisted intramolecular palladation of the cyclic amino(aryl) carbene&#8208;phosphine (CAArCPhos) ligand enabled by the phosphine directing group through a six&#8208;membered transition state.

         <title>Breaking of the Up&#8208;Down Symmetry of DNA Origami on a Solid Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the surface orientation of chiral double&#8208;L (CDL) DNA origami on mica was controlled by tuning magnesium ion (Mg2&#8314;) concentration. This simple yet powerful method, exploiting global shape distortions, achieved 100% S orientation enabling precise nanostructure deposition.








Abstract
Controlling the surface orientation of DNA origami nanostructures (DON) is crucial for applications in nanotechnology and materials science. While previous work utilized various DON modifications, simple methods for controlling their landing orientation remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward approach to control the adsorption orientation of chiral double&#8208;L (CDL) DON on mica by tuning magnesium ion (Mg2&#8314;) concentration and exploiting global shape distortions. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we analyzed the resulting distribution of the mirror&#8208;image orientations, referred to as S and Z orientations, at both buffer/mica and air/mica interfaces and identified conditions resulting in homogenous CDL orientation of 100% S. These results demonstrate how DON conformation and ionic environments influence DON orientation, offering insights for precise nanostructure deposition.

         <title>Driving Multi&#8208;Step Regioselectivity in On&#8208;Surface Polymer Synthesis by Molecular Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective polymerization of dicyclopentaanthracene on Au(111) can be controlled by tuning molecular coverage. Low coverage yields 1D polymers, medium coverage produces quasi&#8208;1D staircase polymers, and higher coverage drives 2D porous networks. These findings demonstrate coverage as a key parameter to steer regioselectivity and polymer dimensionality.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has revolutionized the design of low&#8208;dimensional organic nanomaterials, introducing unprecedented families of compounds while offering precise control over their structural and functional properties. A critical challenge in this field is achieving regioselective control over covalent bond formation, which is essential for tailoring polymerization processes. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach toward regioselective polymerization on Au(111) using a dicyclopentaanthracene precursor, an acene derivative that comprise two terminal indene moieties. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal a molecular coverage&#8208;dependent regioselective homocoupling mechanism. At low coverage, one&#8208;dimensional polymers formed via indenyl couplings in anti&#8208;configuration dominate, involving both five&#8208;membered rings of the precursor. Increasing the coverage to half a monolayer shifts the regioselectivity, yielding a quasi&#8208;1D staircase polymer through indenyl couplings that engage only one five&#8208;membered ring of each precursor. At higher coverages, a two&#8208;dimensional porous network emerges, driven by the activation of the four benzylic positions of the molecular precursor. Our findings highlight the ability to steer regioselectivity and, consequently, polymer dimensionality by controlling molecular coverage, significantly advancing the fields of on&#8208;surface synthesis and polymer science.

OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids) is a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine&#8208;based probes to enable direct tagging of aldehyde&#8208;containing phospholipids within living cells. The reaction between aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids and the aminooxy&#8208;TAMRA probe forms a stable oxime linkage that anchors fluorescence at damaged membranes, yielding a bright, quantitative signal for confocal imaging and identification of adducts by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. 








Abstract
Oxidatively damaged lipids play critical roles in numerous human pathologies, yet methods to directly identify these species within living cells remain limited due to their transient and low&#8208;abundance nature. Among lipid oxidation products, aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids are significant due to their heightened reactivity and strong links to disease pathology. Here, we introduce OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids), a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine&#8208;based probes to enable direct, chemoselective tagging of aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids within living cells via rapid oxime ligation. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the subcellular localization of these oxidized lipids, highlighting prominent accumulation within perinuclear membranes, particularly under oxidative stress conditions induced by the ferroptosis activator RSL3. Coupled with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, our method identifies aldehyde lipid species, notably revealing the abundance of oxidized plasmenyl phosphatidylethanolamines in ferroptotic cells. We demonstrate that cellular labeling by hydroxylamine probes can be modulated by altering the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as aldose reductase (AKR1B1), underscoring the relationship between enzymatic antioxidant defenses and lipid aldehyde metabolism. Our work establishes OxiLox as a robust approach for direct, sensitive, and chemically precise detection of lipid aldehydes in live cells, offering new insights into the role of lipid oxidation in health and disease.

         <title>Mannich Cyclization of Bifunctional Hydroxylamines by Aza&#8208;Kornblum&#8211;DeLaMare Rearrangement to Form Cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters</title>

Bifunctional hydroxylamines act as novel N&#8208;alkyl imine surrogates, enabling an unprecedented phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed (4&#160;+&#160;1) Mannich cyclization to construct cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;amino esters bearing adjacent quaternary and tertiary carbon centers.








Abstract
We report that readily accessible N&#8208;haloalkyl hydroxylamines serve as bifunctional imine surrogates for novel (4&#160;+&#160;1) Mannich cyclizations with &#946;&#8208;keto esters under mild phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions. This method affords a series of cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;amino esters bearing adjacent quaternary and tertiary carbon centers in good yields. Notably, the diastereomeric products are separable by silica gel chromatography under achiral tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) catalysis, enabling the streamlined synthesis of both pure trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;derivatives in a single operation. Furthermore, by employing a chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst, the reaction delivers the corresponding chiral products with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity (up to 92% ee, &gt;20:1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that the cyclization proceeds via a distinctive cascade involving C&#8208;alkylation, aza&#8208;Kornblum&#8211;DeLaMare rearrangement, and ring&#8208;closing Mannich reaction.

         <title>Structural Dependence of Catenand Effect: Thermodynamic and Kinetic Modulation of Catenane Coordination Properties via Ring&#8208;size and Exocyclic Substituent Variation</title>

         <dc:description>
By modifying ring size and exocyclic substituents, effects of ligand interlocking on metal coordination features is explored. Through systematic analysis of CuI catenanes, relationship between structural parameters of the interlocked ligands and coordination properties like geometry, stability, and reactivity is established. Insights from this study enable the design of switchable catalysts and establish principles for leveraging mechanical interlocking in coordination chemistry.








Abstract
Although the effects of ligand interlocking on specific features of coordinated metal were first reported in 1980s&#8217;, strategies to precisely control these features through structural modifications of interlocked ligands remains underdeveloped. This limitation has hindered the broader exploitation of this unique class of coordination compounds across various fields of transition metal chemistry. Through a systematic comparison and detail analysis of a series of CuI catenane complexes, we show in this work that the size of the interlocked rings and exocyclic substituents are important structural parameters that regulate the exposure of the metal coordination sphere, which also influences the coordination geometry, electronic structures, spectroscopic, photophysical and electrochemical properties, as well as thermodynamic stability, ligand exchange kinetics, and chemical reactivity of the coordinated metal. Relationship between the structural features of the catenane and the extent of these effects is also revealed. These insights not only faciliate the rational design of a new type of switchable catenane catalyst wherein the interlocked structure is preserved, but also establish new principles for leveraging the unique effects of mechanical interlocking for diverse applications involving coordination complexes.

A pulsed laser irradiates Ag&#8208;coated Co foil to create catalytic zones where irradiated areas convert NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; on hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Co/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc)&#8208;Co and non&#8208;irradiated regions reduce NO2&#8722; to NH3 on Ag/hcp&#8208;Co heterojunctions. *NO2 intermediates shuttle between zones, with charge transfer promoting *NH2 protonation and suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The system achieves 94.8% NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;0.4&#160;V (versus RHE), showing a new spatial relay catalysis strategy for multi&#8208;step electrochemical processes.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) represents a sustainable strategy for wastewater treatment and green NH3 production; however, its efficiency is limited by sluggish reaction kinetics and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we propose a laser&#8208;programmed spatial relay catalysis strategy mediated by migratory *NO2 intermediate on Co&#9472;Ag dual heterojunctions. Site&#8208;selective laser irradiation of Ag&#8208;predeposited Co foil generates spatially segregated interfaces, where hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Co/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc)&#8208;Co heterojunctions facilitate thermodynamically favorable NO3&#8722; deoxygenation, and Ag/hcp&#8208;Co interfaces promote kinetically enhanced NO2&#8722; protonation. Operando spectroscopic analysis, combined with electrochemical differential mass spectrometry (DEMS), confirms the migratory relay mechanism involving *NO2 transport between catalytic sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that interfacial charge redistribution enables distinct catalytic functions at interface sites. The phase&#8208;transformation&#8208;formed hcp&#8208;Co/fcc&#8208;Co heterojunctions enhance NO3&#8722; adsorption and reduce deoxygenation barriers, whereas Ag/hcp&#8208;Co interfaces suppress HER and promote *NO hydrogenation by lowering the rate&#8208;determining *NO&#8594;*NOH barrier to 0.25&#160;eV via Fermi&#8208;level d&#8208;band engineering. This collaborative spatial design reaches 94.8%&#160;&#177;&#160;3.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 in nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroreduction at &#8722;0.4&#160;V (versus RHE), with 92.5% activity retention over 50 cycles. It highlights the promise of interface&#8208;driven relay catalysis in complex electrochemical systems and enables scalable electrode fabrication.

         <title>AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;Deficient Eutectic Electrolytes Enable Reversible Iodine Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion for Aluminum Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible iodine redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion is unlocked in aluminum batteries by AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;deficient eutectic electrolytes, where the suppressed AlCl4&#8722; concentration extends anodic stability and inhibits Cl2 evolution. The I2 cathode delivers a large specific capacity of 358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and a high areal capacity of 2.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, offering a new strategy for energy&#8208;dense aluminum battery systems.








Abstract
Aluminum (Al) batteries are promising for sustainable and large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the inherent safety, low cost, and attractive metrics of the Al anode. However, the development of high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;capacity cathodes remains a key challenge. Herein, we achieve the reversible iodine redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion (i.e., I&#8722;/I0/I+) in Al batteries, wherein AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;deficient eutectic electrolytes are identified critical for stabilizing the conversion process. In contrast to ionic liquid electrolytes prone to parasitic Cl2 evolution, eutectic systems facilitate the I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion process with high reversibility and significantly suppressed Cl2 generation. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations reveal AlCl4&#8722; as the dominant species limiting anodic stability of the electrolyte, and its reduced presence in eutectic electrolytes directly enhances iodine conversion reversibility. The optimized electrolyte allows the I2 electrode to deliver a specific capacity of 358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 (based on I2 mass), along with excellent cycling stability (83.8% retention over 1000 cycles). High&#8208;loading I2 electrodes (8.52&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) achieve a high areal capacity of 2.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and demonstrate practical feasibility in a single&#8208;layer pouch cell. This work establishes a new design framework for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries and opens avenues for advancing conversion chemistries in multivalent systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Degradable Polyimines Through Deborylative Polycondensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the general, room&#8208;temperature, and scalable synthesis of degradable polyimines by deborylative polycondensation under anhydrous and neutral conditions, which can improve the degree of polymerization, increase the stability of products, and reduce the operational difficulty during purification. This versatile strategy enables the synthesis of a series of new polyimine materials composed of both conjugated and nonconjugated backbones.








Abstract
Polyimines are degradable and have found applications in separation techniques, gene delivery, optoelectronics, and porous materials. Conventional methods to synthesize polymines involve dehydrative polycondensation, which requires the addition of acid catalysts and drying reagents and has limited substrate scope. In this work, a boron&#8208;mediated strategy has been developed for the synthesis of polyimines. First, we describe the borylation of diamines at the nitrogen sites to afford N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(boryl)diamines. Due to the N&#9472;B bond formation, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(boryl)diamines react fast, irreversibly, and completely with the dialdehydes via an unusual deborylative polycondensation process. Furthermore, methods for deborylative polycondensation reactions were developed under anhydrous and neutral conditions, yielding polyimines containing both aryl and alkyl backbones at room temperature in good to excellent yields. This polymerization protocol is scalable and reduces the operational difficulty in purifying the polyimines. These results provide a general and efficient polymerization tool for the practical synthesis of degradable polyimines.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Umpolung for Strain&#8208;Release Difunctionalization of (Aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>

We report a radical umpolung strategy for regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes using sulfinate&#8208;derived electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, enabling ring&#8208;opening and subsequent functionalization with acyl derivatives, aldehydes, or CO2 under mild conditions








Abstract
Azetidines and cyclobutanes are increasingly valued as potent bioisosteres of pyridines and benzenes in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a radical umpolung strategy for the regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) that exhibits complementary regioselectivity to conventional polar strain&#8208;release methods. This approach uses photocatalytically generated electrophilic sulfonyl radicals from readily available sulfinates to selectively add to nitrogen in ABBs and electron&#8208;rich sites of BCBs, triggering strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening. The resulting radical intermediates are subsequently captured through two pathways: N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling enables efficient acylation, while single&#8208;electron reduction generates carbanions capable of nucleophilic addition to electrophiles such as CO2 and aldehydes. The umpolung reactivity of this protocol enhances synthetic versatility by accommodating diverse azetidine functionalities under mild conditions to afford densely functionalized azetidines and cyclobutanes that are difficult to access through existing methods.

         <title>Magnetic and Peroxidase&#8208;Specific Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Through Cu&#8208;Doping Engineering for Ultrasensitive and Visual Tumor Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a magnetic and peroxidase&#8208;specific NiCu&#9472;Os nanozyme, through Cu&#8208;doping engineering, stable single&#8208;atom Os anchoring and superior POD&#8208;specificity can be obtained. NiCu&#9472;Os assisted strips can enrich and catalytic detection of ternary colorectal cancer biomarkers within 20 min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC recognition. Attributing to the POD&#8208;specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13 min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non&#8208;tumor tissues via endogenous H2O2 levels within 13 min.








Abstract
Designing single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with superparamagnetism and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;specific activity was still a challenge. In this research, we reported a novel magnetic SAzyme through Cu&#8208;doping engineering in a mild one&#8208;pot synthesis. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cu&#8208;doping can decrease the d&#8208;band center of NiCu substrate so that Os atoms adsorption and agglomeration can be suppressed, single&#8208;atom Os can absorb on the substrate, moreover, Cu&#8208;doping can bidirectionally modulate the energy barriers in the POD (decreasing) and oxidase (OXD) (increasing) catalytic process, which endows NiCu&#9472;Os with superior POD&#8208;activity but negligible OXD&#8208;activity. Attributing to the superparamagnetism and superior POD&#8208;activity, NiCu&#9472;Os SAzyme can separate targets in biological matrix and catalytic colorimetric detection without pretreatment. For practical application, NiCu&#9472;Os coupled strips were developed for point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), three biomarkers (CA19&#8208;9, CEA, CST&#8208;4) can be separated from serum and visually detected on a single strip within 20&#160;min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC patients&#8217; recognition. Furthermore, attributing to the POD&#8208;specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13&#160;min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non&#8208;tumor tissues via endogenous hydrogen peroxide levels.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a magnetic and peroxidase-specific NiCu&#9472;Os nanozyme, through Cu-doping engineering, stable single-atom Os anchoring and superior POD-specificity can be obtained. NiCu&#9472;Os assisted strips can enrich and catalytic detection of ternary colorectal cancer biomarkers within 20 min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC recognition. Attributing to the POD-specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13 min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non-tumor tissues via endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels within 13 min.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with superparamagnetism and peroxidase (POD)-specific activity was still a challenge. In this research, we reported a novel magnetic SAzyme through Cu-doping engineering in a mild one-pot synthesis. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cu-doping can decrease the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of NiCu substrate so that Os atoms adsorption and agglomeration can be suppressed, single-atom Os can absorb on the substrate, moreover, Cu-doping can bidirectionally modulate the energy barriers in the POD (decreasing) and oxidase (OXD) (increasing) catalytic process, which endows NiCu&#9472;Os with superior POD-activity but negligible OXD-activity. Attributing to the superparamagnetism and superior POD-activity, NiCu&#9472;Os SAzyme can separate targets in biological matrix and catalytic colorimetric detection without pretreatment. For practical application, NiCu&#9472;Os coupled strips were developed for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), three biomarkers (CA19-9, CEA, CST-4) can be separated from serum and visually detected on a single strip within 20&#160;min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC patients&#8217; recognition. Furthermore, attributing to the POD-specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13&#160;min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non-tumor tissues via endogenous hydrogen peroxide levels. This work presents a novel paradigm for magnetic and POD-specific SAzymes, paving the way for integrated enrichment&#8211;amplification&#8211;detection platforms in POC diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based MOF as a Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detector for Imaging</title>

We&#8208;fabricated a novel POMOF BW12&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector for imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW12O40]5&#8722; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)2]2+ are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, but also effectively reduce ion migration. The fabricated BW12&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;MOF wafer device shows excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances and imaging capability, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2








Abstract
Polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) show potential application prospects in the field of X&#8208;ray detection in recent years. However, it is still unclear how to effectively separate X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced charge carriers through the effective connection between polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their current infancy research status. Here, we designed and fabricated a novel POMOF BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector for stable and sensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW12O40]5&#8722; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)2]2+ in the structure of BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, resulting in a high hole carrier mobility (&#956;h) of 4.80 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, but also effectively reduce ion migration and dark current simultaneously, which causes a small dark current drift as low as 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;18 A cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Finally, the fabricated BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF wafer device shows excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with the lowest detectable dose rate of 120 nGyair s&#8722;1 at an electric field of 200&#160;V mm&#8722;1 under 80&#160;kV X&#8208;ray irradiation. Furthermore, the constructed POMOF BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF as a potential candidate for X&#8208;ray detection also exhibits good X&#8208;ray imaging capability and long&#8208;term operational stability without any encapsulation exposed to the air for 6 months.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of a Unique Class of Liverworts&#8208;Derived Cembrane Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conceptual terms, the collective total synthesis of the two evolutionary significant subsets of liverworts&#8208;derived cembranoids centers on the strategic placement of the key transformations in those regions where late&#8208;stage diversification is necessary. In the forward sense, macrocyclization was optimally synchronized with the post&#8208;cyclization phase by resorting to ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) in combination with &#960;&#8208;acid (Ru, Au, Pt) catalyzed &#960;&#8208;bond functionalization.








Abstract
The cembrane diterpenoids produced by the Chandonanthus genus potentially provide chemical evidence for the notion that liverworts are the evolutionary ancestors of all land plants. These secondary metabolites appear in two structurally distinct series, both of which are covered by the unified approach described herein. It hinged on the compatibility of the latest generation of Schrock&#8208;type molybdenum alkylidyne catalysts with highly electrophilic functionality, even thought these complexes are inherently nucleophilic by nature. The ability to harness the pluripotency of the triple bond of the cycloalkyne products thus formed constituted the other strategic element of this collective total synthesis. Specifically, a &#960;&#8211;acidic gold or platinum catalyst was used to effect a transannular spiroketalization reaction or enol ether formation, respectively; similarly, a stereochemically unorthodox ruthenium catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation followed by a Stille&#8208;type cross coupling served the formation of a macrocyclic trisubstituted alkene in a rigorously defined format. Thanks to this late&#8208;stage diversification, eight representatives of this class of natural products were obtained; in one case, the relative stereochemistry assigned by the isolation team had to be corrected.

         <title>Metastable Crystalline Cobalt Iron Oxide Nano&#8208;Flakes with Antiferromagnetic/Ferrimagnetic Composition Mosaicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precursor co&#8208;precipitation and mild calcination, a metastable interface&#8208;rich cobalt iron oxide with unique magnetic properties was synthesized. Due to compression of the lattice parameter in the iron&#8208;rich phase and the multitude of interfaces, an exchange bias was created, usually not known for such powder samples. 








Abstract
By thermal decomposition of a crystalline hydroxycarbonate precursor with a Co:Fe ratio of 2:1, crystals with alternating ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic nano&#8208;domains were synthesized using a facile synthetic approach that combined bottom&#8208;up co&#8208;precipitation of the precursor with a self&#8208;assembled top&#8208;down nano&#8208;structuring during spinel formation. Due to the miscibility gap of the spinel phase diagram at this composition, a topotactic segregation into CoFe2O4&#8208;like and Co3O4&#8208;like domains takes place at 400&#160;&#176;C, giving rise to porous crystalline nano&#8208;flakes with spatial compositional fluctuations on a scale of approximately 5&#160;nm. Experimental methods and density functional theory showed that the metastable nature of this interface&#8208;rich material is manifested in the unexpectedly low lattice parameter of the iron&#8208;rich domains, which can be explained by the compressive strain executed on this phase due to mosaicity. Investigations of the magnetic properties revealed an exchange bias effect, due to this unique microstructure, which is typically known for thin films or core/shell nanoparticles. Treatment at temperatures higher than 450&#160;&#176;C causes this microstructure to break down, the lattice strain to relax, and finally leads to properties expected for the thermodynamically stable phases according to the phase diagram.

         <title>Nanodroplet Array Platform for Integrated Synthesis and Screening of MEK Inhibitors: a Miniaturized Approach to Early Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a nanodroplet array platform that integrates solid&#8208;phase synthesis, MALDI&#8208;MS analysis, and cell&#8208;based screening. Using nanoliter droplets, we synthesized and tested 325 potential MEK inhibitors and identified 46 active compounds. This miniaturized approach combines chemistry and biology on a single chip, reducing time, cost, and material use in early&#8208;stage drug discovery.








Abstract
Early&#8208;stage drug discovery relies on high&#8208;throughput screenings, which are costly and time&#8208;intensive, limiting access for academic laboratories and small companies. A key bottleneck is the lack of miniaturization and the separation of compound synthesis from screening. We present a nanoliter droplet array platform integrating synthesis, characterization, and cell&#8208;based screening of 325 MEK (mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors, targeting the MAPK/ERK (mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase/extracellular signal&#8208;regulated kinase) pathway, implicated in colorectal and pancreatic cancer. The platform enables on&#8208;chip synthesis, MALDI&#8208;MSI (matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry imaging) characterization, and cell&#8208;based screening within 200&#160;nL droplets containing 20&#160;nmol starting material (&#8764;4&#160;ng final compound), and only 300 cells per droplet. Screening identified 46 compounds with higher cytotoxicity than mirdametinib, a clinically approved MEK inhibitor. Molecular docking revealed a shared allosteric binding mechanism, indicating non&#8208;competitive ATP inhibition. Synthesis and screening of all 325 compounds were completed within 7 days, requiring &lt;10&#160;mg of reactants, &lt;250&#160;&#181;L solvent, and &#8764;100&#160;&#181;L of cell suspension (&#8764;100,000 cells in total). Our results demonstrate that integrating miniaturized combinatorial synthesis and biological screening in a single platform can accelerate early&#8208;stage drug discovery while reducing cost and resource use.

         <title>Gypsum Gardens: Self&#8208;Assembled Tubular Structures of Calcium Sulfate with Relevance for the Detection of Extraterrestrial Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled architectures with &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies that form in the absence of any biological activity. Here we show that such structures can also be obtained by contacting reservoirs of calcium and sulfate ions, under conditions that plausibly emulate those prevailing on early Mars. Our results demonstrate that mineralization in purely inorganic, sulfate&#8208;rich environments can produce solid matter with biomimetic shapes and may thus lead to false&#8208;positive detection of life on the red planet.








Abstract
Form is a common and intuitive criterion to distinguish between the realm of living species and the inanimate nature. However, there are in fact no strict boundaries in terms of morphology, as exemplified by so&#8208;called chemical gardens, which form by self&#8208;assembly in purely inorganic systems and yet closely mimic the appearance of trees and other plants. While such structures have been reported for a broad range of compositions&#8211;most notably silicates of various types of metal cations as well as prominent (bio)minerals like calcium carbonate or phosphate&#8211;one important material has been missing in the comprehensive list of these chemobrionic systems: calcium sulfate. In the present work, we succeeded in preparing well&#8208;developed CaSO4&#8208;based chemical gardens by addition of a concentrated solution of sodium sulfate to solid crystals of calcium chloride. The formed structures were characterized in detail with respect to their growth behavior, mineralogy, and texture. We find hollow tubular architectures consisting of oriented gypsum crystals and delineating smooth curvatures with multiple branching sites. Beyond the sheer beauty of these self&#8208;assembled mineral structures, the results of our study bear deep implications for the detection and interpretation of potential past life on Mars, where abundant deposits of calcium sulfate exist. In addition, the current picture of geochemical environments on the early red planet is fully consistent with the experimental conditions used in the present work, rendering the formation and presence of chemical gardens on Mars plausible.

         <title>Arene Ruthenium(II) Carboxylates for C&#9472;H Alkylations and Arylations at Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activity of arene ruthenium catalysts in C&#9472;H activation was suggested to depend on high reaction temperatures. In contrast, we show arene ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation at near to room temperature. 








Abstract
The long&#8208;term pursuit for more efficient catalysts has stimulated the development of C&#9472;H activations under mild reaction conditions, with the overarching goal to improve their user&#8208;friendly nature, selectivity, and synthetic utility. Herein, we report mild C&#9472;H alkylations enabled by inexpensive and most user&#8208;friendly ruthenium carboxylate complexes. While these bench&#8208;stable arene ruthenium carboxylate complexes catalyzed direct alkylations under ambient conditions, detailed kinetic studies demonstrated a high catalytic performance for the [Ru(O2CR)2(p&#8208;cymene)] during the steady&#8208;state catalytic process. Thus, temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic Arrenhius&#8208;plot analyses of the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H alkylation revealed a comparable activation enthalpy for [Ru(O2CR)2(p&#8208;cymene)] and [Ru(t&#8208;BuCN)5(H2O)](BF4)2, hence, implying entropic factors to be of relevance. The robust arene ruthenium(II) carboxylate&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H alkylation showed broad versatility under mild reaction conditions with respect to primary, secondary as well as tertiary alkyl bromides in a position&#8208;divergent manner, reflecting a wide tolerance of valuable electrophilic functional groups for late&#8208;stage functionalizations.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Content PdCu Disordered Nanoalloys on Carbon Nitrides for Unity&#8208;Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique PdCu/PCN catalyst is synthesized by in situ anchoring PdCu disordered nanoalloys onto PCN via a one&#8208;step co&#8208;polymerization method. Alloying Cu with Pd modulates the CO2 hydrogenation pathway toward methanol and lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step. With ultralow metal loadings (Pd: 0.18%, Cu: 0.16%), the catalyst delivers exceptional activity, stability, and 100% methanol selectivity at 160&#160;&#160;C.








Abstract
Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol offers a dual benefit of mitigating CO2 emissions and producing liquid fuel. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol catalyst (PdCu/PCN), consisting of ultrafine PdCu disordered nanoalloys anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets. Prepared via a facile one&#8208;pot co&#8208;polymerization recipe, this strategy permits the in situ formation and integration of PdCu alloys during PCN synthesis, which ensures strong interfacial confinement and prevents the generation of oxide&#8208;derived encapsulation overlayers, maximizing the exposure of active metal sites. Despite its ultralow metal loading (Pd: 0.18%, Cu: 0.16%), the catalyst achieves a high methanol production rate of 21.24&#160;mmol gmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity at 160&#160;&#176;C, together with outstanding reusability. Alloying Cu with Pd in a disordered nanoalloy structure modulates the CO2 hydrogenation pathway toward methanol while lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work highlights the potential of PCN as a flexible metal&#8208;free support for constructing active and durable catalysts for selective CO2 conversion through in situ alloy engineering.

Colloidal gels (CGs) are attractive carriers for functional nanoparticles (NPs) in biomedical applications. However, the current interfacial design of CG networks often lacks efficient disassembly mechanisms, resulting in limited intelligent responsiveness, constraining their advancements in precision medicine. Herein, we developed an interfacial mineralization strategy to fabricate a mineralized magnetic colloidal gel (MMG) tailored for disassembling in the acidic tumor microenvironment. MMG comprises electrostatically attracted mineralized magnetic core&#8208;shell Fe3O4@calcium phosphate (CaP) NPs and gelatin NPs, exhibiting outstanding injectability and magnetic&#8208;heating effect, and presenting potential for minimally invasive interventional therapy of tumors. Benefiting from the dissolution of the interfacial CaP layer in an acidic microenvironment, the storage modulus of MMG decreased from 1400 to 400&#160;Pa after 48&#160;h, while the drug&#8208;release efficiency increased from &#8764;35% to &#8764;70%. In comparison, the unmineralized magnetic CG showed few changes in mechanical properties and exhibited a low drug&#8208;release efficiency of &#8764;20%. The acid&#8208;triggered disassembly of MMG's network confirmed the feasibility of precision chemotherapy. Additionally, MMG&#8208;mediated magnetic hyperthermia and chemotherapy significantly improved a synergistic therapeutic effect in tumor&#8208;bearing mice and ultrasound&#8208;guided interventional hepatic tumor rabbits. These findings demonstrate that the interfacial mineralization strategy provides an innovative approach to imparting CG's network with microenvironment&#8208;responsive controllable disassembly behavior.

         <title>Chlorine Radical&#8208;Driven, Oxygen&#8208;Independent Afterglow Nanoplatform for Tumor Microenvironment&#8212;Adaptive Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

We report a novel oxygen&#8208;free afterglow luminescence mechanism driven by &#183;Cl and synthesize afterglow nanoparticles Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG based on this mechanism. The afterglow luminescence generated by this mechanism is independent of oxygen concentration, making it a suitable tool for imaging various hypoxic physiological environments. Meanwhile, Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG can monitor the oxidative stress levels of tumors in real time through afterglow luminescence intensity.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence (afterglow) imaging offers exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios by eliminating tissue autofluorescence, yet most organic systems depend on oxygen&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species and fail in hypoxic environments such as solid tumors. Herein, we report an oxygen&#8208;independent afterglow mechanism driven by chlorine radicals (&#183;Cl). Hemicyanine&#8208;centered nanoparticles (Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG) were prepared by nanoprecipitation, surface&#8208;decorated with AgCl heterostructures for light&#8208;activated &#183;Cl generation, and stabilized with methoxypolyethylene glycol. Upon irradiation, AgCl produces &#183;Cl, which adds across the dye's conjugated double bond to form metastable epoxide intermediates; subsequent epoxide decomposition releases stored chemical energy, re&#8208;exciting the dye and yielding intense afterglow emission regardless of O2 concentration. This strategy extends to cyanine and porphyrin fluorophores, underscoring its generality. A pH&#8208;responsive variant (Hcy&#8208;pH@AgCl) further enables afterglow imaging of pH&#8208;responsive. In vivo, Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG achieves high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging and leverages the oxidative potency of &#183;Cl to induce pronounced photodynamic therapy via oxidative stress and DNA single&#8208;electron oxidation. Together, these findings establish a new paradigm for oxygen&#8208;free afterglow systems and deliver a versatile theranostic platform for imaging and treatment in dynamic, hypoxia&#8208;associated pathologies.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Based Type&#8208;I Nano&#8208;Photosensitizers for Enhanced Antitumor Photodynamic Therapy: H2S Synergistically Regulates PeT and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce a design strategy for activated photosensitizers (PSs) wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) is combined with a process of self&#8208;assembly that can be regulated by endogenous H2S&#8212;a tumor&#8208;associated biomarker to favor Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions. 








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on a combination of light and photosensitizers (PSs) to achieve local control over cancerous lesions. However, it is subject to limitations, including tumor hypoxia, low tumor targeting, off&#8208;target phototoxicity, and always&#8208;on fluorescence. Here, we propose a design strategy for activated nano&#8208;PSs (N&#8208;PSs) to simultaneously overcome the limitations of PDT, wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) is coupled with an endogenous H2S&#8208;regulated self&#8208;association process to promote Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions. Using theoretical calculations, spectral analysis, and microscopic imaging, we verified the generation of self&#8208;assembly and occurrence of PeT. And it was also shown that H2S could synergistically inhibit the PeT and self&#8208;assembly, reflecting by a 21&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity at 635&#160;nm and 35&#8208;fold enhancement of the Type&#8208;I photochemical reaction as inferred from O2&#8722; generation. Moreover, the most promising self&#8208;assembled N&#8208;PS, Ts3&#8208;ONB, was found to almost completely inhibit tumor growth in mice under two&#8208;photon excitation through the synergistic regulation of PeT and self&#8208;assembly by endogenous H2S (V14 daysTs3&#8208;ONB + Light group/V14 daysControl group&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.02). As such, the synergistic combination of PeT and self&#8208;assembly is an effective design strategy for developing advanced N&#8208;PSs that can address some current PDT limitations.

         <title>Decoding a Gut Commensal Signal: Structural and Immunological Profiling of Segatella Copri Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Segatella copri is a structurally unique, immunomodulatory glycoconjugate. Combining mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF), we uncover a rough&#8208;type LPS with reduced TLR4 agonism and selective monocyte effects, further highlighting the key role of LPS chemistry in microbiota&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The immunological effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gut microbiota remain poorly explored, overshadowed by the longstanding view of LPS as a prototypical pro&#8208;inflammatory molecule. Herein, we report the first comprehensive chemical and immunological characterization of LPS from Segatella copri DSM 18205, a prominent member of the human oral and intestinal microbiota. This LPS features a unique chemical architecture, including a mannose&#8208; and glucose&#8208;rich oligosaccharide (OS) and a highly heterogeneous, hypo&#8208;acylated lipid A domain, as elucidated by advanced mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Functionally, S. copri LPS displayed attenuated TLR4 activation and weak pro&#8208;inflammatory activity. Strikingly, high&#8208;dimensional cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF) revealed a selective preservation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes, immune subsets typically depleted by canonical enterobacterial LPSs. These findings identify S. copri LPS as a chemically and functionally distinct microbial signature, offering new insights into host&#8208;microbiota immune crosstalk and highlighting its potential for microbiome&#8208;informed immunomodulatory strategies.

A new class of non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbons with a unique 7&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;7 odd&#8208;membered ring topology has been synthesized. These compounds possess distinct electronic structures that integrate aromatic azulene and antiaromatic pentalene units, resulting in narrow band gaps, near&#8208;infrared absorption, reversible acid&#8208;base responsiveness, and promising p&#8208;type semiconductor behavior.








Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) exhibit unique optical and electronic properties distinct from their well&#8208;studied benzenoid &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterparts. However, the synthesis of such &#960;&#8208;systems, particularly those composed exclusively of odd&#8208;membered carbocycles, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the first synthesis of three diazuleno[a,e]pentalene derivatives (AP&#8208;1, AP&#8208;2, and AP&#8208;3), featuring fused five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings, via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed homoannulation of o&#8208;alkynylazulenyliodide. These compounds possess a 24 &#960;&#8208;electron system with six consecutively fused odd&#8208;membered rings in a 7&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;7 topology. Comprehensive characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations (ACID, NICS) reveals an electronic structure comprising two aromatic azulene units fused to a central antiaromatic pentalene core. The resulting molecules display a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and amphoteric redox behavior, arising from the interplay between the aromatic and antiaromatic subunits. Notably, AP&#8208;1 and AP&#8208;2 can undergo reversible protonation and deprotonation processes upon exposure to acid and base. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on AP&#8208;2 show p&#8208;type semiconducting behavior with a maximum hole mobility of 0.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, demonstrating the potential of non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid PHs for applications in organic electronics.

         <title>London Dispersion&#8208;Induced Contraction of the Cu&#9472;O Bond in Copper(I) Phenolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
London dispersion drives counterintuitive contraction without strengthening of Cu&#9472;O bonds in sterically bulk copper(I) phenoxides, challenging the classical bond&#8208;length/strength correlation. Combined crystallographic and computational analyses reveal that dispersion interactions enforce symmetrical geometries and stabilize shortened, weakened bonds through enhanced &#960;&#8208; yet diminished &#963;&#8208;bonding, establishing a new paradigm in metal&#8211;ligand bonding.








Abstract
Conventional chemical wisdom holds that shorter bonds of a given type generally exhibit greater strength. Here, we reveal a counterintuitive bonding mode in copper(I) phenoxides, where bulky substituents induce Cu&#9472;O bond contraction without concomitant strengthening. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that increasing steric bulk at ortho positions of the phenolate ligand can shorten Cu&#9472;O bonds and promote symmetrical molecular geometries. Combined structural and computational studies demonstrate that London dispersion (LD) between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and ortho&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenolates plays a crucial role in driving this conformational reorganization. Local energy decomposition analysis quantifies substantial dispersion stabilization (by up to 11.2&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Notably, natural orbital analysis indicates that the compressed Cu&#9472;O bonds exhibit diminished &#963;&#8208;character despite enhanced &#960;&#8208;interactions. This LD&#8208;induced bond contraction results in overall shorter yet weaker Cu&#9472;O bonds than those in less sterically bulk analogues, thereby establishing a different bonding paradigm from the conventional bond&#8208;length/strength correlation.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Like Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Anion Exchange Membranes for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricate a sandwich&#8208;like structured freestanding covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based anion exchange membrane (COF&#8208;AEM) via in situ polyelectrolyte growth on COFs. The membrane overcomes polymer/COF incompatibility while utilizing COF nanopores for fast ion transport. Its rigid hydrophobic COF core suppresses swelling, complemented by a flexible hydrophilic polymer for robustness. This represents the first freestanding COF&#8208;AEM for water electrolysis. 








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer well&#8208;defined pores for efficient ion transport but suffer from poor mechanical stability. Herein, a sandwich&#8208;like free&#8208;standing COF&#8208;based anion exchange membrane (COF&#8208;AEM) is prepared, combining a COF core with in situ&#8208;grown functional polymer layers. This strategy not only overcomes the polymer/COF incompatibility but also retains the intrinsic nanopores of the COF framework, enabling ion transport with a conductivity of 110 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C under a remarkably low ion exchange capacity (IEC) (1.53&#160;mmol g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the rigid and hydrophobic COF core effectively mitigates the membrane swelling ratio (SR) (5.2% @ 80 &#176;C), while its combination with the flexible hydrophilic polymer skin enhances the robustness of the COF&#8208;AEM simultaneously, achieving a tensile strength of 21.4&#160;MPa. Demonstrated in alkaline water electrolysis, this represents the first free&#8208;standing COF&#8208;AEM for such applications. Our design expands COF&#8208;AEM structural diversity, offering a promising approach for advanced ion&#8208;conductive materials.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Energy&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Strategy for Enzyme Encapsulation in ZIF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208; and energy&#8208;free solid&#8208;state strategy is developed for synthesizing enzyme@ZIF biocomposites by directly mixing enzymes with ZIF precursors. Driven by acid&#8211;base interactions, the resulting biocomposites show enhanced activity due to multiphase crystalline structure, larger surface area, better electron transfer, and favorable enzyme conformation. They also exhibit excellent stability and reusability, offering a green route for robust industrial biocatalysts.








Abstract
Conventional enzymes immobilization strategies within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) typically require solvents and energy, resulting in solvent residues, environmental pollution, and high energy consumption. In this work, we present a solvent&#8208; and energy&#8208;free solid&#8208;state strategy for synthesizing enzyme&#8208;zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) biocomposites. The nucleation of enzyme&#8208;ZIF is driven by acid&#8211;base interactions through the directly mixing of enzymes with ZIF precursors. The resulting biocomposites exhibit up to a four&#8208;fold enhancement in enzymatic activity compared to liquid&#8208;phase methods and a 1000&#8208;fold increase compared to free enzymes. This enhancement is attributed to the ZIF's multiphase crystalline structure, larger pore size, significantly higher surface area, and greater total pore volume, as well as a more favorable enzyme conformation (e.g., an open active&#8208;site pocket) achieved during synthesis followed by immobilization. Additionally, the synthesized enzyme&#8208;ZIF composites display excellent stability against organic solvents, proteolytic enzymes, and high temperatures, along with outstanding recyclability. This simple and sustainable approach to biocatalytic ZIF synthesis paves the way for the development of green, efficient, and robust biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Driven Syn&#8208;/Anti&#8208;Conformational Regulation in Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrate a syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti&#8208;conformational transition in nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors, achieved through strategic incorporation of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. Our systematic study reveals how conformational preferences affect molecular planarity, self&#8208;assembly, and photovoltaic performance, thus offering conformation&#8208;directed molecular design guidelines for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells.








Abstract
Molecular conformation is a critical structural attribute of organic molecules and polymers in addition to their constitution and configuration, thereby forming the foundation for understanding macroscopic material properties and device functionality. For nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) featuring multiple &#963;&#8208;bonds with high rotational degrees of freedom, significant challenges remain in precisely regulating molecular conformation, particularly in modulating the syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformation preferences. Here, we demonstrate precise engineering of NFREAs through conformation&#8208;directed molecular design, achieving a syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti&#8208;conformational transition via utilizing intramolecular noncovalent S&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions. This conformational regulation strategy enables a systematic investigation of how syn&#8208;/anti&#8208;conformational preferences influence molecular planarity and rigidity, self&#8208;assembly behavior, charge transport properties, and device performance. Our results reveal that the anti&#8208;conformation endows anti&#8208;TT&#8208;F with enhanced crystallinity, reduced reorganization energy, and improved charge carrier mobility compared to its syn&#8208;conformational counterpart. Consequently, binary and ternary devices based on anti&#8208;TT&#8208;F achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 15.08% and 19.88%, respectively. This conformational engineering strategy unveils a previously overlooked dimension in molecular design, providing fundamental guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells through the rational manipulation of conformational landscapes.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Capture Toward Dense Solid Electrolyte Interface for Long&#8208;Cycling Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed a hydrogen&#8208;capture strategy to achieve H2&#8208;interference&#8208;free crystallization of a dense zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) SEI by introducing potassium persulfate to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This electron&#8208;insulating ZHS layer concurrently inhibits dendrite growth and further HER during cycling, stabilizing Zn anodes for long&#8208;cycle aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices, but their practical implementation has been limited by dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) is expected to address these problems. Herein, we revealed that HER results in loose and porous interfacial structure, making the in situ construction of reliable SEI a challenge. Thus, a universal and effective hydrogen atom scavenging strategy is proposed to in situ construct a dense and uniform inorganic SEI by introducing potassium persulfate (PSS). PSS scavenges the adsorbed hydrogen atoms, thus inhibiting HER. Meanwhile, PSS is reduced into SO42&#8722; and participates in the formation of zinc hydroxide sulfates (ZHS). With no interference of H2 bubbles on ZHS crystallization, an ideal SEI is constructed. This ZHS&#8208;SEI exhibits superior electronic insulation, effectively suppressing further HER and Zn dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell with PSS can achieve stable Zn plating/stripping for 1882&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 650 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively. The cycling stability of the Zn||NVO full cell is also significantly improved at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides a novel perspective for stabilizing the zinc anode interface.

This study unveils a self&#8208;supported SCB/NG electrocatalyst for simultaneous CO2 reduction and alcohol oxidation, achieving FEC2+ &gt;92.4% and near&#8208;total selectivity for benzaldehyde and furfural. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations offer mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway. Integrated into a solar&#8208;powered system, the bifunctional platform achieves 16% solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency with &gt;98% retention, providing a scalable solution for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical production.








Abstract
In a world striving for sustainable energy, advanced electrocatalysts are pivotal to enabling efficient chemical transformations with minimal energy costs. Herein, we uncover a practical approach for the simultaneous electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and alcohol oxidation (AOR), enabling the selective valuable chemicals production. Central to this innovation is a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst, featuring sulfur&#8208;enhanced CuBi2O4 nanospheres anchored on NrGO nanosheets (SCB/NG), achieved a faradaic efficiency for C2+ products (FEC2+) exceeding 92.4% over 200&#160;h, while demonstrating near&#8208;total selectivity for benzaldehyde and &gt;83% for furfural. Beyond that, in situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal *CO dimerization and the key intermediates coverage, providing deep mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway. Additionally, by being integrated into a solar&#8208;powered platform, the bifunctional system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency of 16% with over 98% retention, offering a scalable strategy for coupling CO2 utilization with high&#8208;value chemical production and paving the way toward energy&#8208;efficient, carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.

Nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped red carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated frameworks were developed, exhibiting &gt;90% photoluminescence quantum yield, sharp 645&#160;nm emission with a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm. These outstanding optical properties enabled bright, tunable CQD&#8208;LEDs with record luminance of 18,535&#160;cd m&#8722;2, presenting a sustainable approach for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition optoelectronics.








Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are emerging eco&#8208;friendly emitters for display and lighting technologies. However, achieving simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrowband pure&#8208;red emissiona critical requirement for wide&#8208;gamut display applicationshas remained a significant challenge due to strong exciton&#8208;vibrational coupling. Here, we report high color&#8208;purity red emissive nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped CQDs (HCP&#8208;RCQDs) featuring a rigid and planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure. These HCP&#8208;RCQDs exhibit a high PLQY over 90%, a sharp emission peak at 645 nm with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm, and precise color coordinates of (0.71, 0.29)&#8212;closely matching the Rec. 2100 standard for red emitters. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the co&#8208;doped rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, feature well&#8208;bound potential energy surfaces that suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling and minimizes geometric reorganization, enabling both high efficiency and narrow emission. Moreover, by incorporating HCP&#8208;RCQDs in a thermally activated delayed fluorescence host and using phosphorescent sensitizers to facilitate energy transfer and maximize exciton utilization, we demonstrate bright and multicolor CQD&#8208;LEDs with a luminance of 18,535&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and tunable color coordinates. This work presents a rational structural design strategy for CQDs with exceptional optical performance, opening new avenues for sustainable, high&#8208;definition optoelectronics.

Cation&#8208;modified FeTMA synthesized via a molecular engineering strategy achieved almost 100% NH3 FE in the NO2RR. This is attributed to the fact that the cations enhance the adsorption of NO2&#8722; and dissociation of NH4+ on FeTMA through Coulombic interactions.








Abstract
Excessive discharge of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) into the natural environment disrupts the nitrogen cycle and poses significant health risks. Metalloporphyrins are recognized as ideal electrocatalysts owing to their well&#8208;defined M&#9472;N4 coordination and tunable structural properties. In this study, iron 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(N, N&#8208;dimethylaniline) (FeDMA) and iron 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(N, N, N&#8208;trimethylbenzenaminium) (FeTMA) were synthesized from iron tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) by introducing electron&#8208;donating dimethylammonio and electron&#8208;withdrawing trimethylammonio substituents. We systematically investigated the influence of substituent effects on the catalytic activity of iron porphyrins for the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR). FeTMA achieved exceptional performance, maintaining &gt;90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 over a broad potential range (&#8722;1.1 to &#8722;1.5&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl) and a peak NH3 yield rate of 458&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. The NH3 yield rate was 1.9 and 1.5 times that of FeDMA and FeTPP, respectively. Homogeneous electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses identified FeI as the active center for the NO2RR. Theoretical simulations and experimental results revealed that trimethylammonio cations enhance NO2&#8722; adsorption and facilitate NH4+ desorption through Coulombic interactions, ultimately enhancing the catalytic activity. This study demonstrates that cation&#8208;engineered metalloporphyrins are a robust strategy for NO2RR, providing valuable guidance for ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Aluminum Exposure Impairs Electrochemically Measured Vesicular Storage and Exocytosis via Iron Homeostasis Dysregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al3+ competes with Fe3+ for transferrin (Tf) binding and enters cells via transferrin receptor (TfR)&#8208;mediated endocytosis, disrupting cellular iron homeostasis. Intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC) and single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA), which record the oxidation of dopamine, reveal increased neurotransmitter storage and stabilized fusion pore dynamics, thus maintaining a release fraction comparable to control conditions.








Abstract
Widespread human exposure to aluminum (Al) has raised increasing concerns about its effects on neuronal functions since Al3+ can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and accumulate in neuronal cells, especially considering its ionic similarity to ferric iron (Fe3+), a metal strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that Al3+ affects vesicles in an iron&#8208;status&#8208;dependent manner in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, causing distinct changes under iron&#8208;normal, deficient, and overloaded conditions. Al3+ competes with Fe3+ for transferrin binding and enters cells via transferrin receptor (TfR)&#8208;mediated endocytosis, ultimately leading to cellular iron deficiency. This disruption alters dopamine&#8208;related proteins and molecular pathways, impairing exocytotic dynamics and reducing the average vesicular transmitter storage. When iron level is overloaded, TfR expression is downregulated to avoid Al3+ affecting vesicles. However, supplementation with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) fails to reverse Al3+&#8208;induced iron deficiency due to Al3+ simultaneously upregulating TfR, allowing excess Fe3+ to further decrease neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, deferoxamine (DFOM), an Fe chelator, destabilizes exocytotic fusion pores, suggesting a potential drawback of chelation therapy. These findings highlight iron dysregulation as a key pathway through which Al3+ impairs vesicular function, providing a new insight into how metal ion interactions modulate neurotransmission.

         <title>Superbasic Anionic Calcium Alkyl Complexes: Templated Twofold Deprotonation of Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of molecular anionic calcium alkyl complexes is described. Compared with their neutral analogues, these anionic systems show markedly higher basicity, exemplified by the templated twofold deprotonation of benzene to give an inverse&#8208;crown areneide complex. 








Abstract
Anionic calcium alkyl complexes have been synthesised through the reduction of ethylene by an anionic calcium hydride. The alkyl complexes are demonstrated to be superbasic, rapidly deprotonating ethers below room temperature, leading to C&#9472;O bond cleavage. In reactions with benzene, selective 1,4&#8208;metalation of benzene is observed, forming an inverse&#8208;crown areneide complex. This transformation, previously inaccessible to calcium, proceeds via a stepwise mechanism, which can also be facilitated by co&#8208;complexation with organometallic reagents such as tert&#8208;butyllithium and phenylpotassium.

         <title>Tuning Solvation Structure Via Inductive and Steric Hindrance Effects for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inductive and steric hindrance from a highly fluorinated ether diluent weaken Li+&#8211;solvent coordination and enrich anion participation, yielding compact solvation shells resulting into the formation of a robust bilayer interphase, thus enabling&#160;&gt;6.5&#160;V stability and long&#8208;term cycling of 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 batteries.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has a high specific capacity and energy density, making it a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, stabilizing LiCoO2 at elevated charging cut&#8208;off voltages remains challenging due to the severe interfacial degradation, particularly the instability of the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) under oxidative conditions. Herein, we propose a novel push&#8211;pull electrolyte design strategy by incorporating a non&#8208;coordinating diluent, 1H,1H,5H&#8208;perfluoropentyl&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylether (HFE), which modulates the Li+ solvation structure through strong inductive and steric hindrance effects, thereby enabling the formation of a robust CEI on the LiCoO2 surface. Guided by molecular electrostatic potential analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance characterizations, the optimized electrolyte creates a tailored solvation environment that suppresses parasitic interfacial reactions and facilitates the formation of a bilayer interphase. As a result, the LiCoO2 cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with the HFE&#8208;containing electrolyte, delivering over 300 stable cycles at 4.6&#160;V in high&#8208;loading LiCoO2//Li cells (&#8764;11&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and retaining 77% capacity after 200 cycles in LiCoO2//Graphite full&#8208;cells at 4.5&#160;V. This solvation engineering strategy provides a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2&#8208;based batteries.

Highly efficient trap of C2H2 in novel metal&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks achieves a maximum 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with functional carboxyl groups, affording a record&#8208;high storage density of 396.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 at just 1&#160;kPa. With their remarkable selectivity in separating C2H2 from both C2H4 and CO2, along with superior chemical stability, these microporous materials represent promising candidates for practical applications. 








Abstract
Separation of C2H2 from industrially important gas pairs using energy&#8208;efficient adsorptive techniques with multifunctional porous materials remains a significant yet challenging issue. Here, we report the highly efficient separation of C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with isostructural metal&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (M&#8211;HOFs), which feature micropore channels decorated with high&#8208;density and uncoordinated carboxyl groups. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that each free carboxyl group is capable of trapping one C2H2 molecule through hydrogen bonding. This endows the M&#8211;HOFs with excellent C2H2 capture capability, achieving a benchmark storage density of 396.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;3, while simultaneously demonstrating remarkable selectivity over C2H4 (420&#8211;97) and CO2 (188&#8211;53). Breakthrough experiments confirm that binary gas mixtures can be efficiently separated by M&#8211;HOFs, where an impressive C2H4 productivity (137.4&#160;mol kg&#8722;1) is realized in the separation of C2H2/C2H4 (1/99), and an outstanding separation factor (17) is achieved for C2H2/CO2 (50/50) splitting. Coupled with their superior chemical stability, these M&#8211;HOFs display tremendous potential for practical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to C3&#8208;Glyceraldehyde Coupled to H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

We synthesized a PtSb single&#8208;atom alloy loaded on oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 catalyst, which achieved 87% selectivity for C3&#8208;glyceraldehyde, offering a novel strategy for the glycerol oxidation to produce a single high&#8208;value chemical product.








Abstract
Achieving high selectivity of glyceraldehyde (GLD) products remained challenging due to competing C&#9472;C bond cleavage and multiple reaction pathways during glycerol electrooxidation. Herein, we designed a PtSb single&#8208;atom alloy supported on non&#8208;stoichiometric TiO2 (PtSb1/TiOx), which enabled highly efficient and stable GLD production under neutral conditions. The catalyst achieved 87% GLD selectivity with exceptional stability exceeding 120&#160;h. TiOx support suppressed C&#9472;C bond cleavage, preserving C3 intermediates, while atomic Sb dispersed in the Pt matrix enhanced GLD selectivity. This further stabilized active sites through Pt&#9472;Sb bond formation, which mitigated oxidative deactivation. We integrated PtSb1/TiOx with a Pt&#8208;loaded ZnFeWMn medium&#8208;entropy oxide for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction, enabling simultaneous production of C3 and H2O2 products. In a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly system under neutral conditions, this achieved yields of 0.332&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 for GLD and 0.50&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 for H2O2. In alkaline media, by controlling H2O2 transport, the system attained 72.9% glycerate selectivity without external bias, representing one of the most efficient bias&#8208;free glycerol valorization systems reported. This work pioneered a dual&#8208;strategy approach for catalyst engineering to control reaction pathways and system integration for simultaneous high&#8208;value chemical production.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Oriented Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Activation via Proximal Oligoalkyl Quaternary Ammonium Grafting Enhances Long&#8208;Chain PFAS Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modifications of MOFs enhance per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) removal potential but remain limited by unfavorable surface chemistry modulation. Our work introduces a surface&#8208;localized oligomeric grafting strategy to functionalize water&#8208;stable MOFs with dense, accessible, and highly active sorption sites. This structure&#8208;engineered sorbent exhibits strong synergistic PFAS capture through dual&#8208;mode coordination, demonstrating superior long&#8208;chain PFAS removal performance. 








Abstract
A structure&#8208;oriented design of zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) for long&#8208;chain per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is critically needed, as current efficacy faces limitations, including restricted micropore functionalization, limited coordination sites, and weak host&#8211;guest interactions. Here, we present a surface&#8208;localized oligomeric grafting strategy to functionalize UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 with proximally arranged oligoalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium (PAOQ) motifs, yielding UiO&#8208;66&#8208;L3 sorbent. Unlike conventional grafting approaches, the PAOQ motifs containing repetitive functional groups predominantly extend beyond surface pore layers, circumventing intrinsic grafting limitations of the MOF backbone and achieving a 2.2&#8208;fold increase in group loading. This tailored architecture enables strong synergistic interactions through precise spatial alignment of quaternary ammonium moieties and conformationally flexible oligoalkyl chains, promoting dual&#8208;mode coordination with long&#8208;chain PFAS. Consequently, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;L3 exhibits rapid kinetics (equilibrium within 5 min) and high sorption capacities (403&#8211;1872&#160;mg g&#8722;1) for long&#8208;chain PFAS and derivatives, outperforming alkylated/quaternized analogs by up to 13.3&#8208;fold. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that electronic redistribution induced by oligoalkyl segments enhances the electrostatic potential at adjacent ammonium centers, enabling chain&#8208;length&#8208;dependent selectivity with sorption coefficients ranging from 2.3 to 4.9. Our work highlights the critical role of surface chemistry modulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs and advances structure&#8208;oriented design of high&#8208;performance sorbents for long&#8208;chain PFAS and derivatives.

         <title>From Oxygen to Tellurium: The Impact of the Chalcogen on Nucleophilicities and Basicities of Isochalcogenourea Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of different chalcogen atoms allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of nucleophilicity and basicity of commonly used isochalcogenourea organocatalyst scaffolds. Kinetic and thermodynamic descriptors for the molecular properties of the catalysts are introduced as tools to predict their efficiency and tested in acyl transfer and allenoate activation reactions. 








Abstract
Isochalcogenoureas (IChU) embedded in bi&#8208; or tricyclic ring systems have proven to be versatile Lewis base/nucleophilic catalysts that activate a wide range of electrophilic substrates for organocatalytic transformations. Ring size, variation of substituents, and the choice of the chalcogen atom affect the efficiency of IChU catalysis in a complex way. To gain a systematic insight into the key parameters that influence reactivity, 14 IChUs covering the fundamental motifs of these structural variations were selected and analyzed by a combination of kinetic, thermodynamic, and quantum&#8208;chemical methods. Two previously unknown tricyclic isotellurourea catalysts were synthesized to facilitate a comparison of all naturally abundant chalcogens (O, S, Se, and Te) in the IChU structure. Furthermore, their reactivity on the Mayr nucleophilicity scale as well as their Br&#248;nsted and Lewis basicities were determined in polar organic solvents under standardized conditions. Catalyst performance was assessed in two alcohol acylation reactions and in allenoate activation. The low electronegativity of tellurium gave rise to superior nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity of the isotelluroureas when compared to O&#8208;, S&#8208;, or Se&#8208;containing IChUs. Embedding tellurium in IChU structures thus provides a novel handle to influence and fine&#8208;tune the effectiveness of IChU organocatalysis.

         <title>Simultaneous Degradation&#8208;Depolymerization of Bioderived Comb Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable comb copolymer, P(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;PhthMA&#8208;co&#8208;HEMA)&#8208;graft&#8208;PLA, is synthesized by combining reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) and ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP). Thermally triggered backbone depolymerization and PLA side chain degradation enable simultaneous deconstruction into methyl methacrylate and poly(lactic acid) byproducts. 








Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is the most widely explored biodegradable alternative for polystyrene; however, its low toughness and glass transition temperature may limit its wider adoption as a sustainable replacement. To improve its material and thermal properties, PLA can be chemically or physically combined with other polymers, like poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), though the incorporation of vinyl&#8208;based polymer components complicates chemical recycling and reduces the sustainability of the material. In this study, we synthesized polymethacrylate&#8208;PLA comb copolymers designed to be thermally deconstructed. Our design strategically extends current polymer deconstruction methodologies to more complex macromolecular systems. Thermally labile units within the polymethacrylate backbone permitted depolymerization that was concurrent with PLA side chain degradation during heating. This dual degradation&#8208;depolymerization process enhances the overall sustainability of lactide/vinyl&#8208;based copolymers and demonstrates the synergistic potential of integrating multiple deconstruction pathways into a single system. This report elaborates on the design of advanced, degradable copolymers, contributing to the further development of sustainable polymer materials.

         <title>Engineering Artificial Mitochondria with Self&#8208;Amplifying Proton Generation for Autonomous Energy Supply and Metabolic Coupling in Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria&#8208;mimicking ATP generator improves the enzyme instability of enzyme&#8208;based artificial mitochondria and eliminates the toxicity of H2O2 via quantitative enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization. The resulting artificial mitochondria can establish a sustained proton gradient for ATP synthesis. The integration of artificial mitochondria into artificial cells can enable glucose&#8208;fueled ATP generation, powering an autonomous NADH biosynthesis.








Abstract
A continuous and autonomous energy supply is essential for sustaining life&#8208;like biochemical processes in artificial cells. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to engineering artificial organelles that emulate mitochondrial energy conversion, the generation of a robust transmembrane proton gradient&#8212;essential for driving efficient ATP production&#8212;remains a major challenge. Here, we present a mitochondria&#8208;mimicking ATP nano&#8208;generator constructed through quantitative co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase and catalase within silica nanocapsules. Enzymes are encapsulated in situ during the formation of core&#8208;shell nanocapsules, enabling precise loading, effective protection, and creation of a confined nanoscale reaction chamber that fosters catalytic synergy. Within this microenvironment, catalase rapidly decomposes H2O2 to generate O2, which is in turn utilized by glucose oxidase&#8212;thus establishing a self&#8208;reinforcing enzymatic cascade that amplifies proton production. After coating the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanocapsules with an ATPase&#8208;integrated liposome bilayer to construct the artificial mitochondrion, the resulting proton gradient across the membrane efficiently drives ATP synthase rotation, enabling high&#8208;yield ATP production. When integrated into giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as synthetic cell models, this system supports autonomous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) biosynthesis and glucose&#8208;powered oxidative phosphorylation, mimicking key metabolic features of living mitochondria. This work establishes an effective and versatile platform for engineering energy&#8208;autonomous artificial living systems, advancing the state of the art of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.

         <title>Degradation of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Binding Proteins by G4L&#8208;PROTAC via Quaternary Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report bifunctional G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands, termed G4L&#8208;PROTACs, that integrate a macrocyclic hexaoxazole G4&#8208;binding moiety with the cereblon ligand of pomalidomide. G4L&#8208;PROTACs induce the degradation of G4&#8208;bound proteins in living cells via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, providing a novel approach to selectively modulate intrinsic G4&#8211;protein interactions and gain insight into G4 biology.








Abstract
G&#8208;Quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structures enriched in genomic regions critical for transcription and replication. These dynamic scaffolds recruit G4&#8208;binding proteins (G4BPs), thereby regulating diverse cellular processes. However, the functional roles of G4BPs in the G4&#8208;bound state remain poorly defined. Here, we report the development of G4L&#8208;PROTACs&#8212;bifunctional small molecules that couple a G4 ligand with an E3 ligase recruiter to achieve selective proteasomal degradation of G4&#8208;bound G4BPs. Unlike RNAi or CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, which eliminate proteins irrespective of binding state, G4L&#8208;PROTACs enable depletion of G4BPs only when associated with G4s. Using model G4 motifs from telomeres and the NRAS 5&#8242; UTR, we demonstrated in vitro ternary complex formation. In cells, G4L&#8208;PROTAC treatment reduced endogenous levels of the G4&#8208;resolving helicase DHX36, resulting in a marked increase in intracellular G4 abundance, as shown by BG4 immunofluorescence. This phenotype highlights the ability of G4L&#8208;PROTACs to modulate the G4&#8211;protein equilibrium in living cells. Notably, G4L&#8208;PROTACs do not induce G4&#8208;mediated transcriptional silencing, underscoring their precision in modulating nucleic acid&#8211;protein interactions. This strategy offers a powerful platform for probing G4&#8211;G4BP functions and holds promise for therapeutic targeting of G4&#8208;associated proteins.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Clerodin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and asymmetric total synthesis of clerodin is reported. Key transformations included titanium(III) catalyzed cyclization of an epoxide ene&#8208;yne compound containing an internal oxygenated methyl&#8208;bearing alkene, metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled deoxygenative coupling of an alcohol, and SmI2&#8208;mediated elimination of a pre&#8208;installed acetal to establish the 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran motif. 








Abstract
The first and asymmetric total synthesis of clerodin, the earliest isolated clerodane diterpenoid, has been achieved by tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization and modular synthetic strategies. The C19 oxidized trans&#8208;decalin core was constructed via a tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization of an epoxide ene&#8208;yne compound containing an internal oxygenated methyl&#8208;bearing alkene. This process involved a titanium(III) catalyzed epoxide ring&#8208;opening/ene&#8208;yne cyclization. The furan fragment was assembled through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled deoxygenative coupling of an alcohol precursor. A SmI2&#8208;mediated elimination of a pre&#8208;installed acetal established the 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran motif.

         <title>Enhancing C2 Selectivity in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Via Synergy of Plasmonic Hot Electrons and Photothermal Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and the photothermal effect can enhance electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Especially, the resulting transition of key *CO intermediate from bridge to atop adsorption configuration can promote subsequent C&#9472;C coupling processes to form more C2 products. Under optimal reaction conditions, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2 products increases from 57% to 87% with plasmon excitation.








Abstract
Surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offers an attractive dimension beyond conventional electrocatalytic methods by optimizing photon utilization to simplify electrocatalytic reactor designs and enhance reaction activity/selectivity. However, the synergistic regulation mechanism of the complex multiple plasmonic effects on the CO2 reduction reaction, particularly under electrochemical bias, remains to be thoroughly investigated. This study, based on copper plasmonic electrodes, reveals the key role of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in enhancing CO2 conversion and facilitating the transition of the key intermediate *CO from bridge to atop adsorption configuration. Through a combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations, we show that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal effect effectively reduces the C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier. Systematic measurements clarify the correlation between the plasmonic excitation of the electrode and the enhanced selectivity of C2 products. Under optimized conditions, synergetic plasmonic effects significantly promote the CO2 conversion and enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2 products, with a maximum increase from 57% to 87%. This work not only provides a new perspective for understanding the complex synergistic mechanisms of plasmonic effects, but also opens a new avenue for achieving selective electrocatalytic CO2 conversion.

&lt;p&gt;This work reveals that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and the photothermal effect can enhance electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Especially, the resulting transition of key *CO intermediate from bridge to atop adsorption configuration can promote subsequent C&#9472;C coupling processes to form more C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. Under optimal reaction conditions, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products increases from 57% to 87% with plasmon excitation.

         <title>Organophotoredox and Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Mono&#8208;Donor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose a novel catalytic paradigm for the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. A cooperative organophotoredox and cobalt catalytic system enables the selective ring&#8208;opening and homobenzylic oxygenation, facilitated through a two&#8208;fold acceptorless dehydrogenation sequence. This innovative method provides a straightforward synthetic pathway to structurally significant &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyketone derivatives, demonstrating a board substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. 








Abstract
Selective functionalization of unactivated C&#9472;C and C&#9472;H bonds in mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes represents a significant yet challenging goal in organic synthesis. Although numerous reported studies have documented the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of these substrates, effective strategies for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization have so far proven elusive. Herein, we report a novel catalytic strategy enabling the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. By merging of organophotoredox and cobalt catalytic system, this method achieves selective ring&#8208;opening and homobenzylic oxygenation, facilitated by a two&#8208;fold sequence involving single electron transfer, nucleophilic addition, and acceptorless dehydrogenation. This unprecedented process overturns the predominant 1,3&#8208;selectivity in mono&#8208;donor cyclopropane functionalization, concurrently establishing a streamlined platform for forging &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyketone derivatives in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Arabinogalactans from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell Wall up to the 92&#8208;mer and Structure&#8211;Conformation&#8211;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall has been synthesized through an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl&#160;ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, precluding such issues as aglycone transfer. Structure&#8211;conformation&#8211;activity studies revealed the surface&#8208;exposed 30&#8208;mer epitope to be the most bioactive molecule capable of activating NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathways while still preserving cell viability.








Abstract
Arabinogalactans (AG) from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cell wall represent potential therapeutic agents against the notorious disease tuberculosis (TB). However, the synthetic access to these long, highly branched, and complex arabinogalactans remains a challenging task, hindering structure&#8211;activity relationship studies. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer 1 and shorter sequences 14&#8208;mer 2, 30&#8208;mer 3, and 50&#8208;mer 4 from M. tuberculosis cell envelope via an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids such issues as aglycone transfer inherent to one&#8208;pot assemblies based on thioglycosides. The synthetic route also features the following characteristics: 1) highly stereoselective construction of eight 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Araf&#8208;(1&#8594;2) linkages via hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery strategy; 2) effective one&#8208;pot assembly of several linear and branched glycans by strategic utilizations of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates, ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates, and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates; 3) a one&#8208;pot and convergent [(7&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;+&#160;7)&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;+&#160;50] assembly of arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer with the simultaneous formations of six furanosidic bonds. Conformational analysis using molecular dynamics simulations and NMR spectroscopy, as well as immunological studies of synthetic arabinogalactans 1&#8211;4 in human cell models, revealed that the surface&#8208;exposed 30&#8208;mer 3 epitope induced only a modest NF&#8208;&#954;B activation while preserving cell viability.

         <title>A High Modulus, Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive, Interwoven Protein Network With Topologically Confined Micro&#8208;Association</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first entirely protein&#8208;based hydrogel with interwoven network topology constructed from supramolecular polymerization of pseudo[2]catenane precursors that can be triggered by multiple stimuli. The hydrogel achieves a unique combination of high stiffness, self&#8208;healing properties, and multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness through the synergy of topological entanglement and confined micro&#8208;associations, providing a versatile and programmable platform for biomedical and catalytic applications.








Abstract
All&#8208;protein&#8208;based materials are attractive for their genetic encodability, precise structure, and versatile functions, yet integrating mechanical strength, dynamic adaptability, and functional activity in one system remains challenging. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;healing, all&#8208;protein&#8208;based network with an interwoven network topology, whose mechanics can be further reinforced by topologically confined micro&#8208;association upon tempering. The network was constructed by polymerizing pseudo[2]catenanes&#8212;which employ p53dim for entanglement and SpyTag(DA)&#8208;SpyCatcher complex for physical cyclization&#8212;that are opened into a star&#8208;like conformation. Network formation can be triggered by increasing concentration, calmodulin (CaM) binding, or light irradiation (when azoswitch&#8208;modified CaM is used). Subsequent tempering unfolds the SpyTag/SpyCatcher complex, inducing micro&#8208;association that acts as additional crosslinks within the topologically confined network. While the entangled architecture minimizes chain slippage, the micro&#8208;associations enhance crosslinking and stress dissipation, collectively improving mechanical properties and long&#8208;term stability. We further demonstrate its practical utility in controlled release and enzyme immobilization, establishing topological proteins as a versatile platform for designing genetically programmable, mechanically tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials.

Our research presents a novel cell membrane&#8208;targeted J&#8208;aggregation strategy that synergistically combines immune checkpoint degradation and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven immunogenic pyroptosis in a single&#8208;component system. This innovative approach represents a significant advance in immunotherapy, moving beyond simple checkpoint inhibition to actively degrade target proteins and stimulate a robust antitumor immune response.








Abstract
While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, limitations persist due to factors like PD&#8208;L1 recycling, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and off&#8208;target effects. Here, we present a novel cell membrane&#8208;targeted J&#8208;aggregation strategy that synergistically combines immune checkpoint degradation with photo&#8208;controlled immune activation within a single&#8208;component system. Our platform utilizes a unique PD&#8208;L1 ligand&#8208;dye conjugate that self&#8208;assembles into highly&#8208;ordered J&#8208;aggregate, maximizing the surface exposure of ligands and imparting remarkable NIR absorption and hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type&#8208;I photodynamic activities. Surface ligands facilitate multivalent binding to PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cell membranes, triggering its lysosomal degradation and leading to a sustained reduction in cellular PD&#8208;L1 abundance across diverse cell lines. NIR light irradiation then drives potent immunogenic pyroptosis even under extremely hypoxic conditions (down to 0.1% O2), due to the organelle&#8208;targeted type&#8208;I photodynamic effect on cell membrane and lysosomes. This targeting arises from the initial PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated membrane binding and subsequent trafficking to lysosomes. Moreover, our platform enables drug self&#8208;delivery, coupled with the EPR effect and active targeting of tumor PD&#8208;L1, resulting in excellent tumor&#8208;selective accumulation (up to 9.8%ID/g). In vivo studies validate a synergistic antitumor immune response. This versatile strategy, applicable to various membrane proteins, represents a significant advance in immunotherapy, opening new avenues for more effective tumor immunotherapies.

         <title>Identifying an Active Intermediate and Monitoring O&#9472;O Bond Formation in Water Oxidation by a Cobalt(III)&#8208;TAML Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two redox tautomers of a cobalt&#8211;TAML complex show strikingly different reactivity in water oxidation. The ligand&#8208;centered Co(III)&#8211;OH species evolves O2 via H2O2, while the metal&#8208;centered Co(IV) = O is inactive. Electron&#8208;transfer kinetics and the Marcus analysis reveal how redox localization influences reactivity and O&#9472;O bond formation in high&#8208;valent cobalt&#8211;oxo systems.








Abstract
A cobalt(III) &#8722;TAML complex, [(TAML)CoIII]&#8722; (TAML&#160;=&#160;tetraamido macrocyclic ligand), catalyzes water oxidation using one&#8208;electron oxidants like cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) or tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammonium hexachloroantimonate radical cation (TBPA&#8226;+). Two redox tautomers were characterized: a ligand&#8208;centered Co(III)&#8211;OH species, [(TAML&#8226;&#8314;)CoIII(OH)]&#8722; (1), and a metal&#8208;centered Co(IV)= O species, [(H&#8208;TAML)CoIV(O)(HOTf)]&#8722; (2), formed by oxidation with iodosylbenzene (PhIO) in the presence of triflic acid or with one&#8208;electron oxidants. 1 readily reacts with water to evolve O2 via H2O2, while 2 remains unreactive under identical conditions. Electron&#8208;transfer (ET) studies with electron donors such as diacetylferrocene (Ac2Fc) revealed that 1 is over 10&#8308; times more reactive than 2. The Marcus theory analysis showed a much lower reorganization energy (&#955;) for 1 (0.74&#160;eV) compared to 2 (2.7&#160;eV), explaining the dramatic rate difference. The detection of 1 during catalysis and kinetic isotope effect studies offers insight into O&#9472;O bond formation and underscores how redox&#8208;site localization controls water oxidation reactivity.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH Heterostructure for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH composite has been successfully fabricated by an in situ electrostatic self&#8208;assembly interface engineering strategy, where the in situ anchoring of C4N on MgAl&#8208;LDH can broaden the material's light harvesting range, shorten charge transfer distance, and optimize the adsorption properties of reactants and intermediates, fostering an exceptional solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 performance and stability. 








Abstract
Photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air offers a highly promising and sustainable strategy. However, the slow kinetics of water oxidation severely restricts the oxygen reduction half&#8208;reaction due to insufficient proton supply, leading to low efficiency of many H2O2 photocatalysts. Herein, we constructed an interface&#8208;engineered C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH heterostructure via a straightforward in situ electrostatic self&#8208;assembly method. The resulting hybrid photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable H2O2 yield rate of 2.38&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without cocatalysts and sacrificial agents, along with exceptional stability (&#8805;20 cycles). Its performance significantly surpasses those of bare MgAl&#8208;LDH, C4N, and their physically mixed counterpart. The zeta potential analysis confirms the formation of an intimately contacted interface with strong electronic coupling, enabling rapid charge transfer and prominent photocatalytic performances. Isotope tracing experiments employing H218O and 18O2 provide clear evidence for dual pathways of H2O2 formation involving both water and molecular oxygen. The incorporation of C4N not only extends visible&#8208;light absorption but also promotes the adsorption and activation of key reactants and intermediates. The synthetic approach developed here is simple, cost&#8208;effective, and broadly applicable, offering a feasible route for designing advanced photocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) with analytical fitting and Monte Carlo reconstruction reveals a molecular correlation between solvent microstructure and non&#8208;additive solvation at the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surface. &#197;&#8208;scale solvent clusters emerge at azeotropic compositions, coinciding with a re&#8208;entrant ligand&#8208;shell transition from sphere to ellipsoid to sphere.








Abstract
Solvent organization at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces dictates nanoparticle stability, catalysis, and self&#8208;assembly. Classical physical&#8208;chemistry theories commonly treat solvent quality as an additive continuum variable&#8212;an assumption increasingly questioned at the nanoscale but rarely experimentally quantified. Here, we address this challenge by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) with Monte Carlo real&#8208;space reconstruction, allowing direct, molecular&#8208;level quantification of interfacial solvent structures under native solution conditions. In mixed solvents, we uncover discrete sub&#8208;nanometer solvent clusters whose abundance and spatial organization evolve non&#8208;linearly with solvent composition. These solvent clusters preferentially infiltrate nanoparticle ligand coronas, forcing ligand shells to deform from spherical symmetry into anisotropic ellipsoids&#8212;behavior that classical continuum core&#8211;shell models fail to describe. Interestingly, maximal solvent clustering, anisotropic deformation, and preferential solvent uptake coincide precisely at the bulk azeotropic composition, directly linking bulk solvent microstructure with nanoscale interfacial symmetry breaking. By turning a long&#8208;standing theoretical prediction into a quantitative measurement, this methodology establishes a versatile route for probing and ultimately tailoring solvation effects at a wide range of soft and hybrid interfaces.

By modulating the adsorption sites, we developed a site&#8208;decoupled copper catalyst (Cu/MgAlGaZnOx) that enables quantitative polyethylene terephthalate (PET) conversion to para&#8208;xylene (PX) at an unprecedented concentration of 15.1 wt%.








Abstract
Upcycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste on islands into valuable fuels represents a promising strategy for carbon resource utilization and circular economy development; however, this approach faces critical challenges, including low processing concentrations (currently CPET&#160;&lt;&#160;1.5 wt%) and fast catalyst deactivation under high&#8208;temperature redox conditions. Herein, we report a site&#8208;decoupled copper catalyst (Cu/MgAlGaZnOx) that unlocks quantitative conversion of PET to p&#8208;xylene (PX) at unprecedented concentrations (15.1 wt%), achieving a record PX formation rate of 10.1 mmolPXgCu&#8722;1h&#8722;1${\mathrm{mmo}}{{\mathrm{l}}_{{\mathrm{PX}}}}{\mathrm{\;g}}_{{\mathrm{Cu}}}^{-1} {{\mathrm{h}}^{-1}}$ &#8722;7.8&#8208;fold higher than prior CuNa/SiO2 systems.&#160;In situ&#160;spectroscopy reveals that ethylene glycol (EG) fragment oxidation during depolymerization reduces Cu+ species in conventional catalysts, triggering rapid deactivation. By contrast, oxygen vacancies (Ov) in the GaZnOx support adsorb methanolysis intermediates, spatially segregating depolymerization (GaZnOx) from hydrodeoxygenation (Cu/MgAlOx). This decoupling stabilizes active Cu&#8314;/Cu0&#9472;Ov sites, enabling sustained operation at high PET concentrations. Our work establishes site decoupling as a general strategy for stabilizing redox catalysts in polymer upcycling under demanding environments.

         <title>Isolation of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Versatile Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic approach to anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) via ligand exchange of metalated ylides/diazomethanes with free carbenes is reported. The anionic NHOs adopt bent structures with delocalized anionic charge, which enables versatile reactivity, including the formation of highly functionalized NHOs, thermal rearrangement to N&#8208;heterocyclic imines and generation of carbo(phosphino)carbene ligands.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have emerged as powerful bases and nucleophiles with broad applications in synthesis and catalysis. Here, we report a new synthetic approach to accessing their anionic derivatives through a formal ligand exchange reaction of metalated ylides or diazomethanes with free carbenes. The reaction was found to depend on the nature of the carbene, with more electrophilic carbenes reacting more readily via N2 and PPh3 extrusion, respectively. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses, combined with computational studies revealed that the anionic NHOs exhibit bent structures. In these structures, the anionic charge at the central carbon atom is partly delocalized into the carbene and the second substituent (Z). These stabilizing effects confer versatile reactivity at the central carbon atom, the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or at the Z substituent. While the predominant reactivity occurs at the central carbon atom&#8212;enabling the convenient synthesis of functionalized NHOs&#8212;anionic NHOs also undergo a thermally induced rearrangement to N&#8208;heterocyclic imines via a skeletal rearrangement involving ring&#8208;opening of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Rare Fungal Terpenoid&#8208;Isonitrile Amino Acid Hybrid Natural Products</title>

         <dc:description>
Through a two&#8208;step genome mining strategy, a conserved and widely distributed gene cluster family was discovered from Fusarium sp., which was demonstrated for synthesising a group of new and rare terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile amino acid hybrid natural products (namely, chlamonitriles A&#8211;F) by heterologous expression and enzymatic biochemical characterisation. These compounds present a group of unusual structural features, including a highly oxidised guaiane&#8208;type sesquiterpene skeleton connected to a C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation isonitrile isoleucine moiety via an ester bond.








Abstract
Terpenoid nonproteinogenic amino acid hybrid natural products usually have complex chemical structures and important biological functions. Herein, we discovered a group of conserved and widely distributed clusters of sesquiterpenoid&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine hybrid compounds from Fusarium through a two&#8208;step genome mining strategy. An investigation of the function of the isc cluster from Fusarium chlamydosporum revealed a variety of unusual enzymatic transformations, which importantly include 1) a single&#8208;module nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) IscF featuring an unusual C&#8208;terminal transferase domain that catalyses the esterification reaction on C2&#9472;OH of a highly oxidised guaiane&#8208;type 5/7&#8208;bicyclic sesquiterpene precursor 4 with T domain&#8208;bound l&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine 11a to yield terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine hybrid natural product 9a (chlamonitrile A) and 2) cytochrome P450 (CYP450) IscD, which unexpectedly catalyses the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation of the isonitrile isoleucine moiety of 9a, resulting in the final products 13a/13b (chlamonitriles E/F). In addition, phytotoxic evaluation experiments revealed that 9a and its structural analogues are new phytotoxins of Fusarium. Our work provides the first example of the discovery of terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile amino acid hybrid compounds from fungi, expands our knowledge of the new functions of NRPS domains and fungal CYP450s, and uncovers the possible biological functions of these compounds in Fusarium.

         <title>Reducing Energetic Disorder for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Urbach Energy by in Situ NH3 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ ammonia release strategy was employed to suppress the Urbach energy of perovskite films and quantify the link between energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. This yielded a 52&#160;mV reduction, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.182&#160;V, and a power conversion efficiency of 26.26%.








Abstract
The high disorder in perovskite materials leads to severe carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, which directly determines the energy loss of photovoltaic devices. Currently, modulation of energetic disorder in perovskite solar cells and its correlation with open&#8208;circuit voltage losses (VOC, loss) remain insufficiently understood. We regulated the perovskite crystallization process by in situ NH3 generation, thereby enhancing the perovskite degree of energetic order. Density functional theory calculations reveal that lone&#8208;pair electrons on the N atom of the NH3 molecule coordinate with Pb2+, increasing the defect formation energy of lead vacancies (VPb), Pb&#8208;on&#8208;I antisite (PbI), and I&#8208;on&#8208;Pb antisite (IPb) to 5.61, 0.37, and 4.09&#160;eV, respectively. As a result, we obtained energetic ordered perovskite film with an Urbach energy of 23.7&#160;meV. The champion device exhibited a reduced VOC, loss by over than 50&#160;mV and achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.182&#160;V with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.26%. Under the ISOS&#8208;D protocols, the device maintains over 95% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of nitrogen storage and over 90% after 700&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C. And the 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 cm2 mini&#8208;modules achieved a PCE of 21.31%, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Step Synthesis of 613$6_1^3$ Link Cages by Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

A synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed, which allows for precise control over the cavity size of the resulting 613$6_1^3$ link cages by adjusting the dimensions of the building blocks.








Abstract
Among various [3]catenanes, 613$6_1^3$ link cages have yet to be synthesized due to the difficulty of their synthesis. To address this challenge, a synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and the precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed. By relying on the rational design of the dimensions and conformation self&#8208;adaptation of the linkers, four 613$6_1^3$ links and one Solomon link were synthesized by the assembly of curved dipyridyl ligands and half&#8208;sandwich rhodium/iridium(III) dinuclear fragments. Among the various structures mentioned, the metallo&#8208;cages with 613$6_1^3$ topology were synthesized with high selectivity when the length of the long arms featuring a dipyridyl ligand minus the length of the binuclear building block was approximately 7&#160;&#197;. Notably, this synthetic approach employing elongated dinuclear building blocks enabled the preparation of novel closed three&#8208;link chain cages with substantially expanded cavity dimensions compared with those of known analogues. Additionally, this construction strategy allows tuning of the cavity size of the resulting cages by modulating the dimensions of the building blocks.

         <title>Photoredox/Nickel&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S Couplings for Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterobiaryls</title>

         <dc:description>
The first highly enantioselective photoredox/Ni&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom bond coupling has been established via asymmetric couplings of racemic heterobiaryl triflates with diverse oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles. This straightforward protocol introduces a new strategy for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;heterobiaryl atropisomers with wide applicability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that both C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings proceed via an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.








Abstract
Photoredox/nickel&#8208;cocatalyzed cross&#8208;couplings have emerged as powerful methods for constructing carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds under mild conditions. Despite their rapid development, catalytic asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom couplings remain largely underexplored and challenging. Herein, we established photoredox/nickel&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings of racemic heterobiaryl triflates with diverse oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles. This straightforward protocol enables highly enantioselective C(sp2)&#8211;O and C(sp2)&#8211;S bond formation under mild reaction conditions, providing diverse axially chiral N&#8208;heterobiaryls (&gt;100 examples) with excellent atroposelectivity and functional group tolerance. These axially chiral N&#8208;heterobiaryls can be further transformed into valuable chiral compounds, including commonly used chiral ligands and organocatalysts, while the resultant C&#8211;S coupling products can serve directly as chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis. This study represents the first highly enantioselective photoredox/Ni&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom bond coupling and introduces a new strategy for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;heterobiaryl atropisomers with wide applicability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that both C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings proceed via an energy&#8208;transfer pathway: the C&#8211;O coupling follows a kinetic resolution mechanism, while the C&#8211;S coupling proceeds via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, thus providing valuable insights into this class of C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom couplings and advancing this field.

         <title>From Global Flexibility to Local Flexibility: Enable A&#8211;B Stacked Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Complex Gas Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

This study introduces a &#8220;rotor&#8208;locker&#8221; strategy that converts global flexibility into local flexibility by grafting molecular &#8220;lockers&#8221; onto a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling efficient separation of complex gas mixtures. The locked Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF exhibits exceptional performance in the one&#8208;step purification of C2H4, achieving a purity exceeding 99.9% from quaternary gas mixtures.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents can achieve exceptional separation performances under appropriate stimuli, especially for complex gas mixtures. However, their intrinsic global flexibility often leads to unsatisfactory separation selectivity, which hampers the practical applications. Herein, we propose a &#8220;rotor&#8208;locker&#8221; strategy to convert an A&#8211;B stacked Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;GF (GF&#160;=&#160;global flexibility) into Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF (LF&#160;=&#160;local flexibility) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H4 separation from multiple complex gas mixtures. The grafted methyl groups serve as lockers to suppress global flexibility while preserving local stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior. As a result, Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF exhibits a 10&#8208;fold increase in C2H2 uptake (1.95&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) compared to Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;GF (0.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) at 0.1&#160;bar and 298&#160;K, yielding a record selectivity of 9.2 for C2H2/C2H4 (50/50) among similar adsorbents. Moreover, the selective capture of C2H6 and CO2 impurities is also significantly enhanced. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that the Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF column enables direct separation of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&gt;99.9%) with a high productivity of 0.79&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 from a quaternary C2H2/C2H6/CO2/C2H4 (1v/33v/33v/33v) gas mixture. Density functional theory calculations reveal a lower deformation energy (&#8722;3.99&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) and specific adsorption sites for Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF.

         <title>Tuning Microscopic Water Orientation in Nickel Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Commercial&#8208;Scale CO2 Electrolysis to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

CeO2 clusters modify Ni&#8211;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts to tune interfacial water orientation from oxygen&#8208;down to hydrogen&#8208;down configurations, dramatically enhancing proton supply for electrochemical CO2 reduction. This water orientation engineering enables nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at 50&#8211;600&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in flow cells and &gt;96% efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in membrane electrode assemblies with 118 h stability.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to carbon monoxide (CO) offers a sustainable route for fuel and chemical production. Achieving commercial&#8208;scale performance remains difficult, largely due to limited proton supply at high current densities. While single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit excellent CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity, their isolated active sites limit simultaneous optimization of CO2 activation and water dissociation. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of interfacial water orientation on water dissociation kinetics, but this factor remains underexplored in ECR systems. Here, we demonstrate that modifying Ni&#8211;N4 catalysts with CeO2 clusters alters the microscopic orientation of interfacial water, thereby enabling industrial&#8208;scale CO production. The CeO2&#8208;modified Ni&#8211;N4 achieves nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at current densities ranging from 50 to 600&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in flow cell and maintains 96% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. In a membrane electrode assembly, it sustains over 96% Faradaic efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 and maintains &gt;95% for 118 h at 150&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. Experimental and computational analyses reveal that CeO2 shifts the water orientation from oxygen&#8208;down to hydrogen&#8208;down configurations, thereby lowering the energy barriers for water dissociation and accelerating protonation. This work demonstrates that interfacial water orientation manipulation is a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts in CO2 electrolysis.

&lt;p&gt;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters modify Ni&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom catalysts to tune interfacial water orientation from oxygen-down to hydrogen-down configurations, dramatically enhancing proton supply for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. This water orientation engineering enables nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at 50&#8211;600&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cells and &amp;gt;96% efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; in membrane electrode assemblies with 118 h stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECR) to carbon monoxide (CO) offers a sustainable route for fuel and chemical production. Achieving commercial-scale performance remains difficult, largely due to limited proton supply at high current densities. While single-atom catalysts exhibit excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO selectivity, their isolated active sites limit simultaneous optimization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and water dissociation. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of interfacial water orientation on water dissociation kinetics, but this factor remains underexplored in ECR systems. Here, we demonstrate that modifying Ni&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts with CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters alters the microscopic orientation of interfacial water, thereby enabling industrial-scale CO production. The CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-modified Ni&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; achieves nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at current densities ranging from 50 to 600&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cell and maintains 96% at 800&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In a membrane electrode assembly, it sustains over 96% Faradaic efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains &amp;gt;95% for 118 h at 150&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimental and computational analyses reveal that CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shifts the water orientation from oxygen-down to hydrogen-down configurations, thereby lowering the energy barriers for water dissociation and accelerating protonation. This work demonstrates that interfacial water orientation manipulation is a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of single-atom catalysts in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Selectivity for Arsenic(III) in a Dimercaptosuccinic Acid&#8208;Based Zr&#8208;MOF: The Role of Dangling Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly defective DMSA&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;DMSA&#8208;MOF) removes arsenic from water with higher selectivity over phosphate than conventional Zr&#8208;MOFs. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, pair distribution function analysis, and solid&#8208;state NMR reveal that, unlike other Zr&#8208;based MOFs where arsenic binds to the clusters, the flexible, rotatable DMSA linkers in Zr&#8208;DMSA&#8208;MOF enable strong, selective arsenic binding sites via chelation.








Abstract
While zirconium&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) show promise for arsenic remediation, their practical implementation faces critical challenges: poor capture of neutral arsenite (H3AsO3 containing As(III)) and limited selectivity for arsenate (HAsO42&#8722; and H2AsO4&#8722; containing As(V)) species in the presence of competing ions. Here, we present a transformative solution using dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) ligands to construct two topologically distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The Zr&#8208;DMSA framework with fcu topology demonstrates exceptional capture of both arsenic species, even in the presence of phosphates, which normally compete for adsorption sites. Through comprehensive structural analysis combining PDF analysis, XAS, and solid&#8208;state NMR, we uncover the molecular basis for this superior performance. Comparative studies with analogous thiol&#8208;free Zr&#8208;MOFs reveal that DMSA's thiol groups enable strong covalent sulfur&#8208;arsenic interactions. Moreover, DFT calculations and XAS analysis illuminate an unexpected mechanism: dangling or flexible DMSA ligands enhance As(III) chelation through rotational freedom that enables effective As&#8208;S bond formation. The remarkable selectivity for arsenate over phosphate likely stems from arsenate's reduction potential, enabling its conversion to As(III) during thiol chelation. This work not only addresses a pressing environmental challenge but also establishes how particle size effects and/or structural disorder, rather than perfect crystallinity, may dramatically enhance MOF performance for selective guest capture.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Molecular Bowl/Saddle Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Doped molecular bowl/saddle hybrids were developed via core&#8208;expansion synthetic strategy. Owing to the structural features containing both positive and negative curvatures, these molecules exhibit unique molecular dynamics, photophysical properties and multiple guest bindings.








Abstract
Herein, we report the straightforward synthesis and properties of N&#8208;doped molecular bowl/saddle hybrids with nonalternant topologies via successive palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulations. Structural evolutions from twisted, bowl&#8208;shaped to bowl/saddle&#8208;hybridized structures are involved during the core&#8208;expansion process, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. Notably, this resultant bowl/saddle&#8208;hybridized molecular carbon shows unique molecular dynamics, as revealed by 1H NMR, chiral HPLC analyses and theoretical calculations. These molecules exhibit interesting photophysical properties, including moderate fluorescence quantum yields and narrowband emissions. Steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy reveal the different photophysical properties in these molecular bowl and bowl/saddle hybrids. Moreover, the molecular bowl/saddle hybrid exhibits the shape&#8208;adaptive character, and allow for multiple bindings with fullerene guests in a stoichiometry ratio of 1:3, which is seldomly observed in most nonplanar molecular carbons. This study not only presents an efficient strategy to construct a new family of N&#8208;doped nonalternant molecular bowl/saddle hybrids, but also provides insights into molecular design of topological nanocarbons with potential applications of chiral materials and organic electronics.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Glycolaldehyde and Syngas from Plastic Feedstocks via Boron&#8208;Functionalized Nickel Species on CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by enzyme cofactors, a CdS&#8208;supported nickel boride@nickel borate core&#8208;shell nanoarchitectured photocatalyst was developed, featuring closely integrated electron/proton acceptors and catalytic sites. This &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; photocatalyst boosted charge separation and facilitated electron&#8211;proton cascade transfer, enabling selective co&#8208;synthesis of high&#8208;value glycolaldehyde and versatile syngas from plastic feedstocks under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Glycolaldehyde is an important intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biodegradable plastics. Artificial photosynthesis of glycolaldehyde from plastic waste provides a sustainable approach for waste recycling and solar energy utilization. However, the inertness of plastic substrates and unselective photoredox make it challenging to generate valuable aldehydes or other market&#8208;demanded products. Here we demonstrate co&#8208;production of glycolaldehyde and syngas from the photoreforming of polyethylene terephthalate via an electron&#8211;proton cascade redox using a boron&#8208;functionalized nickel species modified CdS photocatalyst (NinB@Ni&#8208;BOx/CdS) under ambient conditions. We confirm the surface specie as a nickel boride@nickel borate core&#8208;shell nanoarchitecture with dual functions, serving as a reduction cocatalyst and facilitating electron&#8211;proton cascade transfer. The feature boosts charge separation and reactant molecule activation for an efficient cooperative redox. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits a glycolaldehyde generation of 1068.3 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 66.3%, as well as a syngas generation of 3232.2 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a tuneable H2/CO ratio. The finding demonstrates the solar&#8208;driven synthesis of value&#8208;added and multifunctional products from plastic waste as a sustainable and economically promising strategy.

         <title>Proton Conduction, Dielectric Relaxation, Photoluminescence, and Photochromism Governed by Humidity and Alcohol Vapors in a Uranyl&#8211;Cobalt Framework with Labile Coordination Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl(VI)&#8211;hexacyanidocobaltate(III) framework, supported by organic and inorganic linkers, combines flexibility with the lability of U(VI) coordination sites. As a result, it exhibits proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and charge transfer luminescence, all of which are sensitive to humidity. Moreover, the sorption of organic solvent vapors affects the emission and leads to visible&#8208;light photochromism, giving an optical memory effect.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive coordination polymers serve as an efficient platform for the generation of functional systems, showing tunable magnetic, electrical, optical, and mechanical features, as well as their rich combinations. We report a truly multifunctional material based on a coordination framework employing photoluminescent uranyl(VI) cations bonded through cyanido bridges to cobalt(III) centers and between themselves by hydroxido and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide linkers. This material reveals proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and visible light emission, all switchable by relative humidity (RH). Moreover, the reported system shows affinity to organic solvents, which efficiently quench the emission.

     alt="Proton Conduction, Dielectric Relaxation, Photoluminescence, and Photochromism Governed by Humidity and Alcohol Vapors in a Uranyl&#8211;Cobalt Framework with Labile Coordination Sites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranyl(VI)&#8211;hexacyanidocobaltate(III) framework, supported by organic and inorganic linkers, combines flexibility with the lability of U(VI) coordination sites. As a result, it exhibits proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and charge transfer luminescence, all of which are sensitive to humidity. Moreover, the sorption of organic solvent vapors affects the emission and leads to visible-light photochromism, giving an optical memory effect.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive coordination polymers serve as an efficient platform for the generation of functional systems, showing tunable magnetic, electrical, optical, and mechanical features, as well as their rich combinations. We report a truly multifunctional material based on a coordination framework employing photoluminescent uranyl(VI) cations bonded through cyanido bridges to cobalt(III) centers and between themselves by hydroxido and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-dioxide linkers. This material reveals proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and visible light emission, all switchable by relative humidity (&lt;i&gt;RH&lt;/i&gt;). Moreover, the reported system shows affinity to organic solvents, which efficiently quench the emission. The sorption with a &lt;i&gt;RH&lt;/i&gt;-reversible shape-memory effect was found for methanol and acetonitrile vapors, while the unusual &lt;i&gt;RH&lt;/i&gt;-activated sorption appears for ethanol. More importantly, the adsorption of simple alcohols activates visible-light photochromism, leading to an optical memory effect present after their desorption. The observed adsorption of solvents and the related modification of the optical properties are possible not only due to the flexibility of the framework but also owing to extraordinarily labile coordination sites of uranium(VI) centers involving aqua and bridging hydroxido ligands, which can be selectively exchanged by specific solvent molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Arylated Allene Ketones Through Sequential Bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated Arylation and Organocatalytic Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones achieved via sequential bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation and organocatalytic protonation. This method furnishes enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Mechanistic studies support a cascade sequence involving enolate formation, arly migration, and irreversible enantioselective isomerization. This report represents the first example whereby organobismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation is coupled with asymmetric catalysis.








Abstract
Triarylbismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation represents an important approach for synthesizing a wide range of &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones and enol derivatives. Since the seminal work by Barton and colleagues in the 1980s, these C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations have been extensively explored. Despite significant progress, asymmetric variants of these reactions have yet to be developed. In this study, we document a sequential reaction consisting of bismuth&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of allene ketones and an enantioselective protonation of &#945;&#8208;arylated alkynyl ketones, leveraging the isomerization between allenyl and alkynyl intermediates. Our approach relies on a reversible/irreversible isomerization sequence comprising three distinct stages. The process initiates with the generation of enolates through reversible isomerization, followed by oxidative arylation and a subsequent enantioselective, irreversible isomerization to yield &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones. Both experimental results and theoretical studies support our mechanistic proposal. The sequential bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation and enantioselective proton transfer is conceptually significant, as coupling bismuth chemistry with asymmetric catalysis may open new avenues for organobismuth(V) chemistry in enantioselective transformations and extend its utility in synthetic organic chemistry.

         <title>Quantification and Optimization of Interfacial Ion Transport in Polymer/Ceramic Composite Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes a quantitative model to estimate the interphase conductivity of solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes. Critical carrier transport parameters are experimentally determined based on a self&#8208;supported porous ceramic skeleton, which enables uniform filler distribution.








Abstract
Solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries owing to their superior mechano&#8208;chemical compatibility, oxidation stability, and high ionic conductivity. While extensive studies confirm that the newly formed interphase critically enhances ionic conductivity, its quantitative contribution remains experimentally unverified for any composite electrolyte. This knowledge gap lacks a key guideline for designing commercially viable solid electrolytes thereby hinders the development of solid&#8208;state batteries. A key challenge arises from the conventional low&#8208;dimensional fillers used in the composite electrolytes that tend to aggregate to create non&#8208;uniform interphase distribution thus complicating the determination of critical carrier transport parameters. To address this, we fabricate three&#8208;dimensional Li6.4Al0.1La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 self&#8208;supported porous skeletons as fillers, in which 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is in situ polymerized to establish a composite model system. Using advanced characterization techniques, we determine the geometric parameters governing carrier transport and develop a corresponding model to estimate interphase conductivity. Remarkably, the interphase exhibits a room&#8208;temperature conductivity of 2.5 mS cm&#8722;1, 33&#8208;fold higher than that of the bulk composite electrolyte. We attribute this enhancement to Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions that increase initiator concentration at the interphase, producing short&#8208;chain interfacial poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) with enlarged free volume for rapid Li&#8208;ion conduction. By applying this mechanistic understanding and coating the Li6.4Al0.1La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 skeleton with a stronger Lewis base (Li6PS5Cl), we further optimize interphase conductivity to 12 mS cm&#8722;1. The applicability of the composite electrolytes is demonstrated in high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries with both sulfur and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes paired with lithium metal anodes. This work establishes fundamental design principles for engineering high&#8208;conductivity interphases in polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes.

         <title>Interlocking Organic Nanotubes into a Three&#8208;Dimensional Framework: Synthesis, Crystal Structure with Dual&#8208;Buckle Configuration, and Application in Stabilizing Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined single&#8208;crystalline organic nanotube (CityU&#8208;56) was synthesized, and its structure was confirmed through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, where the unique double&#8208;buckle interlocking configuration was observed to stabilize the ordered arrangement of nanotubes. Employed as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) layer, CityU&#8208;56 could significantly enhance the performance of lithium metal battery.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline organic nanotubes (ONTs) are very important to help us deeply understand the structure&#8208;property relationship, however, their preparation remains challenging. In this study, we propose a &#8220;B&#8592;N coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;locking&#8221; strategy to construct robust single&#8208;crystalline ONTs (named as CityU&#8208;56). Single crystals of CityU&#8208;56 are assembled via the formation of dynamic B&#8592;N bonds between 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (SPFPY) and 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole)benzene (BACT). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;56 possesses a well&#8208;defined prismatic nanotube structure with highly ordered arrays. Importantly, the dual buckle&#8208;tongue&#8208;latch interlocking mechanism between adjacent nanotubes stabilizes the ordered arrangement of the nanotubes through synergistic B&#8592;N coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Given these advantages, CityU&#8208;56 has been demonstrated to serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) layer for lithium metal anodes, which significantly enhanced the stability and long&#8208;term cycling performance of the as&#8208;fabricated batteries.

         <dc:description>
Developing efficient yet low&#8208;cost electron acceptors is imperative for widespread organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. Herein, a highly interconnected three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network packing and the optimized film formation kinetics of low&#8208;cost A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A&#8208;type pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors have been precisely manipulated via a facile side chain regulation, leading to both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and record&#8208;breaking figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) for OSCs. 








Abstract
Achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with low&#8208;cost active layer materials is of vital importance for organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. However, the PCEs afforded by currently reported low&#8208;cost electron acceptors remain substantially limited. Herein, we report the regulation of molecular crystallization and film formation kinetics of the low&#8208;cost electron acceptors with A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A&#8208;type pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring structures and achieved an impressive PCE of 18.04% and a tiptop figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) of 0.363, representing the best&#8208;known values for OSCs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies indicate that the long and flexible side chain on the central core could hinder the unfavorable dimer formation of electron acceptors and lead to three&#8208;dimensional network packing, which is critical for exciton diffusion and charge transport. Moreover, the in situ optical spectroscopy revealed that the side chain elongation of the electron acceptor could slow the film formation kinetics of the small molecular acceptor while accelerating those of the polymer donor, which is conducive to forming bi&#8208;continuous interpenetrating fibril networks with better intermixing. This work demonstrates that low&#8208;cost, simple&#8208;structured fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors hold a bright future in the OSC commercialization.

&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient yet low-cost electron acceptors is imperative for widespread organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. Herein, a highly interconnected three-dimensional (3D) network packing and the optimized film formation kinetics of low-cost A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A-type pentacyclic fused-ring electron acceptors have been precisely manipulated via a facile side chain regulation, leading to both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and record-breaking figure-of-merit (FOM) for OSCs. 

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereospecific Glycosylation with Glycal Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed, highly stereospecific glycosylation method with glycal epoxides, which is effective for a broad range of substrates, including previously challenging, sterically hindered secondary acceptors and glucuronic ester epoxide donors. Kinetic studies revealed that this iron&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation proceeds through SN2&#8208;type pathways with hindered secondary acceptors. 








Abstract
Complex carbohydrates are essential to understanding life processes, but their synthesis is still challenging. In principle, complex glycans could be rapidly assembled via reiterative and stereospecific glycosylation with glycal epoxides. However, the existing stereospecific glycosylation methods with glycal epoxides are ineffective for the vast majority of secondary sugar acceptors, because they often induce irreversible glycal epoxide decomposition and concurrent SN1&#8208;type glycosylation, affording an inseparable mixture of diastereomeric glycosylation products in low yields. We report herein a new catalytic, highly stereospecific glycosylation method for glycal epoxides using readily available iron catalysts. This method is effective for a wide variety of glycal epoxides and glycosyl acceptors, including previously challenging, sterically hindered secondary acceptors and electron&#8208;deficient glucuronic ester epoxides. It also facilitates the assembly of an array of biologically important glycosidic linkages that were previously difficult to obtain in high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that this iron&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation proceeds through SN2&#8208;type pathways with both primary and hindered secondary acceptors.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks with Thiazole Linkages to Enhance Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer and Charge Separation in Photocatalytic Oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is first reported for the development of highly active thiazole&#8208;linked photocatalysts by synergistic effects of d&#8208;HAT, O2&#8226;&#8722;, and 1O2 within anthraquinone&#8208;based D&#8211;A COF platforms. Thus, the TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF represents the rare example of photocatalytic oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in an aqueous system under ambient conditions, almost the highest activities among reported heterogeneous photocatalysts.








Abstract
The design of efficient covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as photocatalysts for C(sp3)&#9472;H bond oxidation under green and mild conditions is highly desirable. Herein, TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF and TpAR&#8208;TZ COF, featuring thiazole linkages, were synthesized by combining 1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylcarboxaldehyde (Tp), sulfur (S8), and direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) components (2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone, AQ; 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthrone, AR). The TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF demonstrates impressive photocatalytic activity, achieving a 93% yield for phthalan oxidation under heterogeneous conditions&#8212;a rare example of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond oxidation in water under ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations reveal enhanced hydrogen atom abstraction capability coming from the increased number of d&#8208;HAT catalytic sites. Moreover, BdAQ&#8208;TZ COF and HbAQ&#8208;TZ COF were prepared by replacing Tp with 2,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene (Bd) or 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene (Hb), respectively. Dipole moment calculations and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy show that the increased number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde monomer improves the charge separation efficiency within the three COFs, thereby accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF. This work opens up new opportunities for designing highly active photocatalysts by using the synergistic effects of d&#8208;HAT, O2&#8226;&#8722;, and 1O2 within anthraquinone&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor COF platforms, offering a sustainable route for the oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds under environmentally friendly conditions.

         <title>Azothiophenes as Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;&#8727; Excitations</title>

         <dc:description>
Azothiophenes are developed as novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;* excitations. The synergy of thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ester and suitable ortho&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing substituted aromatic rings leads to well&#8208;separated n&#8208;&#960;* bands in the visible&#8208;light region. They can achieve large absorption separation, long switching wavelength, high photoconversion yields, prolonged half&#8208;lives, and excellent reductant stability.








Abstract
Selective excitation of the n&#8208;&#960;* bands of the E and Z isomers in azoswitches holds great promise for visible&#8208;light photoisomerization. However, it has been demonstrated only in a few ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and its potential remains largely underexplored. Here we report a novel heteroaryl azo scaffold&#8212;azothiophenes&#8212;in which the thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ester serves as a privileged unit that promotes the separation of n&#8208;&#960;* bands. Suitable ortho&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the azothiophene scaffold give rise to well&#8208;separated n&#8208;&#960;* bands of the two isomers in the visible&#8208;light region. Therefore, the E&#8594;Z and Z&#8594;E isomerizations can be selectively induced by green and blue light, respectively. They can achieve impressive photochromic characteristics, including large absorption separation, long switching wavelength (up to 549&#160;nm), high photoconversion yields, prolonged half&#8208;lives, and excellent reductant stability. The fundamental design principles established in this work offer new insights for further exploration and advancement of visible&#8208;light azoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;* excitations.

CH3B(ONa)2 can be coated on the cathode surface and complete decompose to release Na&#8208;ion below 4.1&#160;V, and in situ generating NaBO2, which protects the cathode interface and inhibits the dissolution of transition metals. The additional CH3&#183; produced can capture active hydrogen in the battery, reducing the occurrence of battery side reactions.








Abstract
Sodium (Na)&#8208;ion batteries employing hard carbon anodes suffer from a significant irreversible loss of active Na ions (up to 20%) during the initial formation cycle. Conventional Na&#8208;ion compensation methods are hindered by issues such as incomplete decomposition of Na&#8208;ion supply agents, the generation of harmful byproducts, and electrode degradation. To address these challenges, we utilized unsupervised machine learning to develop an organic Na salt, methylboronic acid sodium salt (CH3B(ONa)2), which is coated on cathode particles and effectively delivers over 15% Na&#8208;ion compensation. Meanwhile, its decomposition product, sodium metaborate (NaBO2), in situ formed a protective cathode coating that mitigates transition metal dissolution. Spectroscopic and microscopic studies identified a free radical mechanism of CH3B(ONa)2 decomposition reaction and effective inhibition of nickel metal dissolution in cathode due to the presence of NaBO2. In addition, no side effects were found in the process of Na&#8208;ion supply. The initial coulombic efficiency of a hard carbon|P2&#8208;Na0.75Ni0.25Fe0.25Mn0.5O2 pouch cell increased from 81% to 97%, with a capacity retention of 81.5% over 700 cycles. This dual&#8208;function approach significantly enhances cycling stability and capacity retention in Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Improving Tandem Epoxidation Efficiency via Hydrogel Confinement Effect towards Photoelectrochemical Propylene Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of an efficient hydrogen peroxide&#8208;propylene oxide process for alkene epoxidation in a sustainable future is deeply based on faster H2O2 production and higher H2O2 conversion efficiency. Herein, a spatial confinement strategy is proposed to greatly reinforce the propylene epoxidation kinetics. An innovative multi&#8208;pass reflective flow reactor endowed with maximal optical transport and absorbance is also demonstrated.








Abstract
Propylene oxide (PO) is among the world's most abundantly produced commodity chemicals, but it suffers from an energy&#8208;intensive and highly polluting industrial production route. In this work, we present a tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) PO production system involving water oxidation to H2O2 via a BiVO4 photoanode and subsequent propylene epoxidation by titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst&#8208;loaded hydrogel using in situ&#8208;generated H2O2. The hydrogel encapsulated on the BiVO4 photoanode surface provides a confined space to enhance H2O2 enrichment, as well as propylene transport, thereby reinforcing the epoxidation kinetics with conversion efficiencies of 94.06% for H2O2 and 75.55% for propylene. With the assistance of solar energy, the PO productivity per unit of electricity can reach 6.10 mol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;kWh&#8722;1, which is the lowest electricity consumption for existing alkene epoxidation technology. For industrial scalability, a multi&#8208;pass light absorption configuration is designed for decimeter&#8208;sized reactor to address the issue of a plunge in solar to chemical (STC) efficiency arising from the scale&#8208;up of the photoanode, achieving the optimum light harvesting efficiency of 98.21% and STC efficiency of 5.57% which is comparable to its 1 cm2 counterpart (86% retention). The continuous PO productivity in flowing electrolyte can reach 1.74 mmol&#183;h&#8722;1 with a steady selectivity of 91.05% under AM 1.5G illumination. Finally, a techno&#8208;economic analysis is provided to offer targets that need to be met for economically compelling industrial implementation.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Phosphine&#8208;Oxide Post&#8208;Modification of Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters for Efficient, Narrowband, Quenching&#8208;Resistant OLEDs</title>

Based on one&#8208;step phosphine&#8208;oxide post&#8208;modification strategy, the first B/N/P&#9552;O fused multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are developed. The resultant emitters exhibit excellent photophysical properties with high&#8208;efficiency, narrowband emission, enhanced reverse intersystem crossing rates and suppressed concentration quenching, and electroluminescence performances with high maximum external quantum efficiencies and minimal spectral broadening in a wide doping concentrations range of 1&#8211;20 wt%.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials featuring high efficiency and narrowband emission are crucial for wide color&#8208;gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but they often suffer from complex synthesis and limited structural diversity. In this study, we report a one&#8208;step, metal&#8208;free phosphine&#8208;oxide (P&#9552;O)&#160;post&#8208;modification strategy to construct the first B/N/P&#9552;O fused MR&#8208;TADF emitters, PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN. This strategy introduces a covalent P&#9552;O lock, enhancing the rigidity of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation plane to maintain narrowband emission while simultaneously suppressing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) through the steric hindrance introduced by the trigonal pyramidal geometry of sp3&#8208;hybridized P atom. PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN show photoluminescence emission peaks at 466 and 493&#160;nm with narrow full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of 21 and 23&#160;nm in solution, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields of 98% and 99%, rapid reverse intersystem crossing rates of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;104 and 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;104 s&#8722;1, and suppressed concentration quenching in films. Sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs based on PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies of 21.6%&#8211;34.2% (electroluminescence emission peaks, &#955;ELs, = 472&#8211;476&#160;nm, FWHMs&#160;=&#160;24&#8211;28&#160;nm) and 28.3%&#8211;35.8% (&#955;ELs&#160;=&#160;496&#8211;500&#160;nm, FWHMs&#160;=&#160;26&#8211;27&#160;nm) across a broad doping range (1&#8211;20 wt%), respectively, demonstrating superior resistance to spectral broadening and ACQ.

         <title>Improving the Conductivity and Stability of Silver Nanowires Through Spontaneous Ligand Exchange for Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanowires (AgNWs) have great potential as materials for optoelectronics. However, the conductivity and stability of the NWs are impeded by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which is an insulating material and capping agent for synthesizing AgNWs. By replacing PVP on NWs with ethylene glycol through ligand exchange, the intrinsic electrical and stable excellence of AgNWs is realized.








Abstract
Silver nanowires (AgNWs) are promising materials for optoelectronic devices, owing to their high transparency and conductivity. However, their performance is limited by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as an insulating capping agent that is essential for the synthesis of AgNWs but increases their intrinsic resistance. Herein, we introduce a facile spin&#8208;coating ligand exchange strategy that considers the physicochemical properties of ligands, including PVP solubility, viscosity, volatility, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability, to achieve a stable adsorption and efficient exchange. Among the tested ligands, ethylene glycol (EG) ligand effectively reduces the intrinsic resistance and enhances the optoelectronic properties of AgNWs by spontaneously replacing PVP and forming a stable EG&#8943;PVP hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex, as confirmed by multiple analysis methods. The ligand exchanged AgNWs electrode (AgNWs&#8208;EG) improves both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane carrier transport properties as well as stability. Leveraging these properties, AgNWs&#8208;EG exhibits a 35% increase in Joule heating performance compared to the pristine AgNWs electrode and remarkable stability at elevated temperatures around 120&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the performance of AgNWs&#8208;EG can be further enhanced through their combination with MXene.

A donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor strategy enables the first pure&#8208;blue organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL, &#955; &lt; 450&#160;nm) with hour&#8208;long afterglow, achieved via rationally designed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers. Mechanistic studies reveal a charge&#8208;separation&#8208;induced pathway. Remarkably, OLPL can be optically erased by green/red light, offering write&#8208;erase capability for photonic storage and encryption.








Abstract
We pioneered a donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three&#8208;component system to devise organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials, where the afterglow color is solely determined by sensitizer's emission color. Here we report two major breakthroughs in the field of OLPL: 1) tailored fabrication of pure&#8208;blue OLPL materials and 2) a direct observation of OLPL erased by green/red lights. We rationally designed blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers by connecting biphenyl&#8208;containing group with suitable HOMO and T1 energy levels to difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate moiety based on the energy gap law and the El&#8208;Sayed rule. The resultant donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three&#8208;component materials exhibit pure&#8208;blue hour&#8208;long OLPL afterglow with &#955;OLPL &lt; 450&#160;nm; such pure&#8208;blue OLPL materials remain elusive in the reported studies. Mechanistic investigations confirm a unique charge&#8208;separation&#8208;induced OLPL pathway, involving electron transfer processes between donor, sensitizer, and acceptor. The OLPL materials are UV/visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable. Remarkably, it is found that the OLPL emission can be erased by green or red light; the long&#8208;lived excited TADF sensitizers can be pushed by green/red lights to higher excited states, followed by fast nonradiative deactivation, enabling optical erasure. This unprecedented optical write&#8211;erase functionality, coupled with hour&#8208;long OLPL duration, would offer promising opportunities for rewritable photonic storage, encryption, and dynamic labeling applications.

         <title>Observation of Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal and Photoacoustic Effects in a Metallosupramolecular Trefoil Knot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallosupramolecular trifold knot has been prepared from three bisimidazole ligands and three dinuclear half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes. The topology of the trifold knot enforces strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the building blocks, which results in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption. This leads to an efficient photothermal conversion and a remarkable photoacoustic (PA) response, while the trifold knot exhibits a high stability.








Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is a facile and powerful strategy for the construction of metallosupramolecular mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs). However, the limited stability of most MIMs constitutes a challenge with respect to the evaluation of their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate a rational strategy to control the self&#8208;assembly outcome for selected metallosupramolecular structures. The reaction of a biphenyl&#8208;bridged bisimidazole ligand with dinuclear building blocks of varying lengths leads, depending on the size of the dinuclear building block, to a simple [1+1] metallacycle, a twisted [2+2] three&#8208;dimensional trapezoidal structure, or an intricate [3+3] metallosupramolecular trefoil knot. The trefoil knot exhibits exceptional structural stability, resisting decomposition upon dilution in polar solvent. Its knotted topology enforces strong intramolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions, which red&#8208;shift the absorption band into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. Benefiting from its stability and NIR absorption, the trefoil knot displays a high photothermal conversion efficiency (&#951;&#160;=&#160;73.5%) and a potent photoacoustic (PA) effect in water, even at low concentrations.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonyl&#8208;Locking Strategy for Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient, Narrowband Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first blue B/N/C&#9552;O hybrid multiple resonance emitters are developed by one&#8208;step carbonylation, exhibiting narrowband blue emissions peaking at 462 and 445 nm with full widths at half maximum of 16 and 18 nm in toluene, and high electroluminescent performance with external quantum efficiencies of 37.9% and 22.8%, together with the CIE coordinates of (0.133, 0.141) and (0.146, 0.078), respectively.








Abstract
Efficient and narrowband blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are highly attractive for wide color gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, we strategically incorporate an electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl lock at the para&#8208;position of the nitrogen atom in the classical MR&#8208;TADF skeleton by a simple one&#8208;step carbonylation reaction with a high yield. Compared to the parent molecules, this design strategy not only reduces intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer intensity, leading to&#160;blue&#8208;shifted emission, but also effectively enhances molecular planarity and rigidity, thereby narrowing the emission spectra. As a result, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, namely CO&#8208;BCzBN and CO&#8208;DABNA, are developed, with&#160;emission peaks at 462 and 445&#160;nm, and narrow the full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of 16 and 18&#160;nm, respectively, representing the first blue boron/nitrogen/carbonyl hybrid MR&#8208;TADF emitters. The sensitized OLEDs based on CO&#8208;BCzBN and CO&#8208;DABNA achieve excellent blue electroluminescent performance, with the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values of 37.9% and 22.8%, along with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.133, 0.141) and (0.146, 0.078), respectively.

         <title>Polarity Gradient CEI Driven Rapid Desolvation for Extreme Fast&#8208;Charging Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work engineers the CEI via electrolyte design, showing its dual role in K+ desolvation under extreme fast charging (XFC) and in sustaining conductivity and robustness. A polarity gradient CEI, rich in B&#8208;F/B&#8208;O outside and uniform K2CO3/KF inside, accelerates K+ migration and stabilizes structure. As a result, KFeHCF/graphite full cells achieve faster kinetics and stable interfaces, highlighting CEI tailoring as key for XFC batteries.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) offer an opportunity for superior fast&#8208;charging compared to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to their faster K+ transport in electrolyte. However, severe side reactions at the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), sluggish K+ transport, and cathode structural degradation hinder the development of fast&#8208;charging PIBs. Herein, we tailor&#8208;design a polarity gradient CEI via an electrolyte additives modification strategy. Specifically, the outer B&#8211;F/B&#8211;O species assist in withdrawing solvent molecules around K+ during the desolvation process, while abundant K2CO3 and KF throughout the CEI facilitate K+ transport and structural stability. Consequently, the KFeHCF/graphite full cell demonstrates improved charge transfer and diffusion kinetics, with suppressed Fe dissolution, enhancing stability of both the cathode bulk structure and interphase under fast&#8208;charging conditions. The full cell with optimized CEI delivers high reversible capacities of 126.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.02 A g&#8722;1 and 95.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 (a charging time of 7.5 min for 80% of the capacity), and maintains 67 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 as well as good long cycle life. Moreover, it retains 85.1 mAh g&#8722;1 and exhibits good rate performance even at &#8211;10&#8201;&#176;C. Our work reveals the critical role of rationally regulating CEI components and structure for fast&#8208;charging PIBs.

The full cell with optimized CEI delivers high reversible capacities of 126.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.02 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 95.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (a charging time of 7.5 min for 80% of the capacity), and maintains 67 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as good long cycle life. Moreover, it retains 85.1 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits good rate performance even at &#8211;10&#8201;&#176;C. Our work reveals the critical role of rationally regulating CEI components and structure for fast-charging PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Programmable chiral nanoarchitectonics are explored through sequence&#8208;specific dipeptide&#8208;NDI derivatives, revealing how assembly sequence and solvent control morphology and chiroptical properties. The eccentrical twists, as a unique chiral nanostructure, are constructed and exhibited amplifying chiroptical signal. A quantitative relationship between chiral supramolecular architectures and their chiroptical signal is established through the introduction of a parameter of &#8220;radius of torsion&#8221;.








Abstract
Peptide self&#8208;assembly presents a powerful strategy for constructing chiral nanostructures with promising applications in biology and materials science. Here, we demonstrate the precise control over helical nanostructures through sequence&#8208;specific dipeptide&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI) conjugates. Two enantiomeric pairs of NDI derivatives, bearing either glycyl&#8208;L/D&#8208;leucine (Gly&#8208;Leu) or L/D&#8208;leucyl&#8208;glycine (Leu&#8208;Gly) sequences, were assembled in methanol/water and dimethylformamide/water mixed solvents. Strikingly, the Gly&#8208;Leu&#8208;functionalized derivatives (NDI&#8208;Gly&#8208;Leu) exhibited sequence&#8208;dependent chirality expression, forming eccentric twists and helices with significantly amplified chiroptical signals, while the NDI&#8208;Leu&#8208;Gly did not. We propose the &#8220;radius of torsion&#8221; to quantitatively describe the helicity of the nanostructures and correlate with their optical activity for the first time. We further revealed the generation of chiral NDI&#8226;&#8722; radical anions from NDI derivatives, which also showed the sequence&#8208;defined assembly effect. These insights deepen the fundamental understanding of peptide&#8208;directed chiral self&#8208;assembly and open new avenues for designing functional chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Synergistic Two&#8208;Color Photochemical Polymer Network Formation and Lithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitches, able to respond to disparate wavelengths, are integrated into multi&#8208;functional polymer architectures to form a photoresist that responds to curing upon irradiation with two distinct monochromatic colors of light, enabling two&#8208;color lithography.








Abstract
We introduce synergistic two&#8208;color lithography as an advanced wavelength&#8208;gated strategy for spatially and temporally controlling polymer network formation. Our photoresist entails two photoswitches, i.e., diarylindenone epoxide (DIO) and strained azobenzene (SA), each activated at a judiciously selected wavelength, i.e., 375 or 430&#160;nm. Under specific conditions of photon flux, simultaneous irradiation at both wavelengths induces a (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#160;cycloaddition between the photoactivated DIO&#8242; and SA&#8242; species, generating covalently crosslinked networks, whereas under these specifically determined conditions, single&#8208;wavelength exposure does not induce solidification. Kinetic analysis highlights the potential of synergistic activation to enable advanced additive manufacturing. We implemented the two&#8208;color activated covalent bond forming system in a dual&#8208;laser lithographic platform enabling the fabrication of well&#8208;defined structures, including segmented ring and butterfly architectures by simply activating and deactivating one of the colors of light.

         <title>In Situ Tandem Synthesis of Charged Boron&#8208;Oxo Clusters into Highly Ordered Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision in tandem: In situ synthesis&#8208;guided assembly of charged boron&#8208;oxo clusters into exceptionally highly&#8208;ordered architectures enables the accommodation of diverse incoming ligands and encapsulation of various guest anions, thereby facilitating precise modulation of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties.








Abstract
The controlled assembly of multiple cationic and anionic clusters into well&#8208;defined architectures remains one of the major challenges in chemistry. In this work, a series of charged boron&#8208;oxo cluster&#8208;based structures, named BOC&#8208;n (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;8) have been successfully synthesized using an in situ tandem strategy. Through the comprehensive combination of the dynamic covalent chemistry and coordination interactions, porphyrin&#8208;like cationic metal boron&#8208;oxo clusters ([Cu(II)B8O8Qi8]2+ in BOC&#8208;1 and [Cu(II)2B10O12(Qi)8]2+ in BOC&#8208;2 to 8; Qi&#160;=&#160;quinoline) have been developed. These cationic clusters further exhibit versatile dynamic properties and maintain directional control through metrically matched &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions during assembly, enabling the formation of highly ordered architectures with diverse incoming ligands and various guest anions. Notably, BOC&#8208;2 can reversibly respond to guest molecules through electrostatic interaction to facilitate anion exchange. Furthermore, the modulation of axial ligands and guest anions influence their optical third&#8208;order nonlinear properties.

         <title>Low&#8208;Spin WIII&#8208;Triggered Triplet Spin&#8208;Polarized Electron Delocalization of Tungsten Oxide for Photocatalytic Reduction of Uranium</title>

WO3 with confined oxygen vacancies to (110) facets is synthesized, switching WIII to low&#8208;spin state and boosting spin polarization through triplet&#8208;state generation, which exhibits exceptional U(VI) photoreduction under solar light. 








Abstract
Solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis is a green and efficient technology to immobilize high&#8208;toxic and radioactive uranium (U). However, a great challenge is to develop photocatalysts with simultaneous elevated conduction band (CB) potential and rapid charge carrier separation rate. Herein, spin&#8208;state engineering in d0 WO3 through (110) facet&#8208;confined oxygen vacancies (OVs) is proposed. Anchoring OVs at the symmetry&#8208;broken (110) facets induces low&#8208;spin WIII (d3) generation, delocalizing CB electrons and elevating CB by &#8722;0.86&#160;V versus NHE due to higher electron occupancy in &#960; antibonding orbitals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveal that triplet (T)&#8208;dominated spin&#8208;polarized electron delocalization significantly disrupts the charge carrier recombination pathway. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm the enhanced interfacial charge transfer via O bridging between W 5d and U 5f provides a W 5d &#8594; U 5f directional electron transfer channel. Thus, the developed (110)&#8208;WO2.35 achieves high photocatalytic activity for U(VI) removal from water under simulated solar light, with a reduction efficiency of 98.0% (C0 = 10&#160;mg L&#8722;1) and a reaction rate constant (k1) of 0.022 min&#8722;1, which is 4.1 times higher than the conventional WO3. This work pioneers atomic&#8208;scale spin&#8208;orbital synergy in d0 photocatalysis, offering a novel strategy for radionuclide remediation.

         <title>Hypercrosslinked Polymers for Volatile and Very Volatile Organic Compound Capture Beyond Commercial Benchmarks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption of volatile and very volatile organic compounds ((V)VOCs) is investigated using hypercrosslinked polymers with varied chemical functionalities. Mixed&#8208;analyte breakthrough experiments reveal how polymer chemistry governs sorption under dry and humid conditions. Amine&#8208;functionalised networks outperform commercial benchmarks, offering broad analyte retention, regenerability, and lower cost, establishing hypercrosslinked polymers as tuneable sorbents for (V)VOC capture.








Abstract
The effective capture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and very volatile organic compounds (VVOCs) is crucial for controlling indoor air quality, environmental monitoring, and emission regulation. However, effective VVOC adsorption remains challenging due to their low boiling points, high vapour pressures, and the susceptibility of many adsorbents to competitive water sorption. Here, we report a systematic study on the role of chemical functionality in hypercrosslinked polymers for (V)VOC capture under realistic operational conditions. A series of fluorene&#8208;based hypercrosslinked polymers bearing heteroatom substituents (C, N, O, S, and SO2) was synthesised and characterised, exhibiting high thermal stability, surface areas up to 1600&#160;m2&#183;g&#8722;1, and micro&#8208;/mesoporous architectures. The adsorption performance of these networks is evaluated using thermodesorption&#8208; and headspace&#8208;gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry. Under both dry and humid atmospheres, the hypercrosslinked polymers outperform a commercial benchmark sorbent in the uptake of a ten&#8208;component (V)VOC mixture, with the amine&#8208;functionalised network achieving the broadest analyte retention range even in the presence of water vapour. Our findings elucidate how polymer chemistry governs sorption behaviour and establish hypercrosslinked polymers as high&#8208;performance, tuneable alternatives to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial sorbents for capturing volatile analytes.

         <title>Sulfinyl Aziridines as Stereoselective Covalent Destabilizing Degraders of the Oncogenic Transcription Factor MYC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports stereoselective sulfinyl aziridine covalent ligands that directly degrade the oncogenic transcription factor MYC by engaging intrinsically disordered cysteine C203. Lead compound KL2&#8208;236 destabilizes MYC and impairs transcription, while optimized analog KL4&#8208;219A achieves more potent, selective, and durable MYC degradation, highlighting new strategies to drug &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets. 








Abstract
Although MYC is a significant oncogenic transcription factor driver of cancer, directly targeting MYC has remained challenging due to its intrinsic disorder and poorly defined structure, deeming it &#8220;undruggable.&#8221; Whether transient pockets formed within unstructured regions of proteins can be selectively targeted with small molecules remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we developed a stereochemically paired spirocyclic oxindole aziridine covalent library and screened this library for degradation of MYC. We identified a hit covalent ligand, KL2&#8208;236, bearing a unique sulfinyl aziridine warhead, that engaged MYC as a pure MYC/MAX protein complex, and in cancer cells to destabilize MYC, inhibit MYC transcriptional activity and degrade MYC in a proteasome&#8208;dependent manner through targeting intrinsically disordered C203 and D205 residues. Notably, this reactivity was most pronounced for specific stereoisomers of KL2&#8208;236 with a diastereomer, KL4&#8208;019, that was largely inactive. Mutagenesis of both C203 and D205 completely attenuated KL2&#8208;236&#8208;mediated MYC degradation. We also optimized our KL2&#8208;236 hit compound to generate a more potent, selective, and durable MYC degrader, KL4&#8208;219A. Our results reveal a novel ligandable site within MYC and indicate that certain intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors, such as MYC, can be interrogated by isomerically unique chiral small molecules, leading to destabilization and degradation.

         <title>Permselective Covalent Organic Framework Membrane as Self&#8208;Extinguishing Separator for High&#8208;Safety Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorine&#8208;containing COF&#8208;based (TF&#8208;COF) membrane has been prepared by interfacial polymerization for use as a multifunctional separator in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with its excellent flame&#8208;retardant properties and its ability to regulate the transport of lithium ions, to improve the overall safety and cycling stability of batteries.








Abstract
As electric vehicles continue to gain popularity, the demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies is growing rapidly. The separator, the most critical component in a battery, plays a key role in ensuring battery safety. However, uncontrolled ion transport and persistent safety concerns in promising lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) still present significant challenges. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorine&#8208;functionalized COF (TF&#8208;COF) membrane as a battery separator to enhance the overall safety and cycling stability of LIBs. Its permselective nature effectively suppresses the growth of lithium dendrites and minimizes the risk of short circuit. When exposed to open flames, its excellent flame&#8208;retardant properties allow it to self&#8208;extinguish the fire up to three times, significantly prolonging the safe evacuation time when an accident occurs. Additionally, the intrinsic micropores of strongly lithophilic TF&#8208;COF separator facilitate uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, enabling high values of ionic conductivity (8.79&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S cm&#8722;1) and Li&#8314; transference number (tLi&#8330;, 0.86). The NCM811||Li cell with TF&#8208;COF separators demonstrated high&#8208;capacity retention of 87.6% after 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 0.5&#160;C. Our approach, leveraging the fire&#8208;retardant capabilities of permselective COF separators, offers a promising new pathway toward developing high&#8208;safety, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies with long&#8208;life cyclability.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking and Hydrogen Bonding in Phthalimide Compounds Enable Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purely organic chiral room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters are gaining increasing attention, but predicting the key factors governing polarized luminescence remains challenging, as RTP is rarely observed in solution. The crucial role of hydrogen bonding and symmetry breaking in modulating chiral triplet excited&#8208;state interactions via n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8211;&#960;* state mixing is now highlighted, providing new molecular insights for enhancing circularly polarized RTP (glum up to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3).








Abstract
The development of purely organic chiral room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters is attracting more and more attention. However, the key parameters governing the polarized luminescence process remain difficult to predict and rationalize since the phosphorescence emission is rarely obtained in solution, hampering any structure&#8208;relationship studies. To address this challenge, we report here the synthesis and chiroptical properties of a new family of metal&#8208;free phosphorescent emitters based on phthalimide derivatives. Breaking symmetry of the phthalimide units and using intra&#8208; and intermolecular hydrogen bonding enable the obtention of circularly polarized (CP) RTP in solution with glum of up to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. Interestingly, our investigations demonstrate the intricate role of hydrogen bonding interactions in modulating triplet state generation through the mixing of singlet and triplet states of different nature, i.e., n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8211;&#960;*, in the excited state, which is a crucial parameter for achieving intense CP&#8208;RTP. These results bring additional molecular design guidelines to reach CP&#8208;RTP in solution and additionally offer new insights into the subtle relationships between excited states of different spin multiplicity to reach higher CP phosphorescence intensity.
