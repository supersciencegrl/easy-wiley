         <title>Steric Coordinated Electrolytes for Fast&#8208;Charging and Low&#8208;Temperature Energy&#8208;Dense Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric coordination chemistry between Li+ and ether solvent provides sufficient ion transport over a wide&#8208;temperature range, high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, and fast charge transfer process, which enable the long&#8208;term stability, fast charging capability and low&#8208;temperature adaptation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Electrolytes are known as the dominant factors for fast&#8208;charging affordability and low&#8208;temperature capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the current electrolytes can hardly simultaneously satisfy all the required characteristics, including sufficient ion transport, high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, and fast de&#8208;solvation process over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Here, we report a solution by designing electrolyte solvents that coordinate with Li+ in steric configuration. The steric coordinated electrolytes (SCEs) can overcome the dilemma of quasi&#8208;planer coordinated ether electrolytes that has to be weakly coordinated with Li+ to avoid solvent co&#8208;intercalation towards graphite (Gr) anode, therefore enabling the merits including sufficiently dissociation of Li&#8208;salt with high ionic conductivity, low de&#8208;solvation energy, and forming electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with low energy barrier. As results, the SCEs with only single&#8208;salt and single&#8208;solvent (trimethoxymethane) achieve fast kinetics towards Gr anode and high oxidation stability. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Gr LIBs can reach 80% state of the charge in 6&#160;min, and the Ah&#8208;level energy&#8208;dense pouch cells (4.5 V) retain 82.96% (500 cycles) and 85.94% (200 cycles) of initial capacities at room temperature and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Our work deepens the fundamental understanding of Li&#8208;ion solvation structures and affords an effective approach to design sustainable fluro&#8208;free electrolytes for battery systems.

         <title>Controlled Catalysis Delivering High Molecular Weight Polyesters as Recyclable Alternatives to Polystyrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work exemplifies how to make high molar mass ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) polyesters as engineering plastics, informing upon their thermal and mechanical properties. Leading polyesters, prepared by epoxide/anhydride ROCOP, show high glass transition temperatures and tensile and flexural strengths, matching or exceeding polystyrene properties.








Abstract
An organometallic Al(III)K(I) catalyst shows exceptional control in the epoxide/anhydride ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP), producing high molecular weight polyesters (Mn &#8764; 100&#160;kg&#183;mol&#8722;1). The catalysis is highly effective using cyclohexene oxide, cyclopentane oxide, substituted cyclohexene oxide, and butylene oxide, each combined with phthalic anhydride. The polyesters show entanglement molecular weights, determined by oscillatory shear rheology, from 13 to 50&#160;kg&#183;mol&#8722;1 with cyclopentene and substituted cyclohexene moieties being particularly effective (highly entangled). The lead polyesters show high glass transition temperatures (94&#160;&#176;C&#160;&lt;&#160;Tg&#160;&lt;&#160;137&#160;&#176;C), high tensile strengths (40&#160;MPa&#160;&lt;&#160;&#963;&#160;&lt;&#160;47&#160;MPa) and tensile modulii (0.6&#160;GPa&#160;&lt;&#160;Ey&#160;&lt;&#160;0.9&#160;GPa); their properties are similar to polystyrene. The polyesters are all recyclable by repeated cycles of compression molding, and show equivalently high thermal&#8208;mechanical performances even over repeated recycles.

         <title>Exploring Secondary Electrostatic Interactions Using Molecular Rotors: Implications for SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study experimentally tests the role of secondary electrostatic interactions in SN2 reactions using molecular rotors. Lower rotational barriers for sp2/sp carbons align with faster SN2 rates, isolating these effects from conjugation. The results reveal electrostatic interactions as a key factor, confirmed across diverse atoms like O, S, and N. 








Abstract
Benzylic and allylic electrophiles are well known to react faster in SN2 reactions than aliphatic electrophiles, but the origins of this enhanced reactivity are still being debated. Galabov, Wu, and Allen recently proposed that electrostatic interactions in the transition state between the nucleophile (Nu) and the sp2 carbon (C2) adjacent to the electrophilic carbon (C1) play a key role. To test this secondary electrostatic hypothesis, molecular rotors were designed that form similar through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions with C2 in their bond rotation transition states without forming bonds to C1. This largely eliminates the alternative explanation of stabilizing conjugation effects between C1 and C2 in the transition state. The rotor barriers were strongly correlated with the experimentally measured SN2 free energy. Notably, rotors where C2 was sp2 or sp&#8208;hybridized had barriers that were consistently 0.5&#8211;2.0&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 lower than those for rotors where C2 was sp3&#8208;hybridized. Computational studies of atomic charges were consistent with the formation of stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions. Further confirmation came from observing the benzylic effect in rotors where the first atom was varied, including oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and sp2&#8208;carbon. In summary, these studies provided strong experimental support for the role of secondary electrostatic interactions in the SN2 reaction.

         <title>An Adhesive Adaptation Layer Mitigates the Interfacial Instabilities of Rigid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical solid polymer electrolytes (H&#8208;SPEs) featuring an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) effectively mitigate interfacial instabilities in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries by reinforcing electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact and promoting uniform lithium deposition. This novel architecture demonstrates excellent cycling stability, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity retention over 960&#8197;cycles with high&#8208;loading NMC622 cathode.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely recognized as promising candidates for enabling solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with improved safety, high energy density, and extended cycling life. The traditional perspective posits that increasing the mechanical modulus of SPEs enhances their capacity to regulate Li0 deposition and suppress dendrite penetration. However, this study reveals a distinct failure mechanism: a rigid SPE with a high storage modulus suffers from delamination&#8208;induced cell failure due to its inability to accommodate the volumetric changes of the Li0 anode. To address these limitations, we developed a hierarchical SPE incorporating an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) positioned between the Li0 anode and the rigid SPE. The AAL combines strong adhesive strength, effectively mitigating delamination, with flowability, allowing it to eliminate interfacial voids and defects. Structural characterization via Cryo&#8208;TEM and SEM demonstrates that this hierarchical design facilitates uniform, dense, and whisker&#8208;free Li0 deposition, in sharp contrast to the uneven and porous morphology observed with the rigid SPE alone. Furthermore, the enhanced interfacial stability promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;enriched SEI layer, contributing to long&#8208;term cycling stability. As a result, the H&#8208;SPE exhibits superior electrochemical performance, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity over 960 cycles when paired with high&#8208;loading (1.6&#8197;mAh/cm2) NMC622 cathode.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput DFT Assisted Design of Electrode for Efficient High&#8208;Temperature Electrochemical Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protonic ceramic electrolysis cell (PCEC) is a promising technique to enable efficient dehydrogenation reactions for producing valuable chemicals, but is still limited by the lack of stable electrocatalysts to achieve efficient O&#8208;H/C&#8208;H dissociation. In this work, upon high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations, Ba(Zr,Co,Fe,M)O3&#8208;based (M represents dopants) perovskite is formulated, and oxygen vacancy formation energy ([[EQUATION]]) and hydration energy ([[EQUATION]]) are taken as two key performance indicators to screen potential PCEC electrode materials derived from this category. Trivalent doping elements, particularly, Y, Yb, Er, Tm, achieve a good balance between [[EQUATION]]and [[EQUATION]]. Experiments further validate that the BaZr0.125Co0.375Fe0.375Tm0.125O3&#8722;&#948; showed impressive dehydrogenation reaction activity, with Faradaic efficiency as high as 98.90% in water electrolysis, and outstanding ethane conversion rate (67.60%) and ethylene yield (62.62%) for ethane dehydrogenation reaction at 700 &#176;C. The computational approach can be applied to the rational design of novel electrode materials for other electrochemical reactions in energy and environment devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During photocatalytic nitrogen fixation for ammonia synthesis, the photo&#8208;Dember effect causes direct transmission of photogenerated electrons from the illuminated surface to the bottom of photocatalyst, thus significantly reducing the number of charge carriers migrating on the surface and nitrogen fixation efficiency. Herein, a bismuth oxychloride material with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) is synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield of 591.94 &#956;mol/(g&#183;h) after photocatalytic N2 reduction under simulated solar light irradiation. The designed (101)/(001) interface in BOC(101)&#8208;OVs generates a self&#8208;built electric field (Eself) on the material surface due to different atomic arrangements. Therefore, the newly developed material achieved &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing the transfer path, i.e., from bulk phase transfer to surface lateral transfer path, thus escaping confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect. Meanwhile, after OVs construction, each adsorbed N2 molecule simultaneously bonds with three Bi atoms of material through N 2p&#8211;Bi 6p bonding, accelerating the filling of high&#8208;energy electrons into the &#960;* orbital of N2, leading to a new nitrogen reduction path with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation. This study greatly advances the beneficial effect of charge carrier migration through overcoming the photo&#8208;Dember effect for ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Ion Transport in Ultrathin Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Nanofluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;efficiency ion transport is essential for both biological and non&#8208;biological processes, including the regulation of cell homeostasis, energy conversion, and mass transfer in chemical industry. Nanofluidic channels are considered ideal platforms for delicate control of ion transport in their unique nanoconfinement, yet currently reported one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidics are subjected to elevated transport resistance due to discontinuous and random channels. Here, we engineer ultrathin, three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) nanofluidics featuring continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, demonstrating superior ion conductance. The energy barrier for ion transport across 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics is exceptionally low, suggesting ultrafast and low&#8208;resistance ion movements. Theoretical calculations indicate that 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics facilitate group adsorption to anions, leading to high energy barriers for anion mobility, thus enhancing ion selectivity and high&#8208;throughput cation transport. In osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics achieve a power density of 217.7 W m&#8208;2 with artificial seawater and river water, potentially scalable to 1238.2 W m&#8208;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient. The proposed 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics offer new avenues for desalination and ion/molecular separation.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Nanotubule&#8208;Based Nanodevices with ATP&#8208;Responsive Gating for Direct Cytosolic Delivery of Nucleic Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delivering biomacromolecules to the cytosol remains a formidable challenge, as these molecules are predominantly sequestered within endosomes after endocytosis. The limited efficacy of current delivery systems in promoting reliable endosomal escape underscores the need for innovative strategies. Here, we report a DNA origami nanotubule to construct transmembrane delivery nanodevices with size&#8208;selective gating and ATP&#8208;responsive channel activation. By integrating unilamellar vesicles as large storage compartments, these nanodevices can encapsulate a wide range of macromolecules, including small interfering RNA, messenger RNA, plasmid DNA, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. By bypassing traditional endocytic pathways, the nanotubules enable the delivery of substantial payload quantities directly across the plasma membrane. This approach provides a promising platform for delivering macromolecular therapeutics into the cytosol, advancing gene therapy strategies, and broadening their biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction between electron&#8208;rich alkynes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has emerged as one of the most effective synthetic routes to prepare a large variety of molecular and polymeric electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems. Besides its simplicity, fast rate, and high yield, this reaction may also display complete and predictable regioselectivity, as for the case when tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is used in combination with unsymmetric, activated alkynes. Here, we report the first example of a [2+2] CA&#8208;RE reaction between TCNQ and an aniline&#8208;activated alkyne following an &#8220;inverted&#8221; regiochemistry, thus leading to the exclusive formation of an unexpected regioisomer in contrast to the expected one. A combined experimental and theoretical study helped us to unravel the peculiar reaction mechanism underlying the regioselectivity switching.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Sodium Cyclohexanolate/Phenoxide Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible hydrogen storage is a key challenge for the implementation of hydrogen energy, with dehydrogenation being particularly difficult because of its endothermic nature, slow kinetics, poor selectivity, etc. Solar energy&#8208;driven hydrogen uptake/release represents an interdisciplinary approach that provides an effective solution to those problems. Herein, we report the solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen uptake of 4.9 wt.% over sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair, achieving over 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. Notably, the initial dehydrogenation rate reaches 23.4 mmolH2gcat&#8208;1h&#8208;1&#160;that is ca. 2 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The superior photocatalytic performance stems from the synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light mainly provides heat, high&#8208;frequency light drives the desorption of product from the catalyst surface. This approach offers a path toward a sustainable solar&#8208;driven hydrogen energy system.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Charge Separated Synergistic Binding Sites in Self&#8208;healing Crystalline Porous Organic Salts for Benchmark Trace Alkyne/Alkene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of trace alkyne (C2H2/C3H4) impurities from alkenes (C2H4/C3H6) is a significant but challenging process to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 and C3H6. Herein, we reported an optimally designed charge&#8208;separated organic framework CPOS&#8208;1 with confined polar channels for highly efficient alkyne/alkene separation. CPOS&#8208;1 exhibits excellent stability, remarkably high C2H2 (18.4 cm3/g) and C3H4 (20.9 cm3/g) uptakes at 0.01 bar and 298 K, and benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (25.1) and C3H4/C3H6 (43.9) separation selectivities for 1/99 alkyne/alkene mixtures.

         <title>Switchable Closed&#8208;Shell and Open&#8208;Shell Biradical States in Bis&#8208;Palladium Complexes of Tetrathiadodecaphyrin via Coordination Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin (1), featuring two porphyrin&#8208;like sub&#8208;pockets separated by central carbazolylenes was synthesized. Metalation of the thiaporphyrinoid ligand with Pd(OAc)2 produces two distinct bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes with different coordination environments. Complex 2, adopting an {NNCS} metalation mode, exhibits a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure, whereas complex 3, with an {NNCC} coordination environment, exists as a ligand&#8208;centered organic biradicaloid with two magnetically independent spins (S = 1/2). Biradical formation is attributed to single&#8208;electron transfer from each ligand sub&#8208;pocket to the Pd(II) center accommodated in a d8 square&#8208;planner coordination geometry. Notably, the complexes are interconvertible through doubly one&#8208;electron redox processes, demonstrating a reversible metal coordination rearrangement via thiophene ring flipping within a porphyrinoid framework. This work establishes the first example of such tunable metal coordination, offering a precise strategy for modulating closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell biradical states. In addition, while complex 2 displays intense absorption and photoacoustic responses to the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) light in water after encapsulation within nanoparticles, the nanocomposites encapsulating biradicaloid 3 exhibits enhanced responsiveness in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Bounded Intracellular E3 Ubiquitin Ligase&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (MembTACs) for Targeted Membrane Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;bounded intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase&#8208;targeting chimeras (MembTACs) were developed to simultaneously recruit intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase and bind to the desired membrane proteins for targeted degradation of membrane proteins. MembTACs were demonstrated to effectively degrade membrane protein EpCAM and Met via the proteasome pathway, providing a new platform for membrane protein degradation and expanding PROTAC applications.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) represents a potent therapeutic strategy aimed at dismantling disease&#8208;associated target proteins. PROTAC is the most widely developed technique for intracellular protein degradation, while its degradation ability on membrane proteins has been hindered by the need for complex synthetic processes and limited permeability. In this study, we developed the membrane&#8208;bounded intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase&#8208;targeting chimeras (MembTACs) that simultaneously recruit intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase and bind to the desired membrane proteins for targeted degradation of membrane proteins. We demonstrate that the MembTACs can effectively utilize intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of EpCAM and Met via the proteasome pathway. We anticipate that the new platform will expand the range of PROTAC applications and provide a new dimension for targeted membrane protein degradation.

         <title>Sprayed Microdroplets Architect a Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While many past attempts have utilized micron&#8208;sized droplets for breaking and forming organic bonds, their potential in promoting inorganic bond formation reactions remains largely unexplored. We report a promising approach to synthesizing a tungsten&#8208;based Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) in various organic and aqueous microdroplets under ambient conditions, eliminating the traditional need for hazardous or corrosive chemicals and high&#8208;boiling solvents. When aerosolized, a simple tungstate (WO42&#8722;) solution spontaneously produces a metal&#8208;oxo cluster (W6O192&#8722;), a valuable POM with broad applications, achieving yields up to 99% in less than a millisecond. Mass spectrometric detection of reactive intermediates unraveled the nucleation mechanism in microdroplets, leading to the formation of polyoxotungstate, which was then further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Empirical observations collectively suggest that rapid solvent evaporation and subsequent enrichment of reactants in the confined volume of microdroplets likely facilitate the growth of the POM through partial solvation at the air&#8208;liquid interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron Doping&#8208;Induced Ultrahigh Ce3+ Ratio in Amorphous CeO2/GO Catalyst for Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct utilization of diluted CO2 enables sustainable CO2 conversion into valuable products, with reduced CeO2 emerging as an attractive candidate due to its exceptional redox flexibility. The catalytic efficacy of CeO2 is intimately tied to the electronic structure of 4f, yet the persistent challenge lies in maintaining a high and stable concentration of Ce3+. In this study, we propose a symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8208;induced amorphization strategy to achieve an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio by B doping, which facilitates the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in amorphous CeO2. First&#8208;principles calculations and infrared spectroscopy reveal that B doping&#160;with three excess electrons&#160;induces the formation of planar triangular B&#8208;O&#8323; units by disrupting the original high&#8208;symmetry &#160;structure of CeO2,&#160; facilitating&#160;the spontaneous transition to the amorphous phase. Electronic structure analysis confirms that even a modest 7.5% B doping can significantly elevate the Ce3+ ratio to 85.7%. The resulting amorphous B&#8208;doped CeO2/GO shows a remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 249.33 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1(under 1% CO2), with 100% selectivity in both cases. This performance highlights how amorphization stabilizes defect states, making amorphous CeO2/GO with high Ce3+ an effective material for CO2 photoreduction and addressing key challenges in CO2 capture and utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Leaflet&#8208;Anchored DNA Nanoprobes for Simultaneous Monitoring of Juxta&#8208;Plasma Membrane Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cell membrane functions as a bidirectional interface that coordinates the selective transport of substances and information between the interior and exterior of the cell. Simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer local environments surrounding this lipid bilayer is crucial for elucidating various cellular activities, but significantly challenged by the lack of technologies capable of precisely engineering biosensing probes on both membrane leaflets. In this work, by developing fusogenic nanoliposomes with high cell fusion efficiency, we successfully anchored amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PMin). By integrating this with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet (PMout), we achieved precise functionalization of both leaflets of the cell membrane, thus enabling simultaneous monitoring of localized targets within their respective juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments, avoiding signal contamination caused by the optical diffraction limit. Using selectively dual&#8208;leaflet&#8208;anchored tetrahedral DNAzyme probes, we revealed that the transmembrane ion channel SLC41A1 synergistically modulated the influx of Na+ and the efflux of Mg2+ in live cells. With a modular design, this membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoplatform can be readily extended for the study of bilateral interface&#8208;dominant cellular processes, shifting the paradigm towards a more localized and nuanced perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic Potential Matching in an Anion&#8208;Pillared Framework for Benchmark Hexafluoroethane Purification from Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step purification of CF3CF3 from ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture is crucial since its vital role in the semiconductor industry. However, efficient separation of chemically inert CF3CF3 remains challenging due to the difficulty in creating specific recognition sites in porous materials. In this work, we report the first example of anion&#8208;pillared MOFs to the separation of fluorinated electronic specialty gases, utilizing the unique electrostatic potential matching in the bipolar pores of SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to realize a benchmark CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 separation. SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu exhibits the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity at 0.01 bar, as well as the highest CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 IAST selectivity. Additionally, high&#8208;purity (&#8805; 99.995%) CF3CF3 with record productivity (882.9 L/kg) can be acquired through one&#8208;step breakthrough experiment of CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 (5/5/90). Theoretical calculations further reveal that the coexistence of electronegative SiF62&#8208; and partially electropositive H sites promotes SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to effectively anchor CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen Insertion via Asymmetric Condensation and Chirality Transfer: A Stereodivergent Entry to Cyanocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The condensation of prochiral cyclobutanones and diphenylphosphinyl hydroxylamine is achieved under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. Interestingly, the competing aza&#8208;Baeyer Villiger reaction is completely suppressed and the axially chiral oxime esters can be isolated in excellent yield and selectivity (up to 96% yield, up to 97:3 er). Computational analysis highlights the crucial role of the Br&#248;nsted acid in facilitating a successful condensation. Building on the inherent reactivity of the corresponding oxime esters, a one&#8208;pot protocol towards cyano&#8208;cyclopropanes was discovered, which establishes two consecutive stereocenters. This unusual ring contraction is triggered by strong base and permits an axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer with good enantiospecificity (up to 98% es). Fine&#8208;tuning the reaction parameters enables stereodivergent access to both diastereomers of the cyanocyclopropanes, and the utility of this method is demonstrated through the formal synthesis of the drug Tasimelteon.</dc:description>

         <title>Predator&#8208;Prey Behavior of Droplets Propelling through Self&#8208;Generated Channels in Crystalline Surfactant Layers.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Motile droplets provide an attractive platform for liquid matter&#8208;based applications and protocell analogues displaying life&#8208;like features. The functionality of collectively operating droplets increases by the advance of well&#8208;designed (physico)chemical systems directing droplet&#8208;droplet interactions. Here, we report a strategy based on crystalline surfactant layers at air/water interfaces, which sustain the propulsion of floating droplets and at the same time shape the paths for other droplets attracted by them. First, we show how decylamine forms a closed, crystalline layer that remains at the air/water interface. Second, we demonstrate how aldehyde&#8208;based oil droplets react to decylamine in the crystalline layer by forming an imine, causing the droplets to move through the layer while leaving behind an open channel (comparable to &#8220;Pacman&#8221;). Third, we introduce tri(ethylene glycol) monododecylether (C12E3) droplets in the crystalline layer. Whereas the crystalline layer suppresses the motion of the C12E3 droplets, the aldehyde droplets create surface tension gradients upon depletion of surfactants from the air/water interface, thereby driving Marangoni flows that attract the C12E3 droplets as well as the myelin filaments they grow: Causing the C12E3 droplets to chase, and ultimately catch, the aldehyde droplets along the channels they have created, featuring a predator&#8208;prey analogy established at an air/water interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis of Sequential Enantioselective Epoxidation by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase in Lasalocid A Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyether polyketides are a structurally diverse group of natural products known for their antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. Lasalocid A is a canonical natural polyether produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces lasalocidi. In lasalocid A biosynthesis, a polyene polyketide intermediate is converted to a bisepoxide by the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase enzyme Lsd18. Remarkably, Lsd18 acts on two distinct C=C groups in the substrate molecule, forming two (R,R) epoxides. We have determined the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Lsd18 in the substrate&#8208;free, substrate&#8208;bound, and product&#8208;bound forms. Our work has revealed that Lsd18 has an extra&#8208;large substrate&#8208;binding pocket that allows the polyene to adopt different conformations within the enzyme pocket. This feature enables Lsd18 to epoxidate both of the C=C groups. Additionally, a subpocket located near the Lsd18 active site controls stereoselectivity by dictating which face of the C=C group is placed next to the flavin. Molecular understanding of how Lsd18 transforms a polyene into a bisepoxide during lasalocid A biosynthesis lays the foundation for the production of designer polyethers for drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>A &#8220;Flexible&#8221; Solvent Molecule Enabling High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the BTF diluent and the 2,5&#8208;THF solvent result in an expansion of the bond angle in the 2,5&#8208;THF molecules. This structural alteration increases the steric hindrance of 2,5&#8208;THF, while simultaneously reducing its polarity. Consequently, the anion ratio within the solvation structure of the electrolyte is elevated, which enhances the electrochemical performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode.







Abstract
Electrolyte chemistries are crucial for achieving high cycling performance and high energy density in lithium metal batteries. The localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) exhibit good performance in lithium metal batteries. However, understanding how the intermolecular interactions between solvents and diluents in the electrolyte regulate the solvation structure and interfacial layer structure remains limited. Here, we reported a new LHCE in which strong hydrogen bonding between diluents and solvents alters the conformation and polarity of &#8220;flexible&#8221; solvent molecules, thereby effectively regulating the solvation structure of Li+ ion and promoting the formation of robust electrode interfaces. The endpoint H of the &#8220;flexible&#8221; chain O&#8208;CH&#8208;CH3 of the 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran (2,5&#8208;THF) solvent and the F of the benzotrifluoride (BTF) diluent can form strong hydrogen bonds, which expand the maximum bond angle of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule from 119&#176; to 123&#176;. The expanded bond angle increases the steric hindrance of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule and decreases its polarity. This leads to an increase in the anion content within the solvation structure, which in turn enhances the performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode. As a result, the lithium metal anode shows a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of as high as 99.4&#8201;%. The assembled Li||SPAN battery based on our developed LHCE exhibits impressive stability with an average CE of 99.8&#8201;% over 700 cycles. Moreover, the Li||SPAN pouch cell can be stably cycled with a high energy density of 301.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This molecular&#8208;level understanding of the correlation between molecular interactions and solvation structures provides new insights into the design of advanced LHCEs for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the BTF diluent and the 2,5-THF solvent result in an expansion of the bond angle in the 2,5-THF molecules. This structural alteration increases the steric hindrance of 2,5-THF, while simultaneously reducing its polarity. Consequently, the anion ratio within the solvation structure of the electrolyte is elevated, which enhances the electrochemical performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode.

This leads to an increase in the anion content within the solvation structure, which in turn enhances the performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode. As a result, the lithium metal anode shows a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of as high as 99.4&#8201;%. The assembled Li||SPAN battery based on our developed LHCE exhibits impressive stability with an average CE of 99.8&#8201;% over 700 cycles. Moreover, the Li||SPAN pouch cell can be stably cycled with a high energy density of 301.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This molecular-level understanding of the correlation between molecular interactions and solvation structures provides new insights into the design of advanced LHCEs for high-performance lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated DNA Intelligent Nanorobots for Cellular Lysosome Interference and Enhanced Therapeutics</title>

Logic&#8208;gated intelligent DNA nanorobots are engineered for cascade responses to extra&#8208;/intra&#8208;cellular microenvironmental factors (K+ and H+), enabling targeted cargo delivery, lysosomal interference, and enhanced cancer therapy.







Abstract
Environment&#8208;recognizing DNA nanodevices have proven promising for cellular manipulation and disease treatment, whereas how to sequentially respond to different cellular microenvironments remains a challenge. To this end, here we elaborate a logic&#8208;gated intelligent DNA nanorobot (Gi&#8208;DR) for the cascade response to inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;cellular microenvironments, thereby achieving lysosome&#8208;targeted cargo delivery for subcellular interference and tumor treatment with enhanced efficacy. Utilizing G&#8208;quadruplexes to respond to high&#8208;level K+ in cancer cell surrounding, this Gi&#8208;DR nanorobot can activate an aptamer&#8208;based transmembrane DNA machine that delivers molecular payloads to cellular lysosome. Accordingly, the nanoassembly of Gi&#8208;DR is promoted by the folding of heterodimeric i&#8208;motifs in the acidic microenvironment. Such a design allows the extra&#8208;/intra&#8208;cellular behaviors of the Gi&#8208;DR nanorobot to be programmed by an YES&#8208;AND logic circuit, with environmental K+ and H+ as two inputs. As a consequence, DNA nanostrips are controllably formed in living cells, interfering with lysosomal function and thereby preventing cellular proliferation. Further, a therapeutic agent (i.e. ligand&#8208;drug conjugate) is delivered into target cancer cells for synergistic tumor treatment in vivo, exhibiting the super&#8208;enhanced cancer cell lethality and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. It well illustrates that our designed logic&#8208;gated DNA nanorobot has broad application prospects in modulating cellular function and precision disease treatment.

         <title>Manipulating Dynamic Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition and Static Reversible Photochromism by an Organic Cocrystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a supramolecular assembly strategy for charge&#8208;transfer cocrystal system allows realization of a dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition as well as reversible photochromic behavior, in particular a time&#8208;dependent green&#8208;fading&#8208;yellow fluorescence variation during UV irradiation. These properties allow potential application in photoactivated anti&#8208;counterfeiting functional materials.







Abstract
Developing of molecular crystalline materials with light&#8208;induced multiple dynamic deformation in space dimension and photochromism on time scales has attracted much attention for its potential applications in actuators, sensoring and information storage. Nevertheless, organic crystals capable of both photoinduced dynamic effects and static color change are rare, particularly for multi&#8208;component cocrystal system. In this study, we first report the construction of charge transfer cocrystal allows their light&#8208;induced solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition and photochromic behaviors to be controlled by trans&#8208;stilbene (TSB) as an electron donor and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalonitrile (TFP) as an electron acceptor. In this case, the dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition is due to the photoisomerization of TSB under UV light irradiation, while the accumulation of melted droplets during solid&#8208;state photochemical process causes mechanical deformation of TSB&#8208;TFP cocrystals. The subsequent reversible photochromic behavior is attributed to the emergence of free radicals through a photo&#8208;induced electron transfer. Moreover, TSB&#8208;TFP microcrystals present typical excitation wavelength dependent emission (EWDE) fluorescence by surfactant&#8208;mediated method. This work realizes the dynamic&#8208;static photochemical cascade processes in response to UV light irradiation in an organic cocrystal system, providing the effective method for a new type of smart photo&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>A Strategy of Enhancing Polarization to Achieve Excellent Energy Storage Performance in Simple Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Based Relaxors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing the polarization of relaxors necessitates large local polarization and high breakdown field strength. Dielectrics with low hysteresis are obtained via the chemical regulation for Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 with substantial local polarity. Large polarization is released at a high electric field, thereby achieving exceptional dielectric energy&#8208;storage performance. The mechanism of its high performance is also elucidated through the local structure analysis at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Dielectric energy storage capacitors are indispensable components in advanced electronic and electrical systems. Excellent performance requires the dielectric materials possessing low residual polarization (Pr), high breakdown strength (Eb), and large maximum polarization (Pm). The first two parameters can be typically achieved through chemical regulation, while the Pmax is closely related to the matrix. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that a strong coupling of A&#8208;O bonds and a large lattice can enhance polarization, thus identifying the prototype Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 as a favorable matrix. Here, ultrahigh energy density of 16.5&#8197;J/cm3 and high efficiency of 88.2&#8201;% are achieved in 0.76Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;0.24Ca0.5Sr0.5HfO3 binary system. This system exhibits the highest comprehensive performance among all reported Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;based ceramics. The large perovskite framework facilitated by the large ionic radius of K+ enhances the local polarity of Bi&#8722;O and Ca&#8722;O, resulting in a large Pm of 57.4&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 under an ultrahigh Eb of 82&#8197;kV/mm. The highly disordered local polar clusters at the nanoscale lead to negligible Pr and high &#951;. This work not only provides a unique design concept to enhance the comprehensive energy storage performance from the perspective of local structure, but also offers insight into the origin of high performance.

         <title>Design and Construction of D&#8208;A&#8208;Extended 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing photocatalytic performance. While most studies have concentrated on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, research into their three&#8208;dimensional (3D) counterparts remains limited. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesized a carbazoyl dicyanobenzene derivative (TBFCC) as an intrinsic D&#8208;A building block. By selecting TAPA, TAPB, and TAPT as the donor, acceptor&#8208;&#960;, and acceptor donors, respectively, we synthesized three distinct D&#8208;A&#8208;extended COF materials: D&#8208;D&#8208;A, A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;A, and A&#8208;D&#8208;A. Among these, 3D&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF, featuring an A&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 31.3 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, surpassing most previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This superior performance is attributed to its A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration, which provides multiple charge transfer pathways in three&#8208;dimensional space, overcoming the electron transport limitations inherent in 2D COFs. Consequently, this feature facilitates efficient separation of photogenerated charges within the framework and reduces carrier recombination, thereby optimizing photocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Asymmetrically Coordinated Zn&#8722;MOF for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrosynthetic Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface coordination strategy has been developed by constructing Zn&#8722;O bridges between ZIF&#8208;7 and graphite felt matrix, which promotes NO electrocatalytic conversion into highly value&#8208;added piperidone oxime due to the faster electron transportation and distorted coordinated mode of Zn sites. It provides an impressive method for designing effective electrocatalysts towards electrosynthetic organic chemicals.







Abstract
Oximes are important intermediates for various chemicals synthesis such as pharmaceuticals, among which one vital precursor for producing neurological disease, antimicrobial and anticancer agents is piperidone oxime (PDO). Compared with conventional thermocatalytic method, it's more attractive to synthesize PDO via green electrocatalytic technology especially utilizing waste nitrogen oxides gas as nitrogen source. However, there are great challenges in catalyst design for high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthetic oxime due to the low electron transport rate and multiple competing reactions. Herein, we propose an interfacial coordination strategy based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) electrocatalyst for the first time to promote oxime electrosynthesis, by building Zn&#8722;O bridges between graphite felt (GF) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;7/CGF). Specially, ZIF&#8208;7/CGF delivers a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 75.9&#8201;% with yield up to 73.1&#8201;% for 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;piperidone oxime, which is far superior to the catalyst without Zn&#8722;O bridges (a FE of 10.7&#8201;% and yield of 10.3&#8201;%). In&#8208;depth mechanism study shows that the introducing Zn&#8722;O bridges can promote the electron transfer and induce Zn sites transforming into distorted tetrahedron (Zn&#8208;N3O) coordination mode, which benefits for intermediates adsorption and conversion. The developed strategy presents wide universalities towards various oximes electrosynthesis and adapts to other MOF materials (ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;4). This work provides new insights for electrosynthetic organic chemicals and upgrading nitrogen cycle through rational design surficial coordinated electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Allyl Ketones via BINAP&#8208;CuH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroacylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy allyl ketones: A highly enantioselective CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of benzhydryloxyallene for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones is reported. This highly facile and sustainable method also provides access to syn&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones with&#945;&#8208;substituted carboxylic anhydrides through &#8216;matched&#8208;mismatched&#8217; reaction pathway.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrocupration of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds to generate organometallic nucleophiles has recently become an attractive alternative to conventional stoichiometric reagents in the stereoselective synthesis. Herein, we have developed an efficient and economical method to synthesize enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones via a copper hydride (CuH)&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of alkoxyallenes, a significant advancement given the scarcity of reports on such scaffolds in the literature. DFT calculations reveal that this reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic attack of a kinetically favourable Z&#8208;selective allyl&#8208;copper intermediate on acid anhydrides via a six&#8208;membered chair&#8208;like transition state, stabilized by strongly attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions that ultimately leads to high level of enantioselectivities using the simple BINAP ligand. This method successfully overcomes the challenges of over&#8208;reduction of carbonyl functionality in the presence of CuH&#8208;complex, olefin isomerization and the presence of a highly enolizable &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, which can lead to erosion in enantioselectivities, making our strategy highly desirable. The reaction exhibits a wide range of substrate scope including symmetrical as well as carbonic anhydrides with both aromatic, and aliphatic substitutions. In addition, &#945;&#8208;substituted acid anhydrides provide exclusive syn&#8208;selective &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones in excellent enantiomeric ratios, where the nucleophilic allylation occurs on one of the carbonyls containing the matched &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, confirmed with mechanistic studies.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Plastic Depolymerization: In Situ Hydrogen Generation via Methanol Aqueous Phase Reforming for Sustainable Polyethylene Hydrogenolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem process was developed to convert polyethylene (PE) into n&#8208;alkanes by coupling PE hydrogenolysis with methanol aqueous phase reforming (APR). Utilizing a bimetallic Ru&#8722;Pt/TiO2 catalyst, the process achieved 85.1&#8201;% PE conversion and 81.0&#8201;% selectivity toward liquid fuels and lubricant oils, reducing reliance on fossil fuels through eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen generation.







Abstract
Depolymerizing plastic waste through hydrogen&#8208;based processes, such as hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking, presents a promising solution for converting plastics into liquid fuels. However, conventional hydrogen production methods rely heavily on fossil fuels, exacerbating global warming. This study introduces a novel approach to plastic waste hydrogenolysis that utilizes in situ hydrogen generated via the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of methanol, a biomass&#8208;derived chemical offering a more sustainable alternative. Our results show that a bimetallic Ru&#8722;Pt/TiO2 catalyst achieved high conversion (85.1&#8201;%) and selectivity (81.0&#8201;%) towards liquid fuels and lubricant oils in a tandem process combining polyethylene (PE) hydrogenolysis and methanol APR. By tuning the metal loading, we identified that Pt enhances hydrogen production through methanol APR, while Ru drives C&#8722;C bond cleavage, which is crucial for PE hydrogenolysis. Isotope labeling analysis confirmed that hydrogen generated from methanol APR is effectively utilized in the PE hydrogenolysis reaction. This method was also successfully applied to post&#8208;consumer polyolefin waste, with selectivity toward valuable products ranging from 75.0&#8201;% to 88.9&#8201;%. This study highlights an innovative strategy to reduce reliance on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen in plastic waste depolymerization, promoting both sustainability and environmental protection.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;driven Active Transport Across a Liquid Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe how a small&#8208;molecule catalyst can be transported against its concentration gradient, thanks to the energy provided by the chemical reaction it catalyzes. This non&#8208;equilibrium process builds macroscopic concentration gradients and can be triggered by the localized presence of co&#8208;catalysts. Spatial separation leads to simultaneous autocatalysis and negative feedback, connecting the worlds of molecular ratchets and nonlinear phenomena.







Abstract
Biology has mastered energy transduction, converting energy between various forms, and employing it to drive its vital processes. Central to this is the ability to use chemical energy for the active transport of substances, pumping ions and molecules across hydrophobic lipid membranes between aqueous (sub)cellular compartments. Biology employs information ratchet mechanisms, where kinetic asymmetry in the fuel&#8208;to&#8208;waste (i.&#8197;e., substrate&#8208;to&#8208;product) conversion results in catalysis&#8208;driven active transport. Here, we report an artificial system for catalysis&#8208;driven active transport across a hydrophobic phase, pumping a maleic acid cargo between aqueous compartments. We employ two strategies to differentiate the conditions in either compartment, showing that active transport can be driven either by adding fuel to a single compartment, or by differentiating the rates of activation and/or hydrolysis when fuel is present in both compartments. We characterize the nonequilibrium system through complete kinetic analysis. Finally, we quantify the energy transduction achieved by the catalysis&#8208;driven active transport and establish the emergence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms within the system.

We report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. A strongly coupled Pt&#8722;NiOx cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure simultaneously modulates the coordination environment of Pt and Ni, and delivers fast alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The corresponding AEMWE device with an ultra&#8208;low Pt loading of 50&#8197;&#956;gPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibits by far the best electrochemical performance (1.90&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The results highlight the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Carbon black has been extensively employed as the support for noble metal catalysts for electrocatalysis applications. However, the nearly catalytic inertness and weak interaction with metal species of carbon black are two major obstacles that hinder the further improvement of the catalytic performance. Herein, we report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. In the case of NiOx cluster&#8208;decorated carbon black, a strongly coupled cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure consisting of Pt clusters and NiOx clusters (Pt&#8722;NiOx/C) is formed and delivers greatly enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The NiOx clusters can not only accelerate the hydrogen evolution process as the co&#8208;catalyst, but also optimize the adsorption of H intermediates on Pt and stabilize the Pt clusters. Notably, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Pt&#8722;NiOx/C as the cathode catalyst (with a loading of only 50&#8197;&#956;gPt cm&#8722;2) delivers the most competitive electrochemical performance reported to date, requiring only 1.90&#8197;V to reach a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The results demonstrate the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Valence State Hydrogen Channel Enhances Sustained and Controllable Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Diabetic Skin Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a novel valence&#8208;state hydrogen channel mechanism, the hydrogen evolution reaction performance of the CoP catalyst under neutral conditions has been significantly improved. Based on this catalyst, a flexible device with controllable hydrogen release has been developed, effectively accelerating the healing of diabetic wounds.







Abstract
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of serious health issues, including prolonged skin inflammation and delayed wound healing, owing to inferior glucose control and suppression of the immune system. Although traditional hydrogen (H2) therapy is slightly effective, its ability to tailor the release of H2 on the skin is limited. Accordingly, this study proposed a novel strategy for electrocatalytic H2 release under neutral conditions to promote wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbit. Herein, a defect&#8208;engineered cobalt phosphide (CoP) catalyst was designed by introducing a neutral single&#8208;metal electrocatalytic Hydrogen valence state channel into CoP. By effectively regulating the formation and transfer of *H active species during the CoP catalytic process, a considerable enhancement in neutral electrocatalytic H2 evolution performance was achieved (&#8722;78.0&#8197;mV@&#8208;10.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Based on this superior catalytic performance, we developed a flexible electrode (namely, CoP/flexible gold electrode made by screen printing (FGSP) by combining a convenient electrolysis platform with continuous electrolyte supply and FGSP, enabling customized H2 release and accelerating wound healing in diabetic mice and rabbits. Notably, the designed flexible electrode features adjustable dimensions, interchangeable substrates, and material adaptability, meeting the diverse needs of clinical and basic research and demonstrating significant potential for applications in clinical medicine.

         <title>Promiscuity Guided Evolution of Decarboxylative Aldolases for Synthesis of Tertiary &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promiscuity guided evolution of the decarboxylative aldolase, UstD, resulted in an efficient biocatalyst for synthesis of tertiary &#947;&#8208;hydroxy non&#8208;canonical amino acids. Simultaneous collection of variant activity and promiscuity was enabled by competition screening during directed evolution. Changes in promiscuity effectively identified distal residues that influence catalysis, a longstanding challenge in protein engineering.







Abstract
Many applications of enzymes benefit from activity on structurally diverse substrates. Here, we sought to engineer the decarboxylative aldolase UstD to perform a challenging C&#8722;C bond forming reaction with ketone electrophiles. The parent enzyme had only low levels of activity, portending multiple rounds of directed evolution and a possibility that mutations may inadvertently increase the specificity of the enzyme for a single model screening substrate. We show how to intentionally guide UstD towards generality through multi&#8208;generational directed evolution using substrate&#8208;multiplexed screening (SUMS). Mutations outside of the active site that impact catalytic function were immediately revealed by shifts in promiscuity, even when the overall activity was lower. By re&#8208;targeting these distal residues that couple to the active site with saturation mutagenesis, broadly activating mutations were readily identified. When analyzing active site mutants, SUMS identified both specialist enzymes that would have more limited utility as well as generalist enzymes with complementary activity on diverse substrates. These new UstD enzymes catalyze convergent synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids bearing tertiary alcohol side chains. This methodology is easy to implement and enables the rapid and effective evolution of enzymes to catalyze desirable new functions.

         <title>Abstraction of Hydride from Alkanes and Dihydrogen by the Perfluorotrityl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of a perfluorotrityl cation (F15Tr+) as a salt with halogenated carborane anions. These salts are stable at ambient temperature in the solid state. As predicted by theoretical calculations, F15Tr+ displays remarkable propensity for abstraction of a hydride. It extracts a hydride rapidly from alkanes and slowly even from dihydrogen.







Abstract
Lewis acids play a central role in a large variety of chemical transformations. The reactivity of the strongest Lewis acids is typically studied in the context of affinity towards hard bases, such as fluoride or oxygenous species. Carbocations can be viewed as soft Lewis acids, possessing significant affinity for softer bases, such as hydride. This work presents the ambient&#8208;temperature isolation of salts of the perfluorotrityl cation ((C6F5)3C+ or F15Tr+) in combination with halogenated carborane anions. The F15Tr+ cation exhibits remarkable hydride affinity, illustrated by the observation of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and of the rapid abstraction of hydride from &#8722;CH2&#8722;groups in alkanes. Theoretical studies support the favorability of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and indicate that the hydride abstraction from alkanes proceeds via a concerted hydride transfer process that is sensitive to steric effects.

         <title>Targeted Docking of Localized Hydrogen Bond for Efficient and Reversible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeted localized hydrogen bond docking mechanism, activated by polyhydroxy hexitol&#8208;based electrolyte, optimizes solvation structures and reorganizes localized hydrogen bond networks at the interface, thereby decreasing water activity and enhancing Zn2+ deposition kinetics and homogeneity for efficient and reversible zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Hydrogen bond (HB) chemistry, a pivotal feature of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, modulates electrochemical processes through weak electrostatic interactions among water molecules. However, significant challenges persist, including sluggish desolvation kinetics and inescapable parasitic reactions at the electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, associated with high water activity and strong Zn2+&#8208;solvent coordination.

&lt;p&gt;The targeted localized hydrogen bond docking mechanism, activated by polyhydroxy hexitol-based electrolyte, optimizes solvation structures and reorganizes localized hydrogen bond networks at the interface, thereby decreasing water activity and enhancing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition kinetics and homogeneity for efficient and reversible zinc-ion batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen bond (HB) chemistry, a pivotal feature of aqueous zinc-ion batteries, modulates electrochemical processes through weak electrostatic interactions among water molecules. However, significant challenges persist, including sluggish desolvation kinetics and inescapable parasitic reactions at the electrolyte-electrode interface, associated with high water activity and strong Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvent coordination. Herein, a targeted localized HB docking mechanism is activated by the polyhydroxy hexitol-based electrolyte, optimizing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structures via dipole interaction and reconstructing interfacial HB networks through preferential parallel adsorption. By combining in situ spectroscopic characterizations with theoretical calculations, we elucidate the dynamic evolution of localized HB networks, which enhance Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition kinetics and homogeneity, suppress water-induced side reactions, and mitigate vanadium framework collapse. Our findings support that the targeted HB docking strategy facilitates fast interfacial ion transport kinetics and enables high reversibility, with a substantially prolonged symmetric cell lifespan exceeding 5000&#8197;h. This work markedly advances the efficient and reversible zinc-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first successful growth of elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe2)3 and Sb(SiMe3)3 at 100&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a GPC of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle, is demonstrated. Films transitioned from island to full coverage, with a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) to the (003) plane. Metallic Bi was confirmed by XPS and TEM. The 2500&#8208;cycle film exhibited semimetallic behavior with a resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm.







Abstract
This study presents the first successful demonstration of growing elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe2)3 as the precursor and Sb(SiMe3)3 as the co&#8208;reactant. The films were deposited at a relatively low temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C, with a growth per cycle (GPC) of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle. Island formation marked the initial growth stages, with surface coverage reaching around 80&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles and full coverage between 2000 and 2500&#8197;cycles. Morphological analysis revealed that the Bi grains expanded and became more defined as the number of ALD cycles increased. This coalescence is further supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which show a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) plane to the (003) plane as the film thickness increases. X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of metallic Bi with minimal surface oxidation. Temperature&#8208;dependent sheet resistance measurements highlight the semimetallic nature of Bi, with a room temperature resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm for the 2500&#8197;cycles Bi. Temperature&#8208;dependent sheet resistance was also associated with a transition in carrier&#8208;type dominance from holes at higher temperatures to electrones at lower temperatures.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tridecasaccharide Motif from Angelica Sinensis APS&#8208;1 II Polysaccharide with Anti&#8208;Leukemia Activity and Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from A. sinensis APS&#8208;1 II with anti&#8208;leukemia activity has been synthesized for the first time by orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation and stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosylation strategies. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed that not only the 13&#8208;mer but also a 9&#8208;mer showed anti&#8208;leukemia activity.







Abstract
A polysaccharide APS&#8208;1 II from a medicinal plant Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels represents a potential therapeutic agent against leukemia. However, the synthetic accessibility of the highly branched and complex APS&#8208;1 II polysaccharide with multiple 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages remains a difficult task, impeding the in&#8208;depth structure&#8211;activity relationship biological studies and the development of carbohydrates&#8208;based therapeutics against leukemia. Here, we report the first chemical synthesis of tridecasaccharide repeating unit together with shorter sequences 4&#8208;mer, 6&#8208;mer and 9&#8208;mer from APS&#8208;1 II polysaccharide via one&#8208;pot orthogonal glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded the potential issues such as aglycone transfer associated with one&#8208;pot assembly with thioglycosides. The synthetic pathway also features the following aspects: 1)&#8197;three contiguous and challenging 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;Fuc bonds were highly stereoselectively constructed via the newly developed stereoselective 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosylation method; 2)&#8197;several 1, 2&#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages were formed via neighboring group participation effect, while 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glc linkage was stereoselectively assembled via N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide reagent modulation; 3) the final [1+1+2+9] one&#8208;pot assembly of the target tridecasaccharide via strategic utilizations of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates, ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates. Biological studies revealed that human leukemia K562 and mouse L1210&#8197;cells could be effectively inhibited by tridecasaccharide repeating unit and substructure nonasaccharide.

         <title>Tailoring the Surface Curvature of the Supporting Carbon to Tune the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zinc&#8208;Urea&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

The strain&#8208;induced change in the charge redistribution and binding strength of *O2&#8722;, *OOH and *OH of Fe SA/NhcC contributes to the enhanced catalytic ORR/UOR activity. Due to a lower equilibrium potential for the UOR and the superior catalytic activity of Fe SA/NhcC, the zinc&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery delivers a low charge voltage, high energy efficiency and long lifespan compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
The catalytic activities of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are associated with the varying atomic interactions through its characteristic coordination geometry. Yet, modulation of the surface curvature of carbon acting as a supporting body has not been investigated. Herein, we report the superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and enhanced performance for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) of single Fe atoms anchored on a highly curved N&#8208;doped carbon dodecahedron with concave morphology (Fe SA/NhcC). Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopy disclose that the curvature of the carbon support helps to shorten the bond length of Fe&#8722;N, spatially redistributing the charges around the Fe and thereby lowering the d&#8208;band center toward optimal adsorption for oxygenated species. The Fe SA/NhcC catalyst displays an ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.926&#8197;V for ORR and a small potential difference of 0.686&#8197;V for bifunctional ORR/UOR. A rechargeable Zn&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery with the Fe SA/NhcC cathode displays robust discharge durability, excellent cycling lifespan and higher energy efficiency compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work provides new insight into promoting the catalytic activity of SACs through varying the surface curvature of the supporting carbon, tailoring geometric configuration and electronic states of SACs.

Steady state free precession (SSFP) &#8211; Complete Reduction to Amplitude Frequency Tables (CRAFT) not only improves sensitivity, resolution and number of signals detected by NMR but can also dramatically reduce experiment times. This powerful approach unlocks the potential of NMR as a discovery tool, enabling unprecedented detection of fluorinated compounds in environmental and biological samples.







Abstract
The 2024 Zurich perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) summit reiterated the urgent need for non&#8208;selective analytical approaches for PFC detection. 19F NMR holds great potential, however, sensitivity limitations lead to long analysis times and/or the possibility of not detecting low concentration species. Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) NMR collects the signal in a steady state regime, allowing 100&#8217;s of acquisitions in the timespan of a single traditional NMR scan. Unfortunately, data truncation from SSFP leads to artifacts and spectral broadening with Fourier transform, hindering interpretation. When non&#8208;Fourier based time&#8208;domain analysis is used, namely, complete reduction to amplitude frequency tables (CRAFT), limitations of SSFP are eliminated while sensitivity gains are retained. This work introduces the combined approach, then applies it for the measurement of PFCs in environmental and biological samples. In all cases, the approach reduces analysis time from many hours to minutes and/or greatly increases the range of compounds detected. For example, when PFOA was spiked into human blood, the detection limit improved ~50&#8208;fold vs standard NMR, while in a standard mixture, the approach detected compounds missed by LC&#8208;MS/MS. The technique can be adapted to any nucleus providing a facile approach to reduce experiment time and improve sensitivity of NMR in general.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Actinide Oxo&#8208;Bond Manipulation in Actinyl Thiacalix[4]arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioether &#8211; expanded calixarene actinyl ions [UO2]2+, [NpO2]2+ and [PuO2]2+ place the two trans&#8208;oxo groups in different environments. One is more accessible, so functionalization and redox reactions are explored to target a cis&#8208;dioxo uranyl ion. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically.







Abstract
Understanding the chemistry of the inert actinide oxo bond in actinyl ions AnO22+ is important for controlling actinide behavior in the environment, during separations, and in nuclear waste (An=U, Np, Pu). The thioether calixarene TC4A (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetrathiacalix[4]arene) binds equatorially to the actinyl cation forming a conical pocket that differentiates the two trans&#8208;oxo groups. The &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, [A]2[UO2(TC4A)] (A=[Li(DME)2], HNEt3) and [HNEt3]2[AnO2(TC4A)] (An=U, Np, Pu), enable selective oxo chemistry. Silylation of the UVI oxo groups by bis(trimethylsilyl)pyrazine occurs first at only the unencapsulated exo oxo and only one silylation is needed to enable migration of the endo oxo out of the cone, whereupon a second silylation affords the stable UIV cis&#8208;bis(siloxide) [A]2[U(OSiMe3)2(TC4A)]. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate&#160;oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically, at only 23&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;1 in energy above the classical trans dioxo. Calculations for the transuranic cis[AnO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; (An=Np, Pu) are at higher energies, 30&#8211;35&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;1, retaining the U complexes as the more obvious target for a cis&#8208;dioxo actinyl ion. The aryloxide (OAr) groups of the macrocycle are essential in stabilizing this as&#8208;yet unseen uranyl geometry as further bonding in the TC4A U&#8208;OAr groups stabilizes the U=O &#8216;yl&#8217; bonds, explaining the stability of the putative cis[UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; in this ligand framework.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Overall Water Splitting Dominated by Direct Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Cluster Photoexcitation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs involving photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) were constructed by carbazole dicarboxylic acid and trinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters. Direct LCCT&#8208;triggered photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (OWS) surpassed that achieved through indirect LCCT pathway. Direct LCCT was pivotal in promoting effective charge separation and transfer, maximizing the photon utilization efficiency and ensuring broad&#8208;spectrum OWS.







Abstract
Expanding the spectral response of photocatalysts to facilitate overall water splitting (OWS) represents an effective approach for improving solar spectrum utilization efficiency. However, the majority of single&#8208;phase photocatalysts designed for OWS primarily respond to the ultraviolet region, which accounts for a small proportion of sunlight. Herein, we present a versatile strategy to achieve broad visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive OWS photocatalysis dominated by direct ligand&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer (LCCT) within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Three synthesized OWS MOFs, namely Fe2MCbz (M2+ = Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+), exhibited intrinsic OWS capability without the requirement for extra photosensitizer or sacrificial agent or cocatalyst. Among these, Fe2NiCbz was identified as the superior performer, and when dispersed with polyacrylonitrile nanofibers using electrospinning technology, it achieved the highest OWS rates of 170.2 and 85.1&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for H2 and O2 evolution, surpassing all previously documented MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that direct LCCT played a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, with exceptional performance of Fe2NiCbz attributed to its well&#8208;optimized energy level structures and highly efficient charge transfer mechanism. This work not only sets a benchmark in OWS MOF photocatalysts but also paves the way for maximizing solar spectrum utilization, thereby advancing renewable hydrogen production strategy.

         <title>Sabatier Principle Inspired Bifunctional Alloy Interface for Stable and High&#8208;Depth Discharging Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a Sabatier principle inspired bifunctional transition&#8208;metal (TM) interface to enable homogeneous Zn dissolution during discharging and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition during charging. The &#8216;just right&#8217; interaction between TM and Zn endows Cu@Zn electrodes with remarkable reversibility and uniform pre&#8208;stripping morphologies in aqueous Zn metal batteries cycling under high depth of discharging.







Abstract
Achieving stable Zn anodes that can effectively couple with Zn&#8208;free cathodes is essential for advancing high&#8208;performance Zn metal batteries. Here, we propose a Sabatier principle inspired bifunctional transition&#8208;metal (TM) interface to enable homogeneous Zn dissolution during discharging and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition during charging. Among various TM&#8208;coated Zn (TM@Zn) electrodes, Cu@Zn exhibits the highest reversibility and structural stability, attributed to the optimal interaction between Cu and Zn. The heteroatomic interaction&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance parallels the Sabatier principle. Morphological analyses reveal that bare Zn anodes display detrimental etching pits during stripping, which is different from the uniform dissolution for Cu@Zn electrodes. During subsequent plating, the conductive interface serves as a secondary current collector for uniform Zn deposition in Cu@Zn, thus demonstrating a bifunctional nature. Atomic observations disclose the working mechanisms of this interface as a gradual phase transition from Cu to CuZn5 during cycling. The Cu@Zn anodes exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;h at a low current of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 250&#8197;h at a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. They also demonstrate practical feasibility by maintaining 88.7&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles in Cu@Zn||VO2 full cells. This work provides new insights into the Sabatier chemistry inspired bifunctional layers for Zn metal battery system.

The Cu@Zn anodes exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;h at a low current of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and over 250&#8197;h at a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. They also demonstrate practical feasibility by maintaining 88.7&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles in Cu@Zn||VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cells. This work provides new insights into the Sabatier chemistry inspired bifunctional layers for Zn metal battery system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibiting Interfacial Electron Leakage via An Artificial Rectified Layer for Longevous Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an artificial rectified layer with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features to inhibit electron leakage and homogenize ion/electron fields at the electrolyte/Zn anode interface, preventing the Zn anode from side reactions but promoting its (002) oriented deposition at high utilization and efficiency.







Abstract
Dendrites and water&#8208;induced side reactions impose greatly challenge on the implementation of aqueous zinc ion batteries. To tackle these problems, an artificial rectified layer (ARL) with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features was in situ synthesized on Zn surface rapidly to prevent the electron leakage from Zn anode to aqueous electrolyte, which is the underlying logic for uneven Zn deposition and parasitic side reactions. The ARL also displays a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.71 and can build fast Zn2+ transport channels to homogenize the interfacial ion flux and electric field according to the calculated work function and multi&#8208;physics phase simulation results. Therefore, the Zn anode with ARL shows preferred plating along with (002) crystal facet and an admirable Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 3200 cycles. Zn symmetric cells can withstand large current density up to 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operate stably at 44.2&#8201;% depth of discharge for 250&#8197;hours, surpassing most of published reports. The ARL also enables the Zn||MnO2 full batteries to circulate over 2600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 80.1&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1. This work provides a different perspective to comprehend and design satisfactory solid electrolyte interphase for Zn metal anodes.

The hollow&#8208;structured [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O dual vacancies, demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability and outstanding H2 evolution performance at low temperature in photothermal&#8208;driven methanol/water reforming







Abstract
To enable highly efficient in situ hydrogen release from methanol/water reforming at lower temperature, the integration of solar&#8208;energy offers a promising approach to activate methanol/water and substantially lower the activation energy of this reaction. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;vacancy defective hollow heterostructure derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks, featuring abundant surface hydroxyl groups and S/O vacancies, for photothermal&#8208;promoted methanol solution reforming into hydrogen. The [In2S3&#8208;x/In2O3&#8208;x](OH)y exhibits exceptional photothermal H2 evolution activity, achieving a production rate of 215.2 mmolgcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1, 16&#8208;fold higher than its thermocatalytic activity, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 66.8&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency (STH) of 1.1&#8201;% under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination, and excellent durability over 82&#8197;h, cumulating 2.61&#215;103 mmolgcat&#8722;1. The synergistic effects of dual&#8208;vacancies and the hollow heterostructure significantly enhance the photothermal effect, lowering the activation energy barrier for methanol/water, enabling H2 production at temperatures even as 80&#8201;&#176;C under non&#8208;alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the incorporated surface hydroxyl groups facilitate the generation of active surface hydroxyls from water, further driving activation and cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol, thereby markedly reducing the apparent reaction activation energy by 12.5&#8201;%. This work provides a new strategy for effective H2 production from aqueous methanol reforming under mild conditions, holding great promise for energy&#8208;demanding industrial applications.

         <title>Monitoring the Fate of Zn in the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 Catalyst During CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Synthesis at High Conversions by Operando Spectroscopy</title>

Using an additively manufactured spectroscopic reactor to investigate the structure of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst with operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at high conversion. Restructuring of ZnO during high conversion and condensation was observed.







Abstract
In the frame of developing a sustainable chemical industry, heterogeneously catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted considerable interest. However, the Cu&#8722;Zn based catalyst system employed in this process is very dynamic, especially in the presence of the products methanol and water. Deactivation needs to be prevented, but its origin and mechanism are hardly investigated at high conversion where product condensation is possible. Here, we report on the structural dynamics of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst at 90&#8197;bar and 40&#8201;% CO2 conversion (at equilibrium conditions), investigated in a dedicated metal&#8208;based spectroscopic cell specially fabricated using additive manufacturing. This particular reactor configuration aims to mimic the high CO2 conversion part of the catalyst bed and can induce product condensation, which is monitored by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. While Cu remained mostly stable throughout the experiment, Zn underwent strong restructuring. The chosen reaction conditions, including the use of CO2 as carbon source and in situ product condensation, were selected to provide insights under industrial conditions. This work is highlighting the importance of spectroscopic investigations at high conversion levels, offering insights into chemical transformations during deactivation, extending the concept of spatially resolved studies, and thus providing guidance for the design of more stable catalysts.

         <title>Reaction of NHOs with Bisphosphanes &#8211; Designing Diradicaloids, Zwitterions and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By linking N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins with a P&#8208;substituted indenyl heterocycle, it was possible to synthesize a very exciting new heterocyclic substance class that is both zwitterionic and diradical. The diradical character of these heterocycles can be adjusted by rotation within the molecule, which was achieved by rational design. The thermochromism of these heterocycles was studied by experimental and theoretical methods. Furthermore, we have shown that these heterocycles can activate small molecules. The mechanism of such an activation chemistry was studied and shown to be reversible in some case. Finally, we studied the electronic structure using multireference methods.







Abstract
The linkage of an imidazole&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), containing a terminal CH2 donor group, with a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradical molecular fragment leads to an open&#8208;shell singlet diphospha&#8208;indenylide system, a new class of P&#8208;heterocycles, which can be interpreted both as a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradicaloid and as a zwitterion with a permanent, overall charge separation between the N&#8208; and P&#8208;heterocyclic ring systems. The rotation of the imidazole ring, which is thermally possible due to a central C&#8722;C bond with a weakened &#960;&#8208;component, changes both the charge separation and diradical character depending on the dihedral angle, as quantum mechanical calculations indicate. By varying the bulkiness of substituents at the imidazole&#8208;based NHO, it was possible to obtain different diphospha&#8208;indenylide species with different rotation angles in the solid state and hence varying diradical character. Imidazolium&#8208;diphospha&#8208;indenylides represent a new class of NHO&#8208;based zwitterions with diradical character. Their synthesis, structure, and activation chemistry are described, as well as the quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure in these unusual heterocycles. In addition, along the synthesis route to diphospha&#8208;indenylide, we also succeeded in isolating a highly reactive monoradical anion, which was also fully characterized.

&lt;p&gt;By linking &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic olefins with a P-substituted indenyl heterocycle, it was possible to synthesize a very exciting new heterocyclic substance class that is both zwitterionic and diradical. The diradical character of these heterocycles can be adjusted by rotation within the molecule, which was achieved by rational design. The thermochromism of these heterocycles was studied by experimental and theoretical methods. Furthermore, we have shown that these heterocycles can activate small molecules. The mechanism of such an activation chemistry was studied and shown to be reversible in some case. Finally, we studied the electronic structure using multireference methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linkage of an imidazole-based &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic olefin (NHO), containing a terminal CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; donor group, with a phosphorus-centered diradical molecular fragment leads to an open-shell singlet diphospha-indenylide system, a new class of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles, which can be interpreted both as a phosphorus-centered diradicaloid and as a zwitterion with a permanent, overall charge separation between the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic ring systems. The rotation of the imidazole ring, which is thermally possible due to a central C&#8722;C bond with a weakened &#960;-component, changes both the charge separation and diradical character depending on the dihedral angle, as quantum mechanical calculations indicate. By varying the bulkiness of substituents at the imidazole-based NHO, it was possible to obtain different diphospha-indenylide species with different rotation angles in the solid state and hence varying diradical character. Imidazolium-diphospha-indenylides represent a new class of NHO-based zwitterions with diradical character. Their synthesis, structure, and activation chemistry are described, as well as the quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure in these unusual heterocycles. In addition, along the synthesis route to diphospha-indenylide, we also succeeded in isolating a highly reactive monoradical anion, which was also fully characterized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Cobalt&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues via 3&#8201;d Transition Metals Incorporation for Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cobalt&#8208;Based Prussian blue analogues (CoM&#8208;PBAs) as anode materials for SIBs are designed by a universal low&#8208;energy co&#8208;precipitation approach through the rational incorporation of 3d transition metals. Among them, the CoV&#8208;PBA (CV) anode exhibits remarkable sodium&#8208;ion storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic modulation of its electronic structure through &#960;&#8208;electron regulation induced by vanadium incorporation.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship between structure regulation and electrochemical performance is key to developing efficient and sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) materials. Herein, seven Cobalt&#8208;M&#8208;based (M=V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) Prussian blue analogues (CoM&#8208;PBAs) are designed as anodes for SIBs via a universal low&#8208;energy co&#8208;precipitation approach with the strategic inclusion of 3d transition metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation and experimental validation reveal that a moderate p&#8208;band center of cyanide linkages (&#8722;CN&#8722;) is more favorable for Na+ intercalation and diffusion, while the d&#8208;band center of metal cations is linearly related to electrode stability. Among seven CoM&#8208;based PBAs, CoV&#8208;PBAs possess the best sodium&#8208;ion adsorption/diffusion kinetics and overall cycling performance, including high specific capacity (565&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g), cycling stability (over 15000 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention), and superior rate capability (174.7&#8197;mAh/g at 30&#8197;A/g). In situ/ex situ techniques further demonstrate that the &#960;&#8208;electron regulation by V introduction enhances the reversibility and kinetics of redox reactions. Moreover, the study identified the &#8220;p&#8208;band center&#8221; and &#8220;d&#8208;band center&#8221; may serve as key descriptors for quantifying the capability and stability of other&#8208;type bimetal Co&#8208;based anodes (oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides) with similar theoretical capacity, offering a potentially transformative approach for selecting practical SIB electrode materials.

         <title>Exceptional Battery&#8208;level Safety of High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Non&#8208;Flammable and Low&#8208;Exothermic Localize High Concentration Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localize high concentration electrolyte (code: E&#8208;SE&#8208;F) with non&#8208;flammability and low&#8208;exothermicity was formulated. Thanks to these features, the safety performance of high energy density lithium ion batteries (LIBs) was significantly enhanced. The LHCE also improved the electrochemical performance of LIBs because of its excellent interphasial and interfacial stability.







Abstract
The poor safety performance of high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is drawing increasing public concern. To enhance the safety performance on the battery level, it is indispensable to design safe electrolytes that are both non&#8208;flammable and low exothermic under abusive conditions. By rational design, a safe localize high concentration electrolyte (LHCE) with non&#8208;flammability and extremely low exothermicity is formulated. Compared with conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocabonate electrolytes and previous LHCEs, the heat generated by the reaction between the safe LHCE and fully charged electrodes under abusive conditions is significantly reduced. Because of the non&#8208;flammability and low&#8208;exothermicity of the safe LHCE, high energy density LIB (1800&#8197;mAh Gr||LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, fully charged to 4.3&#8197;V) with the safe LHCE successfully passes the nail penetration test. Because of the excellent interphasial properties of the safe LHCE, the cycle life and the rate capability of high energy density LIBs are significantly improved when the safe LHCE is adopted. This work sheds light on the design principles of electrolytes for achieving battery&#8208;level safety.

We have showed an example for active smart materials that can exchange substances with the surroundings to gain the training &amp; learning capability enabled by covalently integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile in the main chain of a single&#8208;network liquid crystal elastomer (LCE). After being trained in different &#8220;learning intermediates&#8221;, additional polymer chains grafted to the original liquid crystal networks form through the mechano&#8208;radical induced polymerization. As a result, the LCE can improve the actuation performance and learn new functions that it does not intrinsically have, which is determined by the characteristics of the &#8220;learning intermediates&#8221;.







Abstract
In nature, organisms adapt to environmental changes through training to learn new abilities, offering valuable insights for developing intelligent materials. However, replicating this &#8220;adaptive learning&#8221; in synthetic materials presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a feasible approach to train liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by integrating a mechanophore tetraarylsuccinonitrile into their main chain, addressing the challenge of enabling synthetic materials to exchange substances with their environment. Inspired by biological training, the LCEs can self&#8208;strengthen and acquire new functionalities through mechanical stress&#8208;induced radical polymerization. The research not only enhances the mechanical performance of LCEs, but also endows them with the ability to learn properties such as flexibility, light responsiveness, and fluorescence. These advancements are crucial for overcoming the limitations of current materials, paving the way for the creation of advanced intelligent soft materials with autonomous self&#8208;improvement, akin to the adaptive skills of living organisms.

         <title>Photochromic Color Tuning of Copper&#8208;Doped Zinc Sulfide Nanocrystals by Control of Local Dopant Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study achieved tunable photochromic colors (gray to brown) in Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals by controlling surface Zn and S stoichiometry using thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Experiments and quantum chemical calculations revealed that Cu distribution on Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surfaces determines color, with minimal influence from particle size or Cu concentration.







Abstract
Inorganic photochromic materials offer several advantages over organic compounds, including relatively inexpensive and higher thermal stability. However, tuning their color with the same component has remained a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that the photochromic color of Cu&#8208;doped ZnS nanocrystals (NCs), which is initially pale yellow before light irradiation, can be tuned from gray to brown by adjusting the surface stoichiometry of Zn and S, which is controlled through the use of thiol and non&#8208;thiol ligands. Several experiments and quantum chemical calculations using model clusters revealed that the color change is determined by the distribution of Cu, which significantly contributes to the coloration, specifically whether it resides on the Zn&#8208;rich or S&#8208;rich surface. In contrast, particle size and Cu concentration were found to have little effect on the photochromic color. This study expands the diversity of photochromic responses in inorganic NCs and marks an important step toward the development of further advanced photochromic nanomaterials.

In this study, we demonstrate that the photochromic color of Cu-doped ZnS nanocrystals (NCs), which is initially pale yellow before light irradiation, can be tuned from gray to brown by adjusting the surface stoichiometry of Zn and S, which is controlled through the use of thiol and non-thiol ligands. Several experiments and quantum chemical calculations using model clusters revealed that the color change is determined by the distribution of Cu, which significantly contributes to the coloration, specifically whether it resides on the Zn-rich or S-rich surface. In contrast, particle size and Cu concentration were found to have little effect on the photochromic color. This study expands the diversity of photochromic responses in inorganic NCs and marks an important step toward the development of further advanced photochromic nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Energy Lights Up Europium&#8208;Based Ultra&#8208;bright Afterglow for Bioanalysis Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photochemical afterglow system was constructed through structural design and coordination, lighting up the weak&#8208;emissive fluorophore in the form of afterglow through chemiexcitation. Ultimately, a system with a highest reported afterglow luminescence QY of 27.5&#8201;% was accomplished and successfully applied in high SBR in vivo bioimaging and highly sensitive in vitro diagnostic of SAA through lateral flow immunoassay. Ab: antibody; AG: afterglow; PS: polystyrene; QY: quantum yield; SBR: signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio; SAA: serum amyloid A.







Abstract
Photochemical afterglow materials are gaining great attention for the property to continuously emit light after the excitation source is removed. However, their limited luminescence quantum yield (QY) and brightness hinder the use in biological applications. In this study, we introduce a novel photochemical afterglow system that combines a newly designed photoenergy cache unit (PCU) with an emitter through coordination covalent bonds. The PCU boasts a dark state to significantly emit photons only through chemiexcitation in the process of photochemical reactions, facilitating direct energy transfer to the emitter and resulting in bright afterglow. The related mechanisms further guided us to achieve the highest reported afterglow luminescence quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;%. The system can be encapsulated and dispersed in aqueous solutions for in vivo bioimaging in living mice under mild and simple conditions (low concentration, low excitation power, short excitation time, short exposure time), and also for in vitro diagnostic through lateral flow immunoassay, enabling the highly sensitive detection of the inflammatory biomarker serum amyloid A (SAA) and demonstrating excellent correlation with clinical test results. This study offers new insights into enhancing luminescence QY and brightness of afterglow, highlighting the potential of such systems for further biomedical applications.

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer for Targeted Photoactivation of Ion Channels in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) system using oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;imidazolium (OPV&#8722;Im) to activate TRPM2 Ca2+ channels by O2&#8901;&#8722; without relying on external light. The OPV&#8722;Im oligomer targets cell membranes, activating TRPM2 channels and causing intracellular calcium overload, leading to mitochondrial damage, autophagy inhibition, and apoptosis of cells and tumor spheroid. This strategy provides a new method for regulating ion channels and oxidative stress in living cells.







Abstract
The regulation of oxidative stress in living cells is essential for maintaining cellular processes and signal transduction. However, developing straightforward strategies to activate oxidative stress&#8208;sensitive membrane channels in situ poses significant challenges. In this study, we present a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) system based on a conjugated oligomer, oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;imidazolium (OPV&#8722;Im), designed for the activation of transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) calcium channels in situ by superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;) without requiring external light sources. The OPV&#8722;Im oligomer targeted the cell membrane efficiently, leading to the activation of TRPM2 channels in situ by the CRET process and subsequent intracellular calcium overload. This cascade resulted in mitochondrial damage and inhibition of autophagy, ultimately inducing cell apoptosis. Additionally, this strategy could be applied for the selective killing of tumor cells that overexpress TRPM2 ion channels and for inhibiting the growth of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids. Our system offers a novel approach for regulating ion channel activity and oxidative stress in living cells compared to optogenetics and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Nanopore&#8208;Based High&#8208;Resolution Detection of Multiple Post&#8208;Translational Modifications in Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple and efficient nanopore sensing strategy based on host&#8208;guest interactions for detecting PTMs. It can identify 13 types of PTMs at specific peptide positions and is further enhanced by incorporating a short peptide into the probe, enabling differentiation of various PTMs, positional isomers, and multiple PTMs on the target peptide.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play crucial roles in various cellular processes. Despite their significance, only a few PTMs have been extensively studied at the proteome level, primarily due to the scarcity of reliable, convenient, and low&#8208;cost sensing methods. Here, we present a straightforward and effective strategy for detecting PTMs on short peptides through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;assisted nanopore sensing. Our results demonstrate that the identity of 13 types of PTMs in a specific position of a phenylalanine&#8208;containing peptide could be determined via current blockage during translocation of the peptide through &#945;&#8208;hemolysin nanopores in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril. Furthermore, we extend this strategy by incorporating a short peptide into the probe, enabling the discrimination of various PTMs, positional isomers, and even multiple PTMs on the target peptide. With ongoing improvements, our method holds promise for practical applications in sensing PTMs in biologically relevant samples, offering an efficient alternative to traditional mass spectrometry approaches.

         <title>Robust Mechanically Interlocked Network Ionogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust mechanically interlocked network ionogel (IGMIN) with improved toughness, high strength, and impact resistance was developed by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Its stable performance as sewable strain sensors for robot gait monitoring highlights its practical potential, offering a new strategy for toughening ionogels and advancing mechanically interlocked materials.







Abstract
Ionogels have attracted considerable attention as versatile materials due to their unique ionic conductivity and thermal stability. However, relatively weak mechanical performance of many existing ionogels has hindered their broader application. Herein, we develop robust, tough, and impact&#8208;resistant mechanically interlocked network ionogels (IGMINs) by incorporating ion liquids with mechanical bonds that can dissipate energy while maintain structural stability. Profiting from the dynamic yet stable nature of the mechanically interlocked networks, IGMINs exhibit high tensile strength (9.6&#8197;MPa), fracture energy (39&#8197;kJ/m2), and toughness (25.9&#8197;MJ/m3), along with a high elongation rate (473&#8201;%) and excellent impact resistance and shape memory, resulting in overall performance that surpasses most reported ionogels. Furthermore, in the application of strain sensors for monitoring the gait of crawling robots, the toughness and robustness of IGMINs ensure their ability to consistently output stable electrical signals during the stretching and contraction processes, thereby highlighting their practical application potential. Our work provides a new research strategy for toughening ionogels and promotes the development of mechanically interlocked materials.

The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri&#8208;oxidation treatment to construct hard carbon with expanded carbon interlayer spacing and plentiful ultramicropores/closed pores. A large specific capacity of 356&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved along with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88.1&#8201;% and excellent rate/cycling performance.







Abstract
Hard carbons derived from coal precursors have shown bright industrial prospect as the low cost anode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is of extreme necessity yet challenge to regulate carbon microstructure toward superior sodium energy storage. In this study, we propose a powerful chemical reconfiguration tactic to steer hard carbons toward high&#8208;capacity and fast sodium storage. The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri&#8208;oxidation treatment for effectively inhibiting the reordering of carbon layers under high temperature, thereby creating rich ultramicropores/closed pores and expanded interlayer spacing. These structural merits enable the hard carbon to garner an enhanced capacity of 356&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.1&#8201;% and long lifespan. More impressively, the sodium storage kinetics is substantially sped up with a large capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 retained at a high&#8208;rate of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work will afford a fresh methodology for precursor modulation to accelerate the real&#8208;world practice of hard carbons toward advanced sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Towards the Stable Chelation of Radioantimony(V) for Targeted Auger Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New kid on the (p) block! The most stable complex of radioantimony yet reported under physiological conditions, [117Sb][Sb(TREN&#8208;CAM)]&#8211;, is demonstrated through a combination of radiochemical and structural studies, in vitro challenges, and in vivo SPECT and PET imaging in mice. These results mark an exciting leap towards implementing the elementally matched pair 117/119Sb in targeted Auger theranostics of cancer.







Abstract
Antimony&#8208;119 (119Sb) is one of the most attractive Auger&#8208;electron emitters identified to date, but it remains practically unexplored for targeted radiotherapy because no chelators have been identified to stably bind this metalloid in vivo. In a departure from current studies focused on chelator development for Sb(III), we explore the chelation chemistry of Sb(V) using the tris&#8208;catecholate ligand TREN&#8208;CAM. Through a combination of radiolabeling, spectroscopic, solid&#8208;state, and computational studies, the radiochemistry and structural chemistry of TREN&#8208;CAM with 1XX/natSb(V) were established. The resulting [1XXSb]Sb&#8211;TREN&#8208;CAM complex remained intact for several days in human serum, signifying high stability under biological conditions. Finally, the first in vivo single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography imaging studies were carried out using 117Sb, the diagnostic analogue of 119Sb. These studies revealed marked differences in the uptake and distribution of activity in mice administered unchelated [117Sb]Sb(OH)6&#8211; versus [117Sb]Sb&#8211;TREN&#8208;CAM, suggesting that 117Sb is largely retained by TREN&#8208;CAM over the time course of the study. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the most physiologically stable complex of no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added 1XXSb yet reported, offering new promise for the clinical implementation of radioantimony in nuclear medicine. Our results also establish the feasibility of 117Sb as an elementally matched partner to 119Sb for theranostic applications.

         <title>A High&#8208;Capacity Manganese&#8208;Metal Battery with Dual&#8208;Storage Mechanism</title>

Description: The capacity and energy density of manganese metal batteries are greatly enhanced by developing the first cathode based on dual storage mechanism in this work.







Abstract
As a promising post lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;battery candidate, manganese metal battery (MMB) is receiving growing research interests because of its high volumetric capacity, low cost, high safety and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the low energy density, mainly constrained by scarce choices and unsatisfying capacity of cathodes, strictly bottlenecks the development of MMBs. In this work, a new class of cathodes based on novel dual&#8208;storage mechanism (DSM) are reported. Working principles of DSM are revealed and deeply understood via ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept DSM&#8208;based Cu1.8S cathode, which shows the highest specific capacity of 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 97.1&#8201;% higher energy density than previously reported cathodes in storing Mn2+ ions, is presented. The key determinants on DSM and design strategies for next&#8208;generation cathodes are revealed via theoretical calculations. This work provides a new class of high&#8208;capacity cathode materials for MMBs, which is expected to draw inspirations to further enhance the energy density of MMBs.

         <title>Taming the Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction via Rational Diluent Selection for Low&#8208;Temperature Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new selection principle based on the diluent selection parameter (DSP, the product of interaction energies of diluent&#8208;solvent/diluent&#8208;Li+ and diluent&#8208;anion/diluent&#8208;Li+) is proposed for admirable diluent selection. Diluents with larger DSP are more apt to tame ion&#8208;dipole interaction, improving the Li reversibility and low&#8208;temperature stability. This work provides new guidance to develop novel diluents for long&#8208;cycle Li metal batteries.







Abstract
Developing advanced electrolytes with high Li affinity is crucial for achieving long&#8208;cycling lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the strong Li+&#8208;solvent interactions in conventional electrolytes often induce difficult Li+ desolvation especially under low&#8208;temperature conditions, resulting in the formation of fragile electrode interfaces involving solvents, and thus dissatisfactory cycling stability of LMBs. Herein, by introducing various diluents into the lithium hexafluorophosphate in 1, 2&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte, we reveal that Li+ desolvation is influenced by not only the diluent&#8208;solvent interaction but also the diluent&#8208;anion interaction. Based on these findings, a diluent selection parameter (DSP), which is calculated based on the product of interaction energies of diluent&#8208;solvent/diluent&#8208;Li+ and diluent&#8208;anion/diluent&#8208;Li+, is proposed for diluent selection. A diluent with a larger DSP is more favorable for promoting Li+ desolvation and improving the low&#8208;temperature performance of LMBs. With the rationally selected 1, 2&#8208;dichloroethane diluent (DSP=3.95), the Li

         <title>Regulating Interphase Chemistry by Targeted Functionalization of Hard Carbon Anode in Ester&#8208;Based Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The inherent high reactive oxygen&#8208;functional groups of hard carbon (HC) anode are strategically converted into a stable Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si molecular layer for regulating uncontrollable interfacial redox reaction energy and charge transfer, suppressing the interfacial side reactions, and contributing to the construction of inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial resistance and enhanced cycling durability.







Abstract
Commercial hard carbon (HC) anode suffers from unexpected interphase chemistry rooted in the parasitic reactions between surface oxygen&#8208;functional groups and ester&#8208;based electrolytes. Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed to regulate interphase chemistry by tailoring targeted functional groups on the HC surface, where highly active undesirable oxygen&#8208;functional groups are skillfully converted into a Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si molecular layer favorable for anchoring anions. Then, an inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial charge transfer resistance and enhanced cycling durability is constructed successfully. Consequently, the modified HC anode delivers an excellent rate capability of 206.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 92.5&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the coin&#8208;type full&#8208;cell equipped with Na2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cathode exhibits an exceptional capacity retention ratio of 80.9&#8201;% after 800 cycles at 1C. The present simple and effective interfacial modification strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for promoting the development and practicability of HC anode in ester&#8208;based electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>SN2&#8722;Reaction&#8722; Bonding&#8208;Heterointerface Strengthens Buried Adhesion and Orientation for Advanced Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel SN2&#8722;reaction&#8722;driven bonding&#8208;heterointerface to strengthen the buried adhesion and orientation of perovskite film by simultaneously functionalizing the underlying substrate and functionalizing [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedral framework. Benefiting from the reinforcement of buried adhesion and target&#8722;point&#8722;oriented crystallization, an all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8722;based all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br device achieves an enhanced efficiency of 15.14&#8201;% with improved stability.







Abstract
Traditionally weak buried interaction without customized chemical bonding always goes against the formation of high&#8208;&#8722;quality perovskite film that highly determines the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. To address this issue, herein, we propose a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2) driving strategy to idealize the robust buried interface by simultaneously decorating underlying substrate and functionalizing [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedral framework with iodoacetamide and thiol molecules, respectively. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that a strong SN2 reaction between exposed halogen and thiol group in two molecules occurs, which not only benefits the reinforcement of buried adhesion, but also triggers target&#8208;point&#8208;oriented crystallization, synergistically upgrading the upper perovskite film quality and accelerating interfacial charge extraction&#8211;transfer behavior. Benefiting from the suppressed nonradiative recombination, as a result, an all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8211;based all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br device achieves an enhanced efficiency of 15.14&#8201;%, more importantly, with significantly prolonged long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions. This unique reaction&#8211;driven buried interface provides a new path for manipulating perovskite growth and obtaining advanced perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>The Proximal Protonation Source in Cu&#8722;NHx&#8722;C Single Atom Catalysts Selectively Boosts CO2 to Methane Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise functional group modulation of the coordinating N atom (N&#8722;H or N&#8722;CH3) to Cu2+ in a purpose&#8208;designed single atom catalyst with the active center Cu&#8722;N(Hx)&#8722;C embedded in reduced graphene oxide proves the critical protonation role of the proximal N&#8722;H moiety for CO2 hydrogenation, leading to exceptional electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance.







Abstract
Regulating the coordination environment of active sites has proved powerful for tapping into their catalytic activity and selectivity in homogeneous catalysis, yet the heterogeneous nature of copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) makes it challenging. This work reports a bottom&#8208;up approach to construct a SAC (rGO@Cu&#8722;N(Hx)&#8722;C) by inlaying preformed amine coordinated Cu2+ units into reduced graphene oxide (rGO), permitting molecular level revelation on how the proximal N&#8208;site functional groups (N&#8722;H or N&#8722;CH3) impact on the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). It is demonstrated that the N&#8722;H moiety of rGO@Cu&#8722;NHx&#8722;C can serve as an in situ protonation agent to accelerate the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methane reduction kinetics, delivering a methane current density (163&#8197;mA/cm2) 2.42&#8208;times that with the &#8208;CH3 substituted counterpart rGO@Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations elucidate that the high methane faradaic efficiency (77.1&#8201;%) achieved here is enabled by opening up the energetically favorable formyl pathway (*OCHO pathway) against the traditional *CO pathway that normally leads to various CO2RR products other than methane. Our strategy sets the stage to precisely modulate single&#8208;atom catalysts for efficient and selective electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Paired Photoproduction of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;Dihydroisoquinoline Over Covalent Pyrene&#8208;(Thio)urea Frameworks with Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) with electron push&#8208;pull effect were successfully synthesized and served as efficient paired photosynthesis catalysts of H2O2 and 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) products. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, with higher THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) and DHIQ selectivity.







Abstract
Pairing photocatalytic 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction (THIQ&#8208;SDR) with two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a green solar to chemical strategy by simultaneously utilizing the photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes. However, it is still short of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst to drive two reactions above. In the present work, crystalline pyrene&#8208;thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) were synthesized and demonstrated as high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. In particular, COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light and finally solid H2O2 products (Na2CO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O2) was collected after long&#8208;time irradiation. Under natural sunlight conditions, the H2O2 production rate over COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S further increased to ~51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, among the best COF photocatalysts. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S also showed high THIQ&#8208;SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) with 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) selectivity of ~92&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations reveal stronger electron push&#8208;pull effect of COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S than COF&#8722;Py&#8722;O, enhancing its photoinduced charge carries, and a four&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR mechanism with thiourea as the active sites has been confirmed as well as the mechanism of THIQ&#8208;SDR to DHIQ, featuring lower energy barriers for O2 adsorption and *HOOH desorption over thiourea units. This work provides a paired photosynthesis strategy of H2O2 and DHIQ over high&#8208;efficiency pyrene&#8208;(thio)urea COF photocatalysts with electron push&#8208;pull effect.

In the present work, crystalline pyrene-thiourea/urea covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S and &#8722;O) were synthesized and demonstrated as high-performance metal-free photocatalysts. In particular, COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S exhibited higher 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of ~19&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible light and finally solid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was collected after long-time irradiation. Under natural sunlight conditions, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate over COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S further increased to ~51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, among the best COF photocatalysts. COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S also showed high THIQ-SDR conversion (~100&#8201;%) with 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) selectivity of ~92&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations reveal stronger electron push-pull effect of COF&#8722;Py&#8722;S than COF&#8722;Py&#8722;O, enhancing its photoinduced charge carries, and a four-step 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR mechanism with thiourea as the active sites has been confirmed as well as the mechanism of THIQ-SDR to DHIQ, featuring lower energy barriers for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and *HOOH desorption over thiourea units. This work provides a paired photosynthesis strategy of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and DHIQ over high-efficiency pyrene-(thio)urea COF photocatalysts with electron push-pull effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assisted Solubilization Strategy in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Thermally and Mechanically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An assisted solubilization strategy by employing supramolecular polymerization network of deep eutectic solvent has been innovatively developed in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD to dissolve LiTFSI without conventional acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine. The molecular network inhibits Li+ ions migration and strengthens adhesion at perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/electrode interface, thus simultaneously improving thermal and mechanical stabilities under severe conditions.







Abstract
The ions migration and de&#8208;doping reactions caused by conventional doping seriously jeopardizes the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as hole transport layer (HTL), which poses a significant challenge for subsequent commercialization. To address these issues, a novel assisted solubilization strategy has been firstly developed using deep eutectic solvent (DES) synthesized from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)acetamide (NCMA) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). NCMA can form multiple strong interaction modes with LiTFSI through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding and Li&#8722;O/Li&#8722;N coordination, which effectively inhibits Li+ ions migration at high temperature and increases solubility of LiTFSI in chlorobenzene without acetonitrile and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP), fundamentally solving de&#8208;doping reaction. In addition, the molecular network with abundant functional groups in DES improves fracture energy of perovskite/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interface and enhances interfacial adhesion via strong chelation with perovskite and Ag electrode. Consequently, benefiting from tBP removement and inhibited ions migration, the optimized PVSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.02&#8201;%, and the unencapsulated device retains over 90&#8201;% of initial PCE at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 40&#8201;% RH for 1200&#8197;h (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2 standard). This innovative assisted solubilization strategy represents a critical step toward improving device stability and accelerating the commercialization of PVSCs.

         <title>Topological Supramolecular Complexation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Tunable Interconnected Hierarchical Microporosity in Amorphous Form</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of topological supramolecular complexation is proposed to generate frustrated packing for the feasible fabrication of hierarchical microporosity with broad tunability in amorphous form. Secondary building units with cuboctahedron and tetrahedron geometry are complexed through hydrogen bonding and coordination interaction while the mis&#8208;match of the two topologies disfavor the dense packing of the structural units, and extrinsic porosity can be obtained.







Abstract
The precise engineering of microporosity is challenging due to the interference at the sub&#8208;nm scale from unexpected structural flexibility and molecular packing. Herein, the concept of topological supramolecular complexation is proposed for the feasible fabrication of hierarchical microporosity with broad tunability in amorphous form. The 2.5&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) are complexed with quadridentate ligands through hydrogen and coordination bonding while the mismatch between the MOPs&#8217; cuboctahedron and ligands&#8217; tetrahedron topology leads to frustrated packing with extrinsic microporosity. Amorphous supramolecular frameworks can be obtained that integrate the intrinsic microporosity of the MOPs with the extrinsic porosity from the frustrated packing. The topologies, sizes and flexibility of ligands as well as ligand/MOP ratios are systemically varied, and the pore size distribution can be precisely adjusted. The hierarchical structures ranging from molecular packing to the morphologies of meso&#8208;scale assemblies are probed using ultra&#8208;small, small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, enabling the quantitative evaluation of the micropores interconnectivity for the understanding of gas permeation performance. Gas separation membranes with permselectivity surpassing the Robeson upper bound can be designed. The findings not only give insight into the microscopic mechanism of supramolecular frustrated packing from topological design, but also pave new avenues for the cost&#8208;effective fabrications of microporous frameworks.

         <dc:description>
Strained spirocyclic 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexanes were synthesized via a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to a series of non&#8208;enolizable ketones generating a frustrated radical pair&#8208;like N&#8208;centered radical and ketyl radical anion. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental investigations support the proposed mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
Strained spiro&#8208;heterocycles (SSHs) have gained significant attention within the medicinal chemistry community as promising sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres for their aromatic and non&#8208;spirocyclic counterparts. We herein report access to an unprecedented spiro&#8208;heterocycle&#8212;1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane. Our synthetic approach leverages a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to benzophenones generating an N&#8208;centered radical and a ketyl radical anion&#8212;reminiscent of a frustrated radical pair. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating an exergonic radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. This process enables the formation of the desired bond between the oxetane core and benzophenone derivatives, ultimately yielding the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane core. The stability and synthetic utility of the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane motif are showcased. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation is presented, including cyclic voltammetry studies, as well as computational calculations and experiments to support the mechanism of this new single electron synthetic tactic.

         <title>Amplified Production of a DNA Decoy Catalyzed by Intracellular MicroRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved the amplified intracellular production of a DNA decoy targeting NF&#8208;&#954;B using a hairpin DNA circuit known as catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). This system is catalyzed by oncogenic miR&#8208;21 to produce the NF&#8208;&#954;B decoy, thereby inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B with high cancer specificity. Our approach holds great potential for efficient cancer therapy and as a personalized drug discovery system based on miRNA expression profiles.







Abstract
DNA decoys inhibit cellular transcription factors and are expected to be among the nucleic acid drugs used to downregulate the transcription process. However, spatially controlling the on/off efficacy of DNA decoys to avoid side effects on normal cells is challenging. To reduce undesired decoy function in normal cells, we adopted catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to produce a DNA duplex from a hairpin DNA pair in response to a specific microRNA (miRNA). We designed the DNA hairpin pairs to form a DNA decoy that binds to nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#8208;&#954;B), whose overexpression is related to many diseases, including cancer. The transformation of the DNA hairpin pair to the NF&#8208;&#954;B DNA decoy was catalyzed by miR&#8208;21, which is expressed in various types of cancers. Intracellular CHA progression and the inhibitory effect against NF&#8208;&#954;B were observed only in miR&#8208;21 overexpressing cancer cells. The intracellular miR&#8208;21&#8208;catalyzed production of the NF&#8208;&#954;B DNA decoy has the potential to reduce side effects on normal cells, thereby strengthening the therapeutic profile of the CHA&#8208;decoy system. The ability to customize the combination of catalytic miRNA and target transcription factors would allow our technology to serve as a &#8220;personalized drug discovery system&#8221; for a variety of challenging diseases, including cancer.

     alt="Amplified Production of a DNA Decoy Catalyzed by Intracellular MicroRNA"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We achieved the amplified intracellular production of a DNA decoy targeting NF-&#954;B using a hairpin DNA circuit known as catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). This system is catalyzed by oncogenic miR-21 to produce the NF-&#954;B decoy, thereby inhibiting NF-&#954;B with high cancer specificity. Our approach holds great potential for efficient cancer therapy and as a personalized drug discovery system based on miRNA expression profiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA decoys inhibit cellular transcription factors and are expected to be among the nucleic acid drugs used to downregulate the transcription process. However, spatially controlling the on/off efficacy of DNA decoys to avoid side effects on normal cells is challenging. To reduce undesired decoy function in normal cells, we adopted catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to produce a DNA duplex from a hairpin DNA pair in response to a specific microRNA (miRNA). We designed the DNA hairpin pairs to form a DNA decoy that binds to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B), whose overexpression is related to many diseases, including cancer. The transformation of the DNA hairpin pair to the NF-&#954;B DNA decoy was catalyzed by miR-21, which is expressed in various types of cancers. Intracellular CHA progression and the inhibitory effect against NF-&#954;B were observed only in miR-21 overexpressing cancer cells. The intracellular miR-21-catalyzed production of the NF-&#954;B DNA decoy has the potential to reduce side effects on normal cells, thereby strengthening the therapeutic profile of the CHA-decoy system. The ability to customize the combination of catalytic miRNA and target transcription factors would allow our technology to serve as a &#8220;personalized drug discovery system&#8221; for a variety of challenging diseases, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Multicatalytic Decarbonylation of Aldehydes Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;for&#8208;one decarbonylation: two metal&#8208;free multicatalytic decarbonylation processes of either secondary or tertiary aliphatic aldehydes are reported for the first time. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various functionalities and applied to complex molecules. Importantly, these processes are orthogonal and allow the selective decarbonylation of mixtures of aldehydes.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free dual photo&#8208; and organocatalytic decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes is described for the first time. On the one hand, a wide range of tertiary aldehydes are smoothly decarbonylated thanks to the combination of thioxanthone as photocatalyst and diphenyl disulfide as organocatalyst. On the other hand, by simply using 4&#8208;CzIPN as photocatalyst instead of thioxanthone, various secondary aldehydes readily undergo decarbonylation in an orthogonal manner, via the in situ formation of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines. Both methodologies are compatible with various functional groups and are readily applied to the decarbonylation of complex molecules.

         <title>Structural Isomerism of {Ag14}10+ Nanocluster Encapsulated by Bowl&#8208;like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented structural isomerism of {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters is for the first time observed in bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated silver nanoclusters, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2. Such structural isomerism effect endows two clusters with distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties.







Abstract
The structural isomerism of atomically precise nanoclusters provides a preeminent theoretical model to investigate the structure&#8722;property relationships. Herein, we synthesized three bowl&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;encapsulated Ag nanoclusters (denoted as {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1, {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1&#8201;a, and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2) via a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Among them, for the first time, an unprecedented isomeric {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters are obtained in polyoxoanions {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2, which should be probably induced by the different distribution of coordinating O atoms in two isomeric bowl&#8208;like {Sb3W30} ligands. Clusters {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;1 and {Ag14(Sb3W30)2}&#8208;2 exhibit distinct electronic structures and physicochemical properties due to the different geometric structures of the {Ag14}10+ nanoclusters, but both clusters can effectively catalyze the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with over 22,000 turnovers (TONs) after 6&#8208;hour photocatalysis.

         <title>Rational Design Two&#8208; or Four&#8208;Electron Reaction Pathway Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;electron reaction pathway covalent organic framework has been synthesized to boost H2O2 yield by replacing bipyridine N with biphenyl C atoms, which lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates in oxygen reduction reaction process and achieves high faraday efficiency and highly selective hydrogen peroxide production.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are often employed in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide production due to their tunable structures and compositions. However, COF electrocatalysts require precise structural engineering, such as heteroatoms or metal site doping, to modulate the reaction pathway during the ORR process. In this work, we designed a tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;phenylenediamine based COF electrocatalyst, namely TPDA&#8208;BDA, which exhibited excellent two&#8208;electron (2e) ORR performance with high H2O2 selectivity of 89.7&#8201;% and faraday efficiency (FE) of 86.7&#8201;%, higher than the reported COFs to date for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier for reduction of O2 to OOH* intermediates was significantly reduced by replacing of bipyridine with biphenyl blocks, changing from 4e to 2e ORR reaction pathway. Also, the donor&#8208;acceptor characteristic and narrower optical band gap of TPDA&#8208;BDA COF enhanced the electronic conductivity and reduction ability, thus elevating the catalytic activity. As a result, the H2O2 selectivity was maintained above 85&#8201;% even after 50&#8197;h stability test. This work reveals the structure&#8208;property relationship of COF electrocatalysts and provides a new strategy for rational design of high performance 2e ORR COF electrocatalysts for efficient and selective hydrogen peroxide production.

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction toward C2+ Products and CH4 by Regulating the Dimerization and Protonation in Platinum/Copper Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with C2+ FE reaching 70.4&#8201;% and CH4 FE reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. We believe that our work could inspire new opportunities for designing and developing catalysts for highly selective and efficient reactions.







Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts exhibit distinctive performance in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with complex mechanism and sophisticated types of products. The management of key intermediates *CO and *H is a necessary factor for achieving high product selectivity, but lack of efficient and versatile strategies. Herein, we designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts (denoted as Cu&#8208;Pt1 and Cu&#8208;PtNPs) precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products up to 70.4&#8201;% and the FE of CH4 reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. CO stripping experiments reveal that Pt1 sites could enhance the adsorption of *CO, while PtNPs exhibit *CO tolerance for H2O dissociation. In situ spectroscopic results further confirms that high coverage of *CO is achieved on Cu&#8208;Pt1, while *CHO on Cu&#8208;PtNPs might generate by additional water dissociation. As elucidated by theoretical studies, the interfacial sites of Cu&#8208;Pt1 would favor the *CO coverage promoting the evolution of *OCCO for C2+ products while PtNPs supplementarily accelerate H2O dissociation achieving *CHO for CH4. This work provides insights for efficient and targeted CO2 conversion by atomically design of active sites with engineered key intermediates coverage.

The Pt single atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; FE reaching 70.4&#8201;% and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; FE reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. We believe that our work could inspire new opportunities for designing and developing catalysts for highly selective and efficient reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper (Cu)-based catalysts exhibit distinctive performance in the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) with complex mechanism and sophisticated types of products. The management of key intermediates *CO and *H is a necessary factor for achieving high product selectivity, but lack of efficient and versatile strategies. Herein, we designed Pt modified Cu catalysts to effectively modulate the competitive coverage of those intermediates. The Pt single-atoms and Pt nanoparticles modified Cu catalysts (denoted as Cu-Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu-Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt;) precisely regulated the protonation and dimerization, with the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products up to 70.4&#8201;% and the FE of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reaching 57.7&#8201;%, respectively. CO stripping experiments reveal that Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites could enhance the adsorption of *CO, while Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit *CO tolerance for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation. In situ spectroscopic results further confirms that high coverage of *CO is achieved on Cu-Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, while *CHO on Cu-Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt; might generate by additional water dissociation. As elucidated by theoretical studies, the interfacial sites of Cu-Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would favor the *CO coverage promoting the evolution of *OCCO for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products while Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt; supplementarily accelerate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation achieving *CHO for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This work provides insights for efficient and targeted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion by atomically design of active sites with engineered key intermediates coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Application of Chiral Spirocyclic Bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral spirocyclic bisindoles have been designed and synthesized by asymmetric spirocyclization of the corresponding linear ketones by either chiral phosphoric acid catalysis or Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation followed by simple Lewis acid catalysis. These enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles have been demonstrated as useful chiral backbones for effective chiral catalysts that show good performance in both transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
While modifications of the privileged catalyst backbones, such as 1,1&#8217;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8217;&#8208;diol (SPINOL), have led to the development of diverse useful chiral catalysts, the incorporation of heteroarenes in such chiral spirocyclic structures has limitedly known. Herein we report the design of a type of chiral spirocyclic bisindole skeletons where the electronically distinct heteroarenes serve as direct anchor for functional sites. Separate approaches for the synthesis of two different families of such skeletons have been developed via chiral phosphoric acid and rhodium catalysis, respectively. Both strategies provided expedient access to the highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles, owing to not only the high nucleophilicity of the indole ring, but also the robust asymmetric control. These new skeletons have been demonstrated as backbones of effective chiral catalysts for both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis.

         <title>Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Hot Exciton Fluorescence and Multi&#8208;Source Excitation Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot exciton fluorescence and long afterglow emission were realized in the complexes by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly strategy. The complexes emitted bright afterglow after excited by 365&#8197;nm, 450&#8197;nm, white LED and even 800&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared laser under atmospheric conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic complexes with long afterglow luminescence have attracted extensive attention due to potential applications in display, sensing and information security. However, most of the metal&#8208;organic complex long afterglow materials reported so far are limited to the use of UV light as the excitation source, and the ambiguity of the structure&#8208;activity relationship makes the development of metal&#8208;organic complexes extremely limited. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic complexes with ultralong emission lifetime is constructed by coordination assembly of Zn(II) with three isomers. These complexes can emit afterglow when excited by UV light, blue LED, cell phone flashlight or even near&#8208;infrared light (800&#8197;nm) under ambient conditions, and the afterglow is also observed at 360&#8197;K. More interestingly, the inactivation pathway of the triplet exciton was altered by the strategy of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which leads to these complexes having hot exciton fluorescence (HEF) emission that is not present in the ligand. The relationship between structure and optical properties is investigated in detail by experiments and theoretical calculations. This work provides guidance for studying the modulation of optical properties by coordination interactions.

         <title>Porous 3&#8201;d&#8208;4&#8201;f Coordination Clusters for Selective Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

Two new families of high&#8208;nuclearity coordination clusters [M120RE96] (M = Co and Ni, PCC&#8208;216MR) and [Co144Gd156] (PCC&#8208;300CG) with porous structure, high stability in solution were successfully isolated, demonstrating a superior reactivity and selectivity in converting CO2 into CO under visible light.







Abstract
We report herein two families of porous coordination clusters (PCCs) with 216 nuclearity (M120RE96 or PCC&#8208;216MR) and 300 nuclearity (Co144Gd156 or PCC&#8208;300CG). For the first family M could be either nickel or cobalt, and RE = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd; while the latter features the highest nuclearity of transition&#8208;rare earth metal clusters. Characterized by their cube&#8208;like, hollow structures, these clusters exhibit the ability to absorb N2 and CO2. Besides, these clusters can be dissolved in both aqueous and acetonitrile/methanol solutions, and capable of acting as homogeneous catalysts for converting CO2 to CO under visible light. The gadolinium analogues of these clusters all show turnover numbers over 10000 and turnover frequencies over 1&#8197;s&#8722;1. In particular, the nickel based bimetallic cluster (PCC&#8208;216NG) demonstrates nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity for the reduction product, which may open a new direction for the design and development of PCCs based catalysts.

         <title>A ZnO&#8208;based Catalytic System for the Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system (ZnO(OVs)/Zn plate) has an internal electron source for the synthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen in ambient air. Water forms a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface, accelerating the oxygen transfer from the ambient air to the catalyst surface and facilitating the separation and collection of the reaction product.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has a wide range of applications as an eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable oxidant. However, the clean, efficient and convenient synthesis of this compound remains challenging. This work demonstrates a rationally designed electron&#8208;self&#8208;supplied catalytic system capable of generating H2O2 from water and atmospheric oxygen without extra energy input. This catalytic system is made of a ZnO coating containing oxygen vacancies and a Zn substrate. The ZnO catalyst layer obtains electrons from the Zn substrate to synthesize H2O2. The H2O2 concentration produced by this catalytic system is up to 17.9&#8197;mM without any secondary processing. This remarkably high concentration is attributed to the formation of a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface that promotes the oxygen reduction reaction by accelerating the transfer of oxygen from the ambient air to the catalyst surface. By integrating with atmospheric fog collection, this system can continuously collect H2O2 directly from the air.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Aqueous Electrolyte Induced Formation of Water&#8208;Poor Zn2+ Solvation Structures and Gradient Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;entropy aqueous electrolyte is developed by introducing multiple solutes and solvents. The well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated water molecules and free water while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase protective layer and a cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode, which can effectively mitigate the corrosion of the Zn anode and promote uniform deposition of Zn.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering has emerged as an effective strategy for stabilizing Zn&#8208;metal anodes. However, a single solute or solvent additive is far from sufficient to meet the requirements for electrolyte cycling stability. Here, we report a new&#8208;type high&#8208;entropy electrolyte composed of equal molar amounts of Zn(OTf)2 and LiOTf, along with equal volumes of H2O, triethyl phosphate, and dimethyl sulfoxide, which enhances electrolyte stability by increasing solvation entropy. Specifically, this well&#8208;designed high&#8208;entropy electrolyte reduces the content of solvated and free water molecules while forming a robust gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the Zn anode surface, protecting the Zn anode from water&#8208;induced corrosion. Moreover, the cationic electrostatic shielding layer on the Zn anode effectively suppresses the &#8220;tip effect&#8221;, enabling the uniform deposition of Zn. The synergistic effects of this mixed electrolyte effectively leverage the properties of individual additives, significantly extending the cycle life of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Consequently, the resulting Zn//Zn symmetric cell using this high&#8208;entropy electrolyte can operate over 8000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. To highlight, in a Zn//V2O5&#8901;H2O pouch cell, it retains 83.1&#8201;% of initial capacity after 420 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Such multifunctional high&#8208;entropy electrolyte design provides a meaningful reference for stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Where Does the Proton Go? Structure and Dynamics of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Switching in Aminophosphine Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminophosphine chalcogenides are relevant in many organocatalytic concepts and are the focus of prebiotic studies. Spectroscopy (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), MD simulations, and DFT calculations provide unique insight into their proton&#8208;binding affinity. All conceivable hydrogen&#8208;bonding modes can be formed and controlled. Fundamental principles of self&#8208;organization, proton&#8208;hopping, and of the behavior at the lower concentration threshold are revealed.







Abstract
Aminophosphates are the focus of research on prebiotic phosphorylation chemistry. Their bifunctional nature also makes them a powerful class of organocatalysts. However, the structural chemistry and dynamics of proton&#8208;binding in phosphorylation and organocatalytic mechanisms are still not fully understood. Aminophosphine chalcogenides, preserving the central H2N&#8722;P+&#8722;Ch&#8722; structural motif, represent well&#8208;suited molecular models that mimic proton&#8208;binding, hydrogen&#8208;bond switching and supramolecular self&#8208;assembling behavior of catalytically and prebiotically relevant molecules. Through spectroscopic (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), molecular dynamics, and computational investigations, the dynamic proton switching capability of aminophosphate analogs was demonstrated. It was shown under which conditions the amino (NH2) or chalcogen (Ch) functions in H2N&#8722;P+&#8722;Ch&#8722; structural units are protonated. In fact, all conceivable modes of hydrogen&#8208;bonding were identified, revealing substantial differences between the oxygen derivative and the heavier congeners. Using coordinating anions, supramolecular zigzag&#8208; and cube&#8208;shaped arrangements were found in the solid&#8208;state and in solution. After break&#8208;up of the cube structure, the sulfides and selenides no longer form stable interactions with HCl molecules. In the absence of coordinating anions, however, protonation of the chalcogen function is preferred. In contrast to the oxygen derivative, the heavier protonated congeners show dynamic intramolecular proton&#8208;hopping between the chalcogen and the amino function.

         <title>Crystalline, Porous Figure&#8208;Eight&#8208;Noded Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed condensation of Figure&#8208;eight units develops novel double&#8208;decker 2D covalent organic frameworks to create well&#8208;defined &#960; arrays and 1D micropores. The figure&#8208;eight frameworks are brilliant light emitters, convert &#960; columns into water oxidation and oxygen reduction centers, and produce H2O2 efficiently with water/salt water, oxygen/air, and light as sole inputs, opening a novel way to framework and well&#8208;defined figure&#8208;eight materials.







Abstract
Figure&#8208;eight macrocycles represent a fascinating class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units characterized by unique aesthetics and non&#8208;contact molecular crossing at the center. Despite progress in synthesis over the past century, research into inorganic, organic, and polymeric figure&#8208;eight materials remains in its infancy. Here we report the first examples of figure&#8208;eight covalent organic frameworks by condensing figure&#8208;eight knots to create extended porous figure&#8208;eight &#960; architectures. A distinct feature is that polymerization interweaves figure&#8208;eight knots into double&#8208;decker layers, which upon supramolecular polymerization organize well&#8208;defined layer frameworks. The figure&#8208;eight frameworks exhibit a band gap of 2.3&#8197;eV and emit bright orange florescence with benchmark quantum yields. Remarkably, the donor&#8208;acceptor figure&#8208;eight skeletons convert the figure&#8208;eight knots into reduction centers and the linkers into oxidation sites upon light irradiation, enable charge transport and accumulation through &#960; columns, while the built&#8208;in hydrophilic micropores allow rapid water and oxygen delivery via capillary effect. With these distinct features, the figure&#8208;eight frameworks function as a photocatalyst to produce hydrogen peroxide at high rate and efficiency with water/saltwater, oxygen/air, and light as sole inputs. This work paves a way to a new class of molecular frameworks, underpinning the study of well&#8208;defined figure&#8208;eight materials to explore unprecedented structures and functions so far we untouched.

         <title>Unlocking Hexafluoroisopropanol as a Practical Anion&#8208;Binding Catalyst for Living Cationic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution unlocks a simple, versatile, robust, and sustainable anion&#8208;binding catalytic strategy for living cationic polymerization, wherein commercially accessible hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), when used in high loading, can create higher&#8208;order HFIP aggregates to mediate dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium via non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding principle, thereby delivering unprecedented polymerization activity and controllability across various electron&#8208;rich vinyl monomers under mild conditions.







Abstract
Living cationic polymerization (LCP) is a classical technique for precision polymer synthesis; however, due to the high sensitivity of cationic active species towards chain&#8208;transfer/termination events, it is notoriously difficult to control polymerization under mild conditions, which inhibits its progress in advanced materials engineering. Here, we unlock a practical anion&#8208;binding catalytic strategy to address the historical dilemma in LCP. Our experimental and mechanistic studies demonstrate that commercially accessible hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), when used in high loading, can create higher&#8208;order HFIP aggregates to tame dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium via non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding principle, in turn inducing distinctive polymerization kinetics behaviors that grant efficient chain propagation while minimizing competitive side reactions. This unique control mechanism delivers unprecedented polymerization activity and controllability across various electron&#8208;rich vinyl monomers under mild conditions, and provides easy access to high molecular weight polymers, block copolymers, and end&#8208;functionalized telechelic polymers. Also, the minimalistic structure of HFIP coupled with its convenient removal and recycle renders this approach easy to scale up, without concern for cost, sustainability and complicated work&#8208;up processes associated with previous systems. This study presents another universal and sustainable strategy for cationic macromolecular engineering, and will also stimulate further exploration of innovative non&#8208;covalent catalysis that enables more challenging living polymerization systems.

         <title>Tuning the Acid Hardness Nature of Cu Catalyst for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base theory, this work explores tuning the hardness properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts to enhance nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. By modifying Cu&#8208;based catalyst with BaO, we enhanced improved dynamics for protonation and desorption of key intermediates, achieving 97.3&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and stability over wide potential and nitrate range, providing a new paradigm for electrocatalyst design.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) in alkaline electrolyte presents a sustainable pathway for energy storage and green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, it remains challenging to obtain high activity and selectivity due to the limited protonation and/or desorption processes of key intermediates. Herein, we propose a strategy to regulate the acid hardness nature of Cu catalyst by introducing appropriate modifier. Using density functional theory calculations, we firstly identified that the BaO&#8208;modified Cu showed optimal Gibbs free energies for key NO3RR steps, including the protonation of *NO and the desorption of *NH3. Experimentally, the BaO&#8208;modified Cu catalyst exhibited 97.3&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 with a yield rate of 356.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. It could also maintain high activity across a wide range of applied potentials and nitrate substrate concentrations. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Ba species could modulate the local electronic states of Cu, enhance the electron transfer rate, and optimize the adsorption/protonation/desorption processes of the N&#8208;containing intermediates, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One Photoacid Generators with Green/Red&#8208;light Responsiveness and Cooperative Functionality</title>

PBI&#8208;PAG undergoes a quantitative (&gt;99&#8201;%) photoreaction to generate acid and photosensitizer (CBI) upon green/red light (560&#8197;nm&#8208;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Beyond respective roles as catalyst and PDT agent, the released acid and CBI sensitizer could cooperate in tumor anti&#8208;metastasis and ablation, granting PBI&#8208;PAG as a powerful molecular tool in inter&#8208;disciplinary applications.







Abstract
Photoacid generators (PAGs) are invaluable molecular tools that exhibited tremendous potential in emerging interdisciplinary researches of life&#8208;science, nanotechnology and smart materials. However, current PAGs are primarily mono&#8208;functional in terms of acid generation and rely on UV/deep&#8208;blue light excitation, posing a fundamental hurdle to their broader adoption. Developing cooperatively functioned PAGs with long&#8208;wavelength light responsiveness presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of suitable molecular scaffolds. Here, we introduce a newly&#8208;developed perylene bisimides PAG motif (PBI&#8208;PAG) that integrates desired multi&#8208;functionality and visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;reactivity. Taking advantages of characteristic opto&#8208;electronic properties of PBI scaffold, PBI&#8208;PAGs are capable of quantitative releasing (&gt;99&#8201;%) a palette of acids upon green/red light (560&#8211;605&#8197;nm) excitation. Concurrently, a photo&#8208;generated counterpart is functioned as a photo&#8208;sensitizer that could perform cooperatively with acid as an anti&#8208;metastasis cancer therapy agent. These two processes constitute the first example of a cooperatively functioned PAG operated at substrate&#8208;adaptive wavelengths.

         <title>Gradient Design with Low&#8208;Tortuosity Overcoming Kinetic Limitations in High&#8208;Loading Solid&#8208;State Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

A multilayer coating with magnetic field alignment is designed to optimize ion transport and concentration gradients in solid&#8208;state cathodes, enhancing electrochemical kinetics and increasing energy/power densities, thereby overcoming a key challenge in solid&#8208;state battery commercialization.







Abstract
The extensive commercialization of practical solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) necessitates the development of high&#8208;loading solid&#8208;state cathodes with fast charging capability. However, electrochemical kinetics are severely delayed in thick cathodes due to tortuous ion transport pathways and slow solid&#8208;solid ion diffusion, which limit the achievable capacity of SSBs at high current densities. In this work, we propose a conductivity gradient cathode with low&#8208;tortuosity to enable facile ion transport and counterbalance ion concentration gradient, thereby overcoming the kinetic limitations and achieving fast charging capabilities in thick cathodes. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes deliver a room&#8208;temperature (RT) capacities of 147 and 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C, respectively, and meanwhile achieve a RT areal capacity of 3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3&#8197;C, enabling SSBs simultaneously high energy and power densities. The universality of this strategy is demonstrated in LiFePO4 cathodes, providing a novel solution for fast charging and large&#8208;scale application of high&#8208;loading SSBs.

         <title>Insights into the Electrolyte Hydrolysis and Its Impacts on the Interfacial Chemistry of a Li+&#8208;Intercalated Anode during High&#8208;Temperature Calendar Aging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry was employed for decoupling the hydrolysis reaction mechanism of two conventional Li salts in the bulk of electrolyte and at the Li+&#8208;intercalated anode surface during high&#8208;temperature storage. Results showed that the hydrolysis products effectively passivated the anode surface and contributed to improved interfacial stability against high&#8208;temperature calendar aging.







Abstract
Calendar aging occurring during high&#8208;temperature storage has long plagued practical realization of long&#8208;life, high&#8208;safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Generally, the aging process is ascribed to the hydrolysis reaction of fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte salt that generates hydrofluoric acid and chemically corrodes the anode surface. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism about electrolyte degradation, HF generation and surface corrosion remains concealed for various electrolytes. In this work, we employed in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy to resolve the chemical evolution during high&#8208;temperature calendar aging in the bulk of the electrolyte and at the anode/electrolyte interface. Two conventional salts, LiPF6 and Li bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), were employed for comparison. We identify that the high&#8208;temperature hydrolysis of LiPF6 preferentially occurs when the anion aggregates ([PF6+LiPF6]&#8722;) are attacked by trace H2O. HPO2F2, HF and LiF are generated and assist formation of an inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), improving anode stability against parasitic reactions. The LiFSI&#8208;based electrolyte does not involve hydrolysis, which facilities the formation of an organics&#8208;rich SEI. Nevertheless, the SEI does not passivate the anode surface and could induce severe corrosions via electron tunneling at a high temperature. Our work offers original insights into rational design of electrolyte and interface for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;calendar&#8208;life LIBs.

         <title>Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acids Synergy in Photocatalytic Aerobic Alcohol Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites were integrated into TiO2, which can supply coordinatively unsaturated sites to adsorb molecular oxygen and establish hydrogen bond with the OH groups of alcohols. The synergy of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites achieves efficient photocatalytic organic transformations.







Abstract
Photocatalytic chemical transformations for green organic synthesis has attracted much interest. However, their development is greatly hampered by the lack of sufficient reactive sites on the photocatalyst surface for the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of well&#8208;defined Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites coexisting on the surface of TiO2 (SO42&#8722;/N&#8208;TiO2) creates abundant active adsorption sites for photoredox reactions. The electron&#8208;deficient Lewis acid sites supply coordinatively unsaturated surface sites to adsorb molecular oxygen, and the Br&#248;nsted acid sites are liable to donate protons to form hydrogen bonds with the OH groups of alcohols like benzyl alcohol (BA). These coexistent acid sites result in a strong synergistic effect in photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of BA. For example, the conversion of BA to benzaldehyde was found to be 88.6&#8201;%, being much higher than those of pristine TiO2 (14.7&#8201;%), N&#8208;doped TiO2 (N&#8208;TiO2, 24.6&#8201;%), sulfated TiO2 (SO42&#8722;/ TiO2, 35.4&#8201;%), and even their sum. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was determined to be 58.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and 12.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm over SO42&#8722;/N&#8208;TiO2. This strategy to create effective synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids on the catalyst surfaces enables us to apply it to other semiconducting photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Clone&#8208;Resolved Chemical Depletion of T cells via Cellular Proximity Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical strategy of depleting T cells utilizes chemically engineered dendritic cell (DC) &#8208;derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy targeted T cell clones in close proximity. This strategy enables selective elimination of pathogenic T cell clones without impairing normal T cells, which might serve as a new antigen&#8208;specific approach for blunting autoimmune inflammations.







Abstract
T cells play a pivotal role in the development of autoimmune diseases. To mitigate autoimmune inflammation without inducing global immunosuppression, it is crucial to selectively eliminate autoreactive T cell clones while preserving the normal T cell repertoire. In this study, we applied cellular proximity chemistry to develop a T&#8208;cell depletion method with clonal precision. Using engineered dendritic cells (DCs) with surface&#8208;bound photosensitizers, we generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at immune synapses, leading to the targeted death of antigen&#8208;specific T cells in close proximity. This process induces lipid oxidation in T cell membranes, triggering ferroptosis&#8208;like cell death. The method enables the selective elimination of specific T cell clones without affecting others, in which the clonal resolution was demonstrated by TCR sequencing. Finally, we demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in a type 1 diabetes model by selectively depleting the pathogenic 8.3 T cell clone, thereby protecting islet &#946; cells and preserving overall T cell function. This strategy offers a promising avenue for immunosuppressive therapy that targets pathogenic T cells while maintaining overall immune integrity.

         <title>Forward&#8208; and Retro&#8208;Vapofluorochromism of Sponge&#8208;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials with a wide range of multicolor properties have attracted increasing attention due to their wide applications. We here report a unique forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromic behavior of sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals for multicolor switching through reversible amine vapor uptake and &#8220;squeeze&#8221; &#8211; induced solid&#8208;state intramolecular and intermolecular motion.







Abstract
Achieving dynamic multicolor emission through solid&#8208;state molecular motion is of significant importance for advancing applications in organic solid&#8208;state luminescent materials. Herein, we report macrocycle crystals with unique forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromic behavior, which is realized by reversible amine vapor uptake and amine&#8208;&#8220;squeeze&#8221; induced guest release. The forward&#8208;vapofluorochromism occurs when aliphatic amines penetrate guest&#8208;free macrocycle crystals to form host&#8208;guest complex crystals. These fluorescent properties can be reversibly toggled by exposing the amine&#8208;loaded crystals to another amine vapor through competitive guest replacement inside the crystals. Notably, retro&#8208;vapofluorochromism is achieved by exposing amine&#8208;loaded crystals to &#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (MBA). Mechanistic studies show that MBA molecules do not penetrate the crystals, but rather &#8220;squeeze&#8221; the crystals to release loaded amines, driving the amine&#8208;loaded crystals back to the guest&#8208;free phase. The demonstrated forward&#8208; and retro&#8208;vapofluorochromism has already been successfully integrated into a highly secure five&#8208;layer information encryption system.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Modified Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters Towards Pure&#8208;Green OLEDs with a CIEy Value of 0.74</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;narrow green multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters have been developed by synergistic cyano&#8208;decoration and a &#960;&#8208;extension strategy. The resulting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes deliver an exceptional green color purity that approaches the BT.2020 standard, as well as high external quantum efficiencies exceeding 30&#8201;%.







Abstract
The development of pure&#8208;green organic emitters with ideal emission peaks and ultra&#8208;narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report two new green emitters, CNBN and MCNBN, which achieve extremely narrow FWHMs by synergistic rigid &#960;&#8208;extension and cyano&#8208;substitution of a sky&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core. The introduction of cyano groups induces red&#8208;shifts in the emission to the green region and dramatically minimizes the FWHMs. In toluene solution, CNBN and MCNBN exhibit narrowband emission with a maximum at 501&#8197;nm and 510&#8197;nm with ultra&#8208;narrow FWHMs of 14&#8197;nm/0.066&#8197;eV and 15&#8197;nm/0.071&#8197;eV, respectively. Given the near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and almost 100&#8201;% horizontal dipole orientation, the electroluminescent (EL) devices based on CNBN and MCNBN deliver external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 30&#8201;% with FWHMs of 16&#8197;nm/0.072&#8197;eV and 17&#8197;nm/0.080&#8197;eV, respectively. Notably, the MCNBN&#8208;based device achieves pure&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 517&#8197;nm with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.17, 0.74), closely aligning with the BT.2020 green standard.

         <title>Integrated Two&#8208;in&#8208;one Strategy for Efficient Neutral Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis via Phosphorous Doping in 2D Mesoporous Carbon Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for efficient electrocatalytic H2O2 production in neutral media by incorporation P dopant in the carbon framework. The incorporation of P not only helps to modify the microenvironment of the catalyst, but also further adjusts the coordination environment and electronic structure of the In single atom. This optimization enhances the adsorption of *OOH, thereby accelerating the efficient formation of H2O2.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate a two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for efficient neutral electrosynthesis of H2O2 via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), achieved by synergistically fine&#8208;modulating both the local microenvironment and electronic structure of indium (In) single atom (SA) sites. Through a series of finite elemental simulations and experimental analysis, we highlight the significant impact of phosphorous (P) doping on an optimized 2D mesoporous carbon carrier, which fosters a favorable microenvironment by improving the mass transfer and O2 enrichment, subsequently leading to an increased local pH levels. Consequently, an outstanding 2e&#8722; ORR performance is observed in neutral electrolytes, achieving over 95&#8201;% selectivity for H2O2 across a broad voltage range of 0.1 to 0.5&#8197;V vs RHE. In a flow cell, the production rate of H2O2 exceeds 22.54&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 while maintaining high stability at industrial&#8208;level current densities. These results are comparable to, if not better than, those achieved under alkaline conditions. Further analysis, both experimental and theoretical, indicates that the P dopant occupies the second coordination sphere of the In SA, which shows optimized OOH* binding strength for an enhanced 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic.

         <title>Flow Electroreductive Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation of Alkenes Using gem&#8208;Dichloroalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient continuous&#8208;flow electroreductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of olefins using commercial gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes. The reaction is tolerant to oxygen and moisture while displaying a broad functional group compatibility. This methodology enables gram&#8208;scale cyclopropanation and is compatible with a wide range of alkenes. Mechanistic studies suggests that a nickel carbene is electro&#8208;generated to afford the cyclopropane ring.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are valuable motifs in organic synthesis, widely featured in pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we report an efficient electrochemical methodology for the cyclopropanation of alkenes, leveraging a nickel&#8208;catalyzed process in continuous&#8208;flow. The developed protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, accommodating both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor alkenes with high functional group tolerance. Beyond dichloromethane as a feedstock methylene source, the methodology enables the synthesis of methylated, deuterated, and chloro&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. Mechanistic investigations suggest the electro&#8208;generation of a nickel carbene as key intermediate. Notably, the reaction operates under ambient conditions, tolerates air and moisture, and achieves scalability through continuous&#8208;flow technology, offering a straightforward route to multi&#8208;gram quantities with enhanced throughput.

         <title>The First Kleinman&#8208;type Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Circular Dichroism On/Off Switchable Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics show a ferroelectric phase transition at around 336&#8197;K from the chiral&#8208;polar point group 2 to chiral&#8208;nonpolar 422, which enables the notable switching of second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response from SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) to inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states. Such an on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD effect is unprecedented.







Abstract
Chiral ferroelectrics have recently received considerable interest due to their unique chiroptical properties. They can adopt Kleinman symmetry second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#8208;active chiral&#8208;polar point groups in the ferroelectric phase while Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive chiral&#8208;nonpolar point groups in the paraelectric phase, providing a great opportunity to realize on/off switching of SHG circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response. However, the SHG&#8208;CD effect was rarely explored in chiral ferroelectrics, and the on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD has never been reported. Herein, we report the first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics (R/S&#8208;CS)Ca(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) (CS=camphor&#8208;10&#8208;sulfonic acid), which undergo a 422F2 type ferroelectric phase transition at around 336&#8197;K from Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;active point group 2 to Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive point group 422. Notably, they exhibit obvious SHG&#8208;CD responses with an anisotropy factor of up to 0.31. More importantly, the SHG&#8208;CD response can be switched between SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) and inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states during the ferroelectric phase transition, which is unprecedented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of Kleinman&#8208;type SHG&#8208;CD on/off switchable ferroelectric. Our findings open up a new way to switch SHG&#8208;CD response based on chiral ferroelectrics, which would greatly inspire the further exploration of switchable SHG&#8208;CD effects in chiral ferroelectrics.

         <title>Chemically Patterning Lithiophilic Interphase to Harmonize Spatial Electrons and Thermal Catalysis Dynamics for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of elaborated chemically patterning to decorate Cu foil was proposed to harmonize spatial Li+ and facilitate thermal catalysis dynamics for stable and safe lithium metal batteries. The compact electrode with lithiophilic array regulated Li plating/stripping behavior, mitigating Li dendrite formation. Moreover, the composite electrode can suppress smoke and reduce toxicity during the battery thermal runaway process, making a significant improvement for next&#8208;generation safe lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries have garnered significant attention as promising energy storage solutions. However, their performance is often compromised by the risks associated with highly active metallic lithium, unrestricted electrode expansion, and excessive dendrites growth. Here we introduce an advanced lithiophilic anode substrate designed by chemically patterning technology for multiple security enhancements. The innovative lithiophilic array harmonizes spatial Li+ to prepare compact and reversible electrodes. The composite electrodes feature an enhanced C&#8722;F component in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, which protects the deposited lithium metal from unwanted side reactions, thereby stabilizing electrochemical cycling. Notably, the thermal safety can be revealed through the substrate&#8216;s excellent catalytic ability to convert smoke and toxic gases during extreme thermal runaway. This work demonstrates a novel approach to integrating battery cycling stability with thermal safety, paving the way for more reliable and secure energy storage systems.

         <title>Rigidly Locked Pyrene Excimers in Planar Chiral Pyrenophanes for Intense and Stable Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of pyrenophanes with rigidly locked pyrene dimers and varied bridges has been designed and synthesized. These compounds reveal intense and stable circularly polarized photoluminescence (CP&#8208;PL) and electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL), thus making them attractive platforms for both fundamental investigations on pyrene excimers and practical applications, such as chiral sensing.







Abstract

         <title>Towards Solid&#8208;State Batteries Using a Calcium Hydridoborate Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the discovery of a fast solid&#8208;state Ca&#8208;ionic conductor based on di(methylamine) calcium tetrahydridoborate. The new compound Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3 crystallizes in a relatively open and flexible layered structure, which allows for fast Ca&#8208;ion migration in the solid state. The calcium plating/stripping behavior is investigated in cell configurations of Ca|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|M (M=Pt or Mo) and CaxSn|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|Sn.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries created from abundant elements, such as calcium, may pave the way for cheaper and safer electrical energy storage. Here we report a new type of solid calcium hydridoborate electrolyte, Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3, with a high ionic conductivity of &#963;(Ca2+) ~10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at T=70&#8201;&#176;C, which is assigned to a relatively open and flexible structure with apolar moieties and weak dihydrogen bonds that facilitate migration of Ca2+ ions in the solid state. The compound display a low electronic conductivity, providing an ionic transport number close to unity (tion=0.9916). Calcium plating is observed for a Ca|Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3|Pt electrochemical cell and the electrodes are investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) that reveal a rugged Ca anode surface owing to the stripping process and the presence of Ca&#8208;containing domains on the Pt working electrode from the plating process. Improved electrochemical reversiblity was achieved in a three&#8208;electrode cell configuration using a CaxSn counter and reference electrode and a Sn working electrode, CaxSn&#8201;|&#8201;Ca(BH4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2NH2CH3&#8201;|&#8201;Sn, providing reversible Ca plating and stripping.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Synthesis of a Polymer in Two Distinct Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing topologically different polymers from single monomer via traditional solution&#8208;state synthesis is impossible. Two different polymorphs underwent spontaneous topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization and resulted into topologically distinct polymers having 1,4&#8208;disubstituded triazole in the backbone. Furthermore, upon heating at high temperature, both polymorphs exhibited distinct thermoresponses and mechanical properties accompanied by topochemical polymerization.







Abstract
A squaramide&#8208;based monomer, designed for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization, crystallizes as two polymorphs, M1 and M2, both having crystal packing suitable for topochemical polymerization. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding between squaramide units bias the molecular organization in both the polymorphs. 3D packing of H&#8208;bonded stacks of monomer lead to juxtaposition of azide and alkyne units of adjacent molecules in a transition&#8208;state&#8208;like arrangement for their regiospecific cycloaddition reaction. The monomers are arranged as supramolecular sheets and supramolecular helices in polymorph M1 and M2 respectively. Both the polymorphs undergo slow and spontaneous regiospecific TAAC polymerization at room temperature, but react quickly at higher temperatures, resulting in 1,4&#8208;traizolyl&#8208;linked polymer, with distinct mechanical responses. Upon heating, single crystals of polymorph M1 show expansion followed by contraction without any permanent dimensional change, whereas crystals of polymorph M2 undergo splitting. At moderate temperatures, both the polymorphs undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) polymerization, resulting in two polymer&#8208;polymorphs with distinct topologies that can be studied at atomic resolution by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The polymorph M1 reacts to polymer P1 with &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like topology, and polymorph M2 reacts to polymer P2 having polymer chains of helical conformation. Nanoindentation experiments with crystals of these polymers revealed their distinct mechanical properties.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalyzed Alkylation of Phosphonites by Direct Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;P Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent oxidation sensitivity of P(III) reagents has long hindered their application in oxidative coupling. However, the synergy of light and electricity enables a general, modular approach to the synthesis of functionalized alkylphosphonites from carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions using P(III) compounds as limiting reagents. This strategy is applicable to the alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleoside&#8208;derived phosphonites.







Abstract
A photoelectrocatalytic method is presented that achieves direct decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;P coupling, providing a modular route to alkylphosphinates and alkylphosphonates from readily available carboxylic acids. The success of this reaction hinges on the synergistic combination of electrochemical anodic oxidation and photocatalytic ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) decarboxylation. By employing P(III) reagents as limiting reagents, our approach enables efficient alkyl modification of medicinally important nucleosides and complex molecules derived phosphonites, which were challenging to access by existing methods. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the critical roles of Fe catalysts and additives, offering valuable insights into the reaction pathway and laying the foundation for future advancements in photoelectrocatalytic C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Perylene Diimide Macrocycle Chiroptical Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle has been prepared in which point chiral imide groups yield a discrete helical dimer, to mimic a helical supramolecular assembly. The macrocycle exhibits three&#8208;way switching of its chiroptical properties in solution (+/&#8722;/off). This behaviour can be controlled by various stimuli, including the binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and identifies important structure&#8208;property relationships for chiral materials.







Abstract
Helical assemblies of organic dyes are ubiquitous chiral organic materials, with valuable properties including chiroptical switching due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular chirality.

     alt="A Bis-Perylene Diimide Macrocycle Chiroptical Switch"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral bis-perylene diimide macrocycle has been prepared in which point chiral imide groups yield a discrete helical dimer, to mimic a helical supramolecular assembly. The macrocycle exhibits three-way switching of its chiroptical properties in solution (+/&#8722;/off). This behaviour can be controlled by various stimuli, including the binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and identifies important structure-property relationships for chiral materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helical assemblies of organic dyes are ubiquitous chiral organic materials, with valuable properties including chiroptical switching due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report a novel chiral bis-perylene diimide macrocycle, which acts as a discrete molecular model for a chiral supramolecular assembly. Point chirality is installed through amino acid-derived imide groups which, upon macrocyclization, is translated into helical chirality in the perylene diimide dimer. In solution, the macrocycle's chiroptical properties are switchable, with both the sign (+/&#8722;) and amplitude (on/off) of the signal tuned using solvent and molecular recognition stimuli respectively. The chiral structure&#8211;property relationships identified from this macrocycle are important for the design of high fidelity supramolecular chiroptical switches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing a 3&#8197;C Fast&#8208;Charging Practical Sodium Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorus&#8208;sulfur synergistic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase has been constructed on the surface of hard carbon anode to reduce the energy barrier of both Na+ desolvation and diffusion. Consequently, a 126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Ah&#8208;level practical sodium pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C fast charging has been achieved. Further, a power&#8208;type pouch cell with a record high charging C&#8208;rate up to 50&#8197;C has also been fabricated.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), endowed with relatively small Stokes radius and low desolvation energy of Na+, are reckoned as a promising candidate for fast&#8208;charging endeavors. However, the C&#8208;rate charging capability of practical energy&#8208;dense sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells is currently limited to &#8804;1&#8197;C, due to the high propensity for detrimental metallic Na plating on the hard carbon (HC) anode at elevated rates. Here, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level sodium&#8208;ion pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging is successfully developed via phosphorus (P)&#8208;sulfur (S) interphase chemistry. By rational electrolyte regulation, desired P&#8722;S constituents, namely, Na3PO4 and Na2SO4, are generated in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with favorable Na+ interface kinetics. Specifically, Na+ desolvation energy barrier has been greatly lowered by the weak ion&#8208;solvent coordination near the inner Helmholtz plane on Na3PO4 interphase, while Na2SO4 expedites charge carrier mobility due to its intrinsically high ionic conductivity. Consequently, an energy&#8208;dense (126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) O3&#8208;Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2||HC pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging (100&#8201;% state of charge) without Na plating can be achieved, with a great capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles. Further, the assembled power&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)3||HC pouch cell displays an impressive fast&#8208;charging capability of 50&#8197;C, which surpasses that of previously reported high&#8208;power SIBs. This work serves as an enlightenment for developing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

         <title>Oligomerized Electron Acceptors with Alkynyl Linkages to Suppress Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling for Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Solar Cells</title>

A novel series of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via Sonogashira coupling, achieving precise morphology control, reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, and high efficiencies up to 19.52% in ternary solar cells.







Abstract
A novel series of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized electron acceptors have been synthesized via Sonogashira coupling. The alkynyl linkages can enhance molecular planarity and aggregation, suppress electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and reduce non&#8208;radiative losses. Binary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved an efficiency of 17.90%, with a non&#8208;radiative loss of 0.185 eV, while ternary OSCs reached a remarkable efficiency of 19.52%. Oligomerized electron acceptors, featuring molecular weights akin to polymers and well&#8208;defined chemical structures, have emerged as promising candidates for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their consistent batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and improved thermal stability. In this study, we developed a series of oligomerized electron acceptors incorporating alkynyl linkages via an efficient Sonogashira coupling reaction between alkyne&#8208;substituted Y&#8208;type precursors and multi&#8208;substituted iodobenzenes. This method produced monomeric (S&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF), dimeric (D&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF), and trimeric (T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF) configurations, enabling systematic control over molecular size and substituent arms. The alkynyl linkages, characterized by high bond strength and planar geometry, enhanced molecular planarity and aggregation in films, thus facilitating precise control over morphology and phase separation in the photoactive layers. Notably, the inclusion of these linkages effectively suppressed electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in reduced non&#8208;radiative energy losses and elevated photocarrier lifetime. OSCs based on PM6:T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.90%, a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of 0.185&#8197;eV, and an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.943&#8197;V. Furthermore, integrating T&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;YF into the D18:N3 blend yielded an exceptional PCE of 19.52%. These results underscore the potential of alkynyl&#8208;linked oligomerized acceptors in advancing highly efficient and stable OSCs, offering a viable pathway for reducing electron&#8208;phonon coupling and enhancing device performance.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Engineered Hydrophilic Perovskite Enabling Surface Potential&#8208;Driven Anions Exchange for Multicolor Biosensing</title>

         <dc:description>
The geometric preorganization induced by C=C bonds in unsaturated alkylamines and the &#8220;bridge&#8221; effect of haloalkanoic acids are harnessed to promote the SN2 reaction and design zwitterionic ligands, enabling CsPbBr3 NCs with hydrophilicity and a 100&#8201;% PLQY. Based on the positive surface potential&#8208;driven fast anion exchange (FAE) reaction, AgI NPs are developed as latent anion exchangers, realizing multicolor biosensing with H2S as an example.







Abstract
The difficulty in designing zwitterionic ligands impedes the water&#8208;dispersed CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and their application as fast anion exchange (FAE) probes in biosensing. This study proposes a design paradigm for zwitterionic ligands predicated upon revealing the mechanism of the SN2 reaction between unsaturated alkylamines (Cn&#8242;) and haloalkanoic acids (HAAs). Among them, the C=C bond can enhance the nucleophilicity of Cn&#8242; and promote the electrostatic adsorption of HAAs onto Cn&#8242;, i.e., the geometric preorganization process, thereby initiating the SN2 reaction. Moreover, an appropriate &#8220;bridge&#8221; length enables HAAs to balance the geometric preorganization process and the Sigma hole intensity of the C&#8722;Br bond. Zwitterionic ligands derived from oleylamine (C18&#8242;) and 5&#8208;bromovaleric acid (5&#8208;BVA) endow CsPbBr3 NCs with water dispersibility, an almost 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield, and enhanced surface potential, facilitating the capture of halide ions and driving the FAE reaction. Using AgI nanoparticles (NPs) as latent anion exchangers, a third FAE strategy is presented for multicolor biosensing. Such a robust biosensing strategy can generate wavelength shift and chromatic difference for biological target molecules, exemplified by H2S, and is ultimately applicable to multicolor assay in biological, environmental and food samples, demonstrating the immense potential of perovskite&#8208;based FAE probes in biosensing.

         <title>Innovative asymmetric CoSA&#8208;N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx catalysis: unleashing superoxide radicals for rapid self&#8208;coupling removal of phenolic pollutant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;oxygen double coordination strategy is proposed to create an asymmetrical Co&#8208;N2O3 microenvironment onto Ti3C2Tx. It shows excellent peroxymonosulfate activation capability for the formation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;) and the subsequently completed removal of phenolic pollutants. An &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;mediated radical pathway, functioning as a self&#8208;coupling reaction rather than deep oxidation, is proposed for phenolic removal in water.







Abstract
The polymerization pathway of contaminants rivals the traditional mineralization pathway in water purification technologies. However, designing suitable oxidative environments to steer contaminants toward polymerization remains challenging. This study introduces a nitrogen&#8208;oxygen double coordination strategy to create an asymmetrical microenvironment for Co atoms on Ti3C2Tx MXenes, resulting in a novel Co&#8208;N2O3 microcellular structure that efficiently activates peroxymonosulfate. This unique activation capability led to the complete removal of various phenolic pollutants within 3&#8197;min, outperforming the representative Co single&#8208;atom catalysts reported in the past three years. Identifying and recognizing reactive oxygen species highlight the crucial role of &#8901;O2&#8722;. The efficient pollutant removal occurs through a &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;mediated radical pathway, functioning as a self&#8208;coupling reaction rather than deep oxidation. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich pollutants transfer more electrons to the catalyst surface, inducing the reduction of dissolved oxygen to &#8901;O2&#8722; in the Co&#8208;N2O3 microregion. In a practical continuous flow&#8208;through application, the system achieved 100&#8201;% acetaminophen removal efficiency in 6.5&#8197;h, with a hydraulic retention time of just 0.98&#8197;s. This study provides new insights into the previously underappreciated role of &#8901;O2&#8722; in pollutant purification, offering a simple strategy for advancing aggregation removal technology in the field of wastewater treatment.

         <title>Soluble Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Lithiophilic Modulator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two new COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile solution processing technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries, which can be utilized as artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase to protect lithium metal anode. Highly improved cycling performance of 5000&#8197;h cycling for symmetric cell and up to 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500 cycles for LiFePO4 full&#8208;cell are achieved.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as the potential alternative of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, severe instability and safety problems caused by the dendrite growth and inevitable side reactions have hindered the commercialization of LMBs. To solve them, in this contribution, a design strategy of soluble lithiophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is proposed. By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile coating technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries. Furthermore, when coated on the lithium anode of LMB, both COFs can act as artificial solid electrolyte interphase to prevent dendrite growth thus enabling the long&#8208;term stability of the cells. Notably, the symmetric CityU&#8208;29@Li cell can work for more than 5000&#8197;h at a current density of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an areal capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A remarkable capacity retention of 78.9&#8201;% after 1500&#8197;cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of about 99.9&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;C can also be realized in CityU&#8208;29@Li||LiFePO4 full cell. This work could provide a universal design strategy for soluble COFs and enlighten their application in diverse scenarios, especially energy&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanobiohybrids for High&#8208;Performance Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis via Multi&#8208;Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

We developed an innovative nanobiohybrid design strategy using eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn) through multi&#8208;interface engineering. The resulting Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b)&#8208;EGaIn nanobiohybrids enabled high&#8208;performance solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis by enhancing proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms. This study paves the way for sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Nanobiohybrids for solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis present a promising solution to the global energy crisis. However, conventional semiconductor&#8208;based nanobiohybrids face challenges such as limited tunability and poor biocompatibility, leading to undesirable spontaneous electron and proton transfer that compromise their structural stability and CH4 selectivity. Herein, we introduced eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn), featuring a self&#8208;limiting surface oxide layer surrounding the liquid metal core after sonication, integrated with Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b). The well&#8208;designed M. b&#8211;EGaIn nanobiohybrids exhibited superior performance, achieving a maximum CH4 yield of 455.64&#177;15.99&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1, long&#8208;term stability across four successive 7&#8208;day cycles, and remarkable CH4 selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. These improvements stem from enhanced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms at the core&#8211;shell interface, further facilitated by the elevated expression of hydrogenases at the abiotic&#8211;biotic interface. This study provides an insightful concept for nanobiohybrid design through multi&#8208;interface engineering, advancing sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation by Synergistic Incorporation of Pure Silica Silicalite&#8208;1 Zeolite and CeO2 into Cu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy to active Cu centers by synergistically incorporating S1 and CeO2 into the catalytic matrix. S1 stabilizes small&#8208;sized CeO2 and thus enhances the synergistic interaction between Cu and CeO2. This promotes the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and Cu+ sites at the interface, achieving a simultaneous increase in selectivity and activity.







Abstract
Chemical conversion of CO2 is providing an opportunity to mitigate the global warming induced by the overconsumption of fossil fuel. Cu has been regarded as one of the most powerful contenders in catalyzing CO2 conversion, yet the precise manipulation of its surface state and the nearby chemical environment continues to pose a formidable challenge. In this work, we report a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst by utilizing CeO2 and pure silicon zeolite (S1) to co&#8208;activate Cu species. In CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (CTM) conversion, the space&#8208;time yield of methanol (STYMeOH) of the obtained CuCe/S1 catalysts reaches 87.23&#8197;g&#8201;kgCu&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which represents a fivefold increase compared to that of the Cu/CeO2 catalysts. The following mechanistic investigations reveal that S1 serves as a pivotal stabilizer for the small&#8208;sized CeO2 particles, thereby significantly enhancing the synergistic interaction between Cu species and CeO2. The crafted interaface possesses abundant oxygen vacancies and a high content of Cu+, significantly enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and inhibiting the formation of CO. Our discovery presents a promising new direction for catalyst upgrading and performance enhancement for CTM processes in the foreseeable future.

The following mechanistic investigations reveal that S1 serves as a pivotal stabilizer for the small-sized CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles, thereby significantly enhancing the synergistic interaction between Cu species and CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The crafted interaface possesses abundant oxygen vacancies and a high content of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly enhancing the adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inhibiting the formation of CO. Our discovery presents a promising new direction for catalyst upgrading and performance enhancement for CTM processes in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple Protophilic Redox&#8208;Active Sites in Reticular Organic Skeletons for Superior Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>

Intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer expose consecutive electron delocalization route to fully access build&#8208;in ultralow&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier protophilic carbonyls for superior proton storage. A 5 e&#8722; high&#8208;kinetics H+&#8208;coupled mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and ultralong life (60,000&#8197;cycles).







Abstract
Protons (H+) with the smallest size and fastest redox kinetics are regarded as competitive charge carriers in the booming Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Developing new H+&#8208;storage organic cathode materials with multiple ultralow&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier protophilic sites and super electron delocalization routes to propel superior ZOBs is crucial but still challenging. Here we design multiple protophilic redox&#8208;active reticular organic skeletons (ROSs) for activating better proton storage, triggered by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol nanofibrous polymer. ROSs expose reticular electron delocalization geometries to fully access build&#8208;in protophilic carbonyl sites and promote ultrarapid H+ migration with an ultralow activation energy (0.13 vs. 0.29&#8197;eV of Zn2+ ions), thus delivering high capacity (359&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and large&#8208;current survivability (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, the extended interconnected reticular structures strengthen the anti&#8208;dissolution of ROSs in aqueous electrolytes, affording long&#8208;lasting proton&#8208;storage activity in ZOBs to a superior level (60,000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Systematic studies identify the source of excellent charge storage as high&#8208;kinetics H+&#8208;coupled five&#8208;electron redox process of carbonyl motifs in superstable ROSs. These findings can be of importance for evoking superior proton activity in multiple redox organics to build advanced Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

         <title>Prescribing DNA Origami Barrel&#8208;Directed Subtractive Patterning of Nanoparticles for Crystalline Superstructure Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using DNA origami barrels, we demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy to create tunable regiospecific patches on gold nanospheres. This enables the assembly of multidimensional superstructures, such as a graphane&#8208;like bilayered lattice, and provides a geometrical model for reverse engineering assembly symmetries. This approach advances nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties for photonic and electronic applications.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range ordered lattices formed by the directed arrangement of colloidal particles hold significant promise for applications such as photonic crystals, plasmonic metamaterials, and semiconductor electronics. Harnessing regioselective interactions through DNA&#8208;mediated assembly is a promising approach to advancing colloidal assembly. Despite efforts to engineer microscale patchy particles using sequence&#8208;specific binding properties of DNA, the control of patch formation on nanoscale isotropic spherical nanoparticles remains challenging. We demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy using barrel&#8208;shaped DNA origami (DNA barrel) to selectively block surfaces of DNA&#8208;coated gold nanospheres and create regiospecific patches. By designing binding positions and geometric parameters of DNA barrels, we can achieve controlled accessibility to nanosphere surfaces, forming patchy nanoparticles with tunable patch numbers and sizes. This strategy enables the construction of multidimensional superstructures with well&#8208;defined stereo relationships, represented by an unprecedented graphane&#8208;like bilayered superlattice. Furthermore, we developed a geometrical model that accounts for anisotropic particle bonding and steric hindrance, elucidating the relationship between architectural outcomes and the structural parameters of DNA&#8208;barrel&#8208;directed patchy nanoparticles, and enabling reverse engineering designs of potential assembly symmetries. This approach opens new avenues for generating nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties.

         <title>Synergizing Mg Single Atoms and Ru Nanoclusters for Boosting the Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis to Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube, was constructed to boost the catalytic performance of Ru catalysts. Mg atoms beneath Ru built an enhanced interfacial electronic metal&#8208;support interaction. Mg SACs adjacent to Ru aided H2O adsorption and activation. The synergistic Mg SACs and Ru nanoclusters promises an excellent catalytic performance for ammonia borane hydrolysis to produce H2.







Abstract
Development of efficient catalysts with high H2O molecule activation ability holds great importance for H2 production. Herein, enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (BNC), was constructed as a high&#8208;performance support for ruthenium (Ru) nano&#8208;clusters. Dual functions of Mg SACs were discovered, where the Mg atoms beneath Ru catalysts built an interfacial electron polarization, inducing electron transfer from Ru to the Mg&#8208;BNC support. In addition, the oxyphilic Mg SACs adjacent to the Ru catalysts could actively participate in H2O adsorption. The combination of experimental characterization, reaction kinetics study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations validated a stronger intrinsic H2O activation capability at the positive Ru sites. Meanwhile, the synergistic Mg SACs jointly contribute to the acceleration of the sluggish H2O dissociation process in ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis reaction, resulting in exceptional hydrogen production activity and catalytic stability, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides a new strategy for utilizing alkaline earth metals as both the electronic promoter and the reactant activator, offering inspiration for the development of advanced heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of a Dual Activatable DNAzyme Sensor in the Cavity of a DNA Nanocage for Logic&#8208;Gated Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through spatially&#8208;controlled encapsulation of a dual&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor within the cavity of a DNA nanocage, a smart nanosensor is presented for correlated imaging of microRNA and metal ions. The cavity of nanocages is accessible to the dual targets, while the confinement effect can provide steric protection of the DNAzyme probe, leading to improved bio&#8208;stability and imaging precision.







Abstract
Despite intense interest in design of DNAzyme sensors for molecular detection and imaging in living cells, their intracellular applications are still hampered by limited spatial control and poor bio&#8208;stability. Here we present controlled spatial confinement of a rationally designed, microRNA (miRNA)&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor probe (mDz) within the cavity of DNA nanocage, enabling efficient intracellular delivery with improved bio&#8208;stability for AND&#8208;gate molecular imaging. The mDz that possesses inactive DNAzyme activity is designed by the introduction of a blocking DNA strand, while miR&#8208;21 mediated strand displacement reaction allows for the formation of an intact DNAzyme structure for metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated catalytic reaction. Furthermore, the DNA nanocage serves as a nanocarrier for intracellular delivery of mDz, in which the cavity is accessible to the dual targets for logic&#8208;gated molecular imaging, while the confinement effect can provide steric protection of mDz by obstructing nuclease from entering the cavity of the DNA nanocage, resulting in enhanced bio&#8208;stability and improved molecular imaging precision. This strategy paves a way for the engineering of activatable DNA nanosensors with both self&#8208;delivery and self&#8208;protection capabilities to detect diverse intracellular targets.

This strategy paves a way for the engineering of activatable DNA nanosensors with both self-delivery and self-protection capabilities to detect diverse intracellular targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Interface Engineering with Large &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules Enables Durable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A representative large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule, bilirubin, is grafted onto multi&#8208;faceted Zn substrates to induce interfacial charge redistribution, elevate the Zn d&#8208;band center, and enhance H+ fixation at the Zn/electrolyte interface. This strategy effectively suppresses Zn dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
Undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions at the electrical double layer (EDL) of Zn/electrolyte interface are critical challenges limiting the performance of aqueous zinc ion batteries. Through density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that grafting large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules (e.g. bilirubin, biliverdin, lumirubin, and hemoglobin) onto Zn surface induces preferential adsorption on non&#8208;(002) facets, leading to interfacial charge redistribution, upshifted Zn d&#8208;band center, and enhanced H+ fixation capability. Among these, bilirubin (BR) is identified as the most effective, preferentially adsorbing onto non&#8208;Zn(002) facets to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction and promote Zn(002) planar growth during plating. This approach results in average Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 4000 cycles in Zn||BR&#8208;1@Cu cells and prolonged lifespan exceeding 1600&#8197;h in BR&#8208;1@Zn||BR&#8208;1@Zn cells at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Even under harsh conditions of 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, BR&#8208;1@Zn||BR&#8208;1@Zn cell maintains a lifespan of over 400&#8197;h. Furthermore, BR&#8208;1@Zn||MnO2 and BR&#8208;1@Zn||NVO full cells achieve 76.4&#8201;% and 86.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 800 and 1400 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A g&#8722;1, respectively. This study underscores the importance of grafting large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules to allow selective Zn(002) exposure, Zn d&#8208;band center upshift, and EDL structure regulation, paving the way towards durable Zn anodes.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Amino Acid Crystals with Enhanced Piezoelectric Performance for Biodegradable Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy was developed to enhance the piezoelectric responses of amino acid crystals by altering their molecular dipole moment, energy band gap and charge mobility. This method significantly improved the piezoelectric coefficients, reaching 50.36&#8197;pm/V. The resulting biodegradable and implantable force sensors exhibited high sensitivity and stability, making them ideal for long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring of physiological force signals.







Abstract
Amino acid crystals have emerged as promising piezoelectric materials for biodegradable and biocompatible sensors; however, their relatively low piezoelectric coefficients constrain practical applications. Here, we introduce a fluoro&#8208;substitution strategy to overcome this limitation and enhance the piezoelectric performance of amino acid crystals. Specifically, we substituted hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings of L&#8208;tryptophan, L&#8208;phenylalanine, and N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine with fluorine, resulting in significantly elevated piezoelectric coefficients. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that fluorination strengthens polarization by modifying molecular dipole moments. Consequently, these fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals achieve piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.36&#8197;pm/V, surpassing those of other organic piezoelectric materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA), and gelatin. When integrated into flexible, biodegradable force sensors, the fluoro&#8208;substituted crystals exhibit a broad sensing range, high sensitivity, and stable in vivo operation over extended periods. This work establishes a versatile route for boosting piezoelectricity in biomaterials, thereby broadening their scope in biomedical applications.

         <title>Synergizing Interfacial Electric Field Regulation and In situ Robust Interphases for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries at High Currents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unstable cycling of lithium metal anode at high currents has hindered the viability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we report a novel fluorocarbon additive, containing iodine, nitrogen, and fluorine elements, to regulate the interfacial electric field and promote the formation of mechanically robust and ionically conductive electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, leading to remarkable electrochemical performances at high current conditions.







Abstract
Efficient cycling of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) under extremely high current conditions is critical for their practical applications. Here, we report a novel additive containing fluorine, nitrogen, and iodine elements (designated as FCS) to stabilize Li metal anodes in glyme&#8208;based ether electrolytes under high current conditions. Experimental results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the cation of FCS selectively adsorbs on the electrode surface, optimizing the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) structure and effectively regulating the surface electric field, thereby promoting homogeneous Li deposition. Simultaneously, the preferential decomposition of the FCS produces a mechanically robust and ionically conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) comprising LiF, Li3N, and LiI components. Consequently, with the FCS additive, Li||Cu cells demonstrate a remarkably average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.12&#8201;% at an extremely high current of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 400 cycles. Additionally, Li||SPAN cells maintain a reversible capacity of 1126&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. This work presents a new approach to simultaneously tune the Helmholtz plane and SEI using trace amounts of additive, paving the way for stable and efficient LMBs under high&#8208;current conditions.

The study reveals that the photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (OWS) via a direct LCCT pathway surpassed that of an indirect LCCT pathway. The direct LCCT mechanism is pivotal in maximizing photon utilization efficiency and ensuring broad&#8208;spectrum OWS.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Tandem Catalysis for Plastic Depolymerization: In Situ Hydrogen Generation via Methanol APR for Sustainable PE Hydrogenolysis (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 15/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene waste undergoes hydrogenolysis using in situ hydrogen from methanol aqueous phase reforming (APR) over a Ru&#8211;Pt/TiO2 catalyst, achieving 85.1% conversion with 81.0% selectivity for liquid fuels and lubricants. Pt enhances APR&#8208;driven H2 generation, while Ru facilitates C&#9472;C cleavage in polyethylene. Isotope labeling confirms methanol&#8208;derived hydrogen utilization. This approach provides a sustainable alternative to fossil&#8208;derived hydrogen, as reported by Insoo Ro et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202420748).

         <title>Synergistic Cancer Photoimmunotherapy by Harnessing Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Activated Nanoparticles Containing Charge Transfer Complexes</title>

C. Wang et&#8197;al. recently developed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;activated charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanoparticle with donor&#8208; acceptor (D&#8211;A) units, which enhances photothermal conversion and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) synergistically combines photothermal and photodynamic therapies (PTT/PDT). Preclinical experiments have shown a strong immunotherapeutic effect by integrating programmed cell death protein 1 antibody combination therapy. While the use of D&#8211;A units in nanosystems for photoimmunotherapy is still emerging, it holds great potential to revolutionize cancer treatment.







Abstract
Phototherapy&#8212;which includes photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;has evoked interest as a promising cancer treatment modality on account of its noninvasiveness, spatiotemporal precision, and minimal side effects. C. Wang et&#8197;al. recently reported a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;activated charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanoparticle which consists of a donor (D) and an acceptor (A). Experimental results have demonstrated a potent immunotherapeutic effect of integrating programmed cell death protein 1 antibody combination therapy in preclinical models. Incorporating D&#8211;A interactions into nanosystems for photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is still a novel approach. This approach offers a multifaceted strategy for synergistic cancer PIT which holds promising potential to transform cancer treatment paradigms.

         <title>Activatable Photosensitizers: From Fundamental Principles to Advanced Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic concepts of designing activatable photosensitizers are established in this Review by closely examining quenching mechanisms and bioresponsive constructs essential for their function. New strategies developed in the last five years that address the shortcomings of conventional activatable photosensitizers and which enhance selectivity are also summarized.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment that uses light to excite photosensitizers in target tissue, producing reactive oxygen species and localized cell death. It is recognized as a minimally invasive, clinically approved cancer therapy with additional preclinical applications in arthritis, atherosclerosis, and infection control. A hallmark of ideal PDT is delivering disease&#8208;specific cytotoxicity while sparing healthy tissue. However, conventional photosensitizers often suffer from non&#8208;specific photoactivation, causing off&#8208;target toxicity. Activatable photosensitizers (aPS) have emerged as more precise alternatives, offering controlled activation. Unlike traditional photosensitizers, they remain inert and photoinactive during circulation and off&#8208;target accumulation, minimizing collateral damage. These photosensitizers are designed to &#8220;turn on&#8221; in response to disease&#8208;specific biostimuli, enhancing therapeutic selectivity and reducing off&#8208;target effects. This review explores the principles of aPS, including quenching mechanisms stemming from activatable fluorescent probes and applied to activatable photosensitizers (RET, PeT, ICT, ACQ, AIE), as well as pathological biostimuli (pH, enzymes, redox conditions, cellular internalization), and bioresponsive constructs enabling quenching and activation. We also provide a critical assessment of unresolved challenges in aPS development, including limitations in targeting precision, selectivity under real&#8208;world conditions, and potential solutions to persistent issues (dual&#8208;lock, targeting moieties, biorthogonal chemistry and artificial receptors). Additionally, it provides an in&#8208;depth discussion of essential research design considerations needed to develop translationally relevant aPS with improved therapeutic outcomes and specificity.

         <title>Overcoming Boundaries: Towards the Ambient Aqueous Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The traditional solvothermal method, often requiring harsh conditions, has limited the large&#8208;scale synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advances in the aqueous synthesis of COFs. It also presents the limitations and future perspectives of the aqueous synthesis methods.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has traditionally been carried out under strict solvothermal and anaerobic conditions. The utilization of organic solvents in such reactions not only carries significant costs but also imposes a great burden on the environment. The fabrication of COFs using alternative synthetic pathways has, therefore, seen rapid development in recent years and much attention has been placed on green and sustainable methods in particular. The synthesis of COFs in purely aqueous media, however, remains challenging due to the delicate nature of the chemical reactions and the crystallization process in water. This mini&#8208;review discusses different synthetic strategies for the construction of crystalline COFs in aqueous media and offers a perspective on the future development of facile COF synthesis in ambient conditions.

         <title>Photoexcited Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Halogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent surge of photoinitiated transition&#8208;metal catalysis has provided a novel gateway to access carbo&#8208;heteroatom bonds and molecular space that was not been previously attainable. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds has sought out new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and limiting stoichiometric additives. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition&#8208;metal photocatalyzed carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, hoping to expand the synthesis toolkit for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has proven useful in facilitating carbon&#8208;halogen (C&#8722;X) bond formation. Despite the vast number of methodologies reported to furnish these bonds, limitations have remained, warranting continued development. The recent surge of metallaphotoredox&#8208;based transformations has provided a novel gateway to bypass these limitations. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds arise through new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and stoichiometric additives. The discovery of this novel strategy has provided access to molecular space that has not been previously attainable. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition&#8208;metal photocatalyzed C&#8722;X bond formation, in hopes of easing the synthetic endeavours for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.

         <title>An Amorphous Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer with Both High Charge Carrier Mobility and Luminescence Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design and synthesis of a novel donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymer, TTIF&#8208;BT, which exhibits both high charge carrier mobility and luminescence quantum efficiency. With a &#934;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#956; value of approximately 0.084&#8197;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and enhanced interchain&#8208;mediated emissions compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconducting polymer IDT&#8208;BT, TTIF&#8208;BT demonstrates significant potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Organic semiconducting polymers play a pivotal role in the development of field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, structural versatility, and solution processability. However, achieving polymers with both high charge carrier mobility (&#956;) and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;) remains a challenge. In this work, we present the design and synthesis of a novel donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, TTIF&#8208;BT, featuring a di&#8208;Thioeno[3,2&#8208;b] ThioenoIndeno[1,2&#8208;b] Fluorene (TTIF) backbone as the donor component. TTIF&#8208;BT exhibits comparable hole mobility and enhanced interchain&#8208;mediated emissions compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconducting IDT&#8208;BT, leading to a remarkable &#934;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#956; value of ~0.084&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Through time&#8208;resolved absorption and PL techniques, we propose a model to extract the spectral weight of interchain&#8208;mediated emissions, yielding 62&#8201;% in TTIF&#8208;BT. Our results introduce a high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer, which has potential use in next&#8208;generation organic optoelectronic devices, including electrically&#8208;driven polymer lasers and active&#8208;matrix display technologies.

         <title>Renewable Terephthalates and Aromatic Diisocyanates from Galactose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates is presented using a transition metal&#8208;free route through a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization on gram scale. Terephthalates were readily converted into aromatic diisocyanates in flow and used to synthesize 100&#8201;% renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes.







Abstract
Aromatic diisocyanates, invaluable commodity chemicals for polymer manufacturing, are produced annually on megaton scales from petroleum&#8208;derived diamines via phosgenation. Existing routes toward renewable alternatives are sparse and limited by access to functionalized aromatic starting materials, such as terephthalates. Herein, we report the development of a robust route to renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates from D&#8208;galactose via Eastwood olefination and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, followed by a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization. This process was developed and applied on gram&#8208;scale to synthesize terephthalates, which were transformed into aromatic diisocyanates via Curtius rearrangement in flow. We demonstrate gram&#8208;scale preparation of 1,4&#8208;phenylene diisocyanate and 2,5&#8208;toluene diisocyanate and formulation of these monomers to prepare fully renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes.

     alt="Renewable Terephthalates and Aromatic Diisocyanates from Galactose"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation of renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates is presented using a transition metal-free route through a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization on gram scale. Terephthalates were readily converted into aromatic diisocyanates in flow and used to synthesize 100&#8201;% renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatic diisocyanates, invaluable commodity chemicals for polymer manufacturing, are produced annually on megaton scales from petroleum-derived diamines via phosgenation. Existing routes toward renewable alternatives are sparse and limited by access to functionalized aromatic starting materials, such as terephthalates. Herein, we report the development of a robust route to renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates from D-galactose via Eastwood olefination and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, followed by a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization. This process was developed and applied on gram-scale to synthesize terephthalates, which were transformed into aromatic diisocyanates via Curtius rearrangement in flow. We demonstrate gram-scale preparation of 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate and 2,5-toluene diisocyanate and formulation of these monomers to prepare fully renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes. Preparation of these renewable aromatic diisocyanates proceeds without the use of high-pressure gases or costly transition-metals and represents a novel route to fully renewable aromatic diisocyanates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Amino Group Transfer Reactions Mediated by Photoinduced Nitrene Formation from Rhodium&#8208;Hydroxamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the photoinduced generation of Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoids and their catalytic nitrene transfer reactivity using thermally stable, yet photoactive Rh&#8208;hydroxamate. Combined EPR, mass, and DFT studies suggested that Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid species could be furnished via the photoactivation of Rh&#8208;hydroxamates. Further catalytic amidation reactivity of hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to form new C&#8722;N, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds was explored.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic platform to access transient nitrenoids by designing photo&#8208;responsive neutral rhodium&#8208;hydroxamate complexes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and mass spectrometric analysis, suggest that electrophilic Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid intermediates could be generated via photoactivation of corresponding Rh&#8208;hydroxamates via N&#8208;O bond homolysis and redox event. Moreover, catalytic acylnitrenoid transfer was explored toward the amidation of various hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to furnish new N&#8722;C, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds.

         <title>Direct CO2 Activation and Conversion to Ethanol via Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to activate and convert CO2 in dissolved as well as gaseous form via reactive oxygen species was established. Within only 5&#8197;h reaction time at atmospheric conditions, room temperature a conversion efficiency of 92&#8201;% from CO2 to 12.2&#8197;mmol/L ethanol was achieved. Direct Air Capture experiments gave similar results, which showcases both the inherent flexibility of this method as well as its efficiency.







Abstract
The growing demand for energy and the excessive use of fossil fuels represents one of the main challenges for humanity. Storing solar energy in the form of chemical bonds to generate solar fuels or value&#8208;added chemicals without creating additional environmental burdens is a key requirement for a sustainable future. Here we use biomimetic artificial photosynthesis and present a dPCN&#8208;224(H) MOF&#8208;based photocatalytic system, which uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate and convert CO2 to ethanol under atmospheric conditions, at room temperature and in 2&#8211;5&#8197;h reaction time. The system provides a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion efficiency (CTE) of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, this method also allows the conversion of CO2 through direct air capture (DAC), making it a rapid and versatile method for both dissolved and gaseous CO2.

         <title>Charge Polarization Boosting Electrochemical Urea Synthesis by Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrite in Dilute Concentrations with a Unity Carbon Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual site catalyst Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C with single Fe atom and Cu NPs on N&#8208;doped carbon to enhance the coupling of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N) for urea synthesis. The Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high FEurea of 50.05&#8201;% with a flow cell at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized.







Abstract
Synthesis of urea through electrocatalytic coupling reaction of CO2 with nitrite (NO2&#8722;) represents a sustainable means to substitute the conventional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthetic protocol. The direct conversion of dilute NO2&#8722; in real wastewaters to urea with high efficiency is still a significant challenge, as C&#8208;intermediates tend to go through an extensive reduction achieving mostly C&#8208;containing productions due to the lack of N&#8208;intermediates, originating from slow diffusion rate of NO2&#8722;. Herein, we report the charge&#8208;polarized Fe&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Cu&#948;+ dual sites in metal/carbon heterojunction material (Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; solution (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N). The electron&#8208;rich single Fe atoms dispersed N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) restrain *CO desorption, and the electron&#8208;deficient Cu nanoparticles (Cu) promote the deep reduction of NO2&#8722; to *NH2. As a result, the obtained Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for urea of 50.05&#8201;% with a yield of 850.57&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in a flow cell. Moreover, Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized. The present results provide a valuable reference for the design of new catalysts for efficient synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds in dilute NO2&#8722; solution.

         <title>Halogenated Trityl Cations as Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Access Super Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 15, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the easy&#8208;to&#8208;access synthesis of the perfluorotrityl cation and the further functionalization of its para&#8208;fluorine atoms via halodefluorination using trimethylsilyl halides TMSX (X=Cl, Br). This enables the synthesis of equally reactive halogenated trityl derivatives, that can be handled at room&#8208;temperature. Their super&#8208;electrophilicity is demonstrated by hydride abstraction from the short&#8208;chain, linear alkanes n&#8208;pentane and n&#8208;butane.







Abstract
Herein, we present the easy&#8208;to&#8208;access synthesis of the perfluorotrityl cation (15F+) with commercial GaCl3 and the further functionalization of the para&#8208;fluorine atoms of 15F+ via halodefluorination using trimethylsilyl halides TMSX (X=Cl, Br). This gives access to equally reactive halogenated trityl derivatives (p&#8208;3Cl12F+ and p&#8208;3Br12F+), which can be handled at room temperature. The impact of the para&#8208;exchange on the electronic structure is determined by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Finally, the new synthons&#8242; high hydride ion affinities are demonstrated computationally and experimentally by hydride abstraction from the short&#8208;chain, linear alkanes n&#8208;pentane and n&#8208;butane.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present the easy-to-access synthesis of the perfluorotrityl cation (&lt;b&gt;15F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) with commercial GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the further functionalization of the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-fluorine atoms of &lt;b&gt;15F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; via halodefluorination using trimethylsilyl halides TMSX (X=Cl, Br). This gives access to equally reactive halogenated trityl derivatives (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-3Cl12F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-3Br12F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), which can be handled at room temperature. The impact of the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-exchange on the electronic structure is determined by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Finally, the new synthons&#8242; high hydride ion affinities are demonstrated computationally and experimentally by hydride abstraction from the short-chain, linear alkanes &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-pentane and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Signal Circuit for Self&#8208;Regulated Bidirectional Communication in Protocell&#8208;Living Cell Communities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing synthetic biology tools to control cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling can provide new capabilities to engineer cell&#8208;cell communication and program desired cellular behaviors. As cell mimics, abiotic protocells provide an attractive opportunity to modulate the intercellular communication with design&#8208;based regulatory features. Despite the chemical communication of protocells that interact with living cells have been demonstrated, the autonomous regulation of intercellular signal transmission in protocell/living cell community remains a critical challenge. Herein, we designed a DNA circuit consisting of a recognition module, activation module, and feedback module that enables protocells to self&#8208;regulate the interaction with living cells by sensing and responding to the signal released from living cells. The feedback module with renewable capability is capable of processing the signal transduction on the membrane surface of protocells and controlling intercellular adhesion. Once dissociated from living cells, the disengaged protocells allow the following interaction with multiple target living cells in succession. Overall, this work provides an avenue to control and program dynamic signal propagation in protocell/living cell community. The designed communication with living cells would open new ways to tune cellular behavior and apply them to cell&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Hopping Diffusion in Wiggling Nanopore Architecture of MOF Enabling Synergistic Equilibrium&#8208;Kinetic&#160;Separation of Fluorinated Propylene and Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of octafluoropropane (C3F8) from hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) is an industrially important yet challenging process due to their similar physicochemical properties&#160;and&#160;and stringent purity demands in industrial applications. Herein,&#160;we&#160;address this&#160;task&#160;through precise pore architecture in a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;PMA), which exhibits a unique&#160;&#8216;wiggling nanopores&#8217; with narrow windows and large cavities. The narrow windows act as diffusion barriers, selectively restricting C3F8&#160;transport, while the large cavities provide strong adsorption sites for C3F6, enabling an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation.&#160;This dual functionality results in a ~450&#8208;fold difference in diffusion rates and exceptional kinetic selectivity for C3F6&#160;over C3F8, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, time&#8208;resolved kinetics, and dynamic breakthrough experiments.&#160;Theoretical calculations&#160;coupled with in situ spectroscopy elucidate the pore geometry&#8208;dependent hopping diffusion mechanism&#160;responsible for the separation. This work establishes&#160;wiggling&#160;pore geometry as a&#160;versatile&#160;paradigm for&#160;advanced adsorbents targeting&#160;energy&#8208;efficient&#160;separations ofstructurally&#160;similar fluorocarbon mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries via Using I&#8208;&#8208;Based Active Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cathodes possess inherent structural diversity and fast redox kinetics, showing great application prospects in aqueous Zn batteries. Nevertheless, most of the reported organic cathodes display low average working voltage resulting in poor energy density. Herein, diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN)@CMK&#8208;3 composite is utilized as cathode for aqueous zinc battery, which combines the Zn2+ and H+ co&#8208;storage and I&#8208;/I0 conversion by introducing I&#8208;&#8208;based active additive into 0.5 M Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte. The in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ analyses and computational studies disclose that HATN@CMK&#8208;3 with C=N groups not only stores Zn2+ and H+ ions at low potential, but also acts as a substrate to promote the conversion reaction of I&#8208;/I0 at high potential. Accordingly, the Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 cell delivers a high average voltage of 0.75 V, prominent long&#8208;life (10000 cycles) and high energy density (198 Wh kg&#8208;1). Remarkably, under high mass&#8208;loading (10 mg cm&#8208;2) or low&#8208;temperature conditions, the cell still achieves decent capacity and cycle stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Circumtetracene: Unraveling Structure&#8208;Property Relationships of Circumacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circumacenes with unique electronic structures have garnered significant interest in both fundamental science and nanoelectronics. However, their synthesis and investigations into the structure&#8211;property relationships present considerable challenges. In this work, we report the successful synthesis and characterization of a stable circumtetracene derivative in crystalline form. For comparison, a new circumanthracene derivative was also prepared. The electronic properties of both compounds were systematically investigated using both various experimental techniques and DFT calculations. It was found that circumtetracene exhibits a dominant local aromatic nature with small open&#8208;shell diradical character, while circumanthracene displays a closed&#8208;shell global aromatic character. Both compounds show amphoteric redox behavior with narrow energy gaps. The dication of circumtetracene and the dianions of circumtetracene and circumanthracene can be obtained experimentally through chemical oxidation and reduction, all displaying intense NIR absorptions. Furthermore, the electronic properties of these derivatives were compared with those of previously reported circumacene analogues, revealing a transition in electronic structure from closed&#8208;shell global aromatic to singlet open&#8208;shell local aromatic configurations upon &#960;&#8208;extension. This work provides a comprehensive exploration of the structure&#8208;property relationships within the circumacene series, offering valuable insights for the design and synthesis of novel multizigzag&#8208;edged nanographenes with tunable electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Theory&#8208;guided Design of Surface&#8208;Enhanced Ni&#8208;Mn Diatomic Site Catalysts for Efficient Seawater Electrolysis via the Degradation of High Ionization Potential Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facing energy shortages and hard&#8208;to&#8208;degrade chemical pollution, especially high ionization potential (IP) organic pollutants, this study developed a novel photoelectrocatalyst, Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN, for degrading IP pollutants in seawater and generating hydrogen. Incorporating Ni&#8208;Mn dual atoms into an O&#8208;doped boron nitride (OBN) framework, Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN shows excellent stability and HER performance. Density functional theory (DFT)&#160;analysis revealed its low Gibbs free energy change (&#916;GH*&#160;= 0.03 eV) for the HER, outperforming Pt (111). Achieving an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 43.8 mV at 500 mA cm&#8315;&#178; under AM 1.5 G simulated light surpasses commercial Pt/C catalysts. High IP pollutants enhance hydrogen evolution rates, indicating a synergistic effect. Theoretical calculations elucidated the interplay between seawater electrolytes and high IP values on the photoelectrocatalytic performance. Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN demonstrated excellent stability and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 3.72%, offering a sustainable solution for marine pollution control and clean energy production.</dc:description>

Density functional theory (DFT)&#160;analysis revealed its low Gibbs free energy change (&#916;GH*&#160;= 0.03 eV) for the HER, outperforming Pt (111). Achieving an ultra-low overpotential of 43.8 mV at 500 mA cm&#8315;&#178; under AM 1.5 G simulated light surpasses commercial Pt/C catalysts. High IP pollutants enhance hydrogen evolution rates, indicating a synergistic effect. Theoretical calculations elucidated the interplay between seawater electrolytes and high IP values on the photoelectrocatalytic performance. Ni-Mn@OBN demonstrated excellent stability and a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 3.72%, offering a sustainable solution for marine pollution control and clean energy production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionized Water Facilitates the Sustainable Radical&#8208;Mediated Reduction of CO2 to Multi&#8208;Carbon Hydrocarbons and Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abiotic synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 and water under prebiotic conditions is a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in understanding the origins of life. Here we demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway for reducing CO2 to C1&#8210;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates driven solely by ultraviolet irradiation of water, mimicking early Earth environments. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), 17O/13C isotope labelling, and femtosecond transient absorption, we identify ionized water&#8208;derived radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) as the key redox mediators. e&#8315;aq acts as a super&#8208;reductant (&#8208;2.9 V) to activate CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables sequential hydrogenation. Critically, oxidative radicals (H2O&#8226;+ and &#8226;OH) recycle recalcitrant oxygenates (formate and oxalate) back into active CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a dynamic radical network. This process generates a diverse library of organic compounds, including methane, ethylene, and C6 dimethyl succinate, via radical assembly mechanisms spanning hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, self&#8208;coupling, and cross&#8208;coupling. By integrating experimental validation with prebiotic simulations (formate&#8208;mediated redox modulation), we resolve the paradox of inert CO2/H2 activation in primordial environments and establish water not merely as a solvent, but as a reactive matrix directing abiotic organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Octalenobisterphenylene&#160;1&#160;(also known as terphenylene dimer) was synthesized from 3,3',5,5'&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;substituted biaryl by&#160;tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization followed by oxidative coupling. This one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol facilitated the successive formation of four four&#8208;membered and two eight&#8208;membered rings. Treatment of&#160;1&#160;with sodium metal, followed by crystallization from THF, yielded the remarkable diradical dianion [(1&#183;&#8211;)2]2&#8208;, where the two molecular halves are connected by four &#963; bonds. The cyclodimerization is driven by the pronounced reactivity and strain of the central six&#8208;membered ring within the [3]phenylene subunit. The structure and diradical nature of [(Na+)2(1&#183;&#8211;)2] were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT computations, and&#160;1H NMR and ESR spectra.

         <title>Diacylation of Peptides Enables the Construction of Functional Vesicles for Drug&#8208;Carrying Liposomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here we show that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized functional vesicles. The use of integrin&#8208;binding peptide motifs as head groups enables the construction of drug&#8208;carrying liposomes that are specifically taken up by cells.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells by enzymatic diacylation of non&#8208;amphiphilic polar head groups. Analogous non&#8208;enzymatic processes may have been relevant at the origin of life and could have practical utility in membrane synthesis. However, aqueous head group diacylation is challenging in the absence of enzymes. The use of charged peptides instead of canonical phospholipid head groups offers advantages with respect to ease of acylation and chemical diversity. Here we demonstrate that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables in situ synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized vesicles resembling cellular membranes. Diacylation occurs between non&#8208;amphiphilic peptides possessing an N&#8208;terminal cysteine, and acyl thioesters. Peptide head groups endow unique membrane functions, which is demonstrated by incorporation of an arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) motif, resulting in vesicle targeting to &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. The biocompatibility and functional group programmability of D&#8208;ALPs supports their broad utility as membrane mimetics.

         <title>Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of PFAS emission abatement, this minireview addresses catalytic gas phase PFAS decomposition and the associated overarching challenges involving fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and reaction engineering. In addition, concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions are introduced.







Abstract
While the outstanding stability of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) paved the way for their widespread application in a huge variety of applications, it also resulted in their nickname &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221;. The rising awareness for PFAS&#8208;related environmental and health concerns drives a discussion on the most effective ways to abate PFAS emissions into the environment, i.e. water, soil, and air, and remediation of contaminated matter. In order to address the knowledge gap regarding air pollution by PFAS, this minireview summarizes the current corpus of work in the field and outlines how catalysis can contribute to PFAS abatement in the gas phase. Beyond a mere collection of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge, overarching challenges in catalytic PFAS removal are identified, spanning from fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, i.e. C&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation, to heterogeneous catalysis, i.e. surface reactions at the gas&#8208;solid interface, to reaction engineering, i.e. scaling relations and technical hurdles. In addition, the article introduces concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions.

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose Toward Propyl&#8208; or Propenyl&#8208;Substituted Monomers and Mechanistic Understanding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is a promising technology that can selectively extract lignin in biomass and depolymerize it. Here, we prepared one low Ru loading catalyst (Ru0.8/C) for RCF of biomass to selectively produce different lignin oil (both monomers and oligomers) under different reaction atmospheres. The yield of phenolic monomers reached 46.0wt.% (rich in 4&#8208;propylguaiacol and 4&#8208;propylsyringol) in the RCF of birch wood under high H2 pressure and using methanol as solvent. But, under N2 atmosphere the dominant monomers shifted to 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)guaiacol and 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)syringol (79.6% selectivity) with 35.8wt.% yield of total monomers using the same catalyst. The developed catalyst can also transform native lignin in other biomasses such as pine and corn stover. Mechanistic investigation using different model compounds and deuteration indicates that removal of the C&#947;&#8208;OH in methanol&#8208;extracted lignin fragments occurred before obtaining the monomeric lignin fragment, and the C&#945;&#8208;OH and &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds were then cleaved simultaneously to form 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl) substituted monomers. The results are distinct from the reported mechanism that the precursors of the propyl and prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl substituted monomers are monolignols with the removal of C&#947;&#8208;OH at the monomeric level. Thus, this work provided novel insights into the reaction pathway of (native) lignin depolymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Heterointerface Coupling for Durable Industrial&#8208;Level Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a ternary heterostructured catalyst, RuIrOx&#8208;CeO2, featuring a strong&#8208;coupled interface with both electronic and oxygen interaction, which effectively inhibits the active phase separation. The resultant catalyst expresses impressive activity in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers, and demonstrates a stable 2000&#8208;h operation at 5.0 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The industrial&#8208;level application of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) lies in the capacity of operating at high current density in order for higher power density and lower operational cost. However, it poses a significant challenge to the overall performance of catalysts. Heterointerface engineering has emerged as an ideal strategy for addressing the anodic intrinsic activity limitations. Nevertheless, due to the fragile interface structure with weak interactions between different components, it is difficult to maintain the high activity and long&#8208;term stability of heterostructured catalysts. Herein, we report a ternary heterostructured catalyst, RuIrOx&#8211;CeO2, featuring a strong&#8208;coupled interface between RuIrOx phase and CeO2 phase. This strong&#8208;coupled interface exhibits both electronic and oxygen interaction, which effectively inhibits the active phase separation. When applied in PEMWE (0.8 mgIr&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the anode and 0.4 mgPt&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the cathode), the resultant catalyst expresses impressive activity, achieving a current density of 3.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.75&#160;V in PEMWE and demonstrates a stable 2000&#8208;h operation at 5.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 with an imperceptible voltage degradation of &lt;1 &#181;V&#160;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Aromatic Lactones into Bioisosteres by Carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;Boranol Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioisosteric replacement is an important strategy in drug discovery and is commonly practiced in medicinal chemistry, however, the incorporation of bioisosteres typically requires laborious multistep de novo synthesis. The direct conversion of a functional group into its corresponding bioisostere is of particular significance in evaluating structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;exchange strategy that enables the direct conversion of aromatic lactones, a prevalent motif in bioactive molecules, into their corresponding cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate the synthetic value and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility of this strategy, while the application of this methodology to the rapid remodeling of chromenone cores in bioactive molecules highlights its utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Self&#8208;Fenton Reaction Mediated by Silver Single Atom and Cluster Photocatalysts for Highly Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen Toward Efficient Organic Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic pollutants in wastewater were efficiently removed by silver single&#8208;atom and cluster&#8208;doped ZnO (AgSA&#8211;AgC/ZnO) through the &#183;OOH&#8208;mediated in&#8208;situ H2O2 heterolytic cleavage pathway to highly selectively generate singlet oxygen (1O2) via a photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction system. The benzene ring&#8208;opening and dechlorination&#160;reactions via the 1O2 oxidation route at Ag&#8208;SA sites and the reactive H* reduction pathway at Ag&#8208;cluster sites, respectively, are proposed for the p&#8208;chlorophenol degradation. 








Abstract
The persistent organic pollutants in wastewater have caused a heavy threat to ecosystems and humans, but selective removal of these pollutants still faces challenges due to low efficiency, extra addition of oxidation agents, and many highly toxic intermediate products. Herein, we report an efficient, fast kinetic conversion via a photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like system of *OOH intermediate&#8208;involved oxidation pathway with a high selection generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from the novel in situ H2O2 heterolytic activation route for the first time. The single&#8208;atom and cluster&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AgSA&#8211;AgC/ZnO) was successfully synthesized to achieve the 100% degradation yield and 80% total of carbon (TOC) of the p&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP) as the typical pollutant under solar&#8208;light irradiation and exhibit long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;designed photo&#8208;Filter reactor for 4&#8208;CP degradation. It was attributed to the accelerated cycles from Aghigh&#948;+ site to Aglow&#948;+ site in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis, achieving the rapid selection conversion from the H2O2 heterolytic cleavage to &#8764;100% 1O2 via the intermediate *OOH at the Ag SA sites for ring&#8208;opening reaction and reactive H* at the Ag clusters sites for dechlorination reaction, respectively. This discovery gives the deep understanding of the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction through in situ cycles of variable metals for the organic contaminants treatment.

         <title>Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization in Both Polar and Non&#8208;Polar Solvents via Heteroatom&#8208;Driven Amphiphilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular designs to achieve supramolecular polymerization in non&#8208;polar and polar solvents are typically orthogonal. Here, we present a new molecular design to achieve cooperative supramolecular polymerization in both non&#8208;polar and polar solvents using phenazine bisamide in which the nitrogen atoms can interact with polar solvents. This study opens up azaacenes as a new class of molecules for supramolecular polymerization in various solvents.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers in water and non&#8208;polar solvents are extensively studied as model systems to mimic biological processes and as functional materials, respectively. The molecular designs to obtain supramolecular polymers in non&#8208;polar and polar solvents are typically orthogonal. Here, we disclose a molecular design in which we combine hydrogen&#8208;bonding amide units attached to alkyl chains for compatibility with non&#8208;polar solvents and heteroatom in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core for interaction with polar solvents, leading to supramolecular polymerization of the same monomeric unit in both non&#8208;polar and mixture of polar solvents. Redox&#8208;active phenazine appended with two amide groups was studied as a model monomeric unit and it undergoes cooperative polymerization via intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding resulting in one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures with co&#8208;facial type packing in non&#8208;polar solvents. Whereas, in a mixture of polar solvents, a J&#8208;type packing was observed with tunable morphology from globular to 1D nanostructures based on the polarity of the cosolvent used. Further, solvent isotopic substitution studies suggest that the amphiphilicity of the system can be attributed to the nitrogen&#8208;atom in phenazine, which is capable of interacting with polar solvent molecules. Thus, this study opens up azaacenes as a new class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units for functional supramolecular polymers.

         <title>Mn(II)&#8208;Based Hybrid Halide Ionogel Scintillator Film for Large&#8208;Area and High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized ionogels have attracted significant attention in chemical design of new materials and versatile applications, which are formed by polymer network as a matrix with introducing ionic liquids containing characteristic units as a dispersion medium. Here, we present an universal scheme to rapidly synthesize luminescent ionogels through the in&#8208;situ formation of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during the polymerization of monomer. In particular, Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#8208;IG) were formed by incorporating [C20H20P]+ cations and [MnBr4]2&#8208; anions into the polymer network structure. Thanks to the amorphous nature of Mn&#8208;IG and the homogeneous distribution of self&#8208;trapped [MnBr4]2&#8208; light&#8208;emitting units with [C20H20P]+ cations, Mn&#8208;IG exhibits high transparency (nearly 90% transmittance at 550 nm&#8208;1100 nm) and homogeneous highly&#8208;efficient emission. Taking advantage of its processability, we fabricate an 18 cm &#215; 12 cm scintillation film and successfully realize large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. The straightforward and rapid synthesis method on such ionogels paves the way for the low&#8208;process&#8208;demand preparation of large&#8208;area scintillators, and also opens up new routes for the in&#8208;situ construction of uniform 0D metal halide polymer composites.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Ultraviolet Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Employing a Double Boron&#8211;Oxygen&#8211;Nitrogen&#8208;Based Emitter</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel double boron&#8211;oxygen&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (dBON&#8208;PAH) emitter has been developed that shows ultraviolet emission with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) properties. A doped OLED exhibited a high color purity and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (&#955;EL&#160;=&#160;399&#160;nm, FWHM&#160;=&#160;37&#160;nm, CIEy&#160;=&#160;0.030, and EQEmax&#160;=&#160;18.6%), demonstrating a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for HLCT&#8208;based UV OLEDs with CIEy &lt;&#160;0.05.








Abstract
Designing high&#8208;efficiency ultraviolet organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV OLEDs) remains challenging due to the need for efficient utilization of triplet excitons while maintaining a wide bandgap. In this study, we designed double boron&#8211;oxygen&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (dBON&#8208;PAHs) with rigid planar structures and developed a novel UV emitter, BO&#8208;N, featuring hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) properties. BO&#8208;N exhibited UV emission in toluene solution and 1,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene (mCP) film, with photoluminescence (PL) peaks of 391 and 400&#160;nm and narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 15 and 34&#160;nm, respectively. The device doped with 5 wt% BO&#8208;N achieved a narrowband UV emission with an FWHM of 37&#160;nm, an electroluminescence peak (&#955;EL) of 399&#160;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.166, 0.030). Moreover, the device attained a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 18.6% among reported HLCT&#8208;based UV OLEDs with CIEy &lt;&#160;0.05. These findings highlight the great potential of double BON&#8208;PAHs as robust emitters for high&#8208;performance UV OLEDs.

         <title>Understanding and Tuning Singlet&#8211;Triplet (S1&#8211;T1) Energy Gaps in Planar Organic Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new framework for tuning singlet&#8211;triplet (S1&#8211;T1) gaps based on electrostatic interactions of the transition density is developed. Three widely applicable design rules for maximizing the singlet&#8211;triplet gap are derived: minimizing the number of electrons, localizing the excitation, and optimizing through&#8208;space interactions.








Abstract
Molecules with large gaps between their first singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) are key components of various modern technologies, most prominently singlet fission photovoltaics and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC). The design of these molecules is hampered by the fact that only limited rules for maximizing &#916;EST exist, other than increasing the overlap between the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO). Here we suggest a new strategy for tuning and maximizing &#916;EST based on a detailed analysis of the underlying quantum mechanical energy terms. We present a model based on the transition density and derive three straightforward design rules: &#916;EST values can be maximized by (i) minimizing the overall number of &#960;&#8208;electrons, (ii) reducing delocalization, and (iii) optimizing specific geometric interactions. The validity of these rules is first exemplified for a set of 18 hydrocarbon backbones before proceeding to a varied set of dye molecules, highlighting their transferability to realistic settings. We believe that the developed rules will provide an enormous boost to the field, enabling rational design instead of trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of going beyond the FMO approximation in designing advanced molecular materials.

         <title>Hydrogenation of &#8220;Readily Activated Molecule&#8221; for Glycine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By recognizing the unique characteristics of the glyoxylate oxime intermediate, we introduce a brand&#8208;new concept of &#8220;readily activated molecule&#8221;, which empowers Ag as the ideal catalyst for glycine electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of glyoxylate oxime is the energy&#8208;intensive step in glycine electrosynthesis. To date, there has been a lack of rational guidance for catalyst design specific to this step, and the unique characteristics of the oxime molecule have often been overlooked. In this study, we initiate a theoretical framework to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of glycine electrosynthesis across typical transition metals. By comprehensively analyzing the competitive reactions, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes, and desorption steps, we identify the unique role of the glyoxylate oxime as a &#8220;readily activated molecule&#8221;. This inherent property positions Ag, featuring weak adsorption characteristics, as the &#8220;dream&#8221; catalyst for glycine electrosynthesis. Notably, a record&#8208;low onset potential of &#8722;0.09&#160;V versus RHE and an impressive glycine production rate of 1327&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 are achieved when using an ultralight Ag foam electrode. This process enables gram&#8208;scale glycine production within 20 h and can be widely adapted for synthesizing diverse amino acids. Our findings underscore the vital significance of considering the inherent characteristics of reaction intermediates in catalyst design.

         <title>Supramolecular Gels as Active Tools for Reaction Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique combination of environments within gels, self&#8208;assembled from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators, offers the ability to control reactivity in new ways, achieving unique reaction outcomes, leading to the emerging concept of supramolecular gels as nanoreactors. Smart chemical engineering methods enable the use of such gels to fabricate materials and devices potentially capable of transforming the way synthesis is done.








Abstract
Supramolecular gels, assembled from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs), are fascinating soft materials for use in synthesis, combining aspects of hetero&#8208; and homogeneous systems. The unique combination of environments within a gel offers the ability to control reactivity in new ways. For example, self&#8208;assembly into a gel network can modify the reactivity of catalytic sites on the LMWG. Controlling the assembly of multiple LMWGs can result in integrated gels with orthogonal activities that could not normally coexist. Enzymes encapsulated within self&#8208;assembled gels can exhibit superactivity, extending their use into solvent media more appropriate for organic synthesis. Highly reactive species, such as ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles or moisture/air&#8208;sensitive organometallics, can be protected within the unique environment of a supramolecular gel, facilitating their use in ambient conditions, potentially opening up the use of such species to nonspecialist researchers. Beyond fundamental chemistry, performing reactions in gels leads to the emerging concept of gels as &#8220;nanoreactors&#8221;. Smart chemical engineering methods are enabling the fabrication of materials and devices for use in a variety of synthetic workflows, potentially transforming the way synthesis is done. In summary, this review provides an overview of key concepts and signposts the way toward future developments of gels as active tools for reaction engineering.

         <title>Tetranuclear Titanium Nitride Cluster: Dinitrogen Cleavage under Mild Conditions and Its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heating the readily available trinuclear Ti dinitrogen complex [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;1:&#8201;&#951;2:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] 1(Cp* = &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), originally reported by C. Y&#233;lamos and J. Jover, in benzene at 80 &#176;C leads to the cleavage of N&#8801;N bond, forming a tetranuclear titanium nitride cluster [{TiCp*}4Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;N)2] 2. The structure of 2 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Kinetics study and DFT calculations indicate that the energy barrier for the NN bond cleavage in the transformation from 1 to 2 is about 26 kcal/mol.

The structure of 2 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Kinetics study and DFT calculations indicate that the energy barrier for the NN bond cleavage in the transformation from 1 to 2 is about 26 kcal/mol.

         <title>Revealing Transition State Stabilization in Organocatalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Using Data Science</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging a tree&#8208;based learning model, a library of thiourea catalysts were screened with varied substituent electronic characteristics and positions. SHAP analysis reveals the key noncovalent interactions responsible in the transition state, leading to improvement of reactivity without compromising selectivity in organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization.








Abstract
In nature, enzymes leverage constituent amino acid residues to create catalytically active sites to effect high reactivity and selectivity. Multicomponent host&#8211;guest assemblies have been exploited to mimic enzymatic microenvironments by pre&#8208;organizing a network of noncovalent interactions. While organocatalysts such as thioureas have gained widespread success in organic transformation and controlled polymerization, evaluation of the participating structural features in the transition state (TS) remains challenging. Herein, we report the use of data science tools, i.e., a decision&#8208;tree&#8208;based machine&#8208;learning algorithm and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, to model reactivity and regioselectivity in a thiourea&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes. Variation of aryl substituent position and electronic characteristics reveals key catalyst features involved in the TS. The analysis of feature importance helps explain the reason behind the optimal performance of (pseudo)halogen&#8208;substituted catalysts. Furthermore, the structural basis for the unveiled reactivity&#8208;regioselectivity trade&#8208;off in the catalysis are established.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Rare&#8208;Earth Halide Glasses for Tunable Multicolor X&#8208;ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based all&#8208;inorganic glass&#8208;ceramics have exhibited an important role in the field of optoelectronics. However, the research of organo&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth halide glass which can be produced at low temperatures is still in the blank stage. In this paper, we report for the first time on novel amorphous organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based halide luminescent glasses, Bzmim3LnCl6 (Bzmim = 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium; Ln3+ = Tb3+, Eu3+), and realize tunable multicolor photoluminescence emission. By adjusting the ratio of Tb3+: Eu3+ within the Bzmim3LnCl6 glass, we have successfully induced controllable radioluminescence properties ranging from green to red under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Notably, these amorphous organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth glasses exhibit remarkable sensitivity to variations in X&#8208;ray dose, suggesting promising applications in the field of passive color visualization radiation detection. Furthermore, the Bzmim3TbCl6 glass demonstrates exceptional light transmittance greater than 85% across the 480&#8211;800 nm range, which results in superior spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging (&gt;25 lp mm&#8211;1). These findings not only provide a good example for the design and development of hybrid rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based halide glasses, but also hold great potential for applications in detection, sensing, illumination, and display technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Buffered Electron Shuttle of Ru/RuO2 with Switchable Active Sites Enables Robust and Efficient Bifunctional Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly&#8208;efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (OWS) is desirable, but it confronts long&#8208;term challenge in the local structural reconstruction&#160;of catalyst during the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). As inspired by the stable acid&#8208;base buffer system in human life, here we construct an electron buffer system to well address the key issue of structural reconstruction, in which the charge&#8208;buffered fullerene renders the Ru&#8208;based active species to be reversibly shuttled&#160;between Ru and RuO2&#160;during HER and OER. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Ru&#8208;RuO2/C60&#8208;x&#160;catalyst exhibits&#160;overpotentials of merely 7 and 194 mV at&#160;10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;for HER and OER in alkaline conditions, respectively. The photovoltaic&#8208;driven OWS device with&#160;a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 18.9% and&#160;an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) system with&#160;good robustness was fabricated&#160;based on Ru&#8208;RuO2/C60&#8208;x. It was unraveled by in&#8208;situ/operando&#160;spectroscopy and theoretical calculation that the significantly promoted performance of water electrolysis benefits from the fullerene&#8208;based electron shuttle effect on inhibition of structural reconstruction&#160;and electronic structural modulation of active sites&#160;as well as&#160;adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates. Our work may open an avenue to develop efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for promising industrial water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon and Oxygen Double Defects&#8208;Enhanced Ru&#8208;Based Catalyst for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partial coating of CeO2 enhances the stability of the catalyst and creates abundant CeO2&#8208;CNTs interfacial structures. Significant C&#9472;O interactions at these interfaces facilitate the formation of C and O double defect sites. These defects synergistically regulate electron transfer, NH3 adsorption, and product desorption, ultimately achieving remarkable enhancement in catalytic performance for ammonia decomposition.








Abstract
Although ammonia is widely recognized as one of the most promising candidates for hydrogen storage and transformation, the catalytic mechanisms involved in ammonia decomposition remain insufficiently understood, and the stability of catalysts continues to present significant challenges. In this study, Ru/CeO2&#8208;CNTs catalysts with double defect sites were synthesized by a straightforward method, achieving an outstanding hydrogen production rate of 2230&#160;mmol&#8722;1&#160;gRu&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1 at 500 &#176;C, outperforming most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the CeO2&#8208;CNTs interface promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) and carbon defects (Cd) through carbon&#8211;oxygen interactions. These defects enhance electron transfer from the support to Ru nanoparticles (NPs), modulate NH3 adsorption and activation and modulate the recombination and desorption of adsorbed N species (N*). Moreover, the coating of CeO2 significantly improved the stability of CNTs, which weakens undesired reactions under high&#8208;temperature and hydrogen&#8208;rich conditions. The study introduced a rational design strategy that enhances the multiple elementary stages of the NH3 decomposition by constructing double defect sites and offering new insights into the design of efficient and durable catalysts under harsh environments.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells via Multi&#8208;functionalized Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are promising candidates for mechanical photovoltaic applications due to their ease of preparation, lightweight, and portability. However, the weak interface connections, residual strain and the nonradiative recombination loss among adjacent layers are critical challenges that restrict f&#8208;PSCs development. To address these issues, a functionalized molecule with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors, 4&#8208;Carboxyphenylboronic acid (4&#8208;BBA), is designed in the perovskite precursor for modulating perovskite crystallization, which achieves uniform and stress&#8208;relaxation perovskite film and forms a robust bridging structure anchored at the buried interface. Theoretical calculation and experimental results show that the C=O group passivates Pb2+ with I&#8208; vacancy defect through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, reducing trap&#8208;assisted recombination. Furthermore, the designed 4&#8208;BBA is preferentially deposited at the buried layer interface between the perovskite and substrate, forming hydrogen bonds with the self&#8208;assembled monolayer via B&#8208;OH bonds, creating a mechanically stable bridge between the layers. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the champion f&#8208;PSC reached 25.30% (25.13% certified). And the f&#8208;PSC open&#8208;circuit voltage set a record of 1.21V. Importantly, the unencapsulated f&#8208;PSC using 4&#8208;BBA retains 95.3% of its original performance after 5000 cycles at a bending radius of 10 mm, demonstrating extraordinary bending stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Biofilm Scaffold for Structurally Adaptative Slippery Surfaces with Integrated Antifouling and Anti&#8208;Corrosion Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces are highly desirable to combat pervasive biofouling and corrosion in biological environments. However, existing strategies often suffer from slow binding kinetics and harsh fabrication conditions, hindering the concurrent integration of liquid repellency, universal adhesion, and robust flexibility. Herein, we report that it is possible to engineer microbial biofilms as eco&#8208;friendly, cohesive, and flexible materials for omniphobic slippery coatings fulfilling all these requirements. Unlike conventional synthetic slippery coatings requiring laborious surface pretreatments, biofilm sheets formed on demand assemble a durable nanotextured framework on diverse substrates with multiple material categories and surface topologies, serving as hydrophobic lubricant reservoirs. Employing this renewable material enables the scalable and sustainable coating production. The resulting optically transparent and highly flexible coatings manifest exceptional self&#8208;cleaning properties, readily shedding both waterborne and oily liquids over a broad viscosity range. Notably, the synergy between the corrosion&#8208;protective extracellular matrix and non&#8208;stick slipping motion confers unprecedented anti&#8208;biofouling efficacy and corrosion resistance. This study offers a distinctive perspective on harnessing ubiquitous native biofilms as biomaterials for self&#8208;adaptive coatings, facilitating tailored functionality across broad applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Routes to Pt Derivatives of High&#8208;Valent Sulfur Oxofluorides S(&#9552;O)2F, S(&#9552;O)F2, and S(&#9552;O)F3 by Fluorination and Oxygenation</title>

         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the controlled functionalization of a SOF ligand at a platinum center, achieving the selective formation of SO2F and SOF2 complexes by fluorination or oxygenation. Further fluorination of the SOF2 ligand resulted in an unprecedented SOF3 metal derivative, which is a unique example of a high&#8208;valent fluorinated sulfur atom coordinated to a metal center. 








Abstract
Metal derivatives of high&#8208;valent sulfur fluorides and oxofluorides can provid e fluorinated building blocks for materials science and bioactive compounds, but so far, such building blocks are elusive. The paper describes routes to access remarkable metal derivatives of S(&#9552;O)2F, S(&#9552;O)F2, and S(&#9552;O)F3 by oxygenation or fluorination steps. The Pt(II) fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(PCy3)2] (2) reacts with the Davis reagent (3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxaziridine) to yield the sulfuryl fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SO2F)(PCy3)2] (4). Notably, the electrophilic fluorinating agent NFSI (N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide) reacts with 2 to form trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF2)(PCy3)2][NFSO2Ph] (5a). By nucleophilic fluorination with TMAF (Me4NF) it is possible to fluorinate the sulfur center once more to give the complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF3)(PCy3)2] (6) bearing an unprecedented SOF3 ligand. Above 283&#160;K, complex 6 shows a decomposition of the SOF3 moiety to form trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(PCy3)2] (7) and SOF2. The described complexes could represent a previously unknown class of transfer reagents for high&#8208;valent sulfur fluoride units.

         <title>Electronic Structure Tuning in Cu&#8211;Co Dual Single Atom Catalysts for Enhanced COOH* Spillover and Electrocalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient electrocatalysts for CO2&#160;reduction to CO is challenging due to competing hydrogen evolution and intermediate over&#8208;stabilization. In this study, a Cu&#8208;Co dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (CuCo&#8208;DSAC) anchored on carbon black&#160;was&#160;synthesized via scalable pyrolysis. The catalyst achieves 98.5% CO Faradaic efficiency at 500 mA cm&#8315;2, maintaining &gt;95% selectivity across a 400 mV window with &lt;6% decay over 48 hours,&#160;which is superior to the corresponding single&#8208;atom control samples.&#160;In situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a synergistic mechanism: Co sites activate CO2&#160;and stabilize *COOH intermediates, while adjacent Cu&#160;sites facilitate CO desorption by lowering the energy barrier&#160;through charge redistribution. This dynamic buffer system mitigates active&#8208;site blocking and suppresses HER by weakening H adsorption. The electronic interplay between Cu and Co optimizes intermediate energetics, enabling industrial&#8208;level performance. This work demonstrates the potential of tailored dual&#8208;site architectures for complex electrocatalytic processes, offering a promising approach to overcoming traditional limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;(Acyldithio)saccharin: Design, Synthesis and Applications in Catalytic Enantioselective Disulfuration/Amination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have designed and successfully synthesized N&#8208;(acyldithio)saccharin for the first time, which is a highly electrophilic, bench&#8208;stable, and user&#8208;friendly disulfurating reagent. This reagent can undergo reactions with diverse N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles at room temperature. In most cases, no additional catalyst is required, and the desired disulfides were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields. With this reagent, late&#8208;stage disulfuration of pharmaceuticals and biomolecules was readily accomplished. For the first time, catalytic enantioselective disulfuration/amination of unactivated alkenes was achieved using this reagent. A series of chiral disulfides were obtained with high enantioselectivities and yields. The chiral disulfide products can be readily further transformed into chiral sulfonyl fluoride, chiral thiol, and structurally diverse disulfide products. Furthermore, we have evaluated the electrophilic reactivity of a series of disulfurating reagents based on density functional theory calculations, verifying the high reactivity of N&#8208;(acyldithio)saccharin both experimentally and theoretically.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new kind of supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide (SNDI) which can be immediately reduced as supramolecular radical anion by bacteria is reported. The introduction of thiocarbonyl effectively elevates the reduction potential of SNDI, largely increasing the bacteria&#8208;response speed in hypoxia. It selectively distinguishes the bacteria with high and low reduction ability in real time. The host&#8208;guest complexation of SNDI and cucurbit[7]uril can enhance radical anion quantum yield, ensuring intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and realizing high photothermal conversion. The real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacteria is successfully carried out.

         <title>Activating Interfacial Ion Exchange in Composite Electrolytes to Realize High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li+ percolation behavior in composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte is distinctly revealed through solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR). A composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with activated interfacial Li+ exchange and inorganic&#8208;rich interphases with electrodes is developed, which realizes ultra&#8208;long lifespan of solid&#8208;state batteries at high rates and wide temperature range.








Abstract
Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, the poor cross&#8208;phase Li+ transport restricts the rate performance and cycle life of the batteries. Herein, we revealed the Li+ percolation behavior in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based CSEs with Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 filler. The de&#8208;coordination barrier from Li+ clusters determines interfacial Li+ transport capability. We then employed a designed N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetamide (NMTFA) ligand to lower the de&#8208;coordination energy and activate interfacial Li+ exchange. The ionic conductivity is therefore increased from 3.32&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 to 7.30&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1. By tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution process, it was identified that the proportion of interfacial Li+ transport increases from 11% to 26%. The NMTFA also contributes to the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich interphases with electrodes. As a result, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 solid&#8208;state batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long lifespans of 2400, 3000, and 10&#160;000 times at 2, 5, and 10C, respectively, as well as achieve 1000 cycles at 50&#160;&#176;C and 300 cycles at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This work highlights the critical role of interfacial Li+ transport for the CSEs with &#8220;polymer&#8208;Li+ clusters&#8208;filler&#8221; configuration to realize high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Peripheral Engineering of Multiple&#8208;Resonance Framework Targeting Efficient Organic Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational peripheral engineering of multiple&#8208;resonance cores is shown to be critical for modulating molecular interactions, excited&#8208;state dynamics, and lasing performance. Extending &#960;&#8211;conjugation by introducing phenyl groups induces severe aggregation and broadens the excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA), whereas unconjugated tert&#8208;butyl groups suppress molecular aggregation and separate the ESA band away from the lasing region, leading to an optimal lasing performance.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as promising candidates for organic laser applications due to the potential for simultaneously achieving large oscillator strength and triplet utilization. In this study, we investigate the impact of peripheral tert&#8208;butyl (t&#8208;Bu)&#8208; and phenyl (Ph)&#8208;substituents on the typical 9&#8208;(phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;3&#8208;carbonitrile (CzBN) MR framework. Although these modifications preserve the frontier molecular orbital distribution with large oscillator strengths, they significantly influence excited&#8208;state dynamics and molecular aggregation even at low doping concentrations. Introducing Ph substituents extends the &#960;&#8211;conjugation extension of CzBN, promoting closer molecular packing, detrimental molecular aggregation, and significantly broadening the excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) band, which negatively impacts lasing performance. In contrast, CzBN&#8208;tBu, incorporating t&#8208;Bu groups as nonconjugated substituents, demonstrated reduced molecular aggregation and a distinct separation between the ESA band and stimulated emission region. Consequently, the optimal distributed feedback lasing performance is achieved by CzBN&#8208;tBu across various doping concentrations, resulting in the lowest lasing threshold of 3.4&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. These findings underscore the impact of inherent aggregation at low doping ratios on lasing activities, highlighting the crucial role of rational peripheral engineering in modulating molecular interactions and excited&#8208;state dynamics, offering design strategies for developing MR lasing molecules.

         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8208;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions is promising to promote the artificial nitrogen cycling. Despite the development of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts, their incident in&#8208;situ electrochemical reconstruction always leads to the ambiguity of veritable active sites and reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report an approach to encapsulate Ni@Ni2P particles with cationic Ni vacancies in hollow N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (designated Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs) for electrocatalytic NO3&#8208;&#160;reduction to NH3 and have investigated their surface reconstruction and reaction mechanisms using various in&#8208;situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations. Specially, the regulation of cationic Ni vacancy concentration in the three defective Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs catalysts leads to the 3.92&#8208;fold NH3 yield rate difference at &#8211;0.2 V versus RHE.&#160;During the electrocatalytic reaction process, new amorphous Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH species form on the surface of Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs and&#160;the stable amorphous Ni(OH)2 species benefits the generation of more active hydrogen (*H) for hydrogenation with&#160;NO3&#8208;.&#160;This is further verified by the different reaction rate&#8208;determining steps on the pristine and reconstructed defective catalysts.

         <title>A Ruthenium(II) Complex Inhibits BRD4 for Synergistic Seno&#8208; and Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>

A Ru(II) complex, Ru2c, was developed as a BRD4 inhibitor with a nanomolar binding constant. As the first Ru(II)&#8208;based BRD4 inhibitor, Ru2c achieved senotherapy and chemotherapy in cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells and was demonstrated to activate innate and acquired immunity in vivo.








Abstract
Drug resistance is a significant challenge for tumor therapy. Activating immunity is an effective method to combat drug&#8208;resistant tumors. Utilizing metallic chemotherapeutic agents to induce nonapoptotic programmed cell death is a practical approach to stimulate immunity. Besides, triggering tumor cell senescence, named senotherapy, is also an effective but often ignored method to induce immune responses. Despite some progress, reports on metallic immunotherapeutic stimuli are sparse and mainly delve into the level of organelle targeting, with vague drug&#8211;target mechanisms. Here, we report a Ru(II) complex (Ru2c) inhibits BRD4 with high affinity at a nanomolar constant. After encapsulation into biotin&#8208;DNA cage, Ru2c@biotin&#8208;DNA cage was demonstrated to kill drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells through a synergistic apoptosis&#8208;ferroptosis&#8208;senescence pathway, exhibiting 51&#8208;fold anticancer activity compared to the commercial inhibitor JQ&#8208;1. Ru2c effectively erased drug&#8208;resistant tumors and activated innate and acquired immunity in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, Ru2c is the first metal&#8208;based BRD4 inhibitor to achieve synergistic seno&#8208;immunotherapy and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

Here, we report a Ru(II) complex (&lt;b&gt;Ru2c&lt;/b&gt;) inhibits BRD4 with high affinity at a nanomolar constant. After encapsulation into biotin-DNA cage, &lt;b&gt;Ru2c@biotin-DNA cage&lt;/b&gt; was demonstrated to kill drug-resistant cancer cells through a synergistic apoptosis-ferroptosis-senescence pathway, exhibiting 51-fold anticancer activity compared to the commercial inhibitor JQ-1. &lt;b&gt;Ru2c&lt;/b&gt; effectively erased drug-resistant tumors and activated innate and acquired immunity in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, &lt;b&gt;Ru2c&lt;/b&gt; is the first metal-based BRD4 inhibitor to achieve synergistic seno-immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photovoltaic Absorber &#8220;Glues&#8221; for Efficient Bifacial Selenium Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifaical solar cells hold great potential for achieving higher power output than conventional monofacial devices by harvesting solar irradiance from both their front and rear surfaces. However, almost all currently reported bifacial devices typically require a sputtered rear transparent conducting oxide electrode, which can damage the underlying layers due to plasma effects during the deposition process. Here we report a glue&#8208;bonding strategy that uses a high&#8208;viscosity photovoltaic absorber slurry&#8212;in the case of molten selenium (Se)&#8212;as the adhesive to bond two charge&#8208;transport layer&#8208;deposited commercial fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide glasses, directly creating bifacial solar cells without the use of magnetron sputtering. We find that molten Se exhibits relatively high viscosity, high stability, and Newtonian fluid characteristics, facilitating film formation using this strategy. The resulting bifacial Se solar cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, surpassing all types of conventional thin&#8208;film solar cells. These cells achieve efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun illumination with an albedo of 0.3, and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8, with no efficiency loss after 1000 hours of ambient storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Assembly of Homo&#8208; and Heterotypic Ubiquitin Chains from Functionalized, Expressed Monomers via Thiol&#8208;Ene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generating functionalized ubiquitin building blocks via expression in E. coli paves the way to different di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;ubiquitin chains. Light&#8208;induced thiol&#8208;ene click reactions, combined with a masking and protection strategy, are harnessed to establish controlled ubiquitin chain assembly and to allow the semisynthesis of site&#8208;selectively ubiquitylated Tau4.








Abstract
Nature constructs ubiquitin tags with high spatiotemporal precision to execute defined functions that critically rely on the exact molecular composition of the ubiquitin chain. Deciphering the complex ubiquitin code is of paramount interest in biology and requires flexible access to homogeneous ubiquitin tags. As enzymatic approaches suffer from inherent drawbacks such as hardly controllable chain length or connectivity and substrate&#8208;specificity, we apply a combination of expression and chemical tools to assemble ubiquitin chains. Our strategy includes expression of ubiquitin&#8211;intein fusion constructs to obtain large quantities of defined ubiquitin monomers with C&#8208;terminal modifications such as hydrazides and propargylamides. Linkages between ubiquitins are generated via photoinitiated thiol&#8208;ene click (TEC) chemistry, resulting in a nearly native isopeptide bond. We demonstrate the generation of homo&#8208; and heterotypic ubiquitin oligomers with K27, 29, 48, and 63 linkages up to a K48&#8208;linked tetramer. The presented toolbox allows selective installation of ubiquitin on target peptides and proteins with reactive cysteine residues as demonstrated for segments of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau. Such segments can be implemented into protein semisyntheses as shown here for ubiquitylated full&#8208;length Tau4. The presented work combines minimal synthetic effort with high fidelity linkage chemistry, paving the way toward homogeneously ubiquitylated proteins.

         <title>Linkage Chemistry of Covalent Organic Frameworks in Photocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis applications due to their structurally ordered architectures and tunable physicochemical properties. In COFs, organic building blocks are linked via covalent bonds, and the structural and electronic characteristics of COFs are critically governed by their linkage chemistry. These linkages influence essential materials attributes including surface areas, crystallinity, hydrophobicity, chemical stability, and the optoelectronic behavior (e.g., photoelectron separation efficiency, electron conductivity, and reductive activity), which collectively determine catalytic performance in energy conversion systems. A systematic understanding of linkage engineering in COFs not only advances synthetic methodologies but also provides innovative solutions to global energy and environmental challenges, thereby accelerating the development of sustainable technologies for clean energy production and environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>mRNA nanomedicine represents a new generation of therapeutics. However, how to deliver mRNA to the desired organs and cells effectively remains challenging. Common mRNA delivery vectors include viral and non&#8208;viral types such as four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer based nanoparticles, lipid&#8208;polymer hybrid nanoparticles and so on. One&#8208;component ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (IAJDs), are an emerging type of mRNA delivery vehicle displaying good stability and high delivery efficiency. In this review, we comprehensively present the design, synthesis and mRNA delivery properties of IAJDs, with particular focus on the relationship between their molecular structures and organ targeted delivery properties. Other representative types of dendrimers for RNA delivery are also reviewed. Overall, this review summarizes the recent research progress on IAJDs systematically, aiming to guide the development of more efficient mRNA delivery platforms and next&#8208;generation mRNA nanomedicines.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of an Automated Workflow for Screening the Assembly and Host&#8208;Guest Behavior of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages towards Accelerated Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are a class of self&#8208;assembled materials with promising applications in chemical purifications, sensing, and catalysis. Their potential is, however, hampered by challenges in the targeted design of MOCs with desirable properties. MOC discovery is thus often reliant on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches and brute&#8208;force manual screening, which are time&#8208;consuming, costly and material&#8208;intensive. Translating the synthesis and property screening of MOCs to an automated workflow is therefore attractive, to both accelerate discovery and provide the datasets crucial for data&#8208;led approaches to accelerate MOC discovery and to realize their targeted properties for specific applications. Here, an automated workflow for the streamlined assembly and property screening of MOCs was developed, incorporating automated high&#8208;throughput screening of variables pertinent to MOC synthesis, data curation and automated analysis, and development of a host:guest assay to rapidly assess binding behavior. Computational modelling supplemented this automated experimental workflow for post priori rationalization of experimental outcomes. This study lays the groundwork for future large&#8208;scale MOC screening: from a relatively modest screen of 24 precursor combinations under one set of reaction conditions, 3 clean MOC species were identified, and subsequent screening of their host:guest behavior highlighted trends in binding and the identification of potential applications in molecular separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Antifreeze Protein Mimics Realizing Stable Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant&#160;Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Batteries with High Water Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous metal batteries offer inherent safety and low cost due to the predominance of water in their aqueous electrolytes, yet their practical applications are severely limited by electrolyte freezing under subzero conditions. Drawing inspiration from the mechanism of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that protect living organisms from freezing damage, we synthesize oxidized quasi&#8208;carbon nitride quantum dots (OQCNs) featuring a regularly in&#8208;plane structure commensurate with the prism face of hexagonal ice crystal. At an ultralow concentration, the OQCNs effectively mimic AFP functionalities by controlling ice crystal morphology, suppressing ice growth kinetics, and inhibiting ice recrystallization. This synergistic mechanism preserves continuous ion transport pathways while mitigating physical damage to battery components caused by ice crystal growth. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the Gibbs&#8208;Thomson effect underpins the suppression of ice growth, avoiding complete solidification of the electrolyte under subzero conditions. The OQCNs&#8208;modified electrolyte exhibits exceptional cryogenic performance at &#8208;30&#176;C, with Zn||Zn symmetric cell maintaining stable cycling of 1000 hours and Zn||NH4+&#8208;intercalated vanadium oxide (NVO) battery preserving 91.48% capacity retention through 5000 cycles (over 90 days). This work unveils a bioinspired paradigm that significantly enhances the performance of eco&#8208;friendly, high&#8208;moisture electrolytes, paving the way for robust, low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant zinc&#8208;ion batteries and related aqueous electrolyte&#8208;based technologies.</dc:description>

This work unveils a bioinspired paradigm that significantly enhances the performance of eco-friendly, high-moisture electrolytes, paving the way for robust, low-temperature-resistant zinc-ion batteries and related aqueous electrolyte-based technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyne Lipids Enable Efficient Synthesis of Comparable Polymer Lipids via Copper&#8208;Free Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses electron&#8208;deficient acetylenedicarboxylate lipids for the synthesis of polymer lipids via Cu&#8208;free azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. We successfully obtained a variety of polymer lipids which all enabled the preparation of well&#8208;defined, stabilized liposomes. Additionally, the linker structure &#8211; a 1,2,3&#8208;triazol diester &#8211; shows suitable pH&#8208;stability and biocompatibility for in vivo applications.








Abstract
Polymer lipids (PLs) are essential components of liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for drug and gene delivery, providing colloidal stabilization and defining the biological interface. While poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based PLs are the current standard, they are suspected to be responsible for rare adverse reactions, e. g. to LNP&#8208;based Covid&#8208;19 vaccines. Therefore, PLs based on alternative stealth polymers are being intensively investigated for their use in LNPs. However, alternative PLs often lack comparability due to different synthesis protocols and are often not easily accessible. Herein we present a catalyst&#8208;free, efficient and versatile coupling procedure for PL synthesis based on azide&#8208;functionalized polymers and electron&#8208;deficient acetylene dicarboxylate lipids. To highlight the versatility of this approach, we prepared PLs based on PEG and 4 alternative stealth polymers with quantitative coupling efficiencies. The linker structure showed appropriate pH stability and biocompatibility. All PLs enabled the preparation of well&#8208;defined liposomes with excellent stability. Our facile and versatile approach yields comparable PLs with minimized linker size, making them promising candidates for future comparative studies, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Phosphorus&#8208;Based Fluorescent Sensors: Synthesis and Selective Metal Sensing of Pyrazolyl Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazolyl phosphine oxides are shown to act as dual&#8208;responsive fluorescent sensors, displaying a selective &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; fluorescence response for Fe3+ and a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response for Al3+. These systems serve as a new framework in the field of sensing materials based on main&#8208;group elements such as phosphorus.








Abstract
Despite a wealth of previously reported frameworks for fluorescent metal sensors, there are few examples of phosphorus&#8208;based fluorophores being used in metal sensing applications. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new family of pyrazolyl phosphine oxides and their use in metal sensing applications. The mechanism of their formation has been probed in detail with both computational and experimental studies, rationalizing the selectivity of the reaction. Their use as dual&#8208;responsive fluorescent metal sensors is then demonstrated, with &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; and &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses observed for Fe3+ and Al3+, respectively. These systems exhibit good selectivity, large Stokes shifts, and submicromolar limits of detection and will open new avenues in phosphorus&#8208;based fluorophores and metal&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Nitrofuran Pharmaceuticals using Acetyl Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrofurfural is a key building block for the synthesis of antimicrobial nitrofurans as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Its synthesis involves the nitration of furfural, a substrate derived from biobased resources. However, furfural has a delicate heteroaromatic backbone. Typical nitrations involve harsh reaction conditions, which often compromise this structure, resulting in poor reproducibility and low yields. Although acetyl nitrate, a mild nitrating agent, is suitable for this task, major deterrents remain. First, its conventional preparation method involves conditions that are not compatible with furfural. Second, significant safety concerns are associated with the unstable and explosive nature of acetyl nitrate. These critical issues are addressed herein. A safe and robust continuous flow platform featuring in situ generation of acetyl nitrate for the nitration of furfural to nitrofurfural is reported. The high level of integration and automation enables remote process operation by a single operator. Key furfural&#8208;based pharmaceutical intermediates were synthesized with favorable metrics and high reproducibility. The efficiency of this flow platform is demonstrated using a selection of best&#8208;selling nitrofuran pharmaceuticals (nifuroxazide, nifurtimox, nitrofurantoin and nitrofural), which were obtained with excellent isolated yields in under five minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Built&#8208;In Electric Field in Freestanding Hydroxide/Sulfide Heterostructures for Industrially Relevant Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freestanding NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructure supported on nickel mesh was synthesized for industrially relevant alkaline water electrolysis. The robust built&#8208;in electric field and the asymmetric electron distribution at the interface play pivotal roles in significantly enhancing the activity and stability, including outstanding steady&#8208;state stability and resilience to operational fluctuations. 








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), as a premier technology to massively produce green hydrogen, hinges on outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes with high activity and robust stability under high current densities. However, it is often challenged by issues such as catalytic layer shedding, ion dissolution, and inefficient bubble desorption. Herein, a scalable corrosion&#8208;electrodeposition method is presented to synthesize nickel&#8211;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH)/Ni3S2 heterostructures on nickel mesh, tailored to meet the stringent requirements of industrial AWE. The study underscores the critical role of the built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) in optimizing electronic properties, curtailing Fe leaching, and enhancing mass transfer. The resultant NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructure manifests remarkable OER performance, with ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 202&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 290&#160;mV at 800&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH at 25&#160;&#176;C, alongside superior steady&#8208;state stability and resistance to reverse current under fluctuating conditions. Furthermore, the performance is further validated in an alkaline electrolyzer, achieving a large current density of 800&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.908&#160;V, while maintaining excellent stability. This work offers a blueprint for the design of efficient OER electrodes for industrially relevant AWE applications.

         <title>Geminiarene&#8208;Based Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystals with Dichromatic Variants and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Structural Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals is a challenging frontier in organic crystal engineering. Here, we introduce a gemini CT cocrystal system with dichromatic stimuli&#8208;responsiveness by utilizing the unique dual/gemini conformational feature of geminiarene. Geminiarene binds with the electron&#8208;deficient guest 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene through exo&#8208;wall interactions to form two types of gemini CT cocrystals with distinct colors. Single&#8208;crystal structures, along with theoretical calculations and spectral analyses, reveal that the color differences are primarily due to the dual molecular conformations of geminiarene and their distinct electronic properties. Notably, the gemini CT cocrystal system can be used to develop a novel dichromatic sensing material capable of distinguishing commonly used organic solvents. Moreover, the stimuli&#8208;responsive interconversion between the two conformations of geminiarene enables a loop&#8208;locked structural transition in the cocrystal system. This work expands CT cocrystal engineering and offers a new strategy for designing intelligent responsive materials for sensing and adsorption applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensionality Reduction of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Monolayers for Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential candidates for electrocatalysis due to their well&#8208;defined, tunable structures and ability to incorporate diverse active sites. However, their inherent insulating nature restricts electron transfer from electrode to remote active sites, leading to diminished catalytic performance. In this work, we present a novel strategy to overcome this limitation by reducing three&#8208;dimensional MOFs (3D_MOFs) into monolayered MOFs (monoMOFs) with a thickness of ~1.8 nm, maximizing the exposure of catalytic sites to the electrode and enhancing electrocatalytic performance. We designed and synthesized a monoMOF incorporating cobalt(II)&#8208;porphyrin sites in the linker (monoMOF&#8208;Co) for CO2 electroreduction. After being grafted onto graphene oxide, the monoMOF&#8208;Co exhibited a peak faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO = 93%), surpassing the performance of a 3D_MOF incorporating the same porphyrin&#8208;Co&#8208;based linker (3D_MOF&#8208;Co, FECO = 51%). Additionally, monoMOF&#8208;Co achieved a turnover frequency of 10,600 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.8 V vs. RHE and maintained stability over 47 hours in a near&#8208;neutral aqueous solution. In situ spectroscopic studies further confirmed the distinct electric field environment in the Stern layer between monoMOF&#8208;Co and 3D_MOF&#8208;Co. Furthermore, similar enhancement effects of monoMOFs over 3D_MOFs were observed in the nitrate and oxygen electroreduction reactions, highlighting the broader applicability of monoMOFs in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis and Spiral&#8208;Stair&#8208;Like Single Helix Assembly of Figure&#8208;Eight Cyclophenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of chiral figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylenes via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed four consecutive intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions of dodecaynes with two flexible biphenyl units, resulting in increased rotational freedom of the reaction intermediates. The figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylene with ethyl and methyl side chains exhibits the spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like single helix assembly in the crystal due to CH&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;O interactions and the marked CPL amplification in solution.








Abstract
Helix assemblies of chiral molecules can transfer microscopic unimolecular chirality to macroscopic supramolecular chirality, enhancing various chiral properties. In addition to the commonly observed spiral&#8208;column&#8208;like helix assembly, a small number of spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like helix assemblies have also been reported in aromatic nanocarbons with multiple chirality&#8208;related irregularities. However, they require separation of diastereomers and/or enantiomers or do not have stable chirality. Here, we report the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylenes with stable helical chirality by the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed four consecutive intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions of dodecaynes with two flexible biphenyl units. The chiral figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylene with ethyl and methyl side chains exhibits the spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like single helix assembly in the crystal due to CH&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;O interactions and good CPL properties in solution. Experimental verification of the enantio&#8208; and diastereodetermining steps of four consecutive [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions is also reported.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Pathways for Sustainable and Cleaner Recovery of Precious Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recovery of precious metals from waste streams is crucial for sustainable resource utilization but remains hindered by traditional methods involving high toxicity, energy consumption, and environmental pollution. Here, we present a photocatalytic strategy employing hydrothermally synthesized decatungstate ([W10O32]4&#8208;) homogeneous ion catalysts to achieve simultaneous oxidation and reduction of precious metals under ambient conditions. This innovative approach integrates solvent&#8208;controlled reaction pathways, enabling efficient dissolution and recovery of precious metals from diverse waste sources, including electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), platinum membrane electrodes, and platinum&#8208;containing catalysts. The decatungstate catalyst exhibits exceptional performance, with an apparent quantum yield of 0.027%&#8212;nearly double that of commercial TiO2 (0.014%)&#8212;and achieves recovery efficiency of 80&#8211;100% for platinum, surpassing 21 tested photocatalysts. The process adheres to a solid&#8208;phase dissolution model and remains against ionic interference. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations corroborate experimental UV&#8208;Vis spectra, while electron&#8208;hole pair analyses elucidate atomic and molecular contributions to photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) further validates the thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction pathways. By combining high efficiency, ambient operational conditions, and scalability, this work establishes decatungstates as a sustainable benchmark for green precious metal recovery, addressing the limitations of traditional methods and advancing innovation in resource circularity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Tandem Reaction System for High&#8208;Concentration Acetic Acid Production from Methane and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directly converting methane into high&#8208;value products like CH3COOH poses significant challenges owing to the kinetic limitations of C&#8208;H activation and C&#8208;C coupling in traditional single&#8208;catalysis methods. This work systematically studied the compatibility and effectiveness of plasma and thermo&#8208;catalytic tandem systems. By optimizing the plasma process in a self&#8208;designed dielectric barrier discharge reactor, we enhanced methane conversion (68%), methanol concentration (5.2 mol/L), and CO selectivity (56.9%), while preventing carbon deposition and CO2 formation. In subsequent thermo&#8208;catalysis, we developed the stearic acid&#8208;modified ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S hydrophobic catalyst to avoid the separation of methanol and CO from mixture and minimize the influence of by&#8208;product (e.g. H2O). This innovative approach achieved 52% CH3COOH selectivity and 1.3 mol/L concentrations, three orders of magnitude than traditional methods, meeting the preliminary industrial criteria. This study demonstrates the potential of tandem catalysis, offering valuable insights for the efficient utilization of methane and other challenging catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Metallated 1D Perylene Diimide Carbon&#8208;Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Activation and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic activation of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles provides a direct and efficient route to high&#8208;value &#945;&#8208;amino amides but remains challenging due to intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;metallated, one&#8208;dimensional ABC&#8208;stacking covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as a metal coordination site. Cobalt metallation significantly enhances photocatalytic efficiency, enabling the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H carbamoylation of saturated azaheterocycles with yields of up to 91%, far surpassing its nonmetallated counterpart (59%). This enhancement arises from the synergistic interplay between the PDI units and cobalt centers, which promote electron&#8211;hole pair separation and enhance singlet oxygen (1O2) generation. Moreover, PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co exhibits a 57&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity compared to its pristine analogue. This work highlights the critical role of metallation in modulating charge dynamics within COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers insights into the development of next&#8208;generation materials for sustainable catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyclic Quaternary Stereocenters via Catalytic Asymmetric Cross&#8208;Couplings with Unactivated Alkyl N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While significant advancements have been made in creating quaternary stereocenters (all&#8208;carbon substituents) within cyclic frameworks, generating acyclic quaternary stereocenters poses a more formidable task due to increased conformational flexibility. In this study, we report an enantioselective synthesis of compounds containing acyclic quaternary stereocenters through an iron&#8208;catalyzed alkylation reaction between an acyclic tertiary alkyl source and an unactivated primary alkyl source. This method not only facilitates the rapid construction of sterically hindered motifs but also effectively enhances the saturation level of the molecule. Key to this method is the employment of an outer&#8208;sphere C&#8211;C bond formation mechanism, where enantioselectivity is governed by a cooperative triple catalysis system that combines photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and iron catalysis. A series of compounds featuring acyclic quaternary stereocenters is produced under mild reaction conditions, and various transformations are presented to illustrate the potential applications of this approach. A comprehensive mechanistic study supports the crucial SH2 (bimolecular homolytic substitution) mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Concentrated Formate via CO2 Electrolysis Integrated with Cl2 Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilized two automated pH regulation strategies to integrate cathodic CO2 electrolysis with anodic Cl2 formation in scalable cation exchange membrane&#8208;based electrolyzers. Our process achieved formate concentrations exceeding 5&#160;M during extended operations, establishing a new benchmark for electrochemical formate synthesis.








Abstract
Integrating CO2 electrolysis with an industrially relevant anodic reaction enhances the economic feasibility and reduces carbon emissions in practical operations. In this study, we present an electrosynthesis strategy that integrates the CO2 reduction reaction to produce concentrated formate solution with the Cl2 formation in cation exchange membrane&#8208;based electrolyzers, scaling from 1 to 100 cm2 electrode areas. Our process, equipped with two automated pH regulation strategies, achieved selectivities over 80% for formate and 95% for chlorine in a 25 cm2 electrolyzer. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to achieve formate concentrations up to 5.4&#160;M during extended operation periods, establishing a new benchmark for electrochemical formate/formic acid synthesis. Techno&#8208;economic assessment and life cycle assessment further validated the process' sustainability, demonstrating a realistic path to profitability for valuable chemical production from CO2 even without considering potential subsidies and carbon taxes.

         <title>Temperature and Solvent Dual Switch Photochromic Chiral Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Advanced Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;gated photochromic ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (iHOF) for smart&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;information cryptomaterials with an enhanced circular polarization tendency at low temperatures has been synthesized using a charge&#8208;assisted strategy. These findings confirm the feasibility of iHOFs as a new generation of crystalline, multifunctional, circularly polarized, and luminescent materials.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;response encryption materials with temperature control and time resolution have attracted widespread attention due to their unique response characteristics and higher application security. The design and development of photochromic crystalline materials with multiple stimulus responses remain challenging. In this study, we report a pair of responsive photochromic chiral ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (iHOF) R/S&#8208;iHOF&#8208;19, controlled by both temperature and solvent through charge&#8208;assisted synthesis. The chromophore tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE) acts as an electron donor and (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine (R/S&#8208;DPEN) as an electron acceptor and chiral source. Water and methanol molecules connect the donor and acceptor and interact to build a 3D supramolecular framework. Notably, water and methanol molecules form independent hydrogen&#8208;bonding channels within the iHOF structural framework, providing a transfer path for the photoinduced electrons. Surprisingly, the formation of a continuous chiral supramolecular framework by R/S&#8208;DPEN while generating photo&#8208;induced radicals under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C imparts excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties to R/S&#8208;iHOF&#8208;19. The glum values reach &#8722;1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and&#160;+3.75&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, respectively, and show an enhancement of the circular polarization of light with decreasing temperature. This CPL with unique low&#8208;temperature stimulus&#8208;responsive photochromism provides new guidance and perspectives for the development of information security and multiple encryption materials.

         <title>A Powerful Regulator to Enhance Electrocatalytic Reaction Kinetics and Thermodynamics: The Ordered Hetero&#8208;Nanowire</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the thermodynamics of electrode reactions is a valid strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). However, as the catalyst downsizes to the nanoscale, the influence of mass transfer kinetics is increasingly pronounced in improving electrocatalytic activity. Herein, an ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire regulator that simultaneously couples the virtues of kinetics and thermodynamics is reported. Finite element analysis demonstrates that the periodic arrangement of hetero&#8208;nanowires could construct a uniform electric field directed to each catalyst surface, promoting the precise mass transfer of reactant molecules and accelerating the electrode reaction kinetics for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). In addition, the microscopic electronic structure effect of the well&#8208;defined catalyst weakens the bonding interaction toward toxic carbonaceous intermediates, which meanwhile strengthens the adsorption of hydroxyl species, critically contributing to enhanced MOR durability. The wide generality of this regulator has been confirmed by a series of as&#8208;prepared ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire catalysts, which show prominent electrocatalytic performance, including a relatively high mass activity, superior CO resistance, and long&#8208;term stability. Therefore, this work reveals the importance of the tandem effect of kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis, which provides valuable insights for developing customized and highly efficient catalysts for extensive applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;like (Cyclo)addition of Small Organic Molecules to a Stable Azomethine Ylide.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azomethine ylides are 1,3&#8208;dipolar zwitterions typically used for constructing N&#8208;heterocycles by 3+2&#8208;cycloaddition reactions. We report here a pyridyl&#8208;tethered isolable azomethine ylide (AY) that activates a series of H&#8722;E bonds (E = B, Si, Al, O) in FLP&#8208;like fashion. The reactions are probed mechanistically by DFT calculations and each case appears to be distinct from others. While the HBpin activation is stepwise, the same of PhSiH3 is concerted. The AlH3 activation is also stepwise but takes place across the 1,5&#8208;(C+/N&#8722;) dipole. The hydrolysis of AY fits better with a &#8216;relay&#8217; mechanism with two H2O molecules working in tandem. The B&#8722;B bond of B2pin2 is also cleaved but in an intriguingly different way, by delivering both the Bpin moieties at the carbenic site. Though the challenging H2 activation fails, a transfer hydrogenation of AY by NH3&#8226;BH3 is readily achieved. AY also undergoes cycloadditions with various dipolarophiles including unactivated alkene and alkynes. In this regard, AY makes an interesting distinction between CO2 and CS2 by staying inert to the former but easily cycloadding the latter. DFT analysis justifies this dichotomy by showing the cycloaddition of CO2 as thermodynamically disfavored.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A novel potassium tetraiodatoiodate(III) iodate(V), K2[IIII(IVO3)4]IVO3, has been successfully synthesized via an innovative in&#8208;situ reduction and complexation reaction. This atypical inorganic nonmetallic coordination compound, featuring trivalent iodine as the central coordination atom, exhibits exceptional potential as a second&#8208;order nonlinear optical material. It demonstrates remarkable second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (21.6KH2PO4 at 1064&#160;nm, 1.0KTiOPO4 at 2050&#160;nm), a broad transparency range from the visible to the mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths (0.37&#8211;6.05 and 7.03&#8211;13.40&#160;&#181;m), and a high birefringence (0.358 at 543&#160;nm) enabling rare full&#8208;wavelength phase matching.








Abstract
The development of nonlinear optical materials with large nonlinear optical susceptibilities, wide transmission ranges, and comprehensive full&#8208;wavelength phase matching capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized a novel potassium tetraiodatoiodate(III) iodate(V) via an in&#8208;situ reduction and complexation reaction. The resulting compound, K2[IIII(IVO3)4]IVO3, exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (21.6KH2PO4 at 1064&#160;nm, 1.0KTiOPO4 at 2050&#160;nm), a wide transparency range from the visible to the mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths (0.37&#8211;6.05 and 7.03&#8211;13.40&#160;&#181;m), and a high birefringence (0.358 at 543&#160;nm) to achieve full&#8208;wavelength phase matching. These properties are primarily ascribed to the synergistic substantial hyperpolarizability and polarizability anisotropy exhibited by the [IIII(IVO3)4]&#8722; complex ions, which comprise square&#8208;planar coordinated trivalent iodine and optimally arranged iodate ligands. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of nonmetallic cation centered coordination entities in influencing linear and nonlinear optical properties, a discovery that has significant implications for the development of innovative inorganic functional materials.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Controlled, Sequential Self&#8208;Sorting of Supramolecular Assemblies in Model Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;sorting of cellular components is essential for maintaining order and function in living systems, enabling complex processes to operate seamlessly. Emulating such self&#8208;sorting in synthetic self&#8208;assembly, however, has conventionally relied on structural or chirality mismatches of monomers yielding self&#8208;sorted systems under thermodynamic conditions. In contrast, reaction&#8208;coupled, kinetically&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly, ubiquitous in biological systems, is critical for achieving spatiotemporal characteristics. Extending this principle to temporally self&#8208;sorted synthetic assemblies is key to developing multi&#8208;component biomimetic systems. Herein, we present a strategy towards this direction, to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular assemblies through differences in the chemical&#8208;reactivity of monomers, coupled to redox&#8208;reactions. This approach exploits the distinct redox potentials of monomers to achieve precise temporal&#8208;control over self&#8208;sorting, while inherent structural mismatches among monomers ensure the kinetic stability of self&#8208;sorted state. Reduction reactions transiently disrupt their assemblies into dormant inactive monomeric states, while subsequent kinetically controlled reassembly occurs via reversible oxidation reactions.. Finally, utilizing this sequential self&#8208;sorting, we aim to mimic multicomponent cellular self&#8208;organization by demonstrating the kinetically controlled growth of self&#8208;sorted structures in the presence of model protocells, using lipid vesicles as compartments. Although spatial&#8208;distribution remains non&#8208;selective, the dormant monomeric states facilitate monomer encapsulation and the unprecedented stepwise&#8208;formation of self&#8208;sorted assemblies within model protocells.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Lithium Recovery from Spent LiFePO4 Stabilizes Ferricyanide Catholyte for Durable Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The scarcity of lithium resources and the increasing volume of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) exacerbate the imbalance between lithium supply and demand. The development and efficient recovery strategies of valuable lithium ion (Li+) from spent LIBs and their subsequent utilization presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Here, we propose an innovative approach for Li+ recovery from spent lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries (LFPs) and its subsequent utilization in alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries (AZFFBs). Utilizing a redox&#8208;mediated reaction, we achieve exceptional Li+ recovery efficiency from spent LFPs. Furthermore, the recovered Li+ in solution leads to the elevated ionic strength in the electrolyte, enhancing the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to a remarkable level of 1.74 M. Utilizing the above catholyte, an AZFFB cell demonstrates the cycling life extending to 11,000 cycles with a degradation rate as low as 0.00019% per cycle and 0.09% per day at a current density of 120 mA cm&#8722;2. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient protocol that eliminates additional intermediate processes, achieving effective Li+ recovery from spent LFPs and subsequent utilization in flow batteries. The resulting AZFFB exhibits high energy density and long lifespan, positioning it as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Leaflet&#8208;Specific Structure and Dynamics of Solid and Polymer Supported Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript investigates the structural and dynamic properties of polyethylene glycol&#8208;supported lipid bilayers using a method based on graphene&#8208;induced energy transfer and line&#8208;scan fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy, providing subnanometer spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution within a single experiment.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;supported or tethered lipid bilayers serve as versatile platforms for mimicking plasma membrane structure and dynamics, yet the impact of polymer supports on lipid bilayers remains largely unresolved. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that combines graphene&#8208;induced energy transfer (GIET) with line&#8208;scan fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (lsFLCS) to examine the structural and dynamic properties of lipid bilayers. Our findings reveal that polymer supports markedly influence both the structural parameters, such as the membrane height from the substrate, its thickness, as well as dynamic properties, including leaflet&#8208;specific diffusion coefficients and interleaflet coupling. These findings highlight the complex interplay between a polymer support and the lipid bilayers. By resolving leaflet&#8208;specific diffusion and heights of the two leaflets from the substrate, this study emphasizes the potential of GIET&#8208;lsFLCS for probing membrane dynamics and structure. These insights significantly advance the understanding and application of polymer&#8208;supported membranes across diverse research contexts.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linking Profiling of Molecular Glue Degrader&#8208;Induced E3 Ligase Interactome to Expand Target Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and robust cross&#8208;linking profiling strategy was introduced for unveiling the molecular glue degrader (MGD)&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactomes in live cells, integrating genetic code expansion with chemoproteomics. Neosubstrates of E3 ligase induced by both well&#8208;known and novel MG degraders were identified, expanding the target space for targeted protein degradation and opening new opportunities to address challenging undruggable proteins. 








Abstract
Molecular glue (MG) degraders, small molecules with significant therapeutic potential for targeting undruggable proteins, are emerging as new modality in drug discovery. Profiling the E3 ligase interactome induced by MG degraders provides insights into their mechanism of action and identifies clinically relevant neosubstrates for degradation, thereby offering new therapeutic opportunities. However, established methods face significant challenges in comprehensive and accurate profiling of MG degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome. Herein, we introduce the concept of globally cross&#8208;linking profiling of the MG degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome in living cells, achieved by integrating genetic code expansion technology with mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics. Our approach presents an efficient and robust strategy for identifying neosubstrates recruited to cereblon E3 ligase by the known degraders CC&#8208;885 and DKY709, offering valuable insights for clinical evaluation and significantly expanding their target space. Moreover, we developed two novel MG degraders with potent antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, and application of our method identified neosubstrates, revealing a previously unrecognized target landscape and advancing our understanding of E3 ligase&#8211;neosubstrate interactions. Overall, our study provides a powerful tool for neosubstrate identification and expanding target space of E3 ligase, opening new opportunities for developing next&#8208;generation MG degraders to address the clinical challenge of undruggable targets.

Moreover, we developed two novel MG degraders with potent antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, and application of our method identified neosubstrates, revealing a previously unrecognized target landscape and advancing our understanding of E3 ligase&#8211;neosubstrate interactions. Overall, our study provides a powerful tool for neosubstrate identification and expanding target space of E3 ligase, opening new opportunities for developing next-generation MG degraders to address the clinical challenge of undruggable targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Enzymatic Platform for Aniline Synthesis through Oxidative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aniline motifs are commonly found in natural products and synthetic molecules. While chemists have developed numerous methods for constructing C(sp2)&#8211;N bonds, their biocatalytic counterparts in nature are primarily limited to P450&#8208;based protein machineries. To address this limitation, we developed a biocatalytic platform for aniline synthesis based on oxidative amination of cyclohexanones. Through directed evolution of a flavin&#8208;dependent enzyme PtOYE, we identified several protein catalysts (e.g., OYE_G3 and OYE_M3) that exhibited activity across a broad array of substrates, enabling the preparation of 40 different secondary and tertiary anilines with various substitution patterns in up to 91% GC conversion. Mechanistic investigations revealed the improved kinetic performance of the evolved variants on the desaturation of imines. Additionally, mutations introduced through protein engineering further reduced the propensity for phenol formation. This enzymatic platform represents a highly promising application of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes, showcasing their great potential in organic synthesis and drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Superfast Protein Desulfurization Triggered by Low&#8208;Energy Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of transthioesterification&#8208;based ligation of thiol&#8208;derived amino acids and the post&#8208;ligation desulfurization has greatly expanded the scope of modern chemical protein synthesis. Here, we report a new strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) that enables superfast and clean protein desulfurization (half life = 1.7 s) with improved reaction selectivity compared to the previous methods. The LEnVLD method can be easily carried out under very mild conditions using only a catalytic amount of fluorescent dye and household flashlight (ca. 5 W) irradiation, eliminating the need for any pyrophoric reagent, thiol additives, or excessive radical initiators, and its practicality was demonstrated by the fast and high&#8208;yielding desulfurization of more than 30 peptide and protein substrates bearing a variety of sensitive functional groups (e.g., Thz, N&#8208;alkylated maleimide, and thioester). Moreover, the convenience and robustness of LEnVLD enables its extension to versatile reaction scenarios (e.g., solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization) that would enhance the practical capability of chemical protein synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Silagermenides as Powerful Synthons: Unraveling &#960;&#8208;Bonding and Lone Pair Effects in the Multiple Bonds of Heavier Main Group Analogs of the Vinyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to common vinyl anions, their heavier heteronuclear analog, silagermenides [R2Si&#9552;GeR]&#713;, remain exceedingly rare. Herein, we present a systematic investigation of silagermenides, synthesized via a straightforward desilylation route. We delve into the bonding characteristics, revealing a weak, polarized Si&#8211;Ge &#960; bond with a significant nonbonded lone pair character at the &#946;&#8208;Si position. This &#946;&#8208;Si exhibits predominantly nucleophilic behavior, while the &#945;&#8208;Ge position demonstrates subtly electrophilic tendencies, despite the presence of a vinylic, formally anionic Ge atom. This leads to the formation of silagermenide complexes in an unprecedented &#951;2 coordination mode, as well as various silagermenes and germylenes with unconventional substituents. We also document the facile cleavage of the ambiphilic Si&#9552;Ge double bond, resulting in the transfer of a formal doubly reduced silylene and a formal germyliumylidene. Our findings expand the understanding of heavier main group analogs of the vinyl anion, with important implications for their synthesis and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiospecific 2,3&#8208;Dialkylindole Synthesis Enabled by Alkylpalladium 1,2&#8208;Migration to In Situ Formed Aldimine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiospecific synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dialkylindoles via a 1,2&#8208;alkylpalladium migration to an in situ&#8208;generated aldimine intermediate. The unprecedented 1,2&#8208;alkylpalladium migration process is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments, providing robust evidence for its mechanistic feasibility. 








Abstract
2,3&#8208;Dialkylindoles play crucial roles in natural products and pharmaceuticals, but the step&#8208;efficient and regioselective construction of such privileged structures remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a regiospecific non&#8208;Fischer indole synthesis through chemoselective 1,2&#8208;migratory addition of alkylpalladium to an aldimine intermediate, formed in situ through a palladium hydride&#8208;triggered sequential isocyanide and intramolecular olefin insertion. This unprecedented 1,2&#8208;migratory addition leads to formal C&#9552;C bond cleavage and isocyano carbon insertion between the two sp2 carbons, offering a novel approach to specific 2,3&#8208;dialkyl substituted N&#9472;H free indoles from readily available alkyl substituted 1&#8208;isocyano&#8208;2&#8208;vinylbenzenes.

         <title>Synergistic solvent and composition engineering of perovskites for tandems on industrial silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites based on mixed formamidinium&#8722;cesium cation and iodide&#8722;bromide halide are promising materials in the top cells that are well&#8208;matched with crystalline silicon bottom cells to construct efficient tandem photovoltaics. Nevertheless, mixed cation&#8722;halide perovskite films with sub&#8208;micron film thickness suffer from poor crystallinity with inhomogeneous and undesirable phases, owing to the presence of multiple pathways of crystal nucleation and phase transition. Herein, we propose a synergistic solvent and composition engineering (SSCE) strategy to regulate the solvated phases and manipulate the transition pathways simultaneously. The resultant mixed cation&#8722;halide perovskite film shows optimizing crystallization and desired phase structure with suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved phase stability under aging stresses. Consequently, the SSCE strategy enables the tandem cells based on industrially ultra&#8208;thin silicon wafers (120 &#181;m) to achieve a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 31.0%. Those encapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial performance after 1200 h continuous operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Dual&#8208;Ratiometric SERS Probe Enables Raman Imaging of Neurological pH Fluctuations in Epilepsy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An imbalance of brain pH is closely associated with biochemical reactions, ion regulation, and electrical activity, serving as a hallmark for various neurological disorders. High&#8208;resolution imaging of pH fluctuations in brain diseases is crucial for understanding pathological processes. However, current pH probes are inadequate for this purpose due to poor blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration or insufficient specificity. Herein, we reported a tandem dual&#8208;ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe, RHP@AuS, capable of crossing the BBB to address these challenges. RHP@AuS leveraged dendrimers for the facile one&#8208;step synthesis of SERS probes, significantly enhancing signal intensity and reproducibility. RHP@AuS can be sequentially activated by neuroinflammation&#8208;associated H2O2 and pH, exhibiting highly selective ratiometric responses to pH fluctuations in brain disease. Dynamic SERS imaging revealed that during neuronal epileptic activity, inflammation increased and local pH dropped sharply to around 6.6. Building on these findings, a drug combination with dual neuroinflammation&#8208;mitigating and pH&#8208;regulating properties was developed, effectively alleviating epilepsy in mouse models. This study opens new avenues for developing imaging probes for the brain and deepens our understanding of the roles of pH in neurological disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing the Selectivity of CH4 Electrosynthesis from CO2 over Cuprates through Cu&#8208;O Bond Length Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely controlling the nature of Cu&#8208;O bond in Cu&#8208;based oxide catalysts and understanding its correlation with CH4 electrosynthesis (from CO2) for selectivity optimization is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, taking a specific type of cuprates structured with CuO4 square&#8208;planar motifs as the platform, we report a selectivity descriptor of Cu&#8208;O bond length for screening highly selective catalysts toward CH4 electrosynthesis. We establish the descriptor by systematic investigations of several proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cuprates. Their Cu&#8208;O bond lengths are precisely controlled ranging from 1.944 to 1.970 &#197; and these bonds remain stable in CH4 selectivity evaluation. Our investigations demonstrate that the CH4 selectivity exhibits a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Cu&#8208;O bond length, and the optimized value is accessible at about 1.951 &#197;. This could be attributed to the optimal (neither too strong nor too weak) *CO adsorption created by the moderate Cu&#8208;O bond length, facilitating *CO hydrogenation. Furthermore, utilizing this descriptor, we predict three highly selective cuprates for CH4 electrosynthesis, with superior selectivity that is near the top of the volcano plot. And importantly, in an acidic electrolyte (pH = 1), they outperform the reported catalysts, achieving CH4 selectivity of up to 61.7% at 300 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Induced Crystallization Regulation for Efficient and Stable Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (5&#8208;AH) is introduced into perovskite precursor solution to selectivity coordinates with SnI2 forming the thermodynamically favored SnI2&#8208;5&#8208;AH adducts with stronger SnI2&#8208;Cl&#8722;, effectively delaying the reaction rate of SnI2 and FAI and thus mediating the crystallization rate, resulting in an improved spatial homogeneity of Sn and Pb components. As a result, the 5&#8208;AH&#8208;treated Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells achieve a high efficiency of up to 23.76% with enhanced long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The unbalanced crystallization rate between Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskites leads to their heterogeneous distribution and inferior quality of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films. The promising strategy of selective molecular interaction would balance the crystallization rate. However, the deeper selectivity mechanism needs to be considered, particularly in terms of the entire coordination reaction in the perovskite precursor solution. Herein, we take advantage of thermodynamics and molecular orbital theory to reveal the competitive coordination of additive, i.e., methyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (5&#8208;AH), with SnI2 and PbI2. The SnI2 competes with PbI2 in coordinating with 5&#8208;AH to form the thermodynamically favored SnI2&#8208;5&#8208;AH adducts with stronger SnI2&#8208;Cl&#8722;, thereby mediating the crystallization rate of the Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskite. Such crystallization regulation improves the composition uniformity and crystallization quality, which effectively suppresses nonradiative recombination. Additionally, the strong interaction between Sn2+ and 5&#8208;AH as well as reductive grain boundaries inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+. Therefore, the optimal devices with 5&#8208;AH exhibit an improved PCE of 23.76% with a high voltage of 0.885&#160;V and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Controlling the Chirality of Metallo&#8208;Cages by Manipulating the Stereochemistry of the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the dynamics of ZnII and CdII ions are approximately the same, the stereochemistry of 1&#8208;ZnII12L18 and 2&#8208;CdII12L18 cuboctahedra induced by the same chiral guests (D&#8208;/L&#8208;camphorsulfonate) was opposite, thus enabling manipulation of the chirality of the metallo&#8208;cages through the metal ions. Spontaneous resolution of 3&#8208;ZnII12L28 into enantiopure individual crystals was achieved by changing the ligand's substituent to 2&#8208;methylphenylethyl.








Abstract
Precise control over the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages by manipulating the stereochemistry of metal centers is important in many practical applications, but is extremely challenging. In this study, two isostructural metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra (1&#8208;ZnII12L18 and 2&#8208;CdII12L18) have been assembled using ligand L1 and two kinds of metal ions (ZnII and CdII) with similar coordination lability. The chiral&#8208;induction by the same guests (D&#8208;/L&#8208;camphorsulfonate, D&#8208;/L&#8208;SCS) results in a completely opposing stereochemical output of 1 and 2: D&#8208;SCS induced host&#8211;guest complex of [D&#8208;SCS&#8834;&#916;12&#8211;1] and [D&#8208;SCS&#8834;&#923;12&#8211;2], respectively, with reverse handedness. The distinct stereochemical configuration of metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra can be manipulated by participant metal ions that exhibit similar dynamics. Furthermore, a subtle variation of the ligand peripheral substituent group facilitates spontaneous resolution of metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra 3&#8208;ZnII12L28 from a racemic mixture as (R24, &#923;12)&#8208;3/(S24, &#916;12)&#8208;3 enantiopure entities. The dynamic stereochemistry of MII12L8 cuboctahedra described in this work allows a chiral manipulation based on the nature of metal centers and ligands, enabling the design and control of the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Activating Polydimethylsiloxane&#8208;Modified CrOx/Al2O3 Catalyst for Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wobble effect of flexible polydimethylsiloxane chain protects catalyst surface from the coke precursors generated during acetylene semihydrogenation, thus extending the lifetime of CrOx/Al2O3 over 40&#8208;fold. This work highlights the importance of dynamic self&#8208;activation in the catalytic reactions suffering from carbonaceous deposition issues.








Abstract
Biomimetic approach is a nature&#8208;driven strategy for designing functional materials to meet the industrial challenges. Here we demonstrate the bio&#8208;inspired discovery of a self&#8208;activating catalyst, with polydimethylsiloxane anchored over the surface of CrOx/Al2O3, exhibiting comparable performance with noble metallic catalysts for acetylene semihydrogenation. In addition, the dynamic movement of polymer chains with high flexibility renders the catalyst to impose proactive perturbation to the undesired coke precursors generated in reaction, analogous to the function of hair&#8208;like cilia on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells, thus avoiding the site&#8208;blocking induced by carbonaceous deposits and sustaining the catalyst stable for 1000&#160;h without any deactivation. This study paves the way to develop other heterogeneous catalysts with high efficiency and durability via mimicking the innate defense mechanism of natural organisms.

         <title>Construction of Multistep Charge Transfer Pathways in Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 for Significantly Accelerated Photoconversion of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach integrating multistep charge transfer pathways and heat&#8208;driven reactions is designed to convert waste polypropylene into CO and CH3COOH, both widely used in industry as essential chemical feedstocks. Under light irradiation, polypropylene thermally decomposes into C4 molecules due to the heat generated by the SPR effect of Bi0; C4 molecules are adsorbed onto the surface of the Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 and attacked by &#183;O2&#8722;, leading to their photoconversion into CO and CH3COOH. This study provides a new strategy for achieving high&#8208;value recycling of waste plastics through photocatalysis under mild conditions.








Abstract
Photoconversion of waste plastics into valuable CO and CH3COOH represents a ground&#8208;breaking strategy for addressing plastic pollution issues. However, this process currently encounters significant challenges, primarily due to the limitation of catalyst activity and the difficulty in breaking C&#9472;C bonds. Herein, we present a novel approach that integrates multistep charge transfer pathways with photothermal&#8208;driven reactions to improve photoconversion efficiency. By incorporating Bi0/Bi3+ metal as an electron transport mediator for multistep charge transfer, we markedly enhanced the separation and transport of photoelectrons, thereby accelerating the generation of active species. Meanwhile, the heat generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Bi0 drove the reactions related to the photoconversion of polypropylene. Subsequently, the photoconversion rates of PP into CO by Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 reached 209.41&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, which is 27.55 times higher than that achieved with KNbO3. Furthermore, the dual Bi&#8211;Nb sites effectively stabilize the key intermediate *COOH, thereby promoting the production of CH3COOH at a rate of 213.00&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. This strategy of boosting photoconversion activity of PP into CO and CH3COOH offers an effective green solution to the serious issue of plastic pollution.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Extraction&#8208;Triggered Phase Engineering of Rhodium Nanomaterials for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a unique phase engineering strategy to prepare unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (2H) Rh nanomaterials by C extraction from Rh2C with controlled surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. The unusual 2H Rh shows excellent electrocatalytic performance in nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) compared to conventional face&#8208;centered cubic (3C) Rh, which is theoretically verified by the phase&#8208;dependent NO3RR pathway and hydrogen affinity on Rh.








Abstract
Phase engineering plays a crucial role in tuning the physicochemical properties of noble metal nanomaterials. However, synthesis of high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase noble metal nanomaterials remains highly challenging via current wet&#8208;chemical methods. Herein, we develop a unique synthetic methodology to prepare freestanding unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (2H) Rh nanoplates (NPLs) via a rationally designed two&#8208;step strategy. By extracting C from pre&#8208;synthesized rhodium carbide of different sizes and morphology, phase&#8208;controlled synthesis of Rh nanomaterials can be achieved. Impressively, the obtained parallelogram 2H Rh NPLs have high phase purity, well&#8208;defined 2H (0001)h and (101&#175;${\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$0)h facets, and good thermostability (stable up to 300&#160;&#176;C). In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), the 2H Rh NPLs achieve higher ammonia (NH3) Faradaic efficiency (91.9%) and NH3 yield rate (156.97&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1) with lower overpotentials compared to the conventional face&#8208;centered cubic (3C) Rh nanocubes with (100)f facets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional (0001)h surface has energetically favored NO3RR pathway and stronger H* absorption ability compared to the (100)f surface, which may lead to the higher activity and selectivity of NH3 production on 2H Rh NPLs. This work opens new avenues to the rational synthesis of unconventional&#8208;phase metal nanomaterials and provides important guidelines to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Site Distance Effect in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inter&#8208;site distance effects (ISDE) challenge classical models in heterogeneous catalysis by revealing long&#8208;range interactions between adjacent nonbonded sites. This work reviews the synthetic strategies to regulate inter&#8208;site distances, applications of ISDE, relevant characterization, and computational methods, offering insights to unlock efficiency bottlenecks in electrocatalysts for energy and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
The inter&#8208;site distance effect (ISDE) has gained significant attention in heterogeneous catalysis, challenging classical models that treat adjacent nonbonded sites as isolated. Recent studies demonstrate that these sites can exhibit long&#8208;range cooperative interactions, enhancing reaction efficiencies. Fully leveraging the ISDE to overcome limitations in site reactivity requires a multidisciplinary approach and advanced techniques. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ISDE in electrocatalysis, starting with strategies for synthesizing materials with tunable inter&#8208;site distances. It examines ISDE across various catalyst models, including monometallic and heteronuclear atomic sites, active sites within clusters, and the lattice of nanocatalysts, focusing on their electronic structures, spatial geometries, and synergistic interactions. Advanced characterization and computational methods are highlighted as essential for identifying inter&#8208;site structures and distances, providing a systematic framework for understanding ISDE's role in electrocatalysis. The review also proposes best practices for studying ISDE, addressing current challenges and offering future perspectives. These insights aim to inform the design of highly efficient catalysts, enhance the understanding of catalytic mechanisms, and contribute to the development of more efficient energy conversion technologies, providing a foundation for further research into optimizing electrocatalysts.

         <title>Conversion of Bestmann Ylide into Carbophosphinocarbene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ortho&#8208;carboranyl carbophosphinocarbene(CPC) was synthesized via a click&#8208;type reaction. Experimental and computational studies reveal its remarkable electron&#8208;donating ability. Reactivity studies demonstrate its versatility as a stabilizing ligand, a strong nucleophile for CO&#8322; activation, and a potent Br&#248;nsted base for imidazolium deprotonation.








Abstract
The ortho&#8208;carboranyl carbophosphinocarbene (CPC) has been synthesized through a click&#8208;type reaction between the super strained carborane&#8208;fused borirane 1,2&#8208;BN(SiMe3)2&#8211;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 and Bestmann ylide Ph3PCCO. The [Cl(CO)&#8322;Ir&#8208;CPC] and [Cl3Ga&#8208;CPC] complexes were synthesized, allowing the measurement of their Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) and the sum of Cl&#9472;Ga&#9472;Cl bond angles (&#8721;ClGaCl), respectively. These data highlight their remarkable electron&#8208;donating ability. Further insights into its electron&#8208;donating properties were gained through theoretical calculations, including analysis of frontier orbitals and proton affinity (PA). Preliminary reactivity investigations demonstrate that the new CPC readily forms adducts with boranes and can effectively stabilize borenium cations. Its strong nucleophilicity enables reactions with carbon dioxide, while its exceptional Br&#248;nsted basicity allows it to deprotonate imidazolium to generate carbene species.

         <title>Online Coupling High&#8208;Temperature Electrolysis with Carbonylation Reactions: A Powerful Method for Continuous Carbon Dioxide Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous process for carbonylation reactions based on the online coupling of dry, high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis with a coil reactor has been reported. The strategy relies on producing CO/CO2 mixtures onsite, without H2 or H2O entering the product gas, thus providing a safe and fast concept for the synthesis of several carbonyl compounds. The method demonstrated widespread applicability in amino&#8208;, alkoxy&#8208;, and phenoxycarbonylation, in carbonylative Sonogashira couplings, and in the synthesis of redox&#8208;active esters. The corresponding products were isolated with excellent yields in just 40 min.








Abstract
Despite being widely available, the broad utilization of CO2 for chemical production remains in its infancy. The difficulty of using CO2 as an important resource for the chemical industry lies in the high stability of the molecule and its associated inertia. In this work, we demonstrate how to overcome these limitations by utilizing a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) with an optimized cathode to produce dry CO through the high&#8208;temperature electrolysis of CO2. We further integrate this process with a synthesis setup in a continuous&#8208;flow coil reactor to boost reactivity in various carbonylation processes, including in amino&#8208;, alkoxy&#8208;, and phenoxycarbonylation, carbonylative Sonogashira couplings, or the synthesis of redox&#8208;active esters. Ultimately, our approach offers a platform strategy for the rapid, scalable, and continuous production of carbonyl compounds directly from CO2 while eliminating the requirement for storing large CO quantities.

         <title>Enhancing the Stability of Aqueous Membrane&#8208;Free Flow Batteries: Insights into Interphase Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a new aqueous membrane&#8208;free flow battery based on a novel aqueous biphasic system with enhanced electrolyte properties. The system uses compatible species exhibiting high partitioning behavior, as demonstrated by computational and experimental analysis. These species prevent parasitic reactions, enabling unprecedented studies of the liquid&#8211;liquid interphase and providing valuable insights into advancing this battery technology.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;free flow batteries using immiscible electrolytes aim to overcome limitations of conventional redox flow batteries by eliminating expensive ion&#8208;selective membranes. However, they face challenges including low power density due to the transport constraints in immiscible electrolytes, the need for high partitioned stable compatible active species, and the overlooked self&#8208;discharge interphase phenomena that reduce coulombic efficiency. We present a novel aqueous biphasic system based on two salts improving electrolyte ionic conductivity and viscosity. Potassium ferrocyanide (K4[Fe(CN)6]) and a sulfonated viologen ((SPr2)V) species were examined computationally and experimentally, demonstrating effective redox pair separation in all oxidation states, achieving a tenfold higher concentration in their electrolyte. The mutual compatibility and stability of these species enabled unprecedented scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) analysis of the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase, revealing insights like species concentration gradients and crossover. The enhanced electrolyte properties expanded the open&#8208;circuit voltage to 1.1&#160;V and improved mass transport, enabling power densities that are 3.5 times higher than previous examples. The battery achieved 80.2% energy efficiency at a C/2 rate, and under flowing conditions, it maintained stable performance over a month (400 cycles) at high states of charge. This work presents an innovative aqueous membrane&#8208;free flow battery that avoids parasitic reactions, enabling detailed interphase studies and advancing this technology.

         <title>Engineering Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites in Ordered Macroporous Architectures for Enhanced C2H4 Production from CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst was constructed by in situ creating Cu&#9472;In active sites within the three&#8208;dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) In2O3, which demonstrates a dual&#8208;engineered strategy integrating 3DOM architectures with heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal active sites to synergistically enhance C2H4 production in photocatalytic CO2 and H2O conversion.








Abstract
Photocatalytic C2H4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O by utilizing solar energy represents a promising sustainable process, yet its efficiency remains significantly limited. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;engineered strategy integrating 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) architectures with heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal active sites to synergistically promote the photocatalytic C2H4 production. As an example, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst was synthesized by in situ incorporating Cu single atoms (Cu SAs) into 3DOM In2O3 through a template&#8208;assisted pyrolysis process. The strong interaction between Cu SAs and In2O3 resulted in the formation of charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#9472;In active sites along with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs). 3DOM architectures serving as special nanoreactors displayed significant advantages in promoting CO2 enrichment and confining key intermediates, thereby increasing *CO coverage. Meanwhile, the charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#9472;In active sites effectively mitigated electrostatic repulsion and promoted the formation of *CO&#160;+&#160;*CHO intermediates, resulting in a thermodynamically spontaneous C&#9472;C coupling step. Therefore, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst exhibited robust CO2 reduction to C2H4, achieving high C2H4 evolution rates under various CO2 concentrations, including pure CO2, 10% CO2 in Ar (simulated flue gas), and 0.04% CO2 in Ar (simulated air). This work offers a novel strategy for the construction of photocatalysts with tailored microstructures and specific active sites to promote the conversion of CO2 and H2O into multicarbon products.

         <title>Microporous Hard Carbon Support Provokes Exceptional Performance of Single Atom Electrocatalysts for Advanced Air Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe single atoms in microporous hard carbon (Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC) possesses a microporous structure with crumpled graphene sheets, which serves confined microenvironment for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC yields a remarkable ORR performance, and hydrogen bonding between the intermediates and micropore interior surfaces accelerates ORR kinetics. Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC shows outstanding performance in zinc&#8208;air batteries and industrial chlor&#8208;alkali process.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts embracing metal&#8208;nitrogen (MNx) moieties show promising performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The modification on spatially confined microenvironments, which won copious attention with respect to achieving efficient catalysts, are auspicious but yet to be inspected for MNx moieties from modulating the energetics and kinetics of ORR. Here, Fe single atoms (SAs) are immobilized in microporous hard carbon (Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC), in which the microporous structure with crumpled graphene sheets serves confined microenvironment for catalysis. Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC holds a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.927&#160;V and excellent stability for ORR. Theoretical studies unveil that hydrogen bonding between the intermediate of O* and micropore interior surfaces substantially promote its protonation and accelerate the overall ORR kinetics. Both the aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries driven by Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC air cathode show excellent stability with small charging/discharging voltage gaps. Importantly, when used as the air cathode for industrial chlor&#8208;alkali process, the applied voltage of Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC&#8208;based flow cell to reach 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is 1.57&#160;V, which is 210&#160;mV smaller than Pt/C&#8208;based one. These findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into the confined microenvironment of MNx moieties for boosted electrochemical performance, and pave the pathways for future catalyst development satisfying the requirement of industrial applications.

         <title>Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis: A Versatile Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclopropenes and Oxazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that the radical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates with alkynes and the radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with nitriles proceeds smoothly via a cobaloxime&#8208;based metalloradical catalysis (MRC) pathway, affording the desired products in high to excellent yields. Key results include broad substrate compatibility, high functional group tolerance, scalability to gram&#8208;scale transformations, and practical applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. The work not only underscores the synthetic utility of cobaloxime complexes but also expands the scope of MRC, providing a robust platform for sustainable and innovative radical transformations in organic synthesis.








Abstract
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. Here, an efficient catalytic method has been devised for the radical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cyclopropenation of alkynes and radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] oxazolation of nitriles using &#945;&#8208;aryldiazoacetates via MRC. Cobaloxime proves effective in facilitating the metalloradical [2&#160;+&#160;1] cyclopropenation of alkynes and radical [3&#160;+&#160;2] oxazolation cycloaddition reaction under mild conditions. The reactions demonstrate broad substrate tolerance, accommodating gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our findings highlight the significant potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition as a valuable tool in organic synthesis and broaden the scope of metalloradical systems in catalysis.

         <title>Tubular Nanostructures from Large&#8208;Pore 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavy mesoporous 2D covalent organic framework (COF) has been synthesized with a 6&#8208;nm hexagonal pore lattice. This COF forms non&#8208;covalent tubular domains that can be separated by mild sonication, yielding a family of tubular COF nanostructures that combine a 1D morphology with accessible mesopores.








Abstract
The synthesis of a wavy mesoporous 2D covalent organic framework (COF) with a 6&#8208;nm hexagonal pore lattice (Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;1) is reported. This has been achieved by the synthesis of a terpyrenyl linker of approximately 2.7&#160;nm in length and its subsequent condensation with a 3&#8208;connected non&#8208;planar cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exists as non&#8208;covalent tubular domains composed of &#960;&#8208;stacked 4 to 5 pores in 2D COF sections that can be separated by mild sonication, resulting in a family of tubular COF nanostructures that combine a 1D morphology with accessible mesopores.

         <title>Li21Ge8P3S34: New Lithium Superionic Conductor with Unprecedented Structural Type</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of high ion&#8208;conductive inorganic crystal structures remains a challenge in facilitating the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Ionic conductors reported to date have predominantly been limited to well&#8208;known crystal structures. In this work, we report a new, unprecedented crystalline structure, Li21Ge8P3S34, which demonstrates high ionic conductivity.








Abstract
Lithium superionic conductors are pivotal for enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, which aim to replace liquid electrolytes and enhance safety. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented lithium superionic conductor, Li21Ge8P3S34, featuring a novel structural type and a new composition in the Li&#8211;Ge&#8211;P&#8211;S system. This material exhibits high lithium ionic conductivity of approximately 1.0&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 303&#160;K with a low activation energy of 0.20(1)&#160;eV. It's unique crystal structure was elucidated using three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) and further refined through combined powder X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction analyses. The structure consists of alternating two&#8208;dimensional slabs: one of corner&#8208;sharing GeS4 tetrahedra and the other of isolated PS4 tetrahedra, enabling efficient lithium&#8208;ion transport through a tetrahedrally interconnected network of 1D, 2D, and 3D diffusion pathways. This distinctive structural motif provides a novel design strategy for next&#8208;generation solid electrolytes, broadening the structural landscape of lithium superionic conductors. With further advancements in compositional tuning and interfacial engineering, Li21Ge8P3S34 could contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry in Functional Hydrogel Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive overview of research progress in functional hydrogel coatings, the interfacial mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed, and the preparation methods with their respective advantages and disadvantages for hydrogel coatings are summarized. Finally, the challenges in terms of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality are outlined, and a glimpse into future opportunities is offered. 








Abstract
Functional hydrogel coatings can endow the underlying substrate with excellent surface properties, such as anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;fogging, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;abrasion, lubrication, and controllable drug delivery, while hardly changing the mechanical properties of the substrate. Through elaborate interface engineering, hydrogel coatings with high interfacial toughness and controllable thickness have been successfully constructed on different substrate surfaces for widespread applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current research progress in functional hydrogel coatings and the associated interfacial chemistry. First, the interfacial interactions and mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed. Next, the preparation methods for hydrogel coatings are systematically summarized, with a focus on the involved critical chemical groups/reactions and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we highlight the challenges from the perspective of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality, and provide a glimpse into future opportunities, hoping to promote the transformation of functional hydrogel coatings from foundational research to industrial applications.

         <title>Rapid Water Permeation by Aramid Foldamer Nanochannels With Hydrophobic Interiors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We compare the water permeability of stacked macrocycles and synthetic helical nanotubes of three different lengths across phospholipid bilayers. Our results demonstrate that covalent nanotubes with a length matching the bilayer width exhibit high water permeability, excellent salt and proton rejection, and performance comparable to natural aquaporins.








Abstract
Aquaporins are natural proteins that rapidly transport water across cell membranes, maintaining homeostasis, whilst strictly excluding salt. This has inspired their use in water purification and desalination, a critical emerging need. However, stability, scalability, and cost have prevented their widespread adoption in water purification membrane technologies. As such, attention has turned to the use of artificial water channels, with pore&#8208;functionalized polymers and macrocycles providing a powerful alternative. Whilst impressive rates of transport have been achieved, the combination of a scalable, high&#8208;yielding synthesis and efficient transport has not yet been reported. Herein, we report such a system, with densely functionalized channel interiors, synthesized by high&#8208;yielding living polymerization with low polydispersities, showing high salt exclusion and excellent water transport rates. Our aramid foldamers create artificial water channels with hydrophobic interiors and single&#8208;channel water permeability rates of up to 108 water molecules per second per channel, approaching the range of natural aquaporins (c. 109). We show that water transport rates closely correspond to the helical length, with the polymer that most closely matches bilayer thickness showing optimal efficacy, as supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our work provides a basis for the scalable synthesis of next&#8208;generation artificial water channels.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doping Engineering of Fused Olympic Cations: Metal&#8208;Free Modular Syntheses and NIR&#8208;II Radicals with Mixed Aromatic/Antiaromatic Characters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of nitrogen and sulfur/oxygen dual&#8208;doping Olympic heterocyclic cations have been modularly synthesized employing a metal&#8208;free protocol, with tunable optical and redox properties. These charged &#960;&#8208;molecules can transform to delocalized neutral radicals through single&#8208;electron reduction, exhibiting NIR&#8208;II absorptions around 1300&#8211;1400&#160;nm and mixed aromatic/antiaromatic features.








Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have attracted immense attention owing to their fascinating optoelectrical properties. However, precise heteroatom&#8208;doping engineering and fabricating charged polycyclic aromatic scaffolds remain challenging and far from satisfactory. Herein, a new family of nitrogen and sulfur/oxygen dual&#8208;doping fused Olympic heterocyclic cations (FPT/FPOs) are modularly synthesized employing an efficient and convenient metal&#8208;free protocol. Tunable optical and redox properties can be achieved by rational structural editing. Compared with their half&#8208;fused counterparts, FPTs and FPOs hold higher redox stability and can undergo single&#8208;electron reduction to form delocalized neutral radicals, exhibiting NIR&#8208;II absorptions around 1300&#8211;1400&#160;nm and unexpected mixed aromatic/antiaromatic characters. It is anticipated that this line of research provides a new approach for heteroatom&#8208;doping engineering and constructing novel charged &#960;&#8208;molecules, with deeper insights into their redox&#8208;amphoteric features and aromaticity manipulation.

         <title>Probing Inside the Catalyst Layer on Gas Diffusion Electrodes in Electrochemical Reduction of CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind in situ confocal Raman spectroscopy technique is developed to probe the cross&#8208;section of catalyst layers in gas diffusion electrodes during CO(2) reduction reactions. For CORR in alkaline medium, the active region is identified by CO adsorption bands. In CO2RR in acidic electrolyte, CS&#8208;Raman spectroscopy reveals that only regions with elevated pH are active.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are widely used in electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CO(2)RR) in flow cells due to their ability to alleviate mass transport limitations of gaseous reactants. The flow cell configuration makes uniform distribution of reactants, intermediates, products, and speciation within the catalyst layer (CL) unlikely. In this work, a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind in situ characterization technique capable of probing the cross section of the CL with confocal Raman spectroscopy was developed to investigate the speciation distribution across the Cu CL in CO(2)RR with a spatial resolution of &#8764;4&#160;&#181;m. In both CORR in alkaline medium and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte, the active region of CL was identified as that with the presence of the Raman band for adsorbed CO (COad). The strong correlation of COad and CO32&#8722; bands provides the first spectroscopic evidence that CO2RR only occurs in an alkaline microenvironment.

         <title>Simultaneous Activation of Bicyclobutanes and Indolyl Alcohols with HFIP: Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Bicyclo[3.1.1]Heptanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indole&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.1.1.]heptanes were synthesized by the (3&#160;+&#160;3) annulation of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with indolyl alcohols through dual activation with 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol (HFIP). HFIP activates BCBs to ester enolates and indolyl alcohols to cationic indolenium species. This method is straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits good functional group compatibility.








Abstract
The concept of strain release to unleash unique reactivity that drives a wide range of synthetically valuable transformations has long intrigued chemists. Among the various strained systems, highly reactive bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently emerged as versatile building blocks for constructing bicyclic scaffolds. Despite the existence of various activation pathways for BCBs, the use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol (HFIP) to activate BCBs has not been realized so far. Herein, we report the first HFIP&#8208;promoted (3&#160;+&#160;3) annulation of BCBs with indolyl alcohols through the simultaneous activation of both partners, facilitating the metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free synthesis of indole&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Mechanistic studies reveal the role of HFIP in activating both components, and the reaction proceeds by an initial (3&#160;+&#160;2) annulation followed by a ring expansion/aromatization cascade.

         <title>Competition between One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Electron Unimolecular Reactions of Late 3d&#8208;Metal Complexes [(Me3SiCH2)nM]&#8211;(M = Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu; n = 2&#8211;4)</title>

         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and theoretical calculations on a series of model complexes determine the intrinsic tendencies of the late 3d metals to undergo one&#8208;versus two&#8208;electron reactions and unravel the factors controlling the selectivity.








Abstract
Although organometallic complexes of the late 3d elements are known to undergo both one&#8208;and two&#8208;electron reactions, their relative propensities to do so remain poorly understood. To gain direct insight into the competition between these different pathways, we have analyzed the unimolecular gas&#8208;phase reactivity of a series of well&#8208;defined model complexes [(Me3SiCH2)nM]&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu; n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;4). Applying a combination of tandem&#8208;mass spectrometry, quantum&#8208;chemical computations, and statistical rate&#8208;theory calculations, we find several different fragmentation reactions, among which the homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;carbon bonds and radical dissociations are particularly prominent. In all cases, these one&#8208;electron reactions are entropically favored. For the ferrate and cobaltate complexes, they are also energetically preferred, which explains their predominance in the corresponding fragmentation experiments. For [(Me3SiCH2)4Ni]&#8722; and, even more so, for [(Me3SiCH2)4Cu]&#8722;, a concerted reductive elimination as a prototypical two&#8208;electron reaction is energetically more favorable and gains in importance. [(Me3SiCH2)3Ni]&#8722; is special in that it has two nearly degenerate spin states, both of which react in different ways. A simple thermochemical analysis shows that the relative order of the first and second bond&#8208;dissociation energies is of key importance in controlling the competition between radical dissociations and concerted reductive eliminations.

&lt;/i&gt;M]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;4). Applying a combination of tandem-mass spectrometry, quantum-chemical computations, and statistical rate-theory calculations, we find several different fragmentation reactions, among which the homolytic cleavage of metal-carbon bonds and radical dissociations are particularly prominent. In all cases, these one-electron reactions are entropically favored. For the ferrate and cobaltate complexes, they are also energetically preferred, which explains their predominance in the corresponding fragmentation experiments. For [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ni]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and, even more so, for [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cu]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, a concerted reductive elimination as a prototypical two-electron reaction is energetically more favorable and gains in importance. [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is special in that it has two nearly degenerate spin states, both of which react in different ways. A simple thermochemical analysis shows that the relative order of the first and second bond-dissociation energies is of key importance in controlling the competition between radical dissociations and concerted reductive eliminations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecularly Designed Cathode for Copper&#8208;Benzimidazole&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction to MeOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular cathode incorporating a strategically designed copper&#8208;benzimidazole&#8208;based electrocatalyst was developed for direct CO&#8322; capture and electrochemical conversion to methanol (e&#8208;MeOH). This system follows a formato pathway, utilizing water as a proton source and thus eliminating the need for H&#8322; in e&#8208;MeOH production. The mechanism of methanol formation has been investigated by DFT calculations. The electrode's stability and recyclability were thoroughly evaluated through multiple controlled potential electrolysis experiments.








Abstract
Conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) into value&#8208;added products is aimed to develop scalable technologies to promote a circular economy. While the electrochemical reduction of CO&#8322; to carbon monoxide (CO) and formic acid has advanced significantly, a major challenge remains achieving further reduced and more energy&#8208;dense products, such as methanol (MeOH), through sustainable pathways. Herein, we report a molecular electrode capable of direct six&#8208;electron reduction of CO&#8322; to MeOH using water as a proton source with a global Faradaic efficiency (FEG) of 22% and product selectivity of 61% for MeOH. The design consists of an active copper&#8208;hydride center surrounded by two closely spaced benzimidazole&#8211;hydride units, facilitating the catalytic transfer of three hydrides to produce MeOH. The concurrent formation of formic acid and the absence of formaldehyde suggest that MeOH is generated via a formato pathway. DFT investigations revealed the complete mechanistic pathway, which supports the experimental observations. The morphology and stability of the electrode were evaluated before and after prolonged electrolysis (12&#160;h) experiments using electron microscopic techniques.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transport Divergence in Ultrastable Heterometal&#8208;Oxo Clusters Exerting Significant Effect on Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difference in orbital hybridization between heterometallic elements in heterometal&#8208;oxo clusters Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A (M&#160;=&#160;Ti, Zr, and Hf) has a significant effect on the distribution of frontier molecular orbital energy levels, resulting in the transmission of photogenerated electrons to different active sites, thus leading to different catalytic activities.








Abstract
The transfer path of photogenerated charges greatly affects the final photocatalytic performance, but this important fact has not been clearly demonstrated experimentally. Here, we construct an ultrastable crystalline catalytic system including three heterometal&#8208;oxo clusters, Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A (M&#160;=&#160;group IVB metal&#8208;Ti/Zr/Hf), which include cubic metal&#8208;oxo cluster core with eight Bi atoms at the vertices, one M atom at the body center, and six M atoms above the cubic face centers. It is worth noted that the change of group IVB elements in Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A can specifically modulate the LUMO&#8208;HOMO orbitals to distribute on different active metal atoms. This allows it to be an excellent model system to verify the effect of the transport paths of photogenerated charges on photoreactivity. In model reaction based on CO2 photoreduction, Bi8Ti7&#8208;TBC4A displays superior photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion rate of 3580.02&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Bi8Zr7&#8208;TBC4A and 4 times that of Bi8Hf7&#8208;TBC4A. In situ characterization accompanied by density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the difference in orbital hybridization between Bi and IVB group elements largely affects the orbital distribution of frontier molecular orbital levels in Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A, leading to the transport of photogenerated charges to metal active sites with different reactivities, and thus widely differing photocatalytic performances. This is the first model catalyst system that explores the effect of different photogenerated charge transport pathways on photoreactivity.

         <title>Unusual MurC Ligase and Peptidoglycan Discovered in Lachnospiraceae Using a Fluorescent L&#8208;Amino Acid Based Selective Labeling Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid probe that can selectively label the family Lachnospiraceae in vivo and in vitro is reported. The labeling position of LAA probe is the 1st amino acid of the bacterial PGN stem peptide. The unusually large volume of the inner space in the crystal structure of Roseburia faecis MurC implies its higher tolerance for substrates to some extent.








Abstract
Developing selective labeling probes for specific bacterial taxa can not only facilitate the study of target bacteria but also deepen our understanding of the microbial diversity at structural and molecular levels. The availability of such probes, however, remains very limited. In this study, by exploiting the variation of amino acids in peptidoglycan stem peptide, we designed a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid probe and found that it can selectively target the family Lachnospiraceae (a major Gram&#8208;positive family in murine gut microbiome) in vivo. The following in vitro test using two Roseburia species belonging to this family validated labeling by the probe. We then discovered that the labeling site is the first amino acid (L&#8208;alanine in most bacteria), which links the stem peptide with N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid, a process catalyzed by a highly conserved enzyme MurC. An enzyme assay of Roseburia MurC demonstrated its ability to conjugate a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid and other non&#8208;L&#8208;Ala amino acids to UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid. Subsequent X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis uncovered a substantially enlarged inner space in this enzyme, which can partially explain its tolerance to these atypical substrates. The resulting unusual peptidoglycan structures lead to significantly reduced activation of the NOD immune receptors, suggesting a new mechanism for the host to accommodate these highly abundant commensals.

         <title>Compacting Molecular Stacking and Inhibiting Self&#8208;Aggregation in Fullerene Transporting Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphate&#8208;substituted fullerene derivative, FuPE, is developed and blended with PCBM to increase crystallinity, compact molecular stacking, and improve the compatibility of electron transport layers in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The FuPE:PCBM blend presents higher electron mobility, more complete coverage, and suppressed self&#8208;aggregation, and thus enables PSCs to achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies up to 26% with enhanced stability.








Abstract
The underdevelopment of electron transport layer (ETL) materials remains a critical bottleneck limiting the overall photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Fullerene derivatives, such as PCBM, are widely employed ETL materials in PSCs due to their excellent electron affinity and energy level alignment with the perovskite layer. However, PCBM suffers from high energy disorder, self&#8208;aggregation predilection, and insufficient defect passivation ability, leading to significant charge carrier recombination and accumulation at interfaces. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;substituted fullerene derivative, FuPE, is developed to enhance the performance of PCBM&#8208;based ETLs for PSCs. Incorporating FuPE efficiently compacts molecular stacking, enforces crystallinity and intermolecular interaction, suppresses self&#8208;aggregation, and improves interfacial compatibility of the FuPE:PCBM blend. Such endows the FuPE:PCBM blend film with enhanced electron mobility (0.183&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), lower trap density, more uniform film morphology, and superior defect&#8208;passivation ability, compared to the PCBM pristine one. Consequently, PSCs employing FuPE:PCBM as the ETL achieve reduced trap&#8208;assisted recombination, enhanced charge carrier extraction, and thus a remarkable power conversion efficiency exceeding 26% alongside improved operational stability. This work highlights an effective strategy for optimizing fullerene&#8208;based ETLs, advancing the development of highly efficient and durable PSCs.

         <title>C&#9472;S Bonds Modulated Nanointerface Tension to Create Stable Magnetic Hollow Nanocarbons for Efficient Microplastics Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new perspective in creating structural stable, well&#8208;defined hollow nanostructures by modulating nanointerface tension via C&#9472;S bonds. Practiced from this stability design principle, a functional integrated magnetic hollow nanocarbons featuring an increased contact area, magnetically facilitated mass transfer, and a sulfur&#8208;modified surface, achieves high&#8208;capacity, rapid, and widely adaptable microplastics capture.








Abstract
Microplastic pollution poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Hollow nanomaterials are promising adsorbents for microplastics remediation due to their tailorable architectures, functions, and large contact area. Nevertheless, the structural stability of well&#8208;defined nanostructures has always been a critical factor, and understanding the stability principle is desired. Herein, we fabricated magnetic hollow nanocarbons as &#8220;nano&#8208;analytical tool&#8221;, revealing that the stability is related to additional pressure caused by nanointerface tension at curved carbon shell surface. To mitigate this, we introduced C&#9472;S bonds by sulfurizing carbon matrix, suppressing the condensation of oxygen&#8208;containing groups and thereby reducing interface tension. As a showcase, the stable hollow Fe3O4@C/S enabled rapid and efficient microplastics capture (100% within 10 s, 53 600&#160;mg g&#8722;1 capacity) under an alternating magnetic field, owing to the magnetically accelerated mass transfer and increased contact area. Additionally, sulfur modification broadens applicability range where carbon surface is oppositely charged to microplastics, expanding the universality in capturing multiple types of microplastics, even under challenging conditions including different pH and salinities. This work offers guidance into the precise synthesis of hollow nanomaterials from nanointerface perspective. The design principles involving sulfur modification and high&#8208;contact area may open prospects for high&#8208;capacity microplastics capture in complex aquatic environments.

         <title>Isolation of a Square Pyramidal Bis(amidophenolate)&#8208;Supported As(III)&#8208;Cation: Coordination&#8208;Induced Electromerism at As</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When a bis(amidophenolate)&#8208;supported As(III)&#8208;center is treated with typical two&#8208;electron donors, a coordination&#8208;induced electromerism induces the oxidation of the central atom to As(V) with concomitant reduction of the redox&#8208;active ligand. Due to this triggerable electronic reorganization, the As&#8208;center remains a remarkable Lewis acid and can be used as initiator for transfer hydrogenation reactions. 








Abstract
The synthesis and structural characterization of a slightly distorted square pyramidal arsenium cation is reported. Spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational evidence indicate that coordination of typical Lewis bases to the As(III)&#8208;center induces its oxidation to As(V) with concomitant reduction of the supporting, redox&#8208;active bis(amidophenolate) ligand. That reaction is reversible and represents a well&#8208;defined example of base&#8208;induced electromerism in an As&#8208;complex. Single electron reduction of the same As(III) species initially generates a ligand&#8208;centered radical, which is persistent enough to be observed by EPR but slowly decays to a heterodimer. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the utility of the As(III)&#8208;cation as initiator for transfer hydrogenation reactions.
