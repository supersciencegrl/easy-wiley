      <title>Flapping Peryleneimide as a Fluorogenic Dye with High Photostability and Strong Visible&#8208;Light Absorption</title>
      <dc:description>Flapping fluorophores (FLAP) with a flexible 8&#960; ring are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile photofunctional system. Here we report a highly photostable &#8220;flapping peryleneimide&#8221; with an unprecedented fluorogenic mechanism based on a bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar conformational change in the S  1  excited state. The S  1  planarization induces an electronic configurational switch, almost quenching an inherent fluorescence (FL) of peryleneimide moieties. However, the FL quantum yield is remarkably improved with a prolonged lifetime by a slight environmental change. This fluorogenic function is realized by sensitive &#960;&#8208;conjugation design, as a more &#960;&#8208;expanded analogue does not show the planarization dynamics. With strong visible&#8208;light absorption, the FL lifetime response synchronized with the flexible flapping motion is useful for the latest optical techniques such as FL lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Monofunctionalization Enabled by Reaction History&#8208;Dependent Communication in Catalytic Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>Selective monofunctionalization of substrates with distant, yet equally&#8208;reactive functional groups is difficult to achieve, as it requires the second functional group to selectively modulate its reactivity once the first functional group has reacted.&#160;We now show that mechanically&#8208;interlocked catalytic rings can effectively regulate the reactivity of stoppering groups in rotaxanes over a distance of ~2&#160;nm.

Our method not only led to a rare example of selective monofunctionalization, but also to a &#8220;molecular if function&#8221;.

      <title>In&#8208;situ Spectroscopy of Calcium Fluoride&#8208;anchored Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Thin&#8208;Films during Gas Sorption</title>
      <dc:description>Surface&#8208;mounted Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (SURMOFs) show promising behavior for a manifold of applications. As MOF thin&#8208;films are often unsuitable for conventional characterization techniques, understanding their advantageous properties over their bulk counterparts presents a great analytical challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that MOFs can be grown on calcium fluoride (CaF  2  ) windows after proper functionalization. As CaF  2  &#160;is optically (in the IR&#8208; and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;range of the spectrum) transparent, this allows to study SURMOFs using a conventional spectroscopic tool typically used during catalysis or gas sorption. Hence, we have measured HKUST&#8208;1 during the adsorption of CO and NO. We show that no copper oxide impurities are observed and also confirmed that SURMOFs grown by a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) approach possess Cu  +  &#8208;species in paddlewheel confirmation, but 1.9 times less than in bulk HKUST&#8208;1. The developed methodology paves the way for studying the interaction of any adsorbed gases with thin&#8208;films; not limited to MOFs, low temperature or these specific probe molecules, pushing the boundaries of our current understanding of functional porous materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;II: Outlook</title>
      <dc:description>
Exploring the possibilities: This two&#8208;part Review evaluates the contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. This second part reflects on exemplary case studies introduced in the first part. A set of open research directions in terms of both practical and methodological challenges are defined; addressing these would advance the extent to which these systems can make meaningful discoveries.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to &#8220;discover&#8221; despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants. We must carefully consider how they have been and can be applied to future problems of chemical discovery in order to effectively design and interact with future autonomous platforms. The majority of this Review defines a large set of open research directions, including improving our ability to work with complex data, build empirical models, automate both physical and computational experiments for validation, select experiments, and evaluate whether we are making progress towards the ultimate goal of autonomous discovery. Addressing these practical and methodological challenges will greatly advance the extent to which autonomous systems can make meaningful discoveries.

      <title>Facile Preparation of WO3&#8208;x Dots with Remarkably Low Toxicity and Uncompromised Activity as Coreactants for Clinic Electrochemiluminescent Diagnosis</title>
      <dc:description>The exceptional nature of WO3&#8208;x  dots has inspired widespread interests, but it is still a significant challenge to synthesize high&#8208;quality WO3&#8208;x  dots without using unstable reactants, expensive equipment, and complex synthetic processes. Herein, we report the synthesis of ligand&#8208;free WO3&#8208;x  dots that were highly dispersible and rich in oxygen&#8208;vacancies by a simple but straightforward exfoliation of bulk WS2  and a mild follow&#8208;up chemical conversion. Surprisingly, the WO3&#8208;x  dots were emerged as coreactants for the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of Ru(bpy)32+  with a comparable ECL efficiency to the well&#8208;known Ru(bpy)32+  /tripropylamine (TPrA) system. Moreover, compared to TPrA, whose toxicity remains a critical issue of concern, the WO3&#8208;x  dots were ~300&#8208;fold lower toxic. The potent of WO3&#8208;x  dots was further explored in a showcase for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with the most competitive limit of detection so far. This work would not only open a new way to synthesize WO3&#8208;x  dots with superior properties but also stimulate an emerging application in clinic ECL diagnosis as coreactants with uncompromised high performance and unprecedented low toxicity.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The exceptional nature of WO3&#8208;x  dots has inspired widespread interests, but it is still a significant challenge to synthesize high&#8208;quality WO3&#8208;x  dots without using unstable reactants, expensive equipment, and complex synthetic processes. Herein, we report the synthesis of ligand&#8208;free WO3&#8208;x  dots that were highly dispersible and rich in oxygen&#8208;vacancies by a simple but straightforward exfoliation of bulk WS2  and a mild follow&#8208;up chemical conversion. Surprisingly, the WO3&#8208;x  dots were emerged as coreactants for the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of Ru(bpy)32+  with a comparable ECL efficiency to the well&#8208;known Ru(bpy)32+  /tripropylamine (TPrA) system. Moreover, compared to TPrA, whose toxicity remains a critical issue of concern, the WO3&#8208;x  dots were ~300&#8208;fold lower toxic. The potent of WO3&#8208;x  dots was further explored in a showcase for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with the most competitive limit of detection so far. This work would not only open a new way to synthesize WO3&#8208;x  dots with superior properties but also stimulate an emerging application in clinic ECL diagnosis as coreactants with uncompromised high performance and unprecedented low toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Designable Aluminum Molecular Rings: Ring Expansion and Ligand Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Presented here are the Al(III) molecular ring architectures from 8&#8208;ring to 16&#8208;ring. Although there are numerous reported cyclic coordination compounds based on transition metals, gallium, or lanthanides, so far the Al molecular are less developed due to the fast hydrolysis nature of Al 3+  ion. In this work, with the assistant of different monohydric alcohol, a series of atomic precisely aluminum molecular rings based on benzoates have been successfully synthesized. The ring expansion of these Al&#8208;rings from 8&#8208;ring to 16&#8208;ring is related to the structure&#8208;directing agents of monohydric alcohols. Moreover, the organic ligands on the Al&#8208;ring can be properly modified by using various benzoate derivatives, which lead to tunable surface properties of these Al&#8208;rings from hydrophilicity to ultra&#8208;hydrophobicity. Importantly, 4&#8208;aminobenzoic acid bridged 16&#8208;ring is soluble in organic solvents and exhibits high solution stability revealed by mass spectroscopy. Ligand substitution also can be performed between these Al&#8208;rings, which reveal controllable ligand functionalization of these Al&#8208;rings. This family of Al&#8208;rings with the ability to be post&#8208;modified therefore can be considered and expected as interesting and potential lego&#8208;like nano&#8208;building units for reticular chemistry. Such a model of organic shell modification without alteration of the inorganic core structure opens a new platform to further tune the chemical&#8208;property and subsequent utilization of these promising Al&#8208;rings. This work not only reveals molecular ring architectures assembled from Al 3+  ions and benzoates but also provides coordination delayed hydrolysis strategy toward the synthesis of crystalline Al(III)&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In a conjugated polymer based single&#8208;particle heterojunction, stochastic fluctuations of the photogenerated hole population lead to spontaneous fluorescence switching. We found that 405 nm irradiation can induce charge recombination and activate the single&#8208;particle emission. Based on these phenomena, we developed a novel class of semiconducting polymer dots that can operate in two superresolution imaging modes. The spontaneous switching mode offers efficient imaging of large areas, with &lt;10 nm localization precision, while the photoactivation/deactivation mode offers slower imaging, with further improved localization precision (~1 nm), showing advantages in resolving small structures that require high spatial resolution.

The excellent localization precision and versatile imaging options provided by these nanoparticles offer clear advantages for imaging of various biological systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Illuminating Initial Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation during the Early Stages of Methane Dehydroaromatization</title>
      <dc:description>Still in 2020, methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) is among the most challenging processes in catalysis science due to the inherent harsh reaction conditions and fast catalyst deactivation. To improve it further, understanding the initial C&#8208;C bond formation mechanism is sine qua non. However, consensus about the actual reaction mechanism is still to be achieved. In this work, using advanced magic angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, we study in detail the early stages of the reaction over a well&#8208;dispersed Mo/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst. Simultaneous detection of acetylene (i.e., presumably the direct C&#8208;C bond forming product from methane), methylidene, allenes, acetal and surface&#8208;formate species along with the typical olefinic/aromatic species allow us to conclude the existence of two independent C&#8208;H activation pathways. Moreover, this study emphasizes the significance of mobility&#8208;dependent host&#8208;guest chemistry between inorganic zeolite and its organic trapped species during heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

A variety of cages can be achieved by applying dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC), which are less chemical stable.

      <title>Enzymatically&#8208;Formed Peptide Assemblies Sequestrate Proteins and Relocate Inhibitors for Selectively Killing Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Here we show that enzymatic reaction generates peptide assemblies to sequestrate proteins for selectively killing cancer cells.  A phosphopeptide bearing the antagonistic motif (AVPI) to the inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) enters cancer cells and normal cells via caveolin&#8208;dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis, respectively. The AVPI&#8208;bearing peptide assemblies in the cytosol sequestrate IAPs and sensitize the cancer cells to bortezomib (BTZ), a proteasome inhibitor, but rescue the normal cells (i.e., HS&#8208;5) by trafficking the BTZ into lysosomes. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) acts as a context&#8208;dependent signal for trafficking the peptide/BTZ assemblies and selectively inducing the death of the cancer cells. The assemblies of AVPI exhibit enhanced proteolytic resistance. This work, being the first example of utilizing the endocytic difference of enzymatically formed peptide assemblies for selective killing cancer cells, promises a new way to develop selective cancer therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Disintegrants: A New Generation of Enzyme Preparation Platforms with Boosted Activity</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;performance enzyme preparation plays critical roles to realize enzymes&#8217; practical applications. We developed a new generation of enzyme formulation platforms using customized enzyme activators (e.g., metal ions) to directly construct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as protective carriers of the enzymes. More interestingly, these MOF carriers can also serve as the &#8217;disintegrating agents&#8217; that are disintegrable to simultaneously release enzymes and their activators during biocatalysis with boosted activities. For the first time, this highly efficient enzyme preparation platform combines the benefits of enzyme immobilization (enhanced stability, easy operation) and homogeneous biocatalysis (fast diffusion, high activity). Notably, the MOF serves as &#8216;ion pump&#8217; that continuously provides metal ion activators who greatly promote the enzymatic activities (up to 251%). Moreover, this MOF&#8208;enzyme composite demonstrated an excellent protective effect against various perturbation environments. An in&#8208;depth mechanism investigation revealed that the spontaneous activator/enzyme&#8208;releasing and ion&#8208;pumping effects enable enzymes to sufficiently interact with their activators due to the proximity effects and lead to boost of biocatalytic performance, while directly adding activators into enzyme solution leads to much lower activation efficiency. This study opens up the new avenue for high&#8208;performance enzyme preparation, and will significantly promote the broad application of enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>An interface bridged organic&#8208;inorganic&#160;layer suppressing dendrite&#160;and side reactions&#160;for ultra&#8208;long&#160;life&#160;aqueous&#160;Zn metal anodes</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#160;(Zn)&#160;batteries (AZBs) are widely considered as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage owing to its excellent safety feature. However, the application of Zn anode is hindered by severe dendrite formation and side reactions. Herein an&#160;interfacial bridged organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid&#160;protection layer&#160;(Nafion&#8208;Zn&#8208;X)&#160;is developed&#160;by complexing inorganic&#160;Zn&#8208;X zeolite nanoparticles with&#160;Nafion, which shifts&#160;ion transport from channel transport in Nafion to hopping mechanism in organic&#8208;inorganic interface. This unique organic&#8208;inorganic&#160;structure&#160;is found to effectively suppress dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn anode. Consequently, Zn@Nafion&#8208;Zn&#8208;X&#160;composite&#160;anode delivers&#160;high coulombic efficiency (~97%), deep Zn plating/stripping (10 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) and long cycle life (over 10000 cycles). By tackling the intrinsic chemical/electrochemical issues, the proposed strategy provides a versatile remedy for the limited cycle life of Zn anode.</dc:description>

Herein an&#160;interfacial bridged organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid&#160;protection layer&#160;(Nafion&#8208;Zn&#8208;X)&#160;is developed&#160;by complexing inorganic&#160;Zn&#8208;X zeolite nanoparticles with&#160;Nafion, which shifts&#160;ion transport from channel transport in Nafion to hopping mechanism in organic&#8208;inorganic interface. This unique organic&#8208;inorganic&#160;structure&#160;is found to effectively suppress dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn anode. Consequently, Zn@Nafion&#8208;Zn&#8208;X&#160;composite&#160;anode delivers&#160;high coulombic efficiency (~97%), deep Zn plating/stripping (10 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) and long cycle life (over 10000 cycles). By tackling the intrinsic chemical/electrochemical issues, the proposed strategy provides a versatile remedy for the limited cycle life of Zn anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Miniaturized lasers with high spectral purity and wide wavelength tunability  are crucial for various photonic  applications. Here we propose a strategy to realize broadband tunable single&#8208;mode lasing based on photoisomerization activated intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) process in coupled polymer microdisk cavities. The photoisomerizable  molecules doped in the polymer microdisks can be quantitatively transformed into a kind of laser dyes with strong ICT characters by photoexcitation. The gain region was tailored over a wide range through the self&#8208;modulation of the optically activated ICT isomers. Meanwhile, the resonant modes shifted with the photoisomerization due to an effective refractive index change of the polymer microdisk cavity. Based on the synergetic modulation of optical gain and microcavity, we realized the broadband tuning of the single&#8208;mode laser.

      <title>Graphene&#8208;like Covalent Organic Framework with Wide Bandgap Synthesized On Surface via Stepwise Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Developing graphene&#8208;like two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials naturally possessing a bandgap has sparked enormous interest. Thanks to the inherent wide bandgap and high mobility in the 2D plane, covalent organic frameworks containing triazine rings (  t  &#8208;COFs) hold great promise in this regard, whilst synthesis of single&#8208;layer  t  &#8208;COFs remains highly challenging. Herein, well&#8208;defined, graphene&#8208;like  t  &#8208;COF has been fabricated on Au(111). Instead of one/multiple&#8208;step(s) single&#8208;type reactions commonly applied for on&#8208;surface synthesis, distinct stepwise on&#8208;surface reactions, including alkynyl cyclotrimerization, C&#8211;O bond cleavage, and C&#8211;H bond activation, are triggered on&#8208;demand, leading to the product evolution step&#8208;by&#8208;step in a controlled manner. Besides the precise control in sophisticated on&#8208;surface synthesis, this work proposes a single atomic&#8208;layer organic semiconductor with a wide bandgap of 3.41 eV.</dc:description>

      <title>Formation and structure of fluorescent silver nanoclusters at interfacial binding sites facilitating oligomerization of DNA hairpins</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent, DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA&#8208;AgNCs) are applied in a range of applications within nanoscience and nanotechnology. However, their diverse optical properties, mechanism of formation, and aspects of their composition remain unexplored, making the rational design of nanocluster probes challenging.

      <title>Cyclopropenylmethyl Cation &#8211; A Concealed Intermediate in Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The last years have witnessed many gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkynes. One of the most prominent species in the reaction of two alkyne units is the vinyl&#8208;substituted gold vinylidene intermediate. Here, we were able to show that the reaction of a haloacetylene and an alkyne proceeds via a hitherto overlooked intermediate, namely the cyclopropenylmethyl cation. The existence and relative stability of this concealed intermediate is verified by quantum chemical calculations and  13  C&#8208;labeling experiments. A comparison between the cyclopropenylmethyl cation and the well&#8208;known vinylidene intermediate reveals that the latter is more stable only for smaller cycles. However, this stability reverses in larger cycles. In case of the smallest representative of both species, the vinylidene cation is the transition state en route to the cyclopropenylmethyl cation. The uncovering of this intermediate should help to get a deeper understanding for gold&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions of alkynes. Furthermore, since enynes can be formed from the cyclopropenylmethyl cation, the inclusion of this intermediate should enable the development of new synthetic methods for the construction of larger  cyclic  halo and non&#8208;halogenated conjugated enyne systems.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Methanation of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) is attractive within the context of a renewable energy refinery. Herein, we report an indirect methanation method that harnesses amino&#8208;alcohols as relay molecules in combination with a catalyst comprising ruthenium nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on a Lewis acidic and robust metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). The Ru NPs are well dispersed on the surface of the MOF crystals and have a narrow size distribution. The catalyst efficiently transforms amino&#8208;alcohols to oxazolidinones (upon reaction with CO  2  ) and then to methane (upon reaction with hydrogen), simultaneously regenerating the amino&#8208;alcohol relay molecule. This protocol provides a sustainable, indirect way for CO  2  methanation as the process can be repeated multiple times.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window facilitated by aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is an emerging research field. NIR&#8208;II AIEgens overcome the bottlenecks of penetration depth and fluorescence efficiency, offering high&#8208;performance imaging with enhanced precision. Some reported NIR&#8208;II AIEgens demonstrate capabilities of fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging, and fluorescence imaging guided photothermal therapy, which not only improves diagnosis accuracy but provides an efficient theranostic platform to accelerate preclinical translation as well. This Minireview summarizes recent efforts on exploiting NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with regard to molecular design strategy and bioapplications, and puts forward current challenges and promising prospects. The presented timely sketch should benefit the further exploitation of diverse and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for a wide array of applications.</dc:description>

Some reported NIR&#8208;II AIEgens demonstrate capabilities of fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging, and fluorescence imaging guided photothermal therapy, which not only improves diagnosis accuracy but provides an efficient theranostic platform to accelerate preclinical translation as well. This Minireview summarizes recent efforts on exploiting NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with regard to molecular design strategy and bioapplications, and puts forward current challenges and promising prospects. The presented timely sketch should benefit the further exploitation of diverse and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for a wide array of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Surface Capping Agents and Their Roles in Shape&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A pivotal role in directing the growth of colloidal metal nanocrystals into diverse but well&#8208;controlled shapes is played by surface capping agents. This article offers a comprehensive review of capping agents as well as their use in engineering the surface structures and catalytic properties of metal nanocrystals.







Abstract
Surface capping agents have been extensively used to control the evolution of seeds into nanocrystals with diverse but well&#8208;controlled shapes. Here we offer a comprehensive review of these agents, with a focus on the mechanistic understanding of their roles in guiding the shape evolution of metal nanocrystals. We begin with a brief introduction to the early history of capping agents in electroplating and bulk crystal growth, followed by discussion of how they affect the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in a synthesis of metal nanocrystals. We then present representative examples to highlight the various capping agents, including their binding selectivity, molecular&#8208;level interaction with a metal surface, and impacts on the growth of metal nanocrystals. We also showcase progress in leveraging capping agents to generate nanocrystals with complex structures and/or enhance their catalytic properties. Finally, we discuss various strategies for the exchange or removal of capping agents, together with perspectives on future directions.

      <title>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Nanozyme with Both Accelerated and Inhibited Biocatalytic Activities Capable of Accessing Drug&#8208;Drug Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>Emerged as a cost&#8208;effective and robust enzyme mimic, nanozymes have drawn increasing attention with broad applications ranging from cancer therapy to biosensing. Developing nanozymes with both accelerated and inhibited biocatalytic properties in a biological context is intriguing to peruse more advanced functions of natural enzymes, but remains challenging, because most nanozymes are lack of enzyme&#8208;like molecular structures. By re&#8208;visiting and engineering the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst that has a heme&#8208;like Fe&#8208;N  x  active sites, herein, we report that Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C could not only catalyze drug metabolization but also had inhibition behaviors similar to cytochrome P450 (CYP), endowing it a potential replacement of CYP for preliminary evaluation of massive potential chemicals, drug dosing guide and outcome prediction. In addition, different to the electrocatalysts, the highly graphitic framework of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C may not be obligatory for a competitive CYP&#8208;like activity. Beyond merely boosting the activity, this work would open a new vista of nanozymes with inhibited behavior for keeping up more demanding applications, enabled by further mimicking the molecular structure of enzymes.</dc:description>

Here, we develop an allosteric EGFR degrader, DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163, which can selectively inhibit the proliferation of L858R/T790 (L/T) mutant Ba/F3 cells while leaving wildtype EGFR Ba/F3 cells unaffected. DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 is also effective against osimertinib&#8208;resistant cells with L/T/C797S and L/T/L718Q EGFR mutations. When combined with an ATP&#8208;site EGFR inhibitor, osimertinib, the anti&#8208;proliferative activity of DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 against L858R/T790M EGFR&#8208;Ba/F3 cells is enhanced. Collectively, DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 is a promising allosteric EGFR degrader with selective activity against various clinically relevant EGFR mutants as a single agent and when combined with an ATP&#8208;site inhibitor. Our data suggests that targeted protein degradation is a promising drug development approach for mutant EGFR.</dc:description>

      <title>The Mechanism of the Magnetodielectric Response in a Molecule&#8208;Based Trinuclear Iron Cluster Material</title>
      <dc:description>Magnetodielectric response mechanisms are critical for the rational design and synthesis of molecule&#8208;based magnetodielectric materials. Herein, the magnetodielectric response was investigated in the molecule&#8208;based material [Fe  3  O(CH  3  COO)  6  (py)  3  ](py) (  1  ). Its magnetodielectric coefficient (MD) is &#8208;2.8% for phase transition III and &#8208;4.1% for phase transition I. Study of the mechanism of the magnetodielectric response in  1  reveals that its magnetodielectric response at phase transition I is induced by the charge&#8208;frustration of the trinuclear iron cluster, while that at phase transition III is attributed to the spin&#8208;frustration of the trinuclear iron cluster, providing a new route for the design of magnetodielectric materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Dinickelaferrocene: Ferrocene Analogue with Two Aromatic Nickeloles Realized by Electron Back Donation from Fe</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the first example of ferrocene analogues with two transition&#8208;metal metallole ligands of the general formula (&#951;5&#8208;C4R4M)2Fe in a sandwich structure. Specifically, dinickelaferrocene 2, a type of dimetallametallocene, is efficiently synthesized from the reaction of dilithionickelole 1 with FeBr2 or FeCl2 presumably via a redox process, and is subjected to detailed experimental (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis, ICP&#8208;OES, magnetometry, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, XPS) and theoretical (MOs, CDA, NICS, ICSS, and AICD) characterizations. Unlike ferrocene and its Cp ligands, it is found that the aromaticity of dinickelaferrocene and its nickelole ligands is accomplished by electron back donation from the Fe 3d orbitals to the &#960;* orbitals of nickelole. Taken together, this work describes a new class of metallaferrocene sandwich complexes and provides a novel approach to effect aromaticity that will contribute to further development of metallocene chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Single Molecule Redox&#8208;targeting Reactions for a pH&#8208;neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have recently received considerable attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Among them, quinone derivatives such as 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonate (2,7&#8208;AQDS), have been explored intensively due to its potentially low cost and swift reaction kinetics. However, the low solubility in pH&#8208;neutral electrolytes restricts their application to corrosive acidic or caustic systems. Herein, we report the single molecule redox&#8208;targeting reactions of 2,7&#8208;AQDS anolyte to circumvent its solubility limit in pH&#8208;neutral electrolytes. Polyimide was employed as a low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity solid material to boost the capacity of 2,7&#8208;AQDS electrolyte to 97 Ah/L. Through  in&#8208;situ  FTIR spectroscopic study, a hydrogen&#8208;bonding mediated reaction mechanism was disclosed. In conjunction with NaI as catholyte and nickel hexacyanoferrate as the catholyte capacity booster, a single molecule redox&#8208;targeting reaction&#8208;based full cell with energy density up to 39 Wh/L was demonstrated.</dc:description>

In conjunction with NaI as catholyte and nickel hexacyanoferrate as the catholyte capacity booster, a single molecule redox&#8208;targeting reaction&#8208;based full cell with energy density up to 39 Wh/L was demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Excimer and Exciplex Formation in Gold(I) Complexes Preconditioned by Aurophilic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Bond formation through excitation: Linear, two&#8208;coordinate gold(I) complexes are known to aggregate side&#8208;on through aurophilic interactions. The resulting weak Au&#8211;Au contacts are strengthened upon UV irradiation as evidenced by a shortening of the intermetallic distance and the vibrational and electronic absorption and emission characteristics of the resulting excimers. The changes in the redox potentials make [AuI&#8722;AuI]* excimers useful intermediates in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Excimers and exciplexes are defined as assemblies of atoms or molecules A/A&#8242; where interatomic/intermolecular bonding appears only in excited states such as [A2]* (for excimers) and [AA&#8242;]* (for exciplexes). Their formation has become widely known because of their role in gas&#8208;phase laser technologies, but their significance in general chemistry terms has been given little attention. Recent investigations in gold chemistry have opened up a new field of excimer and exciplex chemistry that relies largely on the preorganization of gold(I) compounds (electronic configuration AuI(5d10)) through aurophilic contacts. In the corresponding excimers, a new type of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au bonding arises, with bond energies and lengths approaching those of ground&#8208;state Au&#8722;Au bonds between metal atoms in the Au0(5d106s1) and AuII(5d9) configurations. Excimer formation gives rise to a broad range of photophysical effects, for which some of the relaxation dynamics have recently been clarified. Excimers have also been shown to play an important role in photoredox binuclear gold catalysis.

      <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;I: Progress</title>
      <dc:description>
The contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences is discussed in this two&#8208;part Review. This first part describes how discoveries of physical matter, processes, and models are unified as search problems; what to consider when assessing the extent of autonomy in a discovery; and many examples of discoveries in synthetic chemistry, drug discovery, inorganic chemistry, and materials science.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this first part, we describe a classification for discoveries of physical matter (molecules, materials, devices), processes, and models and how they are unified as search problems. We then introduce a set of questions and considerations relevant to assessing the extent of autonomy. Finally, we describe many case studies of discoveries accelerated by or resulting from computer assistance and automation from the domains of synthetic chemistry, drug discovery, inorganic chemistry, and materials science. These illustrate how rapid advancements in hardware automation and machine learning continue to transform the nature of experimentation and modeling. Part two reflects on these case studies and identifies a set of open challenges for the field.

      <title>Maximization of Spatial Charge Density: An Approach to Ultrahigh Energy Density of Capacitive Charge Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Capacitive energy storage possesses the advantages of high power density, long lifespan, and good security, but is severely restricted by its low energy density. Inspired by the charge storage mechanism of batteries, we develop a spatial charge density (SCD) maximization strategy to compensate this shortage by densely and neatly packing the ionic charges in capacitive materials. Accordingly, a record high SCD of ~550 C cm&#8722;3  was achieved by balancing the valance and size of charge&#8208;carrier ions and matching the ion sizes with the pore structure of electrode materials, which is nearly five times higher than those of conventional ones (~120 C cm&#8722;3  ). The maximization of SCD was confirmed by Monte Carlo calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy. As a result, a full&#8208;cell supercapacitor was constructed and it delivers an ultrahigh energy density of 165 W h L&#8722;1  at the power density of 150 W L&#8722;1  , and retains 120 W h L&#8722;1  even at 36 kW L&#8722;1  , opening a pathway towards high energy density capacitive energy storages.</dc:description>

      <title>Mixed Anionic and Cationic Redox Chemistry in a Tetrathiomolybdate Amorphous Coordination Framework</title>
      <dc:description>We report the electrochemistry of a hitherto unexplored Na2MoS4  phase as conversion electrode material for Na&#8208; and Li&#8208;cation reversible storage. The material adopts an amorphous coordination polymer structure, with mixed Mo and S valences. Ex&#8208;situ XPS and in&#8208;situ XRD analysis reveal a complex interplay between Mo and S redox, while excluding the formation of free sulfur, lithium sulfide or other crystalline phases. Na2MoS4  behaves as a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor, with electronic conductivity of 6.1 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  , that allowed the use of this material without any conductive carbon in an electrochemical cell. A reversible capacity of 500 mAh g  &#8208;1  is attained corresponding to 5&#8208;electron redox exchange, with the end&#8208;member reaching from Na&lt;1MoS4  to Na&gt;5MoS4  .

      <dc:description>We report core@satellite Janus mesoporous silica&#8211;Pt@Au (JMPA) nanomotors that are capable of pH&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;phoretic propulsion. The JMPA nanomotors first undergo self&#8208;diffusiophoretic propulsion in 3.0% H2O2 due to the isolated status between Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and PtNPs layer. Then the weak acidity of H2O2 can trigger the disassembly and reassembly of AuNPs, resulting in the Janus distribution of large AuNPs aggregates. Such reconstruction of JMPA leads to the contact between PtNPs and AuNPs aggregates, thus tailoring the propulsion mechanism to self&#8208;electrophoresis. The asymmetric and aggregated AuNPs also enable the generation of thermal gradient under laser irradiation, which propels the JMPA nanomotors by self&#8208;thermophoresis.

      <title>Hydrochromic CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrochromic materials that can reversibly change color upon water treatment have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in diverse fields. Here, for the first time, we report that space&#8208;confined CsPbBr  3  &#160;nanocrystals (NCs) are hydrochromic. When CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs are loaded into a porous matrix, reversible transition between luminescent CsPbBr  3  &#160;and non&#8208;luminescent CsPb  2  Br  5  &#160;can be achieved upon the exposure/removal of water. The potential applications of hydrochromic CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs in anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated by using CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs@mesoporous silica nanospheres (around 100 nm) as the starting material. Due to the small particle size and negatively charged surface, the as&#8208;prepared particles can be laser&#8208;jet printed with high precision and high speed. We demonstrate the excellent stability over repeated transformation cycles without color fade.

      <title>Cellular Synthesis and Crystal Structure of a Designed Protein Heterocatenane</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the biosynthesis of protein heterocatenanes via a programmed sequence of multiple post&#8208;translational processing events including intramolecular chain entanglement, in situ backbone cleavage, and spontaneous cyclization. The approach is general, autonomous, and can obviate the need of any additional enzymes. The catenane topology was convincingly proven via combined techniques of SDS&#8208;PAGE, LC&#8208;MS, SEC, controlled proteolytic digestion, and protein crystallography. The crystal structure clearly shows two mechanically interlocked protein rings with intact folded domains. It opens new avenues to the nascent field of protein topology engineering.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the biosynthesis of protein heterocatenanes via a programmed sequence of multiple post&#8208;translational processing events including intramolecular chain entanglement, in situ backbone cleavage, and spontaneous cyclization. The approach is general, autonomous, and can obviate the need of any additional enzymes. The catenane topology was convincingly proven via combined techniques of SDS&#8208;PAGE, LC&#8208;MS, SEC, controlled proteolytic digestion, and protein crystallography. The crystal structure clearly shows two mechanically interlocked protein rings with intact folded domains. It opens new avenues to the nascent field of protein topology engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Catalytic AsymmetricElectrochemical&#945;&#8208;Arylation of Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Ketocarbonyls with Anodic Benzyne Intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>Asymmetric catalysis with benzyne remains elusive due to the highly fleeting and non&#8208;polar nature of benzyne intermediates. We reported herein an electrochemical approach for the oxidative generation of benzynes and cyclohexyne and its successful merging with chiral primary aminocatalysis, formulating the first catalytic asymmetric enamine&#8208;benzyne (cyclohexyne) coupling reaction. Cobalt acetate was identified to stabilize the in&#8208;situ generated arynes and facilitate its coupling with enamine. This catalytic enamine&#8208;benzyne protocol provides a concise method for the construction of diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl or cyclohexenyl quaternary carbon stereogenic centers with good stereoselectivities.</dc:description>
