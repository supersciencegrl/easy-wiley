      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Vicinal Dichlorination of Alkenes through LMCT Excitation of CuCl2</title>
      <dc:description>This work demonstrates photoredox vicinal dichlorination of alkenes, based on the homolysis of CuCl  2  in response to irradiation with visible light. This catalysis proceeds via a ligand to metal charge transfer process and provides an exciting opportunity for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dichloride compounds using an inexpensive, low molecular weight chlorine source. This new process exhibits a wide substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, extraordinarily mild conditions and does not require external ligands. Mechanistic studies show that the ready formation of chlorine atom radicals is responsible for the facile formation of C&#8211;Cl bonds in this synthetic process.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Strategy for Development of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probes for in vivo High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic&#8208;dye based NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes, owing to their high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deeper penetration, are highly useful for deep&#8208;tissue high&#8208;contrast imaging in vivo. However, due to the lack of suitable dyes, it is still a challenge to design activatable NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes. In this work, we have designed a novel class of polymethine dyes (NIRII&#8208;RTs) with bright (quantum yield up to 2.03%), stable and anti&#8208;solvent quenching NIR&#8208;II emission, together with large Stokes shifts. Significantly, unlike most of reported NIR&#8208;II fluorophores which show uncontrollable fluorescence, the novel NIR&#8208;II dyes NIRII&#8208;RT3 and NIRII&#8208;RT4 equipped with the functional carboxylic&#8208;acid group could serve as effective NIR&#8208;II platforms for the design of activatable bioimaging probe with high contrast. As a proof of concept, we synthesized a series of target&#8208;activatable NIRII&#8208;RT probes (NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;pH, NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;ATP &amp; NIRII&#8208;RT&#8208;Hg) for pH, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and metal ion detecting. By applying the NIRII&#8208;RT probe, we successfully realized the real&#8208;time monitoring of drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

      <title>DNA Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Attractor Patterns</title>
      <dc:description>Living systems can form and recover complex chemical patterns with precisely sized features in the ranges of tens or hundreds of microns. We show how designed reaction&#8208;diffusion processes can likewise produce precise patterns, termed attractor patterns, that reform their precise shape after being perturbed. We use oligonucleotide reaction networks, photolithography and microfluidic delivery to form precisely controlled attractor patterns and study the responses of these patterns to different localized perturbations. Linear and &#8216;hill&#8217;&#8208;shaped patterns formed and stabilized into shapes and at time scales consistent with reaction&#8208;diffusion models. When patterns were perturbed in particular locations with UV light, they reliably reformed their steady state profiles. Recovery also occurred after repeated perturbations. By designing the far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium dynamics of a chemical system, this study shows how it is possible to design spatial patterns of molecules that are sustained and regenerated by continually evolving towards a specific steady state configuration.</dc:description>

      <title>Concentration&#8208;dependent structural transition of the HIV&#8208;1 gp41 MPER peptide into &#945;&#8208;helical trimers</title>
      <dc:description>The membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV&#8208;1 gp41 contains epitopes for at least four broadly neutralizing antibodies. Depending on solution conditions and construct design, different structures have been reported for this segment. We show that in aqueous solution the MPER fragment (gp160  660&#8208;674  ) exists in a monomer&#8208;trimer equilibrium with an association constant in the micro&#8208;molar range. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the association is exothermic, more favorable in D  2  O than H  2  O, and increases with ionic strength, indicating hydrophobically driven intermolecular interactions. Circular dichroism,  13  C  &#945;  chemical shifts, NOE, and hydrogen exchange rates reveal that MPER undergoes a structural transition from predominately unfolded monomer at low concentrations to an &#945;&#8208;helical trimer at high concentrations. This result has implications for antibody recognition of MPER prior to and during the process where gp41 switches from a pre&#8208;hairpin intermediate to its post&#8208;fusion 6&#8208;helical bundle state.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural characterization of the N&#8208;linked glycans in the receptor binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and&#160;their interactions with human lectins using NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The glycan structures of the receptor binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV2 spike glycoprotein expressed in human&#160;HEK293F cells&#160;have been studied by using NMR. The different possible interacting epitopes have been deeply analysed and characterized, providing evidence of the presence of glycan structures&#160;not found&#160;in previous MS&#8208;based analyses. The interaction of the RBD&#160;13C&#8208;labelled glycans with different&#160;human lectins, which are expressed in different organs and tissues that may be affected during the infection process, has also been evaluated by NMR. In particular,&#160;15N&#8208;labelled galectins (galectins&#8208;3, &#8208;7 and &#8208;8 N&#8208;terminal), Siglecs (siglec&#8208;8, siglec&#8208;10), and C&#8208;type lectins (DC&#8208;SIGN, MGL) have been employed. Complementary experiments&#160;from&#160;the glycoprotein perspective or from the lectin&#8217;s point of view have permitted to disentangle the specific interacting epitopes in each case. Based on these findings, 3D models of the interacting complexes have been proposed.</dc:description>

      <title>CO binding to the FeV Cofactor of CO&#8208;reducing Vanadium Nitrogenase at Atomic Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogenases reduce N  2  , the most abundant element in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere that is otherwise resistant to chemical conversions due to its stable triple bond. Vanadium nitrogenase stands out in that it additionally processes carbon monoxide, a known inhibitor of the more prominent molybdenum nitrogenase. The reduction of CO leads to the formation of hydrocarbon products, holding the potential for biotechnological applications in analogy to the industrial Fischer&#8208;Tropsch process. Here we report the most highly resolved structure of vanadium nitrogenase to date at 1.0 &#197; resolution, with CO bound to the active site cofactor after catalytic turnover. CO bridges iron ions Fe2 and Fe6, replacing sulfide S2B, in a binding mode that is in line with previous reports on the CO complex of molybdenum nitrogenase. We discuss the structural consequences of continued turnover when CO is removed, which involve the replacement of CO possibly by OH  &#8211;  , the movement of Q176  D  and K391  D  , the return of sulfide and the emergence of two additional water molecules that are absent in the CO&#8208;bound state.</dc:description>

Abstract
Triflic anhydride mediated activation of acetophenones leads to highly electrophilic intermediates that can undergo a variety of transformations when treated with nucleophiles. This electrophilic ketone activation gives access to &#945;&#8208;arylated and &#945;&#8208;oxyaminated acetophenones under metal&#8208;free conditions in moderate to excellent yields and enables extension to the synthesis of arylated morpholines via generation of vinylsulfonium salts. Computational investigations confirmed the transient existence of intermediates derived from vinyl triflates and the role of the oxygen atoms at the para position of aromatic ring in facilitating their stabilisation.

Supercritical water possesses vastly different properties compared to its liquid phase, for instance it is well known that the famous tetrahedral H&#8208;bond network is destroyed. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202009640), P. Schienbein and D.

      <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME) stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence imaging and trimodal synergistic cancer treatment nanoplatform is facilely constructed via assembling carbon dots and Cu2+. This could act as a potential strategy to achieve enhanced cancer therapeutic efficiency with minimized side effects.







Abstract
A method is developed to fabricate tumor microenvironment (TME) stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatform for fluorescence (FL) imaging and synergistic cancer therapy via assembling photosensitizer (chlorine e6, Ce6) modified carbon dots (CDs&#8208;Ce6) and Cu2+. The as&#8208;obtained nanoassemblies (named Cu/CC nanoparticles, NPs) exhibit quenched FL and photosensitization due to the aggregation of CDs&#8208;Ce6. Their FL imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT) functions are recovered efficiently once they entering tumor sites by the stimulation of TME. Introducing of Cu2+ not only provides extra chemodynamic therapy (CDT) function through reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but also depletes GSH in tumors by a redox reaction, thus amplifying the intracellular oxidative stress and enhancing the efficacy of reactive oxygen species (ROS) based therapy. Cu/CC NPs can act as a FL imaging guided trimodal synergistic cancer treatment agent by photothermal therapy (PTT), PDT, and thermally amplified CDT.

      <title>Mechanism of 3&#8208;Methylglutaconyl CoA Decarboxylase AibA/AibB: Pericyclic Reaction vs. Direct Decarboxylation</title>
      <dc:description>The enzyme 3&#8208;methylglutaconyl coenzyme A (CoA) decarboxylase (called AibA/AibB), catalyzes the decarboxylation of 3&#8208;methylglutaconyl CoA to generate 3,3&#8208;dimethylacrylyl&#8208;CoA, which is an important step in the biosynthesis of isovaleryl&#8208;coenzyme A in  Myxococcus xanthus  when the regular pathway is blocked. A novel mechanism has previously been proposed for this enzyme, involving a pericyclic transition state, which would make AibA/AibB unique among decarboxylases. Herein, we use density functional calculations to examine the energetic feasibility of this mechanism. It is shown that the intramolecular pericyclic reaction is associated with a very high energy barrier that is very similar to the barrier of the same reaction in the absence of enzyme. Instead, the calculations show that direct decarboxylation mechanism has feasible energy barriers that are in line with the experimental observations.</dc:description>

      <title>Host Differential Sensitization toward Color/Lifetime&#8208;Tuned Lanthanide Coordination Polymers for Optical Multiplexing</title>
      <dc:description>Optical multiplexing based on luminescent materials with tunable color/lifetime holds potential applications in information storage and security. However, the available tunable luminescent materials reported so far still suffer from several drawbacks of low efficiency or poor stability, thus restraining their further applications. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to develop the efficient and stable lanthanide coordination polymers (LCPs) with tunable luminescence as a new option for optical multiplexing. Their multicolor emission from green to red and naked&#8208;eye&#8208;sensitive green emission with tunable lifetime (from ~ 300 to ~ 600 &#956;s) can be controlled by host differential sensitization and energy transfer between lanthanide ions. The quantum efficiencies of developed samples range from ~ 20% to ~ 46% and the luminescence intensity/lifetime appear quite stable in polar solvents up to ten weeks. Furthermore, with the aids of inkjet printing and concepts of luminescence lifetime imaging and time&#8208;gated imaging, we also illustrate their inspiring and promising applications of information storage and security in spatial and temporal domains. These results will open up an avenue to the efficient and stable LCPs with tunable luminescence toward optical multiplexing applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production Trilogy</title>
      <dc:description>H  2  production via water electrolysis is of great significance in clean energy pruduction, which, however, suffers from the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the anode product, O  2  , which is of rather low value, may lead to the dangerous explosion hazard and the generation of membrane&#8208;degradable reactive oxygen species. Herein, to address aforementioned issues of electrocatalytic H  2  production, the most recent advances are summarized in three stages based on the benefit increments and varied electron donation routes, which are: (1) electron donations by traditional OER: developing efficient catalysts for water oxidation to promote H  2  production; (2) electron donations by sacrificing agent oxidation: using sacrificial agents to assist H  2  production; (3) electron donations by electro&#8208;synthesis reaction: achieving electro&#8208;synthesis&#160;in parallel with cathodic H  2  production. We will mainly focus on various anodic reactions and corresponding electro&#8208;catalysts in different operating media, as well as the system establishments in this review. The present challenges and related prospects will also be discussed, hopefully to benefit the further progresses of electrocatalytic H  2  production in the future.</dc:description>

Based on nitrenium cations, these acids where previously shown to generate Lewis adducts when combined with the appropriate Lewis bases. In this article, a triazinium&#8208;based Lewis acid was combined with  t  Bu  3  P to generate a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) capable of cleaving, for the first time, Si&#8208;H bonds in silanes.

A FLP based on this acid cleaved the Si&#8208;H bond in PhSiH  3  , generating the triazane product in a quantitative yield. This unprecedented N&#8208;H triazane was fully characterized by multinuclear NMR techniques and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.

      <title>Double Histidine based EPR measurements at physiological temperatures permit site&#8208;specific elucidation of hidden dynamics in enzymes</title>
      <dc:description>Protein dynamics is the heart of all cellular processes. Here, we utilize the dHis&#8208;Cu(II)NTA motif to obtain site&#8208;specific information on dynamics for both an &#945;&#8208;helix and &#223;&#8208;sheet site of GB1, the immunoglobulin binding domain of protein G. Spectral features found in our CW&#8208;EPR measurements were consistent with the overall rigid nature of GB1 and with predictions from molecular dynamics simulations, Using this information, we show the potential of this approach to elucidate the role of dynamics in substrate binding of a functionally necessary &#945;&#8208;helix in human glutathione transferase A1&#8208;1 (hGSTA1&#8208;1). We observe two dynamical modes for the helix. The addition of the inhibitor GS&#8208;Met and GS&#8208;Hex resulted in hGSTA1&#8208;1 to favor the more rigid active state conformation, while the faster mode potentially aids the search for substrates. Together the results illustrate the remarkable potential of the dHis based labelling approach to measure site&#8208;specific dynamics using room temperature lineshape analysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Bonding Energetics of Palladium&#8208;amido/aryloxide Complexes in DMSO: Implications for Pd&#8208;mediated Aniline Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Thermodynamic knowledge of the metal&#8210;ligand (M&#8210;L) &#963;&#8208;bond strength is crucial to understanding metal&#8208;mediated transformations, but it is rarely presented in literature. Here, we developed a general methodology for determining the Pd&#8210;X (X = OR and NHAr) bond heterolysis energies (&#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X)) in DMSO taking [(tmeda)PdArX] (tmeda = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine) as the model complexes. The first &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X) scales here derived span a range of 2.6&#8210;9.0 kcal/mol for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;O)s and of 14.5&#8210;19.5 kcal/mol for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;N)s, respectively, implying a facile heterolytic detachment of the Pd&#8210;ligands. Structure&#8208;reactivity analyses of a modeling Pd&#8208;mediated X&#8210;H bond activation reveal that the M&#8210;X bond metathesis is basically dominated by the differences of the X&#8210;H and Pd&#8210;X bond strengths, with the former being more influential. Combinatorial application of the &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X) and pKa(X&#8210;H) parameters enables rational regulations of the reaction thermodynamics and chemo&#8208;selectivity, and hence provides a feasible energetic criterion for diagnosing the probability of aniline activation with Pd&#8210;X complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Waveguide Single&#8208;Benzene Organic Crystal with Ultralow Temperature Elasticity as a Potential Flexible Material</title>
      <dc:description>With the increasing popularity and burgeoning progress of space technology, the development of ultralow temperature flexible functional materials is a great challenge for human beings. Herein, we reported a highly emissive organic crystal combining with ultralow temperature elasticity and self&#8208;waveguide (when a crystal is excited, it emits light from itself and travels through the crystal to the other end) based on a simple single&#8208;benzene emitter. This crystal displayed excellent elastic bending ability in liquid nitrogen (LN). The preliminary experiments on attempting optical waveguide of the bent crystal demonstrated that the light generated by the crystal itself could be confined and propagated within the crystal body between 170&#186;C and &#8211;196&#186;C. These results not only propose a guideline for designing functional organic crystals with ultralow temperature elasticity but also expand the application region of flexible materials to extreme environments such as space technology.</dc:description>

      <title>Broadband Dynamics of Ubiquitin by Anionic and Cationic Nanoparticle&#8208;Assisted NMR Spin Relaxation</title>
      <dc:description>The quantitative and comprehensive description of the internal dynamics of proteins is critical for understanding their function. Nanoparticle&#8208;assisted  15  N NMR spin relaxation is a new method that uses a simple read&#8208;out allowing the observation of ps &#8208; &#956;s dynamics of proteins when transiently interacting with the surface of nanoparticles. The method is applied here to the widely studied protein human ubiquitin in the presence of anionic and cationic silica nanoparticles (SNP) of different size. The resulting backbone dynamics profiles are highly reproducible and strikingly similar to each other, indicating that, with the exception of the disordered tail, specific protein&#8208;SNP interactions are unimportant. The dynamics profiles closely match the sub&#8208;ns dynamics S  2  values observed by model&#8208;free analysis of standard  15  N relaxation of ubiquitin in free solution. These results indicate that the bulk of ubiquitin backbone dynamics in solution is confined to sub&#8208;ns timescales and, hence, it is dynamically considerably more restrained than some previous NMR studies have suggested.</dc:description>

      <title>Biomimetic approach for highly selective artificial water channels based on tubular Pillar[5]Arene dimers</title>
      <dc:description>Nature provides answers for efficient transport of water by using Aquaporins AQPs as the translocation relays. Artificial Water Channels biomimicking natural AQPs, can be used for both selective and fast transport of water. Here, we use complementary synthetic methods, X&#8208;ray structural data, transport assays to quantify the transport performances of peralkyl&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;pillar[5]arenes dimers in bilayer membranes. They are able to transport ~107 water molecules/channel/second, within one order of magnitude of AQPs&#8217; rates, rejecting Na+ and K+ cations. The dimers have an tubular structure, superposing larger pillar[5]arene pores of 5 &#197; diameter with narrowest twisted carboxy&#8208;phenyl pores of 2.8 &#197; diameter. This exceptional channel biomimetic platform, with variable pore dimensions within the same structure, offers size restriction reminiscent to natural proteins. It allows water molecules to selectively transit and prevent bigger hydrated cations to pass through the 2.8 &#197; pore. Molecular simulations probe that dimeric or multimeric honeycomb aggregates are stable in the membrane and form water pathways through the bilayer. Over time, a significant shift of the upper vs. lower layer of occurs initiating new unexpected water permeation events through novel toroidal pores.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Relay Enabling Modular Synthesis of Fused Pyridines from Alkyne&#8208;Tethered Oximes and Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>We have rationally designed a new class of alkyne&#8208;tethered oximes, and applied them into an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed radical relay protocol for the rapid assembly of a wide array of structurally new and interesting fused pyridines. This method showcases broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and can be applied for a few biologically active molecules. In addition, the fused pyridines can be diversely functionalized through various simple transformations, such as cyclization, C&#8208;H alkylation, and click reaction. DFT calculation studies indicate that the reactions involve cascade 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig radical addition, and cyclization processes.

      <dc:description>Apyrase represents an important family of extracellular enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds (HEPBs) in ATP and ADP, thereby modulating many physiological processes and driving life activities. Here, we report an unexpected discovery that cerium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) of UiO&#8208;66(Ce) possess intrinsic apyrase&#8208;like activity for the intervention of ATP/ADP&#8208;related physiological processes. The abundant Ce(III)/Ce(IV) couple sites of Ce&#8208;MOFs endow them with the ability to selectively catalyse the hydrolysis of HEPBs of ATP and ADP under physiological condition. Compared to natural enzymes, they could resist to extreme pH and temperature, and present a broad range of working conditions. Based on this finding, a significant inhibitory effect on ADP&#8208;induced platelet aggregation was observed upon exposing the platelet&#8208;rich plasma (PRP) to the biomimetic UiO&#8208;66(Ce) films, prefiguring their wide application potentials in medicine and biotechnology.</dc:description>

      <title>Guest&#8208;Reaction Driven Cage to Conjoined Twin&#8208;Cage Mitosis&#8208;Like Host Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>We report here a guest&#8208;reaction induced mitosis&#8208;like host transformation from a known Pd  4  L  2  cage  1  to a conjoined Pd  6  L  3  twin&#8208;cage  2  featuring two separate cavities. The encapsulation of 1&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (  G1  ), a known  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide (  o  &#8208;QMs) precursor, within the hydrophobic cavity of cage  1  is found crucial to realize the cage to twin&#8208;cage conversion. Confined  G1  molecules within the nanocavity undergo self&#8208;coupling dimerization reaction to form 2,2'&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1'&#8208;dinaphthylmethane (  G2  ) which then triggers the cage to twin&#8208;cage mitosis. The same conversion also proceeds, in a much faster rate, via the direct templation of  G2  , confirming the induced&#8208;fit transformation mechanism. The structure of the  2  &#8835;(  G2  )  2  host&#8208;guest complex has been established by X&#8208;ray crystallographic study, where  cis&#8208;  to  trans&#8208;  conformational switch on one bridging ligand is revealed.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report here a guest&#8208;reaction induced mitosis&#8208;like host transformation from a known Pd  4  L  2  cage  1  to a conjoined Pd  6  L  3  twin&#8208;cage  2  featuring two separate cavities. The encapsulation of 1&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (  G1  ), a known  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide (  o  &#8208;QMs) precursor, within the hydrophobic cavity of cage  1  is found crucial to realize the cage to twin&#8208;cage conversion. Confined  G1  molecules within the nanocavity undergo self&#8208;coupling dimerization reaction to form 2,2'&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1'&#8208;dinaphthylmethane (  G2  ) which then triggers the cage to twin&#8208;cage mitosis. The same conversion also proceeds, in a much faster rate, via the direct templation of  G2  , confirming the induced&#8208;fit transformation mechanism. The structure of the  2  &#8835;(  G2  )  2  host&#8208;guest complex has been established by X&#8208;ray crystallographic study, where  cis&#8208;  to  trans&#8208;  conformational switch on one bridging ligand is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>
Layered lithium&#8208;rich materials are promising cathode materials for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Understanding the principles of the performance degradation mechanisms is a prerequisite for progress in this area. In this Minireview, recent research on the material structure and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials is discussed.







Abstract
Layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted extensive interest owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (320&#8211;350&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications. After many years of quiescence, interest in layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials is expected to revive in answer to our increasing dependence on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we review recent research progress and in&#8208;depth descriptions of the structure characterization and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarize the proposed reaction mechanisms of both the cationic redox reaction of transition&#8208;metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges facing the future development of lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Considerations for a More Accurate Evaluation Method for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
For the comparison of photocatalysts for water splitting, more comprehensive and accurate evaluation indicators are needed. Suggestions are made in this Viewpoint, aiming to stimulate discussion in the research community and hopefully lead to a widely accepted and authoritative evaluation system to assess photocatalyst performance.







Abstract
Over the past decades, various photocatalysts have been developed and great progress has been achieved in the field of solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic water splitting. However, the lack of an accurate and comprehensive evaluation method greatly hinders the meaningful comparison between different systems and becomes a serious impediment for the development of photocatalysts. Although many researchers are aware of this, there has been little work in this area. In this Viewpoint, we first analyze the insufficiencies of the existing evaluation methods and then make preliminary suggestions, aiming to stimulate discussion in the research community and hopefully lead to a widely accepted and authoritative evaluation system to assess photocatalyst performance.

However, the lack of an accurate and comprehensive evaluation method greatly hinders the meaningful comparison between different systems and becomes a serious impediment for the development of photocatalysts. Although many researchers are aware of this, there has been little work in this area. In this Viewpoint, we first analyze the insufficiencies of the existing evaluation methods and then make preliminary suggestions, aiming to stimulate discussion in the research community and hopefully lead to a widely accepted and authoritative evaluation system to assess photocatalyst performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Green and Wide&#8208;Scope Approach for Chiroptical Sensing of Cryptochiral Molecules through Biomimetic Recognition in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Optical chirality sensing has attracted a lot of interest due to its potential in high&#8208;throughput screening in chirality analysis. It requires a molecular sensor to convert the chirality of analytes into optical signals. Although many molecular sensors have been reported, the ones with a wide substrate scope remain to be developed. Herein, we report that the amide naphthotube&#8208;based chirality sensors have an unprecedented wide scope for chiroptical sensing of cryptochiral molecules. The substrates include but are not limited to common organic products in asymmetric catalysis, chiral molecules with inert groups or remote functional groups from their chiral centers, natural products and their derivatives, and chiral drugs. The effective chirality sensing is based on biomimetic recognition in water and on effective chirality transfer through guest&#8208;induced formation of a chiral conformation of the sensors. Furthermore, the sensors can be used in real&#8208;time monitoring on reaction kinetics in water and in determining absolute configuration and ee values of the products in asymmetric catalysis. The sensor assays are environmentally&#8208;friendly because the solvent is water and the sensors can be easily recovered in a high yield.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling has become a powerful tool for C&#8211;C bond formation, but its potential for forging the C&#8211;Si bond remains unexplored. Here we report a cross&#8208;electrophile Csp  2  &#8211;Si coupling reaction of vinyl/aryl electrophiles with vinyl chlorosilanes.

The reaction proceeds under mild and non&#8208;basic conditions, demonstrating a high step economy, broad substrate scope, wide functionality tolerance, and easy scalability. The synthetic utility of the method is shown by its efficient accessing of silicon bioisosteres, the design of new BCB&#8208;monomers, and studies on the Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling of vinylsilane products.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Engineering via Controlling Structural Deformation for Highly Efficient Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>It is an enormous challenge to achieve the highly efficient organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long lifetime. Here we demonstrated that by bridging the carbazole and halogenated phenyl ring with methylene linker, a type of RTP phosphors CzBX (X = Cl, Br) shows high phosphorescence efficiency (  &#1060;  Ph  ), up to 38% for CzBBr with a lifetime of 220 ms, which is much higher than that of compounds CzPX (X = Cl, Br) with C&#8208;N bond as a linker (  &#1060;  Ph  &lt; 1%). Single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that, in the crystal phase, the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;Br interaction accelerates the intersystem crossing process, while tetrahedron&#8208;like structure induced by  sp  3  methylene linker restrains the nonradiative decay channel, leading to the high phosphorescence efficiency in CzBBr. This research not only paves a new road for achieving highly efficient and long&#8208;lived RTP materials but also expands the applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting or data encryption.</dc:description>

      <title>"Breathing" Micelles&#160; for Combinatorial Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
      <dc:description>Breathing process involves inhalation and exhalation of different gases in animals. The gas exchange of the breathing process plays a critical role in maintaining the physiological functions of living organisms. Although artificial breathing materials exhibiting volume expansion and contraction upon alternate exposure to different gases have been well explored, those being able to realize the gas exchange remain elusive. Herein, we report breathing micelles (BM) capable of inhaling nitric oxide (NO) and exhaling carbon monoxide (CO), both of which are endogenous gaseous  signaling molecules  . We demonstrate that BM can simultaneously scavenge overproduced NO and attenuate proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;challenged macrophage cells. In vivo studies revealed that BM outperforms conventional nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone (Dexa) in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adjuvant&#8208;induced arthritis (AIA) rats, likely due to the combinatorial effect of NO depletion, CO&#8208;mediated deactivation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and activation of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1).

      <title>Isotope Effects in Plasmonic Photosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The photoexcitation of plasmonic nanoparticles has been shown to drive multi&#8208;step, multi&#8208;carrier transformations like the conversion of CO2  to hydrocarbons. But for such plasmon&#8208;driven chemistry to be precisely understood and modeled, the critical photo&#8208;initiation step in the reaction cascade must be identified. We meet this goal by measuring H/D and  12C/13C kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) in plasmonic photosynthesis. In particular, we find that the substitution of H2O with D2O slows hydrocarbon production by a factor of 5&#8211;8. This primary H/D KIE leads to the inference that hole&#8208;driven scission of the O&#8211;H bond in H2O is a critical, limiting step in plasmonic photosynthesis.

      <title>Tailoring Crystal Facets of Metal&#8211;Organic Layers to Enhance Photocatalytic Activity for CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>It is common that different crystal facets in metal and metal oxide nanocrystals display different catalytic performances, whereas such phenomena have been rarely documented in   metal&#8211;organic frameworks  (MOFs). Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that a nickel metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL)  exposing rich  (100) crystal facets  (  Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;100  ) shows a much higher photocatalytic CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO activity than the one exposing rich (  010  ) crystal facets (  Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010  ) and its  bulky counterpart (bulky Ni&#8208;MOF  ),  with a catalytic activity up to 2.5 and 4.6 times  more active than Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010 and bulky Ni&#8208;MOF, respectively. Theoretical studies reveal that the two coordination&#8208;unsaturated Ni(II) ions  with a close distance of 3.50  &#197; on the surface of Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;100  enables synergistic catalysis  , leading to more favorable energetics in CO  2  reduction than that of Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010.</dc:description>

      <title>A Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded yet Hydrophobic Porous Molecular Crystal for Molecular&#8208;Sieving&#8208;like Separation of Butane and Isobutane</title>
      <dc:description>Porous molecular crystals sustained by hydrogen bonds and/or weaker connections are an intriguing type of adsorbents, but they hardly demonstrate efficient adsorptive separation becuase of poor structural robustness and tailorability. Here, we report a porous molecular crystal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic dinuclear Ag(I) complex, which exhibits exceptional hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 134  o  , high chemical stability in water at pH 2&#8210;13. The seemingly rigid adsorbent shows pore&#8208;opening or nonporous&#8208;to&#8208;porous type butane adsorption isotherm and complete exclusion of isobutane, indicating potential molecular sieving. Quantitative column breakthrough experiments show slight co&#8208;adsorption of isobutane with an experimental butane/isobutane selectivity of 23, and isobutane can be purified more efficiently than for butane.  In&#8208;situ  powder/single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational simulations reveal that a trivial guest&#8208;induced structural transformation play&#160;critical roles.</dc:description>

      <title>MOF&#8208;Mediated Fabrication of Porous 3&#8208;D Superstructure of Carbon Nanosheets Decorated with Ultrafine Cobalt Phosphide Nanoparticles for Efficient Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Superstructures have attracted great interest owing to their potential applications in chemistry and material science. Herein, we report, for the first time, the scalable preparation of a porous nickel foam&#8208;templated superstructure of carbon nanosheets decorated with ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles. Uniform two&#8208;dimensional (2&#8208;D) Co&#8208;MOF nanosheets (Co&#8208;MNS) grow on nickel foam, followed by a MOF&#8208;mediated tandem (carbonization/phosphidation) pyrolysis. The resulted superstructure exhibits a porous 3&#8208;D interconnected network with well&#8208;arranging 2&#8208;D carbon nanosheets on it, in which ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles are tightly immobilized. A single piece of this superstructure can be directly used as self&#8208;supported electrodes for electrocatalysis without any binders. Taking advantages of this &#8220;one&#8208;piece&#8221; porous superstructure with excellent transport properties of mass and electrons, and catalytically active cobalt phosphide nanoparticles with ultrasmall size (3&#8208;4 nm), it exhibits excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities for OER, HER, and ORR, achieving great performances in water splitting and Zn&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Promotion of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Chalcogenate on the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre&#8208;electrocatalysts, and will in situ transform into metal oxyhydroxides under OER condition. However, the role of chalcogen is not fully elucidated after oxidation and severe leaching. Here we present the vital promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on the OER activity. Taking NiSe  2  as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the oxidation of Se&#8208;Se to selenites (SeO  3  2&#8208;  ) then to selenates (SeO  4  2&#8208;  ). Combining the severe Se leaching and the strong signal of selenates, it is assumed that the selenates are rich on the surface and play significant roles. As expected, adding selenites to the electrolyte of Ni(OH)  2  dramatically enhance the OER activity. And sulfates also exhibit the similar effect, suggesting the promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on OER is universal. Our findings offer unique insight into the transformation mechanism of materials during electrolysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Silver Single&#160;Atom in&#160;Carbon Nitride Catalyst for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#160;atom catalysts (SACs) with the maximized metal atom efficiency have sparked great attention. However, it is challenging to obtain SACs with high metal loading, high catalytic activity,&#160;and good stability.&#160;Herein,&#160;we demonstrate a new strategy to develop a highly active and stable Ag single atom in&#160;carbon nitride (Ag&#8208;N2C2/CN) catalyst&#160;with a&#160;unique coordination. The Ag atomic dispersion and Ag&#8208;N2C2 configuration&#160;have been identified by aberration&#8208;correction high&#8208;angle&#8208;annular&#8208;dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy&#160;(AC&#8208;HAADF&#8208;STEM)&#160;and extended X&#8208;ray absorption. Experiments&#160;and DFT&#160;calculations further verify that Ag&#8208;N2C2 can reduce the H2 evolution barrier, expand the light absorption&#160;range, and improve the charge transfer of CN. As a result, the Ag&#8208;N2C2/CN catalyst exhibits&#160;much better H2 evolution&#160;activity than&#160;the N&#8208;coordinated Ag single atom in&#160;CN&#160;(Ag&#8208;N4/CN),&#160;and is even superior to the Pt nanoparticle&#8208;loaded&#160;CN (PtNP/CN).

      <title>Incorporating Transition Metal Phosphides into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven to be an excellent platform in photocatalysis. However, to suppress the  electron&#8208;hole  recombination, the Pt cocatalyst is usually inevitable, especially in photocatalytic H  2  production, which greatly limits the practical application. Herein, for the first time, the monodisperse, small&#8208;size and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free transitional metal phosphides (TMPs, e.g., Ni  2  P, Ni  12  P  5  ), are incorporated into a representative MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , for photocatalytic H  2  production. Compared with the parent MOF and their physical mixture, both TMPs@MOF  composites  display significantly improved H  2  production rates. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies reveal that TMPs, behaving similar ability to Pt, greatly accelerate the linker&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer and promote charge separation, as well as reduce the activation energy of H  2  production. Significantly, results indicate that Pt is thermodynamically favorable yet Ni  2  P is kinetically preferred for H  2  production, accounting for the higher activity of Ni  2  P@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  than Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Multispecific Platinum(IV) Complex Deters Breast Cancer via Interposing Inflammation and Immunosuppression as an Inhibitor of COX&#8208;2 and PD&#8208;L1</title>
      <dc:description>Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies in women and often accompanied by inflammatory processes. Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) plays a vital role in the progression of BC, correlating with the expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Overexpression of PD&#8208;L1 contributes to the immune escape of cancer cells, and its blockade would stimulate anticancer immunity. Two multispecific platinum(IV) complexes DNP and NP were prepared using non&#8208;steroidal antiinflammatory drug naproxen (NPX) as axial ligand(s) to inhibit the BC cells. DNP exhibited high cytotoxicity and antiinflammatory properties superior over NP, cisplatin and NPX; moreover, it displayed potent antitumor activity and almost no general toxicity in mice bearing triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistic studies revealed that DNP could downregulate the expression of COX&#8208;2 and PD&#8208;L1  in vitro  and  vivo  , inhibit the secretion of prostaglandin, reduce the expression of BC&#8208;associated protein BRD4 and phosphorylation of extracellular signal&#8208;regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2), and block the oncogene c&#8208;Myc in BC cells. These findings demonstrate that DNP is capable of intervening in inflammatory, immune, and metastatic processes of BC, thus presenting a new mechanism of action for anticancer platinum(IV) complexes. The multispecificity offers a special superiority for DNP to treat TNBC by combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy in one molecule.</dc:description>

      <title>Coupled vacancy pairs in Ni&#8208;doped CoSe for improved electrocatalytic hydrogen production through topochemically deintercalation</title>
      <dc:description>Vacancy engineering plays vital role in the design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst. Here, we introduced coupled cation vacancy pairs in Ni&#8208;doped CoSe to achieve boosted HER activity, through a facile topochemical intercalation approach. Adjacent Co vacancy pairs and heteroatom Ni doping contribute together for the upshift of the Se 4  p  z  orbital, which induces larger overlap between the Se 4p and H 1s electron clouds. As a result, the free energy of H adsorption can be reduced largely. With an advanced HER activity of 185.7 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , this work provides new direction and guidance for the design of novel electrocatalysts.</dc:description>
