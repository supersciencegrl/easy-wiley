         <title>Influence of the Acid Reactivity of Carbenium Ions in Zeolites on the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we studied the Br&#248;nsted acid reactivity of polymethylbenzenium and alkyl&#8208;substituted cyclopentenyl cations, key intermediates in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. CD3CN selectively and reversibly deprotonates benzenium ions, while cyclopentenyl cations require stronger bases. These results reveal a reactivity scale and provide insight into carbocation chemistry in reactive environments.








Abstract
Carbocations are typical intermediates in acid catalyzed reactions in organic chemistry synthesis. Confinement within the framework of zeotype materials distinguishes the function of carbenium ions as catalytic centers in various chemical processes. A selective and reversible deprotonation event of benzenium ions built in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 during methanol conversion was observed by experiment and theory as a result of CD3CN dosage, denoting their higher acid reactivity compared to the cyclopentenyl cations, which undergo deprotonation only in presence of pyridine. This study uncovers the inverse relationship between the acid reactivity of carbenium ions of different nature and their stability in the surface&#8208;bound state.

         <title>Mechanochemical Cis/Trans Isomerization of a Metal Centre Involving a Metal&#8208;Organic Halogen&#8208;Bonded (MOXB) Cocrystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented work demonstrates a cocrystallization&#8208;enabled mechanochemical interconversion of geometrical isomers of a coordination complex, illustrating the use of halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven cocrystal formation for generating new metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours.








Abstract
Halogen bonding enables the mechanochemical ball&#8208;milling isomerization of an otherwise persistent cis&#8208;coordinated metal complex into the corresponding trans&#8208;isomer. The importance of halogen bonding for enabling the cis&#8594;trans isomerization of the metal centre is evidenced by real&#8208;time in situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction monitoring of the ball&#8208;milling experiments that showed the transient appearance of a cis&#8208;geometry metal&#8208;organic halogen&#8208;bonded (MOXB) cocrystal, which is rapidly replaced by the corresponding trans&#8208;geometry one, with any excess, non&#8208;halogen&#8208;bonded cis&#8208;geometry complex being retained throughout the milling experiment. The importance of cocrystallization for cis&#8594;trans isomerization is supported by periodic density&#8208;functional theory calculations which show that the process becomes notably more enthalpically favourable in the presence of the halogen bond donor. The presented work indicates that the formation of MOXB cocrystals can open the door to new, metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours, different from those of parent solid&#8208;state coordination complexes.

         <title>Tuning Solvation Structure Via Inductive and Steric Hindrance Effects for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inductive and steric hindrance from a highly fluorinated ether diluent weaken Li+&#8211;solvent coordination and enrich anion participation, yielding compact solvation shells resulting into the formation of a robust bilayer interphase, thus enabling&#160;&gt;6.5&#160;V stability and long&#8208;term cycling of 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 batteries.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has a high specific capacity and energy density, making it a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, stabilizing LiCoO2 at elevated charging cut&#8208;off voltages remains challenging due to the severe interfacial degradation, particularly the instability of the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) under oxidative conditions. Herein, we propose a novel push&#8211;pull electrolyte design strategy by incorporating a non&#8208;coordinating diluent, 1H,1H,5H&#8208;perfluoropentyl&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylether (HFE), which modulates the Li+ solvation structure through strong inductive and steric hindrance effects, thereby enabling the formation of a robust CEI on the LiCoO2 surface. Guided by molecular electrostatic potential analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance characterizations, the optimized electrolyte creates a tailored solvation environment that suppresses parasitic interfacial reactions and facilitates the formation of a bilayer interphase. As a result, the LiCoO2 cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with the HFE&#8208;containing electrolyte, delivering over 300 stable cycles at 4.6&#160;V in high&#8208;loading LiCoO2//Li cells (&#8764;11&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and retaining 77% capacity after 200 cycles in LiCoO2//Graphite full&#8208;cells at 4.5&#160;V. This solvation engineering strategy provides a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Formation of Monolithic Magnesium&#8211;Calcium Carbonates Through Aggregation of Carbonate&#8208;Cluster Nanodroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustrating the formation of monolithic amorphous magnesium&#8211;calcium carbonate through the aggregation of nanodroplets. The color coding indicates that the Mg content may differ between the surface and the core. The two solid&#8208;state packings of Mg&#8208;rich and Mg&#8208;deficient domains shown on the right are structurally equivalent. Each tiny cube represents an amorphous domain with distinct Mg content. The cubes serve as a convenient visual guide to the space&#8208;filling feature of the amorphous domains.








Abstract
Mineral nucleation is a fundamental process of paramount importance to various fields, including geology, biomineralization, and industrial manufacturing. Recently, studies on the biominerals of calcium carbonate and phosphate have revealed the presence of a dense liquid phase prior to the formation of an amorphous solid phase. Here, we show that liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation occurs in a non&#8208;aqueous solution where magnesium and calcium carbonates are dissolved in ethanol with excess triethylamine. The nanodroplets can be kinetically trapped by triethylamine. We found that molecular complexes of triethylamine, CO2, and ethanol molecules are in constant exchange with sizable carbonate clusters. We argue that nanodroplets comprising highly solvated carbonate clusters are the key entities in the nucleation process. Remarkably, the coalescence of the nanodroplets leads to the formation of a monolithic magnesium&#8208;calcium carbonate containing two distinct domains with different Mg content.

         <title>Crafting Immune&#8208;Cancer Cell Crosstalk via Modular Multilayer Logic DNA Nanoadaptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a modular DNA nanoadaptor (Magic&#8208;NA) featuring multi&#8208;port scaffold and plug&#8208;and&#8208;play connectors that programs immune&#8208;cancer cell interactions via customizable multilayer logic gates responding to cellular antigens and microenvironmental cues, enabling on&#8208;demand cell targeting and broad&#8208;spectrum cell killing.








Abstract
Synthetic molecular recognition tools offer a promising approach to reconfigure cell&#8208;cell interactions, but engineering user&#8208;defined logic circuits to control intercellular communication in heterogeneous microenvironments endures as a critical barrier. Herein, we present a multilayer logic DNA nanoadaptor (Magic&#8208;NA) to define immune&#8208;cancer cell crosstalk by a customized logic operation of multiple variables, including cell surface antigens and microenvironmental characteristics. The modular Magic&#8208;NA consists of a DNA di&#8208;tetrahedral scaffold featuring three ports at each terminal. These ports can be interfaced with a library of plug&#8208;and&#8208;play logic connectors specifically activated by molecular triggers and targeted to desired cells, enabling programmable design of both logic circuits and inputs. We demonstrated an AND&#8208;AND logic network in Magic&#8208;NA that guides natural killer (NK) cells to target cells for selective cytotoxicity, based on tumor microenvironment (TME) acidic pH, and cellular antigens PTK7 and MUC1. Furthermore, leveraging the multi&#8208;port design, we implemented an OR&#8208;AND logic gate system to achieve on&#8208;demand cell targeting and broad&#8208;spectrum cell killing.

&lt;p&gt;We present a modular DNA nanoadaptor (Magic-NA) featuring multi-port scaffold and plug-and-play connectors that programs immune-cancer cell interactions via customizable multilayer logic gates responding to cellular antigens and microenvironmental cues, enabling on-demand cell targeting and broad-spectrum cell killing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic molecular recognition tools offer a promising approach to reconfigure cell-cell interactions, but engineering user-defined logic circuits to control intercellular communication in heterogeneous microenvironments endures as a critical barrier. Herein, we present a multilayer logic DNA nanoadaptor (Magic-NA) to define immune-cancer cell crosstalk by a customized logic operation of multiple variables, including cell surface antigens and microenvironmental characteristics. The modular Magic-NA consists of a DNA di-tetrahedral scaffold featuring three ports at each terminal. These ports can be interfaced with a library of plug-and-play logic connectors specifically activated by molecular triggers and targeted to desired cells, enabling programmable design of both logic circuits and inputs. We demonstrated an AND-AND logic network in Magic-NA that guides natural killer (NK) cells to target cells for selective cytotoxicity, based on tumor microenvironment (TME) acidic pH, and cellular antigens PTK7 and MUC1. Furthermore, leveraging the multi-port design, we implemented an OR-AND logic gate system to achieve on-demand cell targeting and broad-spectrum cell killing. This nanoplatform provides a paradigm for manipulating cellular interactions through Boolean integration of cell-intrinsic markers and microenvironmental cues, advancing the development of precision cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isolation of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Versatile Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic approach to anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) via ligand exchange of metalated ylides/diazomethanes with free carbenes is reported. The anionic NHOs adopt bent structures with delocalized anionic charge, which enables versatile reactivity, including the formation of highly functionalized NHOs, thermal rearrangement to N&#8208;heterocyclic imines and generation of carbo(phosphino)carbene ligands.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have emerged as powerful bases and nucleophiles with broad applications in synthesis and catalysis. Here, we report a new synthetic approach to accessing their anionic derivatives through a formal ligand exchange reaction of metalated ylides or diazomethanes with free carbenes. The reaction was found to depend on the nature of the carbene, with more electrophilic carbenes reacting more readily via N2 and PPh3 extrusion, respectively. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses, combined with computational studies revealed that the anionic NHOs exhibit bent structures. In these structures, the anionic charge at the central carbon atom is partly delocalized into the carbene and the second substituent (Z). These stabilizing effects confer versatile reactivity at the central carbon atom, the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or at the Z substituent. While the predominant reactivity occurs at the central carbon atom&#8212;enabling the convenient synthesis of functionalized NHOs&#8212;anionic NHOs also undergo a thermally induced rearrangement to N&#8208;heterocyclic imines via a skeletal rearrangement involving ring&#8208;opening of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Based Type&#8208;I Nano&#8208;Photosensitizers for Enhanced Antitumor Photodynamic Therapy: H2S Synergistically Regulates PeT and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce a design strategy for activated photosensitizers (PSs) wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) is combined with a process of self&#8208;assembly that can be regulated by endogenous H2S&#8212;a tumor&#8208;associated biomarker to favor Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions. 








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on a combination of light and photosensitizers (PSs) to achieve local control over cancerous lesions. However, it is subject to limitations, including tumor hypoxia, low tumor targeting, off&#8208;target phototoxicity, and always&#8208;on fluorescence. Here, we propose a design strategy for activated nano&#8208;PSs (N&#8208;PSs) to simultaneously overcome the limitations of PDT, wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) is coupled with an endogenous H2S&#8208;regulated self&#8208;association process to promote Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions. Using theoretical calculations, spectral analysis, and microscopic imaging, we verified the generation of self&#8208;assembly and occurrence of PeT. And it was also shown that H2S could synergistically inhibit the PeT and self&#8208;assembly, reflecting by a 21&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity at 635&#160;nm and 35&#8208;fold enhancement of the Type&#8208;I photochemical reaction as inferred from O2&#8722; generation. Moreover, the most promising self&#8208;assembled N&#8208;PS, Ts3&#8208;ONB, was found to almost completely inhibit tumor growth in mice under two&#8208;photon excitation through the synergistic regulation of PeT and self&#8208;assembly by endogenous H2S (V14 daysTs3&#8208;ONB + Light group/V14 daysControl group&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.02). As such, the synergistic combination of PeT and self&#8208;assembly is an effective design strategy for developing advanced N&#8208;PSs that can address some current PDT limitations.

         <title>AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;Deficient Eutectic Electrolytes Enable Reversible Iodine Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion for Aluminum Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible iodine redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion is unlocked in aluminum batteries by AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;deficient eutectic electrolytes, where the suppressed AlCl4&#8722; concentration extends anodic stability and inhibits Cl2 evolution. The I2 cathode delivers a large specific capacity of 358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and a high areal capacity of 2.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, offering a new strategy for energy&#8208;dense aluminum battery systems.








Abstract
Aluminum (Al) batteries are promising for sustainable and large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the inherent safety, low cost, and attractive metrics of the Al anode. However, the development of high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;capacity cathodes remains a key challenge. Herein, we achieve the reversible iodine redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion (i.e., I&#8722;/I0/I+) in Al batteries, wherein AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;deficient eutectic electrolytes are identified critical for stabilizing the conversion process. In contrast to ionic liquid electrolytes prone to parasitic Cl2 evolution, eutectic systems facilitate the I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion process with high reversibility and significantly suppressed Cl2 generation. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations reveal AlCl4&#8722; as the dominant species limiting anodic stability of the electrolyte, and its reduced presence in eutectic electrolytes directly enhances iodine conversion reversibility. The optimized electrolyte allows the I2 electrode to deliver a specific capacity of 358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 (based on I2 mass), along with excellent cycling stability (83.8% retention over 1000 cycles). High&#8208;loading I2 electrodes (8.52&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) achieve a high areal capacity of 2.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and demonstrate practical feasibility in a single&#8208;layer pouch cell. This work establishes a new design framework for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries and opens avenues for advancing conversion chemistries in multivalent systems.

         <title>A Triple Threat Against Ovarian Cancer: Os(II)&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;Ceritinib Conjugates for Photodynamic Therapy, Chemotherapy, and Immunogenic Cell Death Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Os(II)&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;Ceritinib (Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer) conjugate enables triple&#8208;action anticancer therapy by integrating photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction into a single molecule. Upon near&#8208;infrared light activation, this heterobimetallic complex exhibits potent antiproliferative effects in ovarian cancer models, triggering key ICD hallmarks, including calreticulin exposure, ATP release, and HMGB1 secretion.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based anticancer agents offer unique opportunities to integrate multiple therapeutic modalities within a single molecular framework. Herein, we present the first Osmium(II)&#8208;Platinum(IV)&#8208;Ceritinib conjugate (Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer) that synergistically combines photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy via immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction. This heterobimetallic complex features a photoactive osmium(II) polypyridyl core, a platinum(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin, and the kinase inhibitor ceritinib as an axial ligand. Upon deep&#8208;red irradiation (&#955; = 740&#160;nm), the conjugate exhibits potent antiproliferative activity in ovarian 2D cancer cells and 3D tumour spheroids, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. In addition, Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer effectively inhibits cancer cell migration. Mechanistic studies reveal that the conjugate induces hallmarks of ICD, including calreticulin exposure, ATP release, HMGB1 secretion and phagocytosis. This multifunctional approach highlights the potential of osmium(II)&#8208;platinum(IV) conjugates as promising candidates for overcoming resistance and immune evasion in high&#8208;grade ovarian carcinoma.

     alt="A Triple Threat Against Ovarian Cancer: Os(II)-Pt(IV)-Ceritinib Conjugates for Photodynamic Therapy, Chemotherapy, and Immunogenic Cell Death Induction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel Os(II)-Pt(IV)-Ceritinib (&lt;b&gt;Os-Pt-Cer&lt;/b&gt;) conjugate enables triple-action anticancer therapy by integrating photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction into a single molecule. Upon near-infrared light activation, this heterobimetallic complex exhibits potent antiproliferative effects in ovarian cancer models, triggering key ICD hallmarks, including calreticulin exposure, ATP release, and HMGB1 secretion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-based anticancer agents offer unique opportunities to integrate multiple therapeutic modalities within a single molecular framework. Herein, we present the first Osmium(II)-Platinum(IV)-Ceritinib conjugate (&lt;b&gt;Os-Pt-Cer&lt;/b&gt;) that synergistically combines photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy via immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction. This heterobimetallic complex features a photoactive osmium(II) polypyridyl core, a platinum(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin, and the kinase inhibitor ceritinib as an axial ligand. Upon deep-red irradiation (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; = 740&#160;nm), the conjugate exhibits potent antiproliferative activity in ovarian 2D cancer cells and 3D tumour spheroids, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in the low nanomolar range. In addition, &lt;b&gt;Os-Pt-Cer&lt;/b&gt; effectively inhibits cancer cell migration. Mechanistic studies reveal that the conjugate induces hallmarks of ICD, including calreticulin exposure, ATP release, HMGB1 secretion and phagocytosis. This multifunctional approach highlights the potential of osmium(II)-platinum(IV) conjugates as promising candidates for overcoming resistance and immune evasion in high-grade ovarian carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Permselective Covalent Organic Framework Membrane as Self&#8208;Extinguishing Separator for High&#8208;Safety Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorine&#8208;containing COF&#8208;based (TF&#8208;COF) membrane has been prepared by interfacial polymerization for use as a multifunctional separator in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with its excellent flame&#8208;retardant properties and its ability to regulate the transport of lithium ions, to improve the overall safety and cycling stability of batteries.








Abstract
As electric vehicles continue to gain popularity, the demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies is growing rapidly. The separator, the most critical component in a battery, plays a key role in ensuring battery safety. However, uncontrolled ion transport and persistent safety concerns in promising lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) still present significant challenges. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorine&#8208;functionalized COF (TF&#8208;COF) membrane as a battery separator to enhance the overall safety and cycling stability of LIBs. Its permselective nature effectively suppresses the growth of lithium dendrites and minimizes the risk of short circuit. When exposed to open flames, its excellent flame&#8208;retardant properties allow it to self&#8208;extinguish the fire up to three times, significantly prolonging the safe evacuation time when an accident occurs. Additionally, the intrinsic micropores of strongly lithophilic TF&#8208;COF separator facilitate uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, enabling high values of ionic conductivity (8.79&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S cm&#8722;1) and Li&#8314; transference number (tLi&#8330;, 0.86). The NCM811||Li cell with TF&#8208;COF separators demonstrated high&#8208;capacity retention of 87.6% after 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 0.5&#160;C. Our approach, leveraging the fire&#8208;retardant capabilities of permselective COF separators, offers a promising new pathway toward developing high&#8208;safety, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies with long&#8208;life cyclability.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed O&#8208;Alkylisourea&#8208;Enabled Electrochemical Radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel electrochemical protocol for the deoxygenative arylation of bench&#8208;stable O&#8208;alkylisoureas as C(sp3) radical precursors via reductive activation. Combined with nickel catalysis, this methodology enables the deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of alcohol derivatives with a wide range of aryl electrophiles, offering a mild and efficient electrochemical strategy for C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond formation.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods to employ naturally abundant alcohol derivatives as C(sp3) precursors for deoxygenative carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) cross&#8208;coupling holds significant value for expanding sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space. While progress has been made in this area, the field lacks readily accessible, bench&#8208;stable alkylation reagents capable of undergoing reductive activation to generate alkyl radicals. Herein, we report an electroreductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed system for efficient C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) radical cross&#8208;coupling between aryl electrophiles (halides, triflates, tosylates, and boronic acids) and O&#8208;alkylisoureas as radical progenitors. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. Its synthetic utility is highlighted through the preparation of beclobrate analogs and bifonazole, as well as late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds. Mechanistic investigations support a radical cross&#8208;coupling pathway for this transformation.

         <title>Degradation of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Binding Proteins by G4L&#8208;PROTAC via Quaternary Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report bifunctional G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands, termed G4L&#8208;PROTACs, that integrate a macrocyclic hexaoxazole G4&#8208;binding moiety with the cereblon ligand of pomalidomide. G4L&#8208;PROTACs induce the degradation of G4&#8208;bound proteins in living cells via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, providing a novel approach to selectively modulate intrinsic G4&#8211;protein interactions and gain insight into G4 biology.








Abstract
G&#8208;Quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structures enriched in genomic regions critical for transcription and replication. These dynamic scaffolds recruit G4&#8208;binding proteins (G4BPs), thereby regulating diverse cellular processes. However, the functional roles of G4BPs in the G4&#8208;bound state remain poorly defined. Here, we report the development of G4L&#8208;PROTACs&#8212;bifunctional small molecules that couple a G4 ligand with an E3 ligase recruiter to achieve selective proteasomal degradation of G4&#8208;bound G4BPs. Unlike RNAi or CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, which eliminate proteins irrespective of binding state, G4L&#8208;PROTACs enable depletion of G4BPs only when associated with G4s. Using model G4 motifs from telomeres and the NRAS 5&#8242; UTR, we demonstrated in vitro ternary complex formation. In cells, G4L&#8208;PROTAC treatment reduced endogenous levels of the G4&#8208;resolving helicase DHX36, resulting in a marked increase in intracellular G4 abundance, as shown by BG4 immunofluorescence. This phenotype highlights the ability of G4L&#8208;PROTACs to modulate the G4&#8211;protein equilibrium in living cells. Notably, G4L&#8208;PROTACs do not induce G4&#8208;mediated transcriptional silencing, underscoring their precision in modulating nucleic acid&#8211;protein interactions. This strategy offers a powerful platform for probing G4&#8211;G4BP functions and holds promise for therapeutic targeting of G4&#8208;associated proteins.

         <title>Quantification and Optimization of Interfacial Ion Transport in Polymer/Ceramic Composite Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes a quantitative model to estimate the interphase conductivity of solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes. Critical carrier transport parameters are experimentally determined based on a self&#8208;supported porous ceramic skeleton, which enables uniform filler distribution.








Abstract
Solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries owing to their superior mechano&#8208;chemical compatibility, oxidation stability, and high ionic conductivity. While extensive studies confirm that the newly formed interphase critically enhances ionic conductivity, its quantitative contribution remains experimentally unverified for any composite electrolyte. This knowledge gap lacks a key guideline for designing commercially viable solid electrolytes thereby hinders the development of solid&#8208;state batteries. A key challenge arises from the conventional low&#8208;dimensional fillers used in the composite electrolytes that tend to aggregate to create non&#8208;uniform interphase distribution thus complicating the determination of critical carrier transport parameters. To address this, we fabricate three&#8208;dimensional Li6.4Al0.1La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 self&#8208;supported porous skeletons as fillers, in which 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is in situ polymerized to establish a composite model system. Using advanced characterization techniques, we determine the geometric parameters governing carrier transport and develop a corresponding model to estimate interphase conductivity. Remarkably, the interphase exhibits a room&#8208;temperature conductivity of 2.5 mS cm&#8722;1, 33&#8208;fold higher than that of the bulk composite electrolyte. We attribute this enhancement to Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions that increase initiator concentration at the interphase, producing short&#8208;chain interfacial poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) with enlarged free volume for rapid Li&#8208;ion conduction. By applying this mechanistic understanding and coating the Li6.4Al0.1La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 skeleton with a stronger Lewis base (Li6PS5Cl), we further optimize interphase conductivity to 12 mS cm&#8722;1. The applicability of the composite electrolytes is demonstrated in high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries with both sulfur and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes paired with lithium metal anodes. This work establishes fundamental design principles for engineering high&#8208;conductivity interphases in polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes.

Remarkably, the interphase exhibits a room-temperature conductivity of 2.5 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 33-fold higher than that of the bulk composite electrolyte. We attribute this enhancement to Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions that increase initiator concentration at the interphase, producing short-chain interfacial poly(1,3-dioxolane) with enlarged free volume for rapid Li-ion conduction. By applying this mechanistic understanding and coating the Li&lt;sub&gt;6.4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; skeleton with a stronger Lewis base (Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), we further optimize interphase conductivity to 12 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The applicability of the composite electrolytes is demonstrated in high-energy solid-state batteries with both sulfur and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes paired with lithium metal anodes. This work establishes fundamental design principles for engineering high-conductivity interphases in polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Microscopic Water Orientation in Nickel Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Commercial&#8208;Scale CO2 Electrolysis to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 clusters modify Ni&#8211;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts to tune interfacial water orientation from oxygen&#8208;down to hydrogen&#8208;down configurations, dramatically enhancing proton supply for electrochemical CO2 reduction. This water orientation engineering enables nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at 50&#8211;600&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in flow cells and &gt;96% efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in membrane electrode assemblies with 118 h stability.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to carbon monoxide (CO) offers a sustainable route for fuel and chemical production. Achieving commercial&#8208;scale performance remains difficult, largely due to limited proton supply at high current densities. While single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit excellent CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity, their isolated active sites limit simultaneous optimization of CO2 activation and water dissociation. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of interfacial water orientation on water dissociation kinetics, but this factor remains underexplored in ECR systems. Here, we demonstrate that modifying Ni&#8211;N4 catalysts with CeO2 clusters alters the microscopic orientation of interfacial water, thereby enabling industrial&#8208;scale CO production. The CeO2&#8208;modified Ni&#8211;N4 achieves nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at current densities ranging from 50 to 600&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in flow cell and maintains 96% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. In a membrane electrode assembly, it sustains over 96% Faradaic efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 and maintains &gt;95% for 118 h at 150&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. Experimental and computational analyses reveal that CeO2 shifts the water orientation from oxygen&#8208;down to hydrogen&#8208;down configurations, thereby lowering the energy barriers for water dissociation and accelerating protonation. This work demonstrates that interfacial water orientation manipulation is a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts in CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Driving Multi&#8208;Step Regioselectivity in On&#8208;Surface Polymer Synthesis by Molecular Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective polymerization of dicyclopentaanthracene on Au(111) can be controlled by tuning molecular coverage. Low coverage yields 1D polymers, medium coverage produces quasi&#8208;1D staircase polymers, and higher coverage drives 2D porous networks. These findings demonstrate coverage as a key parameter to steer regioselectivity and polymer dimensionality.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has revolutionized the design of low&#8208;dimensional organic nanomaterials, introducing unprecedented families of compounds while offering precise control over their structural and functional properties. A critical challenge in this field is achieving regioselective control over covalent bond formation, which is essential for tailoring polymerization processes. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach toward regioselective polymerization on Au(111) using a dicyclopentaanthracene precursor, an acene derivative that comprise two terminal indene moieties. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal a molecular coverage&#8208;dependent regioselective homocoupling mechanism. At low coverage, one&#8208;dimensional polymers formed via indenyl couplings in anti&#8208;configuration dominate, involving both five&#8208;membered rings of the precursor. Increasing the coverage to half a monolayer shifts the regioselectivity, yielding a quasi&#8208;1D staircase polymer through indenyl couplings that engage only one five&#8208;membered ring of each precursor. At higher coverages, a two&#8208;dimensional porous network emerges, driven by the activation of the four benzylic positions of the molecular precursor. Our findings highlight the ability to steer regioselectivity and, consequently, polymer dimensionality by controlling molecular coverage, significantly advancing the fields of on&#8208;surface synthesis and polymer science.

         <title>Suppressed Concentration Quenching Via Divalent Eu/Sr Alloying in Hybrid Iodides Scintillators Toward Bright Luminescence for X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divalent Eu/Sr&#8208;based bimetallic hybrid iodide scintillators exhibit 1D [Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI6]4&#8722; octahedra chains, suppressing nonradiative energy loss effectively by maintaining optimal spacing and dispersion between adjacent Eu(II) emission centers. The suppressed quenching benefits to realize a high PLQY to 92.2%, excellent LY of 54&#160;000 &#177; 300&#160;ph MeV&#8722;1 and extremely low detection limits of 49.9 nGy s&#8722;1. The large&#8208;area ceramic wafer counterparts demonstrate high resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 15.7&#8201;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Overcoming concentration quenching in rare&#8208;earth&#8208;activated luminescent materials always remains a challenge for enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we report two divalent Sr&#8208;based hybrid iodides, (Ph3MeP)SrI3 and (Ph3EtP)SrI3 (Ph3MeP&#160;=&#160;methyltriphenylphosphonium, Ph3EtP&#160;=&#160;ethyltriphenylphosphonium), and equivalent Eu/Sr alloying have been identified experimentally in the full range of 0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;1 for (Ph3MeP)Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI3 and (Ph3EtP)Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI3. These Eu/Sr&#8208;based hybrid iodides exhibit 1D [Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI6]4&#8722; octahedra chains, suppressing nonradiative energy loss effectively by maintaining optimal spacing and dispersion between adjacent Eu(II) emission centers. Upon even heavily Eu(II) alloying, (Ph3MeP)Sr0.5Eu0.5I3 exhibits efficient green emission (&#955;em = 525&#160;nm) with a high PLQY of &#8764;92.2%. Accordingly, it achieves a high scintillation light yield of 54&#160;000 &#177; 300&#160;ph MeV&#8722;1 and a low detection limit of 49.9 nGy s&#8722;1. Furthermore, ceramic wafers counterparts of Eu/Sr alloy prepared via cold sintering process demonstrate high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 15.7 lp mm&#8722;1. These findings not only present a new family of hybrid bimetallic iodides via Eu/Sr alloying, but also provides structurally guided strategy to suppress concentration quenching toward bright luminescence for scintillation applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly, Rearrangement, and Disassembly of {Cr6} Horseshoe Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS2), and low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we elucidate the self&#8208;assembly, rearrangement, and disassembly processes of polymetallic {Cr6}x (x&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 5) horseshoe oligomers.








Abstract
Molecular assemblies are commonly found in biological systems, and designing synthetic mimics of these is a challenge for modern chemistry. Here, we apply ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS), density functional theory (DFT), and mass&#8208;selective electrospray ion beam deposition followed by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to decipher the self&#8208;assembly, rearrangement, and disassembly processes of {Cr6}n horseshoe oligomers (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;5). Activated tandem IM&#8208;MS reveals the oligomer disassembly in detail, highlighting the stability of the dimer unit. When n&#160;=&#160;2 and n = 3 oligomers are deposited on surfaces, we observe the rearrangement of dimers and trimers to dimers of dimers, and at higher coverages, the formation of an unexpected hexagonal&#8208;like network. In its entirety, the experimental and computational data provide a convincing framework for the analysis of supramolecular assembly processes in noncrystalline phases that could be used in future design strategies.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced&#8208;Emission Polymer Donor Improves the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells by Suppressing Nonradiative Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent aggregation&#8208;enhanced&#8208;emission polymer donor, namely PiNTSO&#8208;F, was designed and incorporated into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system, which optimizes the D&#8211;A interfaces, reduces the nonradiative recombination rate, and enhances charge generation efficiency. As a result, the ternary device achieves a low &#916;Vnr of 0.192&#160;V and an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.36%.








Abstract
Nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) is a critical factor that limits the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Introducing highly luminescent materials is a promising approach to reduce &#916;Vnr. The majority of prior works have focused on enhancing luminescence of low&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors, whereas highly luminescent donors have received far less attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a highly luminescent polymer donor with aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission property, namely PiNTSO&#8208;F, and incorporated it into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based system. Interestingly, PiNTSO&#8208;F was found to locate at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface, where it optimizes the interfacial morphology, energetic landscape, and charge dynamics of the active layer. Consequently, the nonradiative recombination rate in the ternary system is significantly reduced, while the interfacial charge generation efficiency is simultaneously improved to nearly unity, effectively minimizing &#916;Vnr of the device. As a result, the ternary devices achieve a low &#916;Vnr of 0.192&#160;V and a high efficiency of 20.36%. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for suppressing &#916;Vnr through developing the highly luminescent polymer donors as a third component, providing mechanistic insights that enable high&#8208;performance OSCs with minimized voltage loss.

         <title>Electrochemical Late&#8208;Stage Stitching of Tryptophan Peptides via N&#9472;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a versatile electrochemical platform for macrocyclization and stapling of endogenous peptides, featuring straightforward operation, rapid kinetics, and tunable ring size/geometry. Using sulfur&#8208;containing stapling reagents of varying lengths, tryptophan residues undergo rapid crosslinking cyclization, efficiently delivering 21&#8208; to 29&#8208;membered cyclopeptides with constrained conformations. This protocol enhances the bioactivity of linear peptide precursors, offering a novel strategy for cyclic peptide modification.








Abstract
Late&#8208;stage diversification of peptides via selective modification of endogenous amino acid side chains provides a powerful strategy to access analogues with enhanced bioactivity and tailored physicochemical properties, thereby facilitating peptide&#8208;based drug discovery. However, precise manipulation of short peptides comprising canonical amino acids&#8212;particularly control over backbone conformation&#8212;remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a robust electrochemical strategy for constructing macrocyclic peptides through direct incorporation of diverse aryl sulfur linkers. This method enables tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective crosslinking via electrochemical reaction with aryl thiosulfonates, leading to efficient formation of S&#9472;N bonds. The resulting sulfur&#8208;bridged multi&#8208;aryl macrocycles act as conformationally adaptive scaffolds that reshape the peptide backbone architecture. This conformational remodeling grants access to previously inaccessible structural spaces that are critical for modulating biological activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Degradable Polyimines Through Deborylative Polycondensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the general, room&#8208;temperature, and scalable synthesis of degradable polyimines by deborylative polycondensation under anhydrous and neutral conditions, which can improve the degree of polymerization, increase the stability of products, and reduce the operational difficulty during purification. This versatile strategy enables the synthesis of a series of new polyimine materials composed of both conjugated and nonconjugated backbones.








Abstract
Polyimines are degradable and have found applications in separation techniques, gene delivery, optoelectronics, and porous materials. Conventional methods to synthesize polymines involve dehydrative polycondensation, which requires the addition of acid catalysts and drying reagents and has limited substrate scope. In this work, a boron&#8208;mediated strategy has been developed for the synthesis of polyimines. First, we describe the borylation of diamines at the nitrogen sites to afford N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(boryl)diamines. Due to the N&#9472;B bond formation, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(boryl)diamines react fast, irreversibly, and completely with the dialdehydes via an unusual deborylative polycondensation process. Furthermore, methods for deborylative polycondensation reactions were developed under anhydrous and neutral conditions, yielding polyimines containing both aryl and alkyl backbones at room temperature in good to excellent yields. This polymerization protocol is scalable and reduces the operational difficulty in purifying the polyimines. These results provide a general and efficient polymerization tool for the practical synthesis of degradable polyimines.

         <title>Discovery of Antivirulence ClpP Inhibitors by Self&#8208;Resistance Gene&#8208;Guided Mining Coupled with Dual Functional Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Streptoclipamide A, a potent ClpP inhibitor (IC50&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nM), was discovered by self&#8208;resistance&#8208;guided genome mining coupled with dual functional screening. It uniquely suppresses MRSA virulence toxins without growth inhibition and synergizes with vancomycin in murine pneumonia. This work expands the ClpP inhibitor arsenal and provides a blueprint for resistance&#8208;conscious antimicrobial development.








Abstract
The global threat of MRSA demands innovative anti&#8208;virulence strategies. Caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP), a central virulence regulator in MRSA, represents an attractive yet underexploited target. Here, we developed a discovery platform integrating self&#8208;resistance gene&#8208;guided genome mining with dual functional screening, combining fluorometric&#8208;based assay and counter&#8208;screening against ADEP&#8208;induced ClpP activation. This led to the discovery of streptoclipamides A&#8211;G, novel hybrid polyketide&#8208;nonribosomal peptide ClpP inhibitors from str BGC, validated via heterologous expression and gene knockout. Structure&#8211;activity relationship studies enabled by engineered analogues identified key pharmacophores. Streptoclipamide A potently inhibits ClpP (IC50&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nM) by engaging Thr72 via its C&#8208;21 hydroxyl group, confirmed by biophysics and self&#8208;resistance&#8208;conferring T72P mutation. Streptoclipamide A suppressed MRSA virulence in vitro by reducing critical toxin production, including &#945;&#8208;hemolysin, and demonstrated protection in Galleria mellonella and murine pneumonia models. This work expands chemical diversity of ClpP&#8208;targeting agents, and establishes a genome mining&#8208;driven platform for discovering new therapeutics against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.

Streptoclipamide A suppressed MRSA virulence in vitro by reducing critical toxin production, including &#945;-hemolysin, and demonstrated protection in &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; and murine pneumonia models. This work expands chemical diversity of ClpP-targeting agents, and establishes a genome mining-driven platform for discovering new therapeutics against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Statistical Sampling&#8208;Driven Design for Supported Bimetallic Nanocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A statistical sampling&#8208;driven strategy through the gas&#8211;solid nanoreactor approach was developed to rationally guide the preparation of bimetallic nanocatalysts on the basis of the comparative ease of bimetal alloy formation. Over metal oxide&#8208;supported PdAu&#8208;catalyzed model CO2 reduction reactions, the results not only realize the preparation of the alloy or phase separation of supported PdAu, but also unveil the key factors governing the activity and product selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation.








Abstract
Tailoring supported bimetals to alloyed or phase&#8208;separated structures is of vital importance while this process is blocked by the support interferences during universal impregnation processes. Conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches rooted in chemical intuition often lack efficiency and generality. Here, we present a design strategy guided by the statistical sampling of comparative ease of alloy formation through the metadynamics&#8208;based gas&#8211;solid nanoreactor approach, which enables the rational and systematic development of bimetallic nanocatalysts (NCs). Using metal oxide&#8208;supported PdAu coupling with model CO2 reduction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, the integrated theoretical and experimental results not only validated the reliability of simulation results but also successfully predicted and realized the alloy formation or phase separation of supported PdAu NCs. The generated PdAu alloys over CeO2 weaken the metallicity of supported Pd species and thus the catalytic hydrogenation property, but increase moderate basicity, contributing to activated CO2 hydrogenation to CO via a formate intermediate. However, the phase separation of Pd and Au over TiO2 support promotes formic acid production efficiency attributed to increasing weak basicity to accelerate CO2 activation during a bicarbonate pathway. These findings highlight statistical sampling as a general broadly applicable framework for the rational design of advanced bimetallic NCs.

         <title>From Global Flexibility to Local Flexibility: Enable A&#8211;B Stacked Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Complex Gas Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a &#8220;rotor&#8208;locker&#8221; strategy that converts global flexibility into local flexibility by grafting molecular &#8220;lockers&#8221; onto a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling efficient separation of complex gas mixtures. The locked Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF exhibits exceptional performance in the one&#8208;step purification of C2H4, achieving a purity exceeding 99.9% from quaternary gas mixtures.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents can achieve exceptional separation performances under appropriate stimuli, especially for complex gas mixtures. However, their intrinsic global flexibility often leads to unsatisfactory separation selectivity, which hampers the practical applications. Herein, we propose a &#8220;rotor&#8208;locker&#8221; strategy to convert an A&#8211;B stacked Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;GF (GF&#160;=&#160;global flexibility) into Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF (LF&#160;=&#160;local flexibility) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H4 separation from multiple complex gas mixtures. The grafted methyl groups serve as lockers to suppress global flexibility while preserving local stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior. As a result, Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF exhibits a 10&#8208;fold increase in C2H2 uptake (1.95&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) compared to Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;GF (0.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) at 0.1&#160;bar and 298&#160;K, yielding a record selectivity of 9.2 for C2H2/C2H4 (50/50) among similar adsorbents. Moreover, the selective capture of C2H6 and CO2 impurities is also significantly enhanced. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that the Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF column enables direct separation of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&gt;99.9%) with a high productivity of 0.79&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 from a quaternary C2H2/C2H6/CO2/C2H4 (1v/33v/33v/33v) gas mixture. Density functional theory calculations reveal a lower deformation energy (&#8722;3.99&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) and specific adsorption sites for Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF.

         <title>Reducing Energetic Disorder for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Urbach Energy by in Situ NH3 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ ammonia release strategy was employed to suppress the Urbach energy of perovskite films and quantify the link between energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. This yielded a 52&#160;mV reduction, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.182&#160;V, and a power conversion efficiency of 26.26%.








Abstract
The high disorder in perovskite materials leads to severe carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, which directly determines the energy loss of photovoltaic devices. Currently, modulation of energetic disorder in perovskite solar cells and its correlation with open&#8208;circuit voltage losses (VOC, loss) remain insufficiently understood. We regulated the perovskite crystallization process by in situ NH3 generation, thereby enhancing the perovskite degree of energetic order. Density functional theory calculations reveal that lone&#8208;pair electrons on the N atom of the NH3 molecule coordinate with Pb2+, increasing the defect formation energy of lead vacancies (VPb), Pb&#8208;on&#8208;I antisite (PbI), and I&#8208;on&#8208;Pb antisite (IPb) to 5.61, 0.37, and 4.09&#160;eV, respectively. As a result, we obtained energetic ordered perovskite film with an Urbach energy of 23.7&#160;meV. The champion device exhibited a reduced VOC, loss by over than 50&#160;mV and achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.182&#160;V with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.26%. Under the ISOS&#8208;D protocols, the device maintains over 95% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of nitrogen storage and over 90% after 700&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C. And the 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 cm2 mini&#8208;modules achieved a PCE of 21.31%, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Multifunctional Electronic Textiles for the Simultaneous Detection and Uptake of Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A woven polyester fabric conformally coated with microcrystals of bismuth&#8208;based conductive coordination polymer absorbs H2S plume. As reported by Katherine A. Mirica et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202509883), the resulting smart membrane acts as a variable resistor within an electronic circuit, giving a concentration&#8208;dependent signal as the fabric captures the gas. A molecular visualization shows polysulfide chains wrapping Bi nodes that promote multifunctional performance of detection, capture, and detoxification in one electronic textile.

         <title>Chlorine Radical&#8208;Driven, Oxygen&#8208;Independent Afterglow Nanoplatform for Tumor Microenvironment&#8212;Adaptive Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel oxygen&#8208;free afterglow luminescence mechanism driven by &#183;Cl and synthesize afterglow nanoparticles Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG based on this mechanism. The afterglow luminescence generated by this mechanism is independent of oxygen concentration, making it a suitable tool for imaging various hypoxic physiological environments. Meanwhile, Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG can monitor the oxidative stress levels of tumors in real time through afterglow luminescence intensity.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence (afterglow) imaging offers exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios by eliminating tissue autofluorescence, yet most organic systems depend on oxygen&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species and fail in hypoxic environments such as solid tumors. Herein, we report an oxygen&#8208;independent afterglow mechanism driven by chlorine radicals (&#183;Cl). Hemicyanine&#8208;centered nanoparticles (Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG) were prepared by nanoprecipitation, surface&#8208;decorated with AgCl heterostructures for light&#8208;activated &#183;Cl generation, and stabilized with methoxypolyethylene glycol. Upon irradiation, AgCl produces &#183;Cl, which adds across the dye's conjugated double bond to form metastable epoxide intermediates; subsequent epoxide decomposition releases stored chemical energy, re&#8208;exciting the dye and yielding intense afterglow emission regardless of O2 concentration. This strategy extends to cyanine and porphyrin fluorophores, underscoring its generality. A pH&#8208;responsive variant (Hcy&#8208;pH@AgCl) further enables afterglow imaging of pH&#8208;responsive. In vivo, Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG achieves high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging and leverages the oxidative potency of &#183;Cl to induce pronounced photodynamic therapy via oxidative stress and DNA single&#8208;electron oxidation. Together, these findings establish a new paradigm for oxygen&#8208;free afterglow systems and deliver a versatile theranostic platform for imaging and treatment in dynamic, hypoxia&#8208;associated pathologies.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Umpolung for Strain&#8208;Release Difunctionalization of (Aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>

We report a radical umpolung strategy for regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes using sulfinate&#8208;derived electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, enabling ring&#8208;opening and subsequent functionalization with acyl derivatives, aldehydes, or CO2 under mild conditions








Abstract
Azetidines and cyclobutanes are increasingly valued as potent bioisosteres of pyridines and benzenes in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a radical umpolung strategy for the regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) that exhibits complementary regioselectivity to conventional polar strain&#8208;release methods. This approach uses photocatalytically generated electrophilic sulfonyl radicals from readily available sulfinates to selectively add to nitrogen in ABBs and electron&#8208;rich sites of BCBs, triggering strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening. The resulting radical intermediates are subsequently captured through two pathways: N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling enables efficient acylation, while single&#8208;electron reduction generates carbanions capable of nucleophilic addition to electrophiles such as CO2 and aldehydes. The umpolung reactivity of this protocol enhances synthetic versatility by accommodating diverse azetidine functionalities under mild conditions to afford densely functionalized azetidines and cyclobutanes that are difficult to access through existing methods.

         <title>Electrochemical Assembly of a Defective Cu Catalyst for High Current CO2 Electrolysis to Methane in a Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an electrochemical assembly strategy that forms a Cu(111) catalyst with vacancy defects. Integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer system, this catalyst achieved a high methane FE of 71.46% at a total current of 1.5 A, with a corresponding production rate of 0.28&#160;&#181;mol s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and stable operation over 10&#160;h.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis to methane offers a promising route toward enabling long&#8208;term storage of renewable energy. However, electrolysis in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems using conventional Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts is typically limited by relatively low methane productivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, we conceived an electrochemical assembly strategy that forms a Cu(111)&#8208;dominant catalyst with vacancy defects. In an MEA system at a total current of 1.5 A, the catalyst (Def&#8208;Cu6) achieved a record methane FE of 71.46% and production rate of 0.28&#160;&#181;mol s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, with relatively stable operation over 10&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal the crucial role of vacancy defects in a Cu(111) surface, which favors the hydrogenation of CO* and promotes methane formation over the competing CO* coupling pathway that leads to multicarbon products. Our findings demonstrate how vacancy defects can be tuned to control catalytic outcomes.

However, electrolysis in zero-gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems using conventional Cu-based electrocatalysts is typically limited by relatively low methane productivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE).

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloaddition Enabled by Cage&#8208;Confined Photocatalysis for Precise Bicyclo[2.1.1]Hexane Construction</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] photocycloaddition between chalcones and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCBs was achieved through photoactive metal&#8211;organic cage (PMOC)confined catalysis. This strategy provides a highly atom economical and diastereoselective route to pharmaceutically relevant BCH bioisosteres, leveraging the unique spatial constraints of the supramolecular cage to control reactivity and selectivity. 








Abstract
We disclose a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] photocycloaddition between readily available chalcones and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) promoted by photoactive metal&#8211;organic cage (PMOC). This confined supramolecular catalysis method enables efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane (BCH) bioisosteres with remarkable atom economy and excellent diastereoselectivities, necessitating only 0.1&#160;mol% catalyst loading. The success of this organic transformation arises from the synergistic action of the PMOC as a nanoreactor to combine selective substrate preorganization through host&#8211;guest interactions, efficient Ru(II)&#8208;mediated triplet energy transfer, and nano&#8208;spatial confinement effect that precisely control [2&#960;+2&#963;] cyclization geometry while preventing competitive homodimerization.

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Driven Syn&#8208;/Anti&#8208;Conformational Regulation in Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrate a syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti&#8208;conformational transition in nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors, achieved through strategic incorporation of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. Our systematic study reveals how conformational preferences affect molecular planarity, self&#8208;assembly, and photovoltaic performance, thus offering conformation&#8208;directed molecular design guidelines for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells.








Abstract
Molecular conformation is a critical structural attribute of organic molecules and polymers in addition to their constitution and configuration, thereby forming the foundation for understanding macroscopic material properties and device functionality. For nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) featuring multiple &#963;&#8208;bonds with high rotational degrees of freedom, significant challenges remain in precisely regulating molecular conformation, particularly in modulating the syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformation preferences. Here, we demonstrate precise engineering of NFREAs through conformation&#8208;directed molecular design, achieving a syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti&#8208;conformational transition via utilizing intramolecular noncovalent S&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions. This conformational regulation strategy enables a systematic investigation of how syn&#8208;/anti&#8208;conformational preferences influence molecular planarity and rigidity, self&#8208;assembly behavior, charge transport properties, and device performance. Our results reveal that the anti&#8208;conformation endows anti&#8208;TT&#8208;F with enhanced crystallinity, reduced reorganization energy, and improved charge carrier mobility compared to its syn&#8208;conformational counterpart. Consequently, binary and ternary devices based on anti&#8208;TT&#8208;F achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 15.08% and 19.88%, respectively. This conformational engineering strategy unveils a previously overlooked dimension in molecular design, providing fundamental guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells through the rational manipulation of conformational landscapes.

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of S&#8208;chirogenic allyl sulfinamides is reported, wherein the allylation of sulfinylamines with allenes is demonstrated to proceed with broad substrate scope, accompanied by excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Sulfinamides, pivotal scaffolds in modern organic synthesis, have undergone a continuous evolution of synthetic methodologies over the past century, yet the precise construction of sulfur stereocenters remains a significant synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a versatile catalytic asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of S&#8208;chirogenic allyl sulfinamides through the direct allylation of sulfinylamines with allenes. Our methodology employs a catalytic system comprising copper salts, hydrosilanes, and readily accessible chiral ligands, which facilitates the in situ generation of organocopper surrogates via hydrocupration of allenes. This approach demonstrates remarkable substrate scope and excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity across a diverse array of sulfinamide products. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations, including detailed experimental studies and computational analyses, have been conducted to elucidate the reaction pathway and identify the key factors governing enantioselectivity.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks with Thiazole Linkages to Enhance Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer and Charge Separation in Photocatalytic Oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is first reported for the development of highly active thiazole&#8208;linked photocatalysts by synergistic effects of d&#8208;HAT, O2&#8226;&#8722;, and 1O2 within anthraquinone&#8208;based D&#8211;A COF platforms. Thus, the TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF represents the rare example of photocatalytic oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in an aqueous system under ambient conditions, almost the highest activities among reported heterogeneous photocatalysts.








Abstract
The design of efficient covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as photocatalysts for C(sp3)&#9472;H bond oxidation under green and mild conditions is highly desirable. Herein, TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF and TpAR&#8208;TZ COF, featuring thiazole linkages, were synthesized by combining 1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylcarboxaldehyde (Tp), sulfur (S8), and direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) components (2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone, AQ; 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthrone, AR). The TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF demonstrates impressive photocatalytic activity, achieving a 93% yield for phthalan oxidation under heterogeneous conditions&#8212;a rare example of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond oxidation in water under ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations reveal enhanced hydrogen atom abstraction capability coming from the increased number of d&#8208;HAT catalytic sites. Moreover, BdAQ&#8208;TZ COF and HbAQ&#8208;TZ COF were prepared by replacing Tp with 2,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene (Bd) or 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene (Hb), respectively. Dipole moment calculations and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy show that the increased number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde monomer improves the charge separation efficiency within the three COFs, thereby accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF. This work opens up new opportunities for designing highly active photocatalysts by using the synergistic effects of d&#8208;HAT, O2&#8226;&#8722;, and 1O2 within anthraquinone&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor COF platforms, offering a sustainable route for the oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds under environmentally friendly conditions.

Thus, the TpAQ-TZ COF represents the rare example of photocatalytic oxidation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bonds in an aqueous system under ambient conditions, almost the highest activities among reported heterogeneous photocatalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of efficient covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as photocatalysts for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bond oxidation under green and mild conditions is highly desirable. Herein, TpAQ-TZ COF and TpAR-TZ COF, featuring thiazole linkages, were synthesized by combining 1,3,5-tricarboxylcarboxaldehyde (Tp), sulfur (S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), and direct hydrogen atom transfer (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-HAT) components (2,6-diaminoanthraquinone, AQ; 2,6-diaminoanthrone, AR). The TpAQ-TZ COF demonstrates impressive photocatalytic activity, achieving a 93% yield for phthalan oxidation under heterogeneous conditions&#8212;a rare example of photocatalytic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bond oxidation in water under ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations reveal enhanced hydrogen atom abstraction capability coming from the increased number of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-HAT catalytic sites. Moreover, BdAQ-TZ COF and HbAQ-TZ COF were prepared by replacing Tp with 2,4-dihydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzene (Bd) or 2-hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzene (Hb), respectively. Dipole moment calculations and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy show that the increased number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde monomer improves the charge separation efficiency within the three COFs, thereby accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TpAQ-TZ COF. This work opens up new opportunities for designing highly active photocatalysts by using the synergistic effects of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-HAT, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; within anthraquinone-based donor&#8211;acceptor COF platforms, offering a sustainable route for the oxidation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bonds under environmentally friendly conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Tandem Epoxidation Efficiency via Hydrogel Confinement Effect towards Photoelectrochemical Propylene Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of an efficient hydrogen peroxide&#8208;propylene oxide process for alkene epoxidation in a sustainable future is deeply based on faster H2O2 production and higher H2O2 conversion efficiency. Herein, a spatial confinement strategy is proposed to greatly reinforce the propylene epoxidation kinetics. An innovative multi&#8208;pass reflective flow reactor endowed with maximal optical transport and absorbance is also demonstrated.








Abstract
Propylene oxide (PO) is among the world's most abundantly produced commodity chemicals, but it suffers from an energy&#8208;intensive and highly polluting industrial production route. In this work, we present a tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) PO production system involving water oxidation to H2O2 via a BiVO4 photoanode and subsequent propylene epoxidation by titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst&#8208;loaded hydrogel using in situ&#8208;generated H2O2. The hydrogel encapsulated on the BiVO4 photoanode surface provides a confined space to enhance H2O2 enrichment, as well as propylene transport, thereby reinforcing the epoxidation kinetics with conversion efficiencies of 94.06% for H2O2 and 75.55% for propylene. With the assistance of solar energy, the PO productivity per unit of electricity can reach 6.10 mol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;kWh&#8722;1, which is the lowest electricity consumption for existing alkene epoxidation technology. For industrial scalability, a multi&#8208;pass light absorption configuration is designed for decimeter&#8208;sized reactor to address the issue of a plunge in solar to chemical (STC) efficiency arising from the scale&#8208;up of the photoanode, achieving the optimum light harvesting efficiency of 98.21% and STC efficiency of 5.57% which is comparable to its 1 cm2 counterpart (86% retention). The continuous PO productivity in flowing electrolyte can reach 1.74 mmol&#183;h&#8722;1 with a steady selectivity of 91.05% under AM 1.5G illumination. Finally, a techno&#8208;economic analysis is provided to offer targets that need to be met for economically compelling industrial implementation.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Driven Ni3S4 Gradient in NiFe&#8208;LDH Enables Durable Industrial&#8208;Scale Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH gradient heterostructure nanosheets grown on iron foams are constructed by a corrosion engineering strategy at room temperature within just 1 h. When employed as the anode catalyst in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH/IF demonstrates low overpotentials along with exceptionally long&#8208;term stability, maintaining efficient pure water splitting for 1000 h at 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Designing low&#8208;cost yet highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is essential to enable sustainable green hydrogen generation. However, synthesis complexity, slow kinetics, and poor durability hinder industrial use. In this study, we present a corrosion&#8208;driven gradient engineering approach for the rapid, energy&#8208;free synthesis of Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH heterostructures on iron foam (IF) under ambient conditions. During spontaneous IF corrosion, a compositional and gradient structure forms, with Ni3S4 dominating the surface and NiFe&#8208;LDH enriching the core, establishing a continuous pathway for rapid electron transport. The catalyst exhibits superior OER performance, achieving low overpotentials of 297&#160;mV in 1&#160;M KOH and 326&#160;mV in simulated seawater at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Notably, in pure&#8208;water anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the catalyst demonstrates industrial&#8208;grade performance, sustaining 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.85&#160;V with remarkable stability over 1,000 h of continuous operation. Operando spectroscopic studies unveil that SO42&#8722; leaching from surface Ni3S4 in the gradient structure provides dual protection against metal dissolution and chloride corrosion. Furthermore, the in situ formation of FeOOH synergistically stabilizes the catalytically critical Ni3+ species in NiOOH through strong Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Ni interfacial bonding, contributing to the exceptional durability. This work provides fundamental insights into corrosion&#8208;mediated catalyst design, offering a scalable pathway for developing industrial&#8208;grade electrocatalysts.

         <title>In Situ Construction of NaF&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase with Metallic Ce Sites for Stable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a substrate&#8208;driven in situ interfacial engineering strategy to construct NaF&#8208;rich SEI with metallic Ce active sites, which stabilizes the interphase, accelerates Na+ desolvation, and enables 90% ultrahigh DOD along with stable anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Developing reversible Na plating/stripping under high depth of discharge (DOD) is critical for stable anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs). Achieving high reversibility relies on a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), yet current strategies depend on high&#8208;concentration salts or fluorinated solvents, limiting their practicality. Herein, we demonstrate an in situ NaF&#8208;rich SEI with metallic Ce sites that bypasses electrolyte decomposition. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and TOF&#8208;SIMS revealed a conversion reaction between Na+ and CeF3@NC, forming NaF and metallic Ce sites during cycling. This substrate&#8208;driven well&#8208;defined NaF&#8208;rich SEI ensures interfacial stability even under high DOD. Moreover, metallic Ce sites exhibit strong PF6&#8722; affinity, facilitating Na+ desolvation by lowering the energy barrier for step&#8208;by&#8208;step anion extraction. Consequently, the anode achieved ultra&#8208;long stability of 5800&#160;h (20% DOD) and 1600&#160;h (90% DOD). The full cells delivered the impressive cycling stability for 500 cycles with 93.3% capacity retention, while a pouch cell retained 90.98% capacity after 300 cycles. Notably, the AFSMBs with high cathode loading (&gt;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) exhibited excellent stability, retaining 83.6% capacity over 100 cycles. This work provides new insights into engineering robust in situ SEI, paving the way for accelerating practical application of AFSMBs.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Mediated Growth of Oriented Membrane from 2D&#8208;Structured Zirconium MOF for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly face&#8208;on oriented metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes of Zr&#8208;TCA were successfully fabricated for gas separation. Fine balancing of the gel&#8208;to&#8208;membrane process enabled horizontal layer deposition and well crystal intergrowth. Unprecedented gas separation performance in terms of high permeance and selectivity was achieved for CO2/N2 mixture. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional structured metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;structured MOF) membranes with functionalized and ordered&#8208;direction pores hold significant promise for efficient CO2 separation. However, the direct synthesis of such membranes remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a novel organic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated conversion strategy for direct transformation of a preformed metal&#8211;organic gel (MOG) into an oriented membrane of 2D&#8208;structured MOF. The MOG is initially synthesized and subsequently dissociated to release Zr6 clusters, which promotes the nucleation and growth of the MOF structure.

     alt="Organic-Acid-Mediated Growth of Oriented Membrane from 2D-Structured Zirconium MOF for CO2 Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly face-on oriented metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes of Zr-TCA were successfully fabricated for gas separation. Fine balancing of the gel-to-membrane process enabled horizontal layer deposition and well crystal intergrowth. Unprecedented gas separation performance in terms of high permeance and selectivity was achieved for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional structured metal&#8211;organic framework (2D-structured MOF) membranes with functionalized and ordered-direction pores hold significant promise for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. However, the direct synthesis of such membranes remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a novel organic-acid-mediated conversion strategy for direct transformation of a preformed metal&#8211;organic gel (MOG) into an oriented membrane of 2D-structured MOF. The MOG is initially synthesized and subsequently dissociated to release Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; clusters, which promotes the nucleation and growth of the MOF structure. Small organic molecules of formic acid are employed to modulate the coordination between Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; clusters and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;-tricarboxyltriphenylamine ligand (TCA&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). By finely tuning the balance between crystallization and intergrowth kinetics, a highly oriented Zr-TCA membrane is fabricated, exhibiting excellent crystallinity and structural homogeneity. The resulting Zr-TCA membrane features nitrogen-functionalized, well-aligned pores oriented parallel to the direction of gas permeation; enabling outstanding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance, with an exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 1857.3&#160;GPU and a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 39.2 at 0.12&#160;MPa and 25&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tubular All&#8208;Benzene Nanocarbon with Evolving Excited&#8208;State Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tubular all&#8208;benzene nanocarbons (TANCs) featuring triple covalent linkers have been constructed by coaxially stacked cycloparaphenylene units. The chiral&#8208;TANC exhibits dynamic helicity with ultrafast untwisting motions within 8&#160;ps following photoexcitation. 








Abstract
Molecular nanocarbons with precisely defined conjugated scaffolds can provide an ideal platform for investigating mechanistic insights into photophysical properties. Here, we report the synthesis and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic characterization of two isomeric tubular all&#8208;benzene nanocarbon (TANC) molecules, named meso&#8208; and chiral&#8208;TANC, respectively. Structurally, they feature triple covalent linkages, with different connectivity, between coaxially stacked cycloparaphenylene units. While meso&#8208;TANC maintains conformational rigidity, chiral&#8208;TANC shows photo&#8208;induced dynamic helicity. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) and time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy demonstrate that chiral&#8208;TANC undergoes ultrafast relaxation accompanied by untwisting motions within 8&#160;ps upon photoexcitation, establishing the direct correlation between photo&#8208;induced conformational evolution and chiroptical dynamics in heteroatom&#8208;free, fully conjugated molecules.

         <title>Synergistic Two&#8208;Color Photochemical Polymer Network Formation and Lithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitches, able to respond to disparate wavelengths, are integrated into multi&#8208;functional polymer architectures to form a photoresist that responds to curing upon irradiation with two distinct monochromatic colors of light, enabling two&#8208;color lithography.








Abstract
We introduce synergistic two&#8208;color lithography as an advanced wavelength&#8208;gated strategy for spatially and temporally controlling polymer network formation. Our photoresist entails two photoswitches, i.e., diarylindenone epoxide (DIO) and strained azobenzene (SA), each activated at a judiciously selected wavelength, i.e., 375 or 430&#160;nm. Under specific conditions of photon flux, simultaneous irradiation at both wavelengths induces a (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#160;cycloaddition between the photoactivated DIO&#8242; and SA&#8242; species, generating covalently crosslinked networks, whereas under these specifically determined conditions, single&#8208;wavelength exposure does not induce solidification. Kinetic analysis highlights the potential of synergistic activation to enable advanced additive manufacturing. We implemented the two&#8208;color activated covalent bond forming system in a dual&#8208;laser lithographic platform enabling the fabrication of well&#8208;defined structures, including segmented ring and butterfly architectures by simply activating and deactivating one of the colors of light.

         <title>Lithium Iodide Enables Bis&#8208;electrophilic Ring&#8208;Opening of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium iodide&#8208;mediated electrophile&#8211;electrophile ring opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) furnishes densely substituted azetidines. Leveraging ABB ring strain under mild, base&#8208;free conditions, the method enables sequential electrophilic incorporation, displays broad scope and operational simplicity, and is amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization.








Abstract
Azetidines are privileged nitrogen heterocycles in medicinal chemistry; however, current synthetic methodologies utilizing azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) predominantly rely on classical nucleophile&#8211;electrophile or radical&#8208;based approaches. Here, we report an unprecedented electrophile&#8211;electrophile ring&#8208;opening strategy enabled by lithium iodide&#8208;mediated activation of ABBs, offering direct and versatile access to densely substituted azetidines through sequential electrophilic incorporation. This new reactivity exploits the inherent ring strain of ABBs under mild, base&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions, thereby eliminating the necessity for harsh reaction environments. Mechanistic studies and control experiments unequivocally establish the pivotal role of lithium iodide in ring&#8208;opening and generating an in situ enolate intermediate, facilitating efficient bisfunctionalization via electrophilic trapping. The operational simplicity, extensive substrate scope, and remarkable compatibility with late&#8208;stage functionalization significantly enhance the synthetic versatility and modularity of ABB&#8208;derived azetidines, presenting a powerful approach for rapidly assembling complex molecules containing azetidines.

         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor strategy enables the first pure&#8208;blue organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL, &#955; &lt; 450&#160;nm) with hour&#8208;long afterglow, achieved via rationally designed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers. Mechanistic studies reveal a charge&#8208;separation&#8208;induced pathway. Remarkably, OLPL can be optically erased by green/red light, offering write&#8208;erase capability for photonic storage and encryption.








Abstract
We pioneered a donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three&#8208;component system to devise organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials, where the afterglow color is solely determined by sensitizer's emission color. Here we report two major breakthroughs in the field of OLPL: 1) tailored fabrication of pure&#8208;blue OLPL materials and 2) a direct observation of OLPL erased by green/red lights. We rationally designed blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers by connecting biphenyl&#8208;containing group with suitable HOMO and T1 energy levels to difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate moiety based on the energy gap law and the El&#8208;Sayed rule. The resultant donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three&#8208;component materials exhibit pure&#8208;blue hour&#8208;long OLPL afterglow with &#955;OLPL &lt; 450&#160;nm; such pure&#8208;blue OLPL materials remain elusive in the reported studies. Mechanistic investigations confirm a unique charge&#8208;separation&#8208;induced OLPL pathway, involving electron transfer processes between donor, sensitizer, and acceptor. The OLPL materials are UV/visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable. Remarkably, it is found that the OLPL emission can be erased by green or red light; the long&#8208;lived excited TADF sensitizers can be pushed by green/red lights to higher excited states, followed by fast nonradiative deactivation, enabling optical erasure. This unprecedented optical write&#8211;erase functionality, coupled with hour&#8208;long OLPL duration, would offer promising opportunities for rewritable photonic storage, encryption, and dynamic labeling applications.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Electron and Hole Transport by Pd Single Atoms and Gradient&#8208;Distributed Ti3+ Species for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Oxidation of CH4 to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiO2&#8208;based photocatalyst featuring atomically dispersed Pd and a gradient distribution of Ti3+ enables efficient photocatalytic oxidation of CH4 to liquid oxygenates at room temperature. Pd atoms enhance electron transfer and O2 activation, while Ti3+ promotes hole migration, thereby achieving a record C1 oxygenates yield with 91.3% selectivity through spatially separated charge carrier pathways.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates offers a sustainable strategy for utilizing natural gas and reducing carbon emissions. However, the efficiency of current photocatalysts remains limited by poor charge carrier utilization, particularly the ineffective migration of holes that are crucial for C&#9472;H bond activation. Herein, we report a rationally engineered TiO2 photocatalyst incorporating atomically dispersed Pd and a gradient distribution of Ti3+ species, achieving a remarkable C1 oxygenates yield of 8.14&#160;mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with 91.3% selectivity at room temperature, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd single atoms accelerate electron transfer and facilitate O2 dissociation, while the gradient&#8208;distributed Ti3+ species promote hole migration from the bulk to the surface, enabling efficient CH4 activation. These spatially separated charge pathways synergistically promote the formation of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;OOH radicals, which couple to generate CH3OOH and subsequently convert into methanol and formaldehyde.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereospecific Glycosylation with Glycal Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed, highly stereospecific glycosylation method with glycal epoxides, which is effective for a broad range of substrates, including previously challenging, sterically hindered secondary acceptors and glucuronic ester epoxide donors. Kinetic studies revealed that this iron&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation proceeds through SN2&#8208;type pathways with hindered secondary acceptors. 








Abstract
Complex carbohydrates are essential to understanding life processes, but their synthesis is still challenging. In principle, complex glycans could be rapidly assembled via reiterative and stereospecific glycosylation with glycal epoxides. However, the existing stereospecific glycosylation methods with glycal epoxides are ineffective for the vast majority of secondary sugar acceptors, because they often induce irreversible glycal epoxide decomposition and concurrent SN1&#8208;type glycosylation, affording an inseparable mixture of diastereomeric glycosylation products in low yields. We report herein a new catalytic, highly stereospecific glycosylation method for glycal epoxides using readily available iron catalysts. This method is effective for a wide variety of glycal epoxides and glycosyl acceptors, including previously challenging, sterically hindered secondary acceptors and electron&#8208;deficient glucuronic ester epoxides. It also facilitates the assembly of an array of biologically important glycosidic linkages that were previously difficult to obtain in high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that this iron&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation proceeds through SN2&#8208;type pathways with both primary and hindered secondary acceptors.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonyl&#8208;Locking Strategy for Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient, Narrowband Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first blue B/N/C&#9552;O hybrid multiple resonance emitters are developed by one&#8208;step carbonylation, exhibiting narrowband blue emissions peaking at 462 and 445 nm with full widths at half maximum of 16 and 18 nm in toluene, and high electroluminescent performance with external quantum efficiencies of 37.9% and 22.8%, together with the CIE coordinates of (0.133, 0.141) and (0.146, 0.078), respectively.








Abstract
Efficient and narrowband blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are highly attractive for wide color gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, we strategically incorporate an electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl lock at the para&#8208;position of the nitrogen atom in the classical MR&#8208;TADF skeleton by a simple one&#8208;step carbonylation reaction with a high yield. Compared to the parent molecules, this design strategy not only reduces intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer intensity, leading to&#160;blue&#8208;shifted emission, but also effectively enhances molecular planarity and rigidity, thereby narrowing the emission spectra. As a result, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, namely CO&#8208;BCzBN and CO&#8208;DABNA, are developed, with&#160;emission peaks at 462 and 445&#160;nm, and narrow the full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of 16 and 18&#160;nm, respectively, representing the first blue boron/nitrogen/carbonyl hybrid MR&#8208;TADF emitters. The sensitized OLEDs based on CO&#8208;BCzBN and CO&#8208;DABNA achieve excellent blue electroluminescent performance, with the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values of 37.9% and 22.8%, along with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.133, 0.141) and (0.146, 0.078), respectively.

         <title>Observation of Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal and Photoacoustic Effects in a Metallosupramolecular Trefoil Knot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallosupramolecular trifold knot has been prepared from three bisimidazole ligands and three dinuclear half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes. The topology of the trifold knot enforces strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the building blocks, which results in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption. This leads to an efficient photothermal conversion and a remarkable photoacoustic (PA) response, while the trifold knot exhibits a high stability.








Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is a facile and powerful strategy for the construction of metallosupramolecular mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs). However, the limited stability of most MIMs constitutes a challenge with respect to the evaluation of their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate a rational strategy to control the self&#8208;assembly outcome for selected metallosupramolecular structures. The reaction of a biphenyl&#8208;bridged bisimidazole ligand with dinuclear building blocks of varying lengths leads, depending on the size of the dinuclear building block, to a simple [1+1] metallacycle, a twisted [2+2] three&#8208;dimensional trapezoidal structure, or an intricate [3+3] metallosupramolecular trefoil knot. The trefoil knot exhibits exceptional structural stability, resisting decomposition upon dilution in polar solvent. Its knotted topology enforces strong intramolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions, which red&#8208;shift the absorption band into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. Benefiting from its stability and NIR absorption, the trefoil knot displays a high photothermal conversion efficiency (&#951;&#160;=&#160;73.5%) and a potent photoacoustic (PA) effect in water, even at low concentrations.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Ligand Regulation of Homogeneous Cation&#8211;Anion Distribution Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;ligands additives, PCH and PBD achieve homogeneous cation&#8211;anion distribution in perovskite films via coordinated Pb2&#8314;/FA&#8314; passivation and I&#8722; stabilization. This optimized uniformity enables vacuum&#8208;flashed PSCs with a record 26.66% PCE (certified 26.33%) and exceptional stability (&gt;90% efficiency retention after 1100&#160;h MPPT at 60&#160;&#176;C), highlighting ion homogeneity as key for high performance.








Abstract
While amidine ligands are known to significantly enhance defect passivation in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their role in modulating perovskite film homogeneity through coordinated control of cation&#8211;anion distributions remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that a dual&#8208;ligand strategy utilizing pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboximidamide hydrochloride (PCH) and pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboximidamide dihydrochloride (PBD) achieves homogeneous cation&#8211;anion distributions, enabling high&#8208;performance PSCs. Incorporated into the precursor solutions, these dual&#8208;ligand additives distribute uniformly throughout the perovskite bulk. By simultaneously utilizing their pyridine and amidine groups to passivate Pb2&#8314; and FA&#8314; ions, as well as employing hydrogen bonding to stabilize I&#8722; ions, the uniformity of anions and cations within the film is enhanced. Vacuum flash&#8208;assisted solution&#8208;processed PSCs incorporating PBD&#8208;passivated films with optimized homogeneity achieved a PCE of 26.66% (certified 26.33%). Notably, these devices retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1100 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under operational conditions (60&#160;&#176;C, N2 atmosphere). This PCE value ranks among the highest reported to date for perovskite solar cells. Our findings highlight that achieving homogeneous cation&#8208;anion distribution is essential for designing effective passivators, thereby simultaneously advancing both the PCE and operational stability of PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Dual-ligands additives, PCH and PBD achieve homogeneous cation&#8211;anion distribution in perovskite films via coordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;/FA&#8314; passivation and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; stabilization. This optimized uniformity enables vacuum-flashed PSCs with a record 26.66% PCE (certified 26.33%) and exceptional stability (&amp;gt;90% efficiency retention after 1100&#160;h MPPT at 60&#160;&#176;C), highlighting ion homogeneity as key for high performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While amidine ligands are known to significantly enhance defect passivation in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their role in modulating perovskite film homogeneity through coordinated control of cation&#8211;anion distributions remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that a dual-ligand strategy utilizing pyridine-2-carboximidamide hydrochloride (PCH) and pyridine-2,6-dicarboximidamide dihydrochloride (PBD) achieves homogeneous cation&#8211;anion distributions, enabling high-performance PSCs. Incorporated into the precursor solutions, these dual-ligand additives distribute uniformly throughout the perovskite bulk. By simultaneously utilizing their pyridine and amidine groups to passivate Pb&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; and FA&#8314; ions, as well as employing hydrogen bonding to stabilize I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions, the uniformity of anions and cations within the film is enhanced. Vacuum flash-assisted solution-processed PSCs incorporating PBD-passivated films with optimized homogeneity achieved a PCE of 26.66% (certified 26.33%). Notably, these devices retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1100 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under operational conditions (60&#160;&#176;C, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere). This PCE value ranks among the highest reported to date for perovskite solar cells. Our findings highlight that achieving homogeneous cation-anion distribution is essential for designing effective passivators, thereby simultaneously advancing both the PCE and operational stability of PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Boron&#8208;10 Access: Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C(sp2)&#9472;10B Coupling Utilizing 10BF3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C(sp2)&#9472;10B cross&#8208;coupling method was developed, utilizing commercially available 10BF3. This approach features a Lewis acid/base activation strategy to generate reactive borenium ions in situ. It enables the efficient synthesis of a wide range of 10B&#8208;enriched organoboron compounds, which hold significant potential for applications in boron neutron capture therapy drug development and neutron&#8208;shielding materials.








Abstract
The boron&#8208;10 isotope (10B) is critical for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT); however, the direct use of industrially available 10BF3 for synthesizing 10B&#8208;enriched compounds remains challenging due to the strong B&#9472;F bonds. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol that enables direct C(sp2)&#9472;10B bond formation using 10BF3. This approach employs AlCl3 and a Lewis base to generate electrophilic borenium ions in situ. The method eliminates the need for pre&#8208;functionalized boron reagents, providing an efficient route to diverse 10B&#8208;enriched compounds with promising applications in BNCT and neutron&#8208;shielding materials.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells by Fine&#8208;Tuning Molecular Crystallization and Film Formation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing efficient yet low&#8208;cost electron acceptors is imperative for widespread organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. Herein, a highly interconnected three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network packing and the optimized film formation kinetics of low&#8208;cost A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A&#8208;type pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors have been precisely manipulated via a facile side chain regulation, leading to both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and record&#8208;breaking figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) for OSCs. 








Abstract
Achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with low&#8208;cost active layer materials is of vital importance for organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. However, the PCEs afforded by currently reported low&#8208;cost electron acceptors remain substantially limited. Herein, we report the regulation of molecular crystallization and film formation kinetics of the low&#8208;cost electron acceptors with A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A&#8208;type pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring structures and achieved an impressive PCE of 18.04% and a tiptop figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) of 0.363, representing the best&#8208;known values for OSCs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies indicate that the long and flexible side chain on the central core could hinder the unfavorable dimer formation of electron acceptors and lead to three&#8208;dimensional network packing, which is critical for exciton diffusion and charge transport. Moreover, the in situ optical spectroscopy revealed that the side chain elongation of the electron acceptor could slow the film formation kinetics of the small molecular acceptor while accelerating those of the polymer donor, which is conducive to forming bi&#8208;continuous interpenetrating fibril networks with better intermixing. This work demonstrates that low&#8208;cost, simple&#8208;structured fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors hold a bright future in the OSC commercialization.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH Heterostructure for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH composite has been successfully fabricated by an in situ electrostatic self&#8208;assembly interface engineering strategy, where the in situ anchoring of C4N on MgAl&#8208;LDH can broaden the material's light harvesting range, shorten charge transfer distance, and optimize the adsorption properties of reactants and intermediates, fostering an exceptional solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 performance and stability. 








Abstract
Photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air offers a highly promising and sustainable strategy. However, the slow kinetics of water oxidation severely restricts the oxygen reduction half&#8208;reaction due to insufficient proton supply, leading to low efficiency of many H2O2 photocatalysts. Herein, we constructed an interface&#8208;engineered C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH heterostructure via a straightforward in situ electrostatic self&#8208;assembly method. The resulting hybrid photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable H2O2 yield rate of 2.38&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without cocatalysts and sacrificial agents, along with exceptional stability (&#8805;20 cycles). Its performance significantly surpasses those of bare MgAl&#8208;LDH, C4N, and their physically mixed counterpart. The zeta potential analysis confirms the formation of an intimately contacted interface with strong electronic coupling, enabling rapid charge transfer and prominent photocatalytic performances. Isotope tracing experiments employing H218O and 18O2 provide clear evidence for dual pathways of H2O2 formation involving both water and molecular oxygen. The incorporation of C4N not only extends visible&#8208;light absorption but also promotes the adsorption and activation of key reactants and intermediates. The synthetic approach developed here is simple, cost&#8208;effective, and broadly applicable, offering a feasible route for designing advanced photocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Dual Formate Electrosynthesis via Coupled Formaldehyde Oxidation and CO2 Reduction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study optimized CuxAg10&#8722;x catalysts, exhibiting superior FOR performance. We revealed HCHO concentration&#8208;dependent deactivation caused by HCOO&#8722; accumulation, highlighting the importance of electrolyte optimization. Coupling FOR with CO2RR achieved dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production (0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0.5&#160;V. Furthermore, FOR's versatility was demonstrated by pairing with HER, NO3RR, and ORR to produce electricity and value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
Electrochemical formate (HCOO&#8722;) production via CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds great promise for carbon&#8208;neutral energy systems; however, its practical implementation is significantly hindered by the high energy demand of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing OER with a more energetically and economically favorable alternative anodic reaction is therefore essential. In this study, we developed a highly efficient Cu&#8211;Ag catalyst for anodic formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR). Systematic investigations employing in situ Raman spectroscopy and comprehensive electrochemical analyses revealed that Cu enables&#160;an earlier onset potential for FOR, and Ag enhances formaldehyde adsorption, leading to synergistically improved performance. The optimal Cu3Ag7 catalyst exhibited superior FOR performance, with an onset potential of&#160;&#8722;0.05&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and Faradaic efficiencies for HCOO&#8722; exceeding 90% from 0.1 to 0.5&#160;VRHE. When coupled with CO2RR, the FOR||CO2RR system enabled dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production, achieving a total HCOO&#8722; yield rate of 0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an ultra&#8208;low cell voltage of 0.5&#160;V, surpassing the performance of previously reported electrochemical HCOO&#8722; production systems. Furthermore, this study presents a versatile anodic strategy that integrates FOR with a range of cathodic reactions, offering an energy&#8208;efficient chemical synthesis approach for the advancement of sustainable electrochemical technologies.

Coupling FOR with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR achieved dual-side HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production (0.39&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 0.5&#160;V. Furthermore, FOR's versatility was demonstrated by pairing with HER, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR, and ORR to produce electricity and value-added chemicals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical formate (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) production via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) holds great promise for carbon-neutral energy systems; however, its practical implementation is significantly hindered by the high energy demand of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing OER with a more energetically and economically favorable alternative anodic reaction is therefore essential. In this study, we developed a highly efficient Cu&#8211;Ag catalyst for anodic formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR). Systematic investigations employing in situ Raman spectroscopy and comprehensive electrochemical analyses revealed that Cu enables&#160;an earlier onset potential for FOR, and Ag enhances formaldehyde adsorption, leading to synergistically improved performance. The optimal Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibited superior FOR performance, with an onset potential of&#160;&#8722;0.05&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;) and Faradaic efficiencies for HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; exceeding 90% from 0.1 to 0.5&#160;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;. When coupled with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, the FOR||CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR system enabled dual-side HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production, achieving a total HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; yield rate of 0.39&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an ultra-low cell voltage of 0.5&#160;V, surpassing the performance of previously reported electrochemical HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production systems. Furthermore, this study presents a versatile anodic strategy that integrates FOR with a range of cathodic reactions, offering an energy-efficient chemical synthesis approach for the advancement of sustainable electrochemical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Step Synthesis of 613$6_1^3$ Link Cages by Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed, which allows for precise control over the cavity size of the resulting 613$6_1^3$ link cages by adjusting the dimensions of the building blocks.








Abstract
Among various [3]catenanes, 613$6_1^3$ link cages have yet to be synthesized due to the difficulty of their synthesis. To address this challenge, a synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and the precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed. By relying on the rational design of the dimensions and conformation self&#8208;adaptation of the linkers, four 613$6_1^3$ links and one Solomon link were synthesized by the assembly of curved dipyridyl ligands and half&#8208;sandwich rhodium/iridium(III) dinuclear fragments. Among the various structures mentioned, the metallo&#8208;cages with 613$6_1^3$ topology were synthesized with high selectivity when the length of the long arms featuring a dipyridyl ligand minus the length of the binuclear building block was approximately 7&#160;&#197;. Notably, this synthetic approach employing elongated dinuclear building blocks enabled the preparation of novel closed three&#8208;link chain cages with substantially expanded cavity dimensions compared with those of known analogues. Additionally, this construction strategy allows tuning of the cavity size of the resulting cages by modulating the dimensions of the building blocks.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and CPL Property of Inner&#8208;Wall Modified Pagoda[5]Arenes Driven by Cavity Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of inner&#8208;wall modified pagoda[5]arene (P5) derivatives were obtained in high yields under mild conditions via highly efficient and selective Diels&#8211;Alder (D&#8211;A) cycloadditions between P5 and the guests. These derivatives displayed the fixed conformation and stable chirality. Particularly, the neutral inner&#8208;wall modified P5 was resolved by HPLC and exhibited mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism and strong circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Macrocyclic arenes with large cavities and chirality are attractive in supramolecular chemistry, but fixing their conformation and obtaining stable chirality remain significant challenges. The method of rim functionalization with bulky groups often involves multiple reactive sites, leading to poor selectivity and efficiency. Herein, the inner&#8208;wall modification as a promising yet underexplored strategy for achieving fixed conformation and stable chirality of pagoda[5]arene (P5) was developed. Consequently, a series of inner&#8208;wall modified P5 derivatives were obtained in high yields under mild conditions by the highly efficient and selective Diels&#8211;Alder (D&#8211;A) cycloadditions of P5 with (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium)ethylene guests, enabled by the guest pre&#8208;organization in the cavity microenvironment of P5. In contrast, reactions of 2,6&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene and the guests are not observed even at 170&#160;&#176;C due to the absence of the cavity microenvironment. Moreover, a neutral inner&#8208;wall modified derivative (P5py) was obtained by post&#8208;reaction demethylation. P5py exhibited stable planar chirality, and its enantiomers were efficiently resolved by chiral HPLC. Notably, the enantiomers showed mirror&#8208;imaged CD signals and strong CPL property. This work provides a new facile strategy for fixing the conformation and achieving the stable chirality of macrocyclic arenes with chiral large cavities, and thereby broadens their prospects for applications in supramolecular and materials chemistry.

         <title>Best&#8208;Practice Reporting for Porous Materials Adsorption Data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital reporting of adsorption data critically relies on standardization enabling FAIR data management, AI&#8208;based discovery, and massive data mining for the exploration of advanced porous materials in sustainable processing for future society.








Abstract
Recent decades have seen an enormous evolution of novel porous materials for catalysis, energy efficient processes, and sustainable technologies to improve life quality. Adsorption characterization is essential to provide descriptors of material texture and functionality. Modern science relies on digital data reporting making such data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible (FAIR). This perspective addresses current methodology and the tools for reporting essential adsorption metadata and primary data in a digital format. Guidelines for the publication of experimental and computer simulated data are provided. A number of shortcomings in traditional reporting schemes and ambiguous units is discussed. The importance of quantity definitions is emphasized to avoid misinterpretation and enhance reproducibility. Documenting high&#8208;quality adsorption data based on a self&#8208;defining text archive and retrieval (STAR) file format is illustrated via examples to establish a best&#8208;practice in the field. The adsorption information file (AIF) captures primary data and metadata in a standardized human readable and editable STAR format.

         <title>Adaptive Rhodium Catalysis with a Lewis&#8209;Acidic Secondary Sphere for Divergent Hydrogenation of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptive rhodium catalysis with a Lewis&#8208;acidic secondary sphere enables divergent hydrogenation of propargylic alcohols into alkynes, allylic ethers, or alkenes. Catalyst design and condition&#8208;dependent pathways provide practical guidance for chemoselectivity control.








Abstract
Achieving chemoselective transformations of multifunctional molecules under mild and sustainable conditions remains a central challenge in catalysis. Here, we show that a rhodium complex equipped with a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere can mediate condition&#8208;dependent, divergent hydrogenation of propargylic alcohols. By tuning the reaction medium, the system selectively yields one of three products&#8212;retained alkynes, allylic ethers, or (E)&#8208;alkenes&#8212;from a single substrate&#8211;catalyst pair under hydrogen. Mechanistic studies implicate &#960;&#8208;allyl and rhodium hydride intermediates, with solvent polarity and nucleophilicity steering the reaction pathway. Control experiments confirm the critical roles of both molecular hydrogen and the boron Lewis acid in enabling divergent selectivity. These findings demonstrate how rational secondary&#8208;sphere design can enable adaptive catalysis and provide a platform for programmable bond transformations in multifunctional substrates.

         <title>Targeted Detection of Phospholipid Aldehydes in Living Cells by Oxime Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids) is a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine&#8208;based probes to enable direct tagging of aldehyde&#8208;containing phospholipids within living cells. The reaction between aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids and the aminooxy&#8208;TAMRA probe forms a stable oxime linkage that anchors fluorescence at damaged membranes, yielding a bright, quantitative signal for confocal imaging and identification of adducts by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. 








Abstract
Oxidatively damaged lipids play critical roles in numerous human pathologies, yet methods to directly identify these species within living cells remain limited due to their transient and low&#8208;abundance nature. Among lipid oxidation products, aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids are significant due to their heightened reactivity and strong links to disease pathology. Here, we introduce OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids), a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine&#8208;based probes to enable direct, chemoselective tagging of aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids within living cells via rapid oxime ligation. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the subcellular localization of these oxidized lipids, highlighting prominent accumulation within perinuclear membranes, particularly under oxidative stress conditions induced by the ferroptosis activator RSL3. Coupled with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, our method identifies aldehyde lipid species, notably revealing the abundance of oxidized plasmenyl phosphatidylethanolamines in ferroptotic cells. We demonstrate that cellular labeling by hydroxylamine probes can be modulated by altering the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as aldose reductase (AKR1B1), underscoring the relationship between enzymatic antioxidant defenses and lipid aldehyde metabolism. Our work establishes OxiLox as a robust approach for direct, sensitive, and chemically precise detection of lipid aldehydes in live cells, offering new insights into the role of lipid oxidation in health and disease.

&lt;p&gt;OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids) is a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine-based probes to enable direct tagging of aldehyde-containing phospholipids within living cells. The reaction between aldehyde-containing lipids and the aminooxy-TAMRA probe forms a stable oxime linkage that anchors fluorescence at damaged membranes, yielding a bright, quantitative signal for confocal imaging and identification of adducts by high-resolution mass spectrometry. 

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Acetylene Activation Enables Enhanced Electrochemical Ethylene Formation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borate&#8208;decorated oxide&#8208;derived Cu nanoparticles have been constructed to modulate the interfacial electron distribution to regulate the hydrogenation rate and increase both the C2H4 selectivity and the C2H2 hydrogenation activity to improve the ethylene formation kinetics. In addition, the origin of the enhanced C2H4 formation kinetics is the asymmetric C2H2 adsorption over the OD Cu&#8211;B NPs.








Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts with weak ethylene (C2H4) adsorption exhibit a robust ability to suppress the overhydrogenation of electrocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation (EAH), providing a green alternative for C2H4 production. However, the unsatisfactory C2H4 formation kinetics due to the sluggishness of C2H2 reactants still limit its practical application potential. Herein, borate&#8208;decorated oxide&#8208;derived copper nanoparticles (OD Cu&#8211;B NPs) are designed to promote C2H2 activation and adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts deliver a partial current density of 720 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a turnover frequency of 48.33 s&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the bare OD Cu counterpart. The symmetric electron distribution of C2H2 is revealed to be broken over the Cu&#8211;borate interface, making it easier to activate and adsorb, which accounts for the lowered hydrogenation barrier and enhanced selectivity, consequently promoting C2H4 formation kinetics through the EAH process.

         <title>Bis(azuleno)pentalenes with Six Consecutive Odd&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbons with a unique 7&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;7 odd&#8208;membered ring topology has been synthesized. These compounds possess distinct electronic structures that integrate aromatic azulene and antiaromatic pentalene units, resulting in narrow band gaps, near&#8208;infrared absorption, reversible acid&#8208;base responsiveness, and promising p&#8208;type semiconductor behavior.








Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) exhibit unique optical and electronic properties distinct from their well&#8208;studied benzenoid &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterparts. However, the synthesis of such &#960;&#8208;systems, particularly those composed exclusively of odd&#8208;membered carbocycles, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the first synthesis of three diazuleno[a,e]pentalene derivatives (AP&#8208;1, AP&#8208;2, and AP&#8208;3), featuring fused five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings, via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed homoannulation of o&#8208;alkynylazulenyliodide. These compounds possess a 24 &#960;&#8208;electron system with six consecutively fused odd&#8208;membered rings in a 7&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;7 topology. Comprehensive characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations (ACID, NICS) reveals an electronic structure comprising two aromatic azulene units fused to a central antiaromatic pentalene core. The resulting molecules display a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and amphoteric redox behavior, arising from the interplay between the aromatic and antiaromatic subunits. Notably, AP&#8208;1 and AP&#8208;2 can undergo reversible protonation and deprotonation processes upon exposure to acid and base. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on AP&#8208;2 show p&#8208;type semiconducting behavior with a maximum hole mobility of 0.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, demonstrating the potential of non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid PHs for applications in organic electronics.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Tetraarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of structurally novel axially chiral tetraarylethenes has been synthesized for the first time through an electrophilic aromatic substitution of phenols with 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones, facilitated by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. The resulting highly enantioenriched products enable further stereospecific elaborations to yield chiral materials with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.








Abstract
Chiral TAEs hold great promise for the development of optically active materials. However, current strategies for constructing such structures are largely limited to introduce spatially distal central chirality or intrinsically helical chirality. In this work, we have incorporated axial chirality to create a novel class of skeletally innovative atropisomeric TAEs for the first time. A CPA&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral TAEs has been established, enabled by an enantioselective aromatic substitution of phenols using 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones as electrophiles. This method achieves excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol for all attempted substrates under the optimized conditions. The resulting highly enantioenriched TAEs enable stereospecific modifications to produce a diverse range of axially chiral TAEs. This work not only complements existing achievements but also provides a rapid and efficient route to access TAE&#8208;based chiroptical devices with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.

RETRACTION: E. Santiago&#8208;Rivera and T. Scheibel, &#8220;Spider Eye Development Editing and Silk Fiber Engineering Using CRISPR&#8208;Cas,&#8221; Angewandte Chemie International Edition 64, no. 25 (2025): e202502068, https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202502068.
The above article, published online on 13 April 2025 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the authors; the journal Editor&#8208;in&#8208;Chief, Frank Maass; the German Chemical Society; and Wiley&#8208;VCH GmbH. In ongoing studies using CRISPR&#8208;Cas in spiders, the authors performed additional tests on the knock&#8208;out (KO) as well as knock&#8208;in (KI) mutants in correspondence with geneticists specializing in the use of CRISPR&#8208;Cas. The authors were unable to confirm that the KO as well as the KI occurred at the intended place in the genome. As the results in this study cannot be verified, the article must therefore be retracted.

Photoenzymes enable light&#8208;driven chemistry inside the chiral environment of a protein. In their Communication (e202505431), Cathleen Zeymer et&#160;al. show that natural sugar dehydrogenases utilizing the redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ, in orange) can be repurposed for enantioselective photoredox catalysis. Upon blue&#8208;light irradiation, radical cyclizations are catalyzed. This work adds a new class of enzymes to the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. Cover art designed by Benjamin Large (Sc&#183;EYE&#183;nce).

The image depicts ZNU&#8208;27, a fluorinated anion&#8208;pillared MOF (center) captures C2H2 and CO2 impurities (incoming meteors) in its 8.5&#160;&#197; spherical cages, while pure C2H4 streams out. This visual metaphor highlights ZNU&#8208;27's breakthrough capability in directly yielding polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures in a single step. Details are reported by Yuanbin Zhang et al. in their Research Article (e202514808).

         <dc:description>
Developing single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) with higher ambient ionic conductivity without compromising structural robustness has been challenging. In their Research Article (e202505232), Fang Lian, Zhaoxia Yang and co&#8208;workers report an adaptive 3D coordination electrolyte LiPHB prepared by chemical crosslinking of boron ion&#8208;centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) as units with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene). Due to abundant conformational transitions and electrostatic interactions, SICPEs achieved adaptive deformation and excellent interfacial stability upon solid&#8208;state battery cycling.

This review outlines major advances in the design, execution, analysis, and data management phases of high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). The limitations and potential opportunities of applying modern HTE to organic synthesis are highlighted. 








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE), the miniaturization and parallelization of reactions, is a valuable tool for accelerating diverse compound library generation, optimizing reaction conditions, and enabling data collection for machine learning (ML) applications. When applied to organic synthesis and methodology, HTE still poses various challenges due to the diverse workflows and reagents required, motivating advancements in reaction design, execution, analysis, and data management. To address these limitations, cutting&#8208;edge technologies, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) have been implemented to standardize protocols, enhance reproducibility, and improve efficiency. Additionally, strategies to reduce bias and promote serendipitous discoveries have further strengthened HTE's impact. This review highlights recent advances at every stage of the HTE workflow, including the development of customized workflows, diverse analysis, and improved data management practices for greater accessibility and shareability. Furthermore, we examine the current state of the field, outstanding challenges, and future directions toward transforming HTE into a fully integrated, flexible, and democratized platform that drives innovation in organic synthesis.

         <title>Adaptive 3D Cross&#8208;Linked Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolytes Enable Powerful Interface for Solid State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

An adaptive 3D&#8208;architechtured single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte LiPHB is designed with dynamic conformational changes under impact, integrating the advantages of natural rigidity and deformability in structural design, facilitating interface compatibility and lithium plating/stripping reversibility.








Abstract
Single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) are designed by covalently bonding anions to the polymers, which is attractive for mitigating anion aggregation&#8208;derived polarization. However, one major challenge for developing SICPEs with higher ambient ionic conductivity comes at the expense of structural robustness. Here, boron ion&#8208;centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) with symmetric cross structure and terminal functional C&#9552;C was proposed as a units, and then 3D coordination electrolyte (LiPHB) was constructed via chemical cross&#8208;linking of LiT4PAB with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP). The boron ion&#8208;centered units catenated by single bonds show the abundant conformation transitions, enabling the deformable architecture of LiPHB with the aid of electrostatic interactions of diphenylsulfonimide. Therefore, LiPHB undergoes adaptive deformation when subjected to impact, achieving good ductility with elastic moduli of 1.4&#160;GPa and a maximum elongation of 447.4%. Moreover, LiPHB demonstrates 3D single lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to guide the homogeneous lithium deposition. As a results, lithium symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping cycle for over 1500&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;&#176;C. Li/LiPHB SICPEs/NCM811 solid&#8208;state batteries deliver a capacity retention of 90.3% in 150 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C and 0.2 C. Our study shed light on the design strategies of the dynamic single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes for solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>A Highly Transparent Thermoplastic Synthesized from Ethylene that Melts Above 200&#160;&#176;C</title>

We introduce a highly transparent ethylene&#8208;based thermoplastic (transmittance of 92%, haze of 8% and clarity of 92%) with a very low density (0.86g cm&#8722;3) and an high melting point (up to 228&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Polyolefin&#8208;based thermoplastics are the most widely used polymers and produced in megaton scale. Their applicability depends strongly on the melting point, and a high&#8208;melting ethylene&#8208;based plastic would be highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of isotactic poly(4&#8208;ethylhex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) (P4EH), a highly transparent and ethylene&#8208;based thermoplastic that melts above 220&#160;&#176;C and has an extremely low density. Molecular catalysts were used to synthesize atactic, syndiotactic, and isotactic P4EH with narrow molecular weight distributions. Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts were used to synthesize isotactic and processable P4EH. Processable i&#8208;P4EH was used to produce discs, and a transmittance of 92%, a haze of 8% and a clarity of 92% were measured. In addition, a density of 0.86&#160;g cm&#8722;3 was observed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyolefin-based thermoplastics are the most widely used polymers and produced in megaton scale. Their applicability depends strongly on the melting point, and a high-melting ethylene-based plastic would be highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;isotactic&lt;/i&gt; poly(4-ethylhex-1-ene) (P4EH), a highly transparent and ethylene-based thermoplastic that melts above 220&#160;&#176;C and has an extremely low density. Molecular catalysts were used to synthesize &lt;i&gt;atactic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;syndiotactic&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;isotactic&lt;/i&gt; P4EH with narrow molecular weight distributions. Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts were used to synthesize &lt;i&gt;isotactic&lt;/i&gt; and processable P4EH. Processable &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-P4EH was used to produce discs, and a transmittance of 92%, a haze of 8% and a clarity of 92% were measured. In addition, a density of 0.86&#160;g cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; was observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Reduction of Non&#8208;Neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet constructed from an asymmetric tridentate ligand structure was designed for the photoreduction of CO2 to syngas under different contents of CO2 and natural sunlight. The carboxyl group in the asymmetric tridentate ligand structure facilitated dissociation of water to generate *H by hydrogen bond. Moreover, *H assists CO2 (g) adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2 where CO2 enrichment and purification is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst, Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits a widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the covalent organic frame (COF) by the formation of atomically dispersed N&#8211;Co&#8211;O4 sites and enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2 to syngas.

         <title>Tailored Selectivity for CO and C2+ in CO2 Reduction: Insights into the Dynamic Evolution of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Fluorine is introduced as a heteroatom to modulate the structure of copper&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts during electrochemical CO2 reduction. The dynamic surface reconstruction and formation of undercoordinated grain boundaries define the real catalytic sites and affect CO and C2+ product selectivity. This offers a strategy for catalyst design and informs principles for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.








Abstract
Controlling product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) is critical for efficient CO2 conversion. However, the dynamic structural changes of Cu&#8208;based catalysts during operation complicate mechanistic understanding. Here, we investigate fluorine&#8208;modified copper pre&#8208;catalysts with varying doping levels and reveal how their structural evolution governs eCO2R activity and selectivity. Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu2&#8314; precursors into metallic Cu&#8304; with distinct local structures. Cu&#8208;F&#8208;4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO2R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 81% at &#8722;0.45&#160;V. In contrast, Cu&#8208;F&#8208;1, enriched in grain boundaries and Cu(100) facets, achieves a high FEC2+ of 80% at &#8722;0.65&#160;V. Differences in local pH, *OH coverage, and *CO binding energies further modulate catalytic pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic catalyst reconstruction in steering product selectivity and offer design principles for advancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.

Butterfly&#8208;shaped nanotubes of 3.7&#160;nm in average length and 6.7&#160;&#197; in pore diameter demonstrate an ultrafast water conduction rate of 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;H2O s&#8722;1 per channel, outperforming the naturally occurred aquaporin 1 by 140% respectively while concurrently achieving high rejections of both salts (i.e., NaCl and KCl) and protons.








Abstract
Water transport across biological membranes is essential for life, facilitated by water channel proteins like aquaporins (AQPs). Drawing inspiration from these natural systems, artificial water channels (AWCs) have emerged as transformative tools for advancing industrial and environmental applications. Herein, we report the design and comprehensive characterization of a groundbreaking class of AWCs, derived from unprecedented butterfly&#8208;shaped aromatic folding synthons, carefully engineered to emulate the functional attributes of natural AQPs. These foldamers, with their intricate helical architectures, exhibit exceptional water transport performance. Remarkably, the highest&#8208;performing AWC achieves an ultrafast water transport rate of 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;H2O s&#8722;1 per channel&#8212;2.4 times the efficiency of AQP1&#8212;without the need for lipid anchors to preserve its functional orientation within phospholipid bilayers, while effectively excluding salts such as NaCl and KCl, along with protons. This work presents an ideal bio&#8208;inspired, high&#8208;performance artificial alternative to natural systems, demonstrating the remarkable potential of foldamer&#8208;based AWCs as next&#8208;generation solutions for tackling critical challenges in water purification and desalination.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Platform for Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Customization of Multivalent Artificial Antibodies and Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular self&#8208;assembling platform ATPlug has been developed that integrates three critical domains: a self&#8208;trimerizing Tri module for enhanced binding avidity, a SpyCatcher domain that enables rapid conjugation, and an albumin&#8208;binding domain that improves circulation half&#8208;life and tissue selectivity. This platform allows rapid customization of multivalent artificial antibodies and modular ADCs with enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, offering a versatile toolkit for drug development.








Abstract
Modular assembly of multivalent therapeutics with precise modulation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties remains a critical challenge in drug development. Here, we present ATPlug, a self&#8208;assembling protein platform that integrates three crucial functional modules: a trimerization domain to enhance avidity, a SpyCatcher module for efficient conjugation, and an albumin&#8208;binding domain to optimize pharmacokinetics and tissue selectivity. This rational design facilitates the modular assembly of multivalent artificial antibodies and antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs), demonstrating remarkable versatility through the successful incorporation of diverse therapeutic modules targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The trivalent constructs exhibited up to 30&#8208;fold enhancement in target binding avidity and extended plasma half&#8208;life via endogenous albumin hitchhiking. Notably, the ATPlug&#8208;customized modular ADCs achieved binding affinities of 1.8&#160;nM for EGFR and exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward EGFR&#8208;overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in potent tumor suppression efficacy. This plug&#8208;and&#8208;play strategy provides a framework for next&#8208;generation therapeutics combining customized multivalency with multidrug synergies.

&lt;p&gt;A modular self-assembling platform ATPlug has been developed that integrates three critical domains: a self-trimerizing Tri module for enhanced binding avidity, a SpyCatcher domain that enables rapid conjugation, and an albumin-binding domain that improves circulation half-life and tissue selectivity. This platform allows rapid customization of multivalent artificial antibodies and modular ADCs with enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, offering a versatile toolkit for drug development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular assembly of multivalent therapeutics with precise modulation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties remains a critical challenge in drug development. Here, we present ATPlug, a self-assembling protein platform that integrates three crucial functional modules: a trimerization domain to enhance avidity, a SpyCatcher module for efficient conjugation, and an albumin-binding domain to optimize pharmacokinetics and tissue selectivity. This rational design facilitates the modular assembly of multivalent artificial antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), demonstrating remarkable versatility through the successful incorporation of diverse therapeutic modules targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The trivalent constructs exhibited up to 30-fold enhancement in target binding avidity and extended plasma half-life via endogenous albumin hitchhiking. Notably, the ATPlug-customized modular ADCs achieved binding affinities of 1.8&#160;nM for EGFR and exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in potent tumor suppression efficacy. This plug-and-play strategy provides a framework for next-generation therapeutics combining customized multivalency with multidrug synergies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Spin State of Atomic Iron Centers for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that spin state modulation of single Fe sites on TiO2, achieved through crystal phase engineering and F&#8208;doping, boosts photocatalytic nitrogen reduction efficiency by optimizing N2 adsorption/desorption equilibrium, suppressing Fe's magnetic moment, reducing activation energy barriers, and enhancing binding to reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Electronic structures fundamentally influence material properties, with electron spin playing a pivotal role in defining catalytic activity and reaction pathways. However, the precise spin&#8208;mediated mechanisms of adsorption energies and nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen transition states on the catalyst surface, remain unclear due to the complexity of spin&#8208;mediated promotion factors. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning the spin state of single iron (Fe) sites on TiO2 can significantly enhance photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Our theoretical predictions reveal that low spin states of single Fe sites facilitate N2 adsorption and intermediate formation, thereby activating more catalytic sites on TiO2 for efficient nitrogen fixation. By manipulating the crystal phase and incorporating fluorine dopants, we systematically modulate the spin states of Fe sites, achieving optimized N2 adsorption and desorption kinetics and suppressing charge recombination. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that these modifications reduce the magnetic moment of Fe sites, lower free energy barriers, and strengthen electronic interactions with key intermediates, particularly during N&#9472;NH formation. Intriguingly, we find that weakening N2 adsorption via reduced Fe magnetization enhances catalytic performance, challenging conventional assumptions that stronger N&#9472;N bond activation necessarily improves NRR efficiency. Our experimental results corroborate these findings, showing a remarkable 72&#8208;fold increase in ammonia production rate compared to pristine TiO2. This work highlights the crucial role of electron spin engineering in designing highly efficient NRR catalysts and provides a new paradigm for rational catalyst design.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Emission of Congruently Melting Iodocuprate Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids based on a 2D or 1D CuI2&#8722; iodocuprate network, which have low congruent melting temperatures allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films, exhibit excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission: upon excitation at high energy (inorganic network) a strong yellow emission of STE type occurs, whereas upon excitation at low energy (organic component), a red emission originating from iodide vacancies (&#9633;(I&#8722;)) is observed.








Abstract
In the context of the emergence of metal halide perovskites for optoelectronic materials, the lead&#8208;free and earth&#8208;abundant copper(I)&#8208;based halide hybrids are of high interest. Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO2C(CH2)n&#8208;1NH3)CuI2 (n&#160;=&#160;3, 4) exhibiting excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n&#160;=&#160;4 compound (2D&#8208;C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge&#8208;sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n&#160;=&#160;3 compound (1D&#8208;C3) and in the metastable n&#160;=&#160;4 (1D&#8208;C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission&#8212;resulting from the emission of both components,&#8212;while 1D&#8208;C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid&#8208;gap states. The emission of 2D&#8208;C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D&#8208;C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 &#176;C, allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor&#8208;converted&#8208;LED based on 2D&#8208;C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of SERS: Merging Direct and Indirect Approaches for Enhanced Analysis of Multiplex Plasticizer Analogs in Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive structural profiling of plasticizer analogs is achieved by merging both direct and indirect surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS). By accumulating the intrinsic signals and functional group&#8208;specific information of the three main functional groups, our platform enables accurate multiplexing of plasticizer analogs in complex oil matrices.








Abstract
Rapid and accurate identification of harmful plasticizer analogs in their native matrix is crucial for contaminant monitoring across industries. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) shows promise for detecting structurally similar analogs but faces challenges like subtle receptor signal changes and distortion with weakly adsorbing plasticizer analytes. We address these limitations by integrating direct and indirect SERS to capture intrinsic Raman signals and receptor&#8208;analyte interactions, achieving 100% classification accuracy eight plasticizer analogs and multiplex quantification of three major plasticizers extracted from canola oil with&#160;&lt;&#160;5% predictive errors at a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01&#160;mg L&#8722;1, despite interference from other lipophilic contaminants such as adipates. Experimental SERS data and interaction energy calculations affirm that direct SERS detects alkyl chains, while indirect SERS identifies aromatic rings and carboxyl groups in eight plasticizer analogs with varying alkyl structures. A hybrid direct&#8208;indirect superspectrum was constructed, enabling the differentiation of eight analogs via Partial&#8208;Least&#8208;Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS&#8208;DA) and further analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals equal contribution from all platforms, which highlights their complementary roles. These findings pave the way for broader applications in rapid, on&#8208;site detection of complex contaminants across industries.

         <title>A Versatile DNAzyme&#8208;Amplified Protease&#8208;Sensing Platform for Accurate Diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Reliable Classification of Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile DNAzyme&#8208;amplified protease&#8208;sensing (DP) platform was developed through the ingenious integration of positively charged peptides and DNAzyme (Dz) for the rapid detection of various target proteases. This platform exhibits superior sensitivity compared to traditional nonamplified protease&#8208;sensing (PP) platforms, thereby enabling the accurate diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and reliable classification of colorectal cancer (CRC).








Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based biosensors are widely used for in vitro detection of protease activity but often suffer from the limited sensitivity, poor accuracy, and incompatibility with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) devices. Herein, we developed a versatile deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme)&#8208;amplified protease&#8208;sensing (DP) platform that integrates the positively charged oligopeptides with a negatively charged DNAzyme biocatalyst for highly&#8208;sensitive protease detection. The system leverages the electrostatic peptide&#8211;DNAzyme interactions to inhibit DNAzyme catalytic activity, which is reactivated upon the protease&#8208;triggered peptide hydrolysis, thus enabling an efficient signal amplification via the successive cleavage of DNAzyme substrate. Compared to conventional peptide&#8208;based sensing platform, our DP system offers an enhanced sensitivity and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and is highly modular for detecting various clinically relevant proteases through a simple replacement of the peptide blocker. By introducing a dual&#8208;enzyme recognition mechanism, we developed a dual&#8208;protease&#8208;triggered DP platform for enabling the accurate detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 proteases in saliva. We also applied the DP platform to differentiate between normal and cancerous colon cells and tissues by detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)&#8208;associated proteases. Overall, this work introduces a universal and scalable biosensing strategy for activity&#8208;based protease detection with potential applications in both infectious disease diagnostics and cancer classification, advancing the field of DNAzyme&#8208;based POCT technologies.

&lt;p&gt;A versatile DNAzyme-amplified protease-sensing (DP) platform was developed through the ingenious integration of positively charged peptides and DNAzyme (Dz) for the rapid detection of various target proteases. This platform exhibits superior sensitivity compared to traditional nonamplified protease-sensing (PP) platforms, thereby enabling the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and reliable classification of colorectal cancer (CRC).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide-based biosensors are widely used for in vitro detection of protease activity but often suffer from the limited sensitivity, poor accuracy, and incompatibility with point-of-care testing (POCT) devices. Herein, we developed a versatile deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme)-amplified protease-sensing (DP) platform that integrates the positively charged oligopeptides with a negatively charged DNAzyme biocatalyst for highly-sensitive protease detection. The system leverages the electrostatic peptide&#8211;DNAzyme interactions to inhibit DNAzyme catalytic activity, which is reactivated upon the protease-triggered peptide hydrolysis, thus enabling an efficient signal amplification via the successive cleavage of DNAzyme substrate. Compared to conventional peptide-based sensing platform, our DP system offers an enhanced sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio and is highly modular for detecting various clinically relevant proteases through a simple replacement of the peptide blocker. By introducing a dual-enzyme recognition mechanism, we developed a dual-protease-triggered DP platform for enabling the accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteases in saliva. We also applied the DP platform to differentiate between normal and cancerous colon cells and tissues by detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated proteases. Overall, this work introduces a universal and scalable biosensing strategy for activity-based protease detection with potential applications in both infectious disease diagnostics and cancer classification, advancing the field of DNAzyme-based POCT technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Polymerization of Tetrabenzoporphyrin into Pyramidal Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin derivative with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties has been accomplished by applying the thermal precursor approach with the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in the system. Furthermore, the polymerization leads to the formation of unique pyramid&#8208;like multilayer structures with a spiral nature.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;extended compounds with hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites remains challenging, especially at high concentrations, due to their limited solubility in nonpolar solvents. Herein, we report a novel method incorporating a thermal precursor approach for the supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) derivative with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites and chiral cholesterol groups (BPChol). Polymerization in the nonpolar solvent tetralin is induced by the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the highly soluble precursor (CPChol) to BPChol in the hot solution and subsequent natural cooling, as confirmed by monitoring absorption spectra. The emergence of circular dichroism signals corroborates the formation of aggregates with supramolecular chirality, as the first chiroptical characterization of BP aggregates. Detailed structural analysis using high&#8208;resolution microscopies reveals a unique pyramidal multilayer structure with a spiral nature. Additionally, faster cooling produces monolayer nanosheets, which differ from the multilayer structures formed upon natural cooling. This is due to a different nucleation process in the cooperative polymerization. By using the nanosheets as seeds, seed&#8208;induced polymerization is achieved, resulting in extended sheets. Notably, the indirect precursor method using CPChol enables outstanding polymerization at high concentrations (mM level) to afford micro&#8208;sized pyramids, which cannot be realized by a direct method using BPChol.

         <title>Promiscuity in Molecular Mimics of the Cysteine Dioxygenase: Effects of Selenium in the Substrate and Cobalt as the Central Metal Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic model for the cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) was found to be also capable of selectively dioxygenating selenocysteamine, suggesting that the lack of reactivity found for the CDO in combination with selenocysteine originates in the protein matrix. The corresponding cobalt complex mediates the dioxygenation of selenocysteamine, too, and thus represents the first example of a molecular cobalt complex that is potent to activate O2 for the dioxygenation of a substrate.








Abstract
Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [TpMesFe(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)] and [TpMes*Fe(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)] (with TpMes&#160;=&#160;hydrotris(3&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate, TpMes* = hydrobis((3&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)(5&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt&#8208;analogue [TpMesCo(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O2 &#8211; as in case of the parent cysteamine&#8208;bound complexes &#8211; the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO&#8208;Sec toward O2 does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [TpMesCo(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen &#8211; more slowly but selectively &#8211; to give [TpMesCo(O2Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O2 mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.

         <title>Single Ag Atoms Induce Ag&#8208;N/O Bonds on WO3 for Ultrastable Acid Ammonia Synthesis</title>

Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonding on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis. The catalyst maintains a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &#8764;94%.








Abstract
Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The resultant catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeding &#8764;90% over a potential range of &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. Importantly, the catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of &#8764;94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), we succeeded in obtaining an NH3 production rate of 12.75 mmol h&#8722;1 at &#8722;4&#160;V and maintained the stability for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, thereby considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities. This work provides insights into acidic nitrate reduction for ammonia electrosynthesis, which develops corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

Light&#8208;induced radical C(sp2)&#8211;H trifluorovinylation of (hetero)arenes with TrFVI reagent is achieved and exhibits good functional group compatibility. Detailed mechanism studies show a plausible radical chain pathway.








Abstract
Trifluorovinyl group is an emerging and valuable motif in drug discovery and material science, especially in polymer&#8208;related researches. However, the practical and efficient synthesis of trifluorovinylated compounds with broad structural diversity still remains a challenging task. Herein, we report the scalable synthesis of a trifluorovinyl hypervalent iodine(III) reagent, ArI(CF &#9552; CF2)OTf (TrFVI), from a bulk chemical, HFC&#8208;134a. The first C(sp2)&#9472;H trifluorovinylation of (hetero)arenes is achieved using TrFVI reagent via photoredox catalysis, which shows good functional group compatibility. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage trifluorovinylation of highly modified substrates, including drug candidates, is achieved to illustrate the powerfulness of our method. A possible radical pathway is proposed according to the mechanism study.

The enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;bis(allenes) is reported for the preparation of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208; and vinyl&#8208;substituted (hetero)cyclic products in high yields and with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
In this study, an enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;bis(allenes) to furnish 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208; and vinyl&#8208;substituted five&#8208;membered (hetero)cycles in high yields and with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity is presented. The possibility of further functionalization to access different chiral cyclic and bicyclic skeletons is provided by the two orthogonal functional groups (alkyne and alkene). We also demonstrate the scalability of the reaction through a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and illustrate the synthetic utility of the resulting 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208; and vinyl&#8208;substituted cyclic product via several transformations. The proposed reaction mechanism is supported by both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments.

         <title>NitrOFF: An Engineered Fluorescent Biosensor to Illuminate Nitrate Transport in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a first&#8208;generation, two&#8208;domain biosensor for nitrate named NitrOFF is reported. The power of directed evolution over seven rounds has unlocked this sensing potential. The integration of in vitro spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography provides insights into the allostery driving the turn&#8208;off fluorescence response. Finally, fluorescence imaging with NitrOFF reveals its potential to illuminate nitrate uptake and modulation in mammalian cells.








Abstract
The duality of nitrate is nowhere better exemplified than in human physiology&#8212;a detrimental pollutant but also a protective nutrient&#8212;particularly as connected to nitric oxide. Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real&#8208;time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus. Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn&#8208;off intensiometric response (Kd &#8776; 9&#160;&#181;M). This was further reinforced by X&#8208;ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate&#8208;bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large&#8208;scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4&#176;. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the &#946;7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, we highlighted the utility of NitrOFF to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Deoxygenation of Esters for the Synthesis of Sterically Hindered Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for accessing sterically hindered ethers via reductive deoxygenation of readily prepared ester starting materials is reported. Employing commercially available and bench&#8208;stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2 (1&#8211;2 mol%) and tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as reductant, this single&#8208;vessel approach operates under mild conditions and provides a range of alkyl, aryl, and benzyl ethers&#8212;both acyclic and cyclic&#8212;in good to excellent yields.








Abstract
The synthesis of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;tertiary and &#946;&#8208;quaternary (neopentylic) ethers has long been constrained by the limitations of traditional SN2 and related SN1 approaches, namely low or inexistent reactivity arising from severe steric hindrance or competitive elimination/rearrangement pathways diverting the reaction outcome. Herein, we describe a general solution to the synthesis of sterically hindered ethers via an iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive deoxygenation reaction of readily available ester and lactone starting materials. Employing commercially available, bench&#8208;stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2 as a precatalyst at 1 mol% loading with 4 equivalents of tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as the terminal reductant at room temperature, this practical synthetic approach to hindered ethers features a simple, mix&#8208;and&#8208;stir, single&#8208;vessel protocol under ambient conditions and produces a diverse range of both acyclic and cyclic ether products in good to excellent yields. Control experiments demonstrated that the IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2/TMDS catalytic system could not only rapidly hydrosilylate esters to mixed silyl/alkyl hemiacetal intermediates but also catalyze the reduction of acetals directly to ethers, revealing the Lewis acidic and hydridic properties required for this deoxygenative transformation.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Protein Complex Stability Controls Substrate Scope in a &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Reductase Specific for Medium Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;ACP complex stability can control substrate preference. Molecular simulations of (top) EcFabG bound to &#946;&#8208;ketobutyryl&#8208;ACP show salt bridges that are not present when (bottom) PpFabG4 binds to the same substrate. EcFabG is active on all chain lengths, but PpFabG4 prefers long chains, which stabilize the enzyme&#8211;ACP complex. By adding stabilizing mutations (red to blue), we can increase its activity on short&#8208;chain substrates by over 100&#8208;fold.








Abstract
Assembly&#8208;line enzymes carry out multistep synthesis of important metabolites by using acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) to shuttle intermediates along defined sequences of active sites. Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase from Pseudomonas putida (PpFabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short&#8208;chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme&#8211;ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for PpFabG4 or weaken it for EcFabG, an Escherichia coli &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short&#8208;chain substrates by over 100&#8208;fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme&#8208;ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly&#8208;line systems.

Molecular simulations of (top) EcFabG bound to &#946;-ketobutyryl-ACP show salt bridges that are not present when (bottom) &lt;i&gt;Pp&lt;/i&gt;FabG4 binds to the same substrate. EcFabG is active on all chain lengths, but &lt;i&gt;Pp&lt;/i&gt;FabG4 prefers long chains, which stabilize the enzyme&#8211;ACP complex. By adding stabilizing mutations (red to blue), we can increase its activity on short-chain substrates by over 100-fold.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembly-line enzymes carry out multistep synthesis of important metabolites by using acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) to shuttle intermediates along defined sequences of active sites. Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a &#946;-ketoacyl-ACP reductase from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pp&lt;/i&gt;FabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X-ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short-chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme&#8211;ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for &lt;i&gt;Pp&lt;/i&gt;FabG4 or weaken it for &lt;i&gt;Ec&lt;/i&gt;FabG, an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; &#946;-ketoacyl-ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short-chain substrates by over 100-fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme-ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly-line systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Pd and In were chosen to jointly regulate the degree of water involvement during eCO2RR. With aco&#8208;doping ratio of 50:2 (Cu:Pd/In&#160;=&#160;50:2), we achieved a variation from 95% C1 to 70% C2 by changing the ratio of Pd:In. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement reveal the positive correlation between the C2 product selectivity and water involvement. Modulating CO2RR via isolated water induction offers a novel catalyst design strategy to boost C2 products.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8211;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.

         <title>Alkaline Earth Metal&#8208;Based Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite&#8208;Like Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics has been successfully synthesized for the first time, with (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3 serving as a typical representative. Combined with excellent comprehensive ferroelectric properties, ease of preparation and good plasticity, this discovery provides a brand&#8208;new structural paradigm for hybrid perovskite and highlights promise in emerging flexible applications.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) with the ABX3 formula have garnered significant scientific interest owing to their substantial technological promise in photovoltaics, optoelectronics and ferroelectrics. Their structural diversity and molecular&#8208;scale chemical programmability provide an exceptional platform for engineering diverse functional HOIP architectures through targeted compositional design. However, the strategic potential of alkaline earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba) in HOIP assembly remains largely unexplored, with ferroelectric implementations yet to be realized, despite their historical roots in perovskite evolution dating back to the eponymous CaTiO3 mineral discovered in 1839. Here, for the first time, we report a new family of alkaline earth metal&#8208;based HOIP&#8208;like ferroelectrics. Benefiting from three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like structure and multiaxial characteristics, (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3 as a representative shows pronounced ferroelectricity with robust polarization switching in both bulk single crystals and compressed polycrystalline powder pellets. Molecular fluorination strategy on pyrrolidinium cation further optimizes the comprehensive ferroelectric properties (R&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3, enhancing Curie temperature, increasing polar axes and doubling polarization values. Combined with their easy preparation and good plasticity, this discovery provides a brand&#8208;new structural paradigm for HOIP ferroelectrics and highlights exceptional promise in emerging flexible ferroelectric applications.

         <title>Improving Charge Extraction and Operational Stability in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Conjugated Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated block copolymers, featuring a polyfluorene block for rapid electron transport and a quaternized conjugated block that effectively passivates both cation and anion defects, serve as interfacial modulators in inverted perovskite solar cells, achieving an efficiency of 26.11% with exceptional long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
A defect&#8208;passivated, electronically benign interface is essential for high&#8208;performance, stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Most conventional surface passivation strategies frequently introduce electrically resistive interlayers that compromise charge transport/extraction between the perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers. We resolve this challenge through the rational implementation of all&#8208;conjugated block copolymers (CBCPs). The CBCPs demonstrate dual&#8208;functional capabilities of offering charge transport channels while facile integrating multiple defect&#8208;passivating moieties, thereby enabling efficient charge carrier transport and defect passivation. This dual&#8208;functional synergy yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.11% in our best device. The target PSCs maintained &gt;90% of their initial PCEs after maximum power point tracking for &gt;1400&#160;hours at 65&#160;&#176;C. This approach offers a promising strategy for interface engineering that improves both charge extraction and defect reduction using conjugated block copolymers.

Related processes allow the &lt;i&gt;intermolecular&lt;/i&gt; transfer of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-2&#176;-alkyl substituents, providing a convenient means of introducing difficult-to-install &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Electrochemistry for Direct Deoxygenative Silylation of Alcohols and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven deoxygenative C&#9472;Si bond formation strategy was developed for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. The reactions operate under mild conditions without transition metal catalysts and sacrificial electrodes, providing an efficient avenue for the direct conversion of feedstock alcohols (1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176;) and ketones directly to valuable organosilanes.








Abstract
Alcohols and ketones are abundant and structurally diverse feedstocks, yet their direct transformation into organosilicon compounds remains challenging due to the difficulty in selective cleaving C&#9472;OH and C&#9552;O bonds. Here, we report an electrochemically driven deoxygenative C&#9472;Si bond formation strategy that converts alcohols and ketones directly to organosilicon compounds. The reactions operate under mild conditions without external redox reagents and sacrificial electrodes. A wide range of alcohols, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, as well as ketones, are efficiently converted to the corresponding organosilane products. Overall, this study provides a step&#8208;economical, highly efficient, and synthetically versatile platform for the direct conversion of feedstock chemicals into valuable organosilicon compounds.

         <title>Localized Hydrolysis&#8208;Based Proximity Reporting Platform for Protein Hierarchical Structure Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a localized hydrolysis&#8208;based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for protein hierarchical structure profiling across diverse biological specimens. LHPR enables quantitative mapping of protein&#8208;specific glycoforms and glycosylation stoichiometry dynamics during physiological transitions. This capability provides a powerful tool for the development of new glyco&#8208;markers and glyco&#8208;intervention&#8208;based personalized treatments.








Abstract
The substrate&#8208;specific bond cleavage capability of hydrolases provides a unique strategy for engineering off&#8208;on switches. This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase 1 (NDM&#8208;1), we developed a localized hydrolysis&#8208;based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target&#8208;recognizing molecules with NDM&#8208;1, and designed click chemistry&#8208;reactive, substrate&#8208;caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes. Programmed NDM&#8208;1 activity enabled in situ protein&#8208;specific imaging of glycans via proximity&#8208;dependent activation within various biological specimens. Within a unified enzymatic framework, we successfully quantified distinct glycans of individual proteins and established the principle of protein&#8208;specific glycosylation stoichiometry analysis. Our work provides a powerful tool for developing glycoprotein&#8208;based disease biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and diagnostic approaches, offering new possibilities for precision medicine research.

         <title>Architecture Engineering and Phase Engineering of Rhodium Metallene Co&#8208;Boost Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium metallene nanoarchitectonics (Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR) integrating architecture engineering and phase engineering are well&#8208;designed to boost nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroconversion. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique structure of Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR, which exposes more active sites due to its ultrathin nature and abundant pores. Meanwhile, amorphous regions enhance nitrite adsorption and lower the reaction energy barrier, guiding catalyst design.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) offers an effective strategy for sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis and N&#8208;pollutants wastewater degradation. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;engineering strategy by combining architecture engineering and phase engineering on nanosheet&#8208;like rhodium metallene (Rh&#8208;NS) coupled with twisted nanoribbon&#8208;like rhodium metallene (Rh&#8208;NR) nanoarchitectonics (Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR) to boost NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electroconversion. Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO2&#8722; and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NOH formation from *NO. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR exhibits satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.7% and a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 44.3&#160;mg mgcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for NO2RR at high reduction potential (0.00&#160;V). Using Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR as cathode, the assembled zinc&#8211;nitrite battery delivers excellent discharge performance (24.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and promising NH3 synthesis capacity (5.96&#160;mg mgcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). This work not only guides the architecture&#8208;engineering design of metallene but also demonstrates the practical potential of zinc&#8211;nitrite batteries in integrated energy&#8208;environmental applications.

         <title>Toward Narrow&#8208;Band, Stable Blue MR&#8208;TADF Emission via Combined Heterocyclic Analogues Marching B.T.2020</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust molecular design strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters via heterocyclic carbazole integration to strengthen weak C&#9472;N bonds was proposed. Blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA have achieved ultra&#8208;narrow FWHMs (24/21&#160;nm), high PLQYs (88%/95%), and record&#8208;high EQEs (23%/26%). The tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA OLED achieved LT90 of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 for being among the longest for CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10 blue OLEDs, approaching BT.2020 coordinates.








Abstract
The development of efficient and stable ultra&#8208;narrowband pure&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is critical for next&#8208;generation wide&#8208;gamut OLED displays. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy that enhances emitter stability and efficiency by reinforcing the weak C&#9472;N bonds through selective incorporation of heterocyclic carbazole (Cz) units into the MR framework. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA, were synthesized via high&#8208;yield, lithium&#8208;free borylation. These emitters exhibit pure&#8208;blue emissions at 453 and 463&#160;nm with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 24 and 21&#160;nm in solution and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 88% and 95%, respectively. OLED devices based on m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA show emissions at 456&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQEmax 23%, CIEy 0.06) and 467&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQEmax 26%, CIEy 0.10), respectively, holding among the highest efficiencies for blue OLEDs without sensitizers. Notably, the tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based device shows an LT90 of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 (EQE 8.95%), representing one of the longest operational lifetimes for blue fluorescent OLEDs with CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10. These results demonstrate a versatile and scalable molecular design strategy for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency, long&#8208;lifetime blue OLEDs approaching the BT.2020 color standard.

These emitters exhibit pure-blue emissions at 453 and 463&#160;nm with narrow full-width at half-maximums (FWHMs) of 24 and 21&#160;nm in solution and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 88% and 95%, respectively. OLED devices based on &lt;b&gt;m-Cz-DABNA&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;tBu-Cz-DABNA&lt;/b&gt; show emissions at 456&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; 23%, CIEy 0.06) and 467&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; 26%, CIEy 0.10), respectively, holding among the highest efficiencies for blue OLEDs without sensitizers. Notably, the &lt;b&gt;tBu-Cz-DABNA&lt;/b&gt;-based device shows an LT&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (EQE 8.95%), representing one of the longest operational lifetimes for blue fluorescent OLEDs with CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10. These results demonstrate a versatile and scalable molecular design strategy for the realization of high-efficiency, long-lifetime blue OLEDs approaching the BT.2020 color standard.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sustainable Nickelaelectro&#8208;catalysis provided access &#946;&#8208;arylated pyrroles via an efficient anodic dehydrogenative C&#9472;H activation.








Abstract
Nickel electrocatalysis has emerged as a powerful strategy for sustainable C&#9472;H activation, offering an environmentally benign alternative to traditional methods based on stoichiometric oxidants. We, herein, report a nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed approach for the expedient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylated pyrroles via a unique multiple dehydrogenative C&#9472;H activation approach. Hence, direct C&#9472;C bond formation between pyrroles and arenes was enabled, obviating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. The reaction proceeded under electrochemical conditions in a user&#8208;friendly undivided cell, utilizing electricity as a traceless oxidant. Mechanistic studies, including cyclic voltammetry, provided support for a nickel(II/III/IV) regime, wherein anodic oxidation facilitates the dehydrogenation and C&#9472;H activation paired with the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our findings highlight the potential of electrocatalysis to unlock distinct reaction manifolds and provides a sustainable platform for accessing complex heteroaryl frameworks.

         <title>Hooked for Decay with Hydrophobic&#8208;Coated Magnetic Beads to Grapple and Disintegrate Nanoplastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid catalysts based on the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which is conjugated with a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda cofactor, were immobilized on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The immobilized biohybrid catalysts catalyzed a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to form a hydrophobic polynorbornene film. These film&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited bifunctional activity toward both capturing of nanoplastics and degrading of styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber nanoparticles.








Abstract
Degradation of synthetic polymers inevitably leads to the formation of nanoplastics (NPs), and recent studies associate health risks with NPs. Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH&#8208;cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS&#8208;COOH500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 &#177; 0.29&#160;g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH&#8208;cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C&#9552;C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.

         <title>Accelerated Porosity Screening Using a Multichannel Colorimetric Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput porosity screening method was developed for rapid porosity evaluation, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach to identifying candidate porous materials that is 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption methods with 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy. A multichannel six&#8208;dye array was used as a proxy measurement for porosity, eliminating false results that would result from the use of a single dye.








Abstract
Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single&#8208;port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a &#8220;quick&#8221; analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre&#8208;screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six&#8208;dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The method showed a 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre&#8208;screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.

         <title>Highly Stable Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Adapted to Fluctuating Renewable Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating renewable energy with electrocatalysis can cut carbon emissions and boost energy efficiency, greening the chemical industry. Our research tackles the challenge of renewable energy's variability by introducing a stable, efficient oxygen reduction system that produces eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen peroxide. This system, using O&#8208;coordinated cobalt catalysts, maintains high performance even with fluctuating power, with over 55 start&#8722;&#8208;stop cycles and 96% Faradic efficiency.








Abstract
The integration of renewable energy with electrocatalytic technology affords an effective pathway to reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy efficiency, thereby promoting the green electrification of the chemical industry. However, the inherent contradiction between the fluctuating nature of renewable energy and the need for stable operation in electrochemical processes significantly hinders their development and implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a robust two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction system using O&#8208;coordinated Co single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrosynthesis of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide. It excels in stability and efficiency across various operating conditions, including steady&#8208;state, start&#8722;stop cycles, and fluctuating power inputs. At a current density of &#8722;50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the system sustains over 55 stable start&#8722;stop cycles with an average Faradic efficiency above 96%. The high selectivity and durability are attributed to the reservoir&#8208;containing O&#8208;coordinated Co single&#8208;atom sites and the self&#8208;healing capability of gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore, we evaluate its practicality under simulated photovoltaic power supply scenarios in the field of smart agriculture, particularly for integrated fertilization, disinfection, and irrigation. By addressing the variability of renewable energy and optimizing the integration of electrochemical processes, our work paves the way for fully realizing green electrification in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Green Fluorescent Protein SELEX: Immobilization Chemistry and His&#8208;Tag Epitope Bias</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using green fluorescent proteins (GFP) as a target for SELEX, the untagged protein results in true protein&#8208;binding aptamers, whereas using the His&#8208;tagged protein results in aptamers biased toward the His&#8208;tag epitope. The His&#8208;tagged GFP provides a simple test for potential artifacts in previously selected aptamers for other His&#8208;tagged proteins.








Abstract
Despite numerous DNA aptamers for proteins having been reported, a model system allowing the use of cost&#8208;effective proteins, unmodified DNA, and convenient homogeneous assays is still lacking, which has in turn limited not only fundamental studies of aptamers but also their translation to practical applications. Herein, three separate green fluorescent protein (GFP) selections were carried out using both non&#8208;tagged and His&#8208;tagged GFP immobilized on either NHS&#8208;activated resin or Co2+ affinity resin. Only the GFP/NHS system resulted in aptamers that consistently bind to unmodified GFP, whereas the His&#8208;tagged GFP yielded aptamers biased toward the His&#8208;tag epitope. Sequence alignment and fluorescence polarization assays indicate that many previously published aptamers bound to the His&#8208;tag instead of the intended protein. This work not only obtained a model aptamer for proteins but also revealed critical information on bias toward His&#8208;tags during aptamer selections.

         <title>Indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene Quasi[8]circulenes Through Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of curved, chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emerges from the fusion of indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene and quasi[8]circulene motifs. These redox&#8208;active, antiaromatic scaffolds offer great synthetic utility, tunable properties, and modular functionalities for organic electronics and functional materials. 








Abstract
The study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has become a cornerstone of chemical sciences, providing crucial guidance for advancing a wide range of fields. Within this context, quasi[8]circulenes and indenofluorenes (IFs) have gained considerable attention due to their rich chiroptical, optoelectronic, supramolecular, and redox properties. However, their combined integration into a single molecular framework has not yet been realized. This work demonstrates that curved indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes are easily accessible through an intramolecular cyclization of a readily available helicene diketone. The cyclization is high yielding and accompanied by an unexpected regioselective triflation that&#8212;alongside both ketones&#8212;allows orthogonal functionalization. This synthetic utility offers great potential for incorporating 8&#8208;membered rings and formally antiaromatic as&#8208;indacene moieties into complex architectures. Herein, a series of fully conjugated antiaromatic indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes were synthesized and studied spectroscopically and electrochemically, showcasing the rich properties of these rare, purely carbon&#8208;based quasi[8]circulenes. It is shown that the studied compounds display multiple accessible redox states at mild potentials, which can be significantly altered through adequate substituents. These substituents additionally induce unprecedented aggregation behavior for one of the compounds. Furthermore, the studied IFs exhibit chirality arising from the curved structure of the quasi[8]circulenes, which allowed studying chiroptical properties for one of the structures.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Active, Irreversible Covalent Inhibitors Targeting a Surface&#8208;Exposed Non&#8208;Catalytic Lysine on Aurora a Kinase by Using Squarate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel class of covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) targeting surface&#8208;exposed, non&#8208;catalytic lysines by using chemically tunable squarate warheads. The optimized AL8 achieved selective, irreversible inhibition of endogenous Aurora A kinase in cancer cells and with negligible off&#8208;targets. This work establishes a general strategy for modification of weakly nucleophilic, non&#8208;catalytic lysines through rational design of different squarate&#8208;based aminophiles, thus expanding the toolbox of targeted kinase drug discovery. 








Abstract
Targeting surface&#8208;exposed lysines in kinases through covalent modification presents a major challenge due to their high pKa and inherently low reactivity. While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP&#8208;binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface&#8208;exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell&#8208;active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface&#8208;exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well&#8208;known lysine&#8208;reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO2F, and OSO2F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates&#8217; superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low&#8208;reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, AL8 emerged as the first&#8208;in&#8208;class squarate&#8208;based, cell&#8208;active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long&#8208;residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine&#8208;reactive CKIs. Our finding has established squarate&#8208;containing ligands as a unique and readily tunable platform for covalent modification of surface&#8208;exposed, non&#8208;catalytic lysines in targeted kinase drug discovery.

         <title>A Fluorogenic Hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

A fluorogenic hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler (HIPS) ligation reaction is used to label lipid&#8208;derived aldehydes under wash&#8208;free conditions in live cells. This innovative technique enables wash&#8208;free imaging within biological systems, offering invaluable insights into the extent and localization of oxidative stress.








Abstract
Lipid peroxidation generates diverse aldehydic lipids associated with oxidative stress and signaling, yet methodologies capable of their detection in live cells are currently lacking. Here, we report a fluorogenic hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler (HIPS) probe for lipidic aldehydes &#8220;FLipA&#8208;HIPS&#8221; that generates bright, wash&#8208;free fluorescent reaction products in vitro and in cellulo. FLipA&#8208;HIPS is essentially nonfluorescent but reacts with aldehydes to give an environmentally sensitive fluorophore with a higher quantum yield in SDS micelles as compared to aqueous buffer alone. FLipA&#8208;HIPS reacts with lipidic aldehydes to give 10&#8208; to 25&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensities than reactions containing either short&#8208;chain aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes in aqueous buffer. Confocal microscopy shows that&#160;live cells pretreated with potassium bromate or the aldehydic phospholipid &#8220;POVPC&#8221; display rapid and selective FLipA&#8208;HIPS staining that co&#8208;localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with the ER's known role in accumulating lipidic aldehydes. These results demonstrate that HIPS reactions can exhibit useful fluorogenic properties for aldehyde biosensing applications in live cells.

         <title>Interactome Profiling of a Lysine Deacetylase Trapping Probe Library Uncovers Crosstalk Between HDAC6 and NF&#8208;&#954;B Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a peptide probe library containing hydroxamic acids based on putative substrate sites of lysine deacetylase HDAC6. Analyzing substrate selectivity and turnover combined with proteomics profiling resulted in identification of novel HDAC6 interaction partners, such as components of the transcription factor NF&#8208;&#954;B. Importantly, HDAC6 counteracted the activity of acetylated NF&#8208;&#954;B p50, indicating a potential role in NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. 








Abstract
Lysine or histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysine residues of numerous proteins, thereby regulating their function and activity. HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6&#8208;trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids.

&lt;p&gt;We designed a peptide probe library containing hydroxamic acids based on putative substrate sites of lysine deacetylase HDAC6. Analyzing substrate selectivity and turnover combined with proteomics profiling resulted in identification of novel HDAC6 interaction partners, such as components of the transcription factor NF-&#954;B. Importantly, HDAC6 counteracted the activity of acetylated NF-&#954;B p50, indicating a potential role in NF-&#954;B signaling. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lysine or histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysine residues of numerous proteins, thereby regulating their function and activity. HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6-trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids. Most probes enriched HDAC6 from cell lysates stronger than HDAC1. Proteomic profiling of the trapping probes revealed a preferential enrichment of HDAC6 and resulted in the identification of novel putative HDAC6 interaction partners. Among those were several components of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-&#954;B that were independently confirmed as HDAC6 binders. Mechanistically, HDAC6 counteracted NF-&#954;B activity induced upon p300-catalyzed acetylation of NF-&#954;B p50. These findings indicate a potential anti-inflammatory function of HDAC6 in NF-&#954;B signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Importance of Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al Moieties in Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Catalysts for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na, with abundant Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties, catalyzed methane conversion to acetic acid using H2O2 in the presence of CO, yielding&#160;144.1 &#181;mol&#160;of oxygenates (81.8% acetic acid selectivity, 50 &#176;C, 2&#160;h)&#8212;superior&#160;to Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 (Br&#248;nsted acid sites,&#160;131.4&#160;&#181;mol,&#160;58.4% acetic acid selectivity). Our approach bypasses traditional Br&#248;nsted acid reliance, instead employing metal&#8208;electronic modulation to enhance catalytic efficiency, presenting an innovative pathway for methane conversion.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to acetic acid with high activity and selectivity remains a significant challenge. Br&#248;nsted acid sites (Si&#9472;OH&#9472;Al) are well&#8208;known for their crucial role in facilitating methane oxidation to acetic acid over zeolite&#8208;based catalysts. Here, we reported that Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na with abundant Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties outperformed Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 (rich in Br&#248;nsted acid sites) in methane oxidation to acetic acid using H2O2 in the presence of CO. The Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na yielded 144.1 &#181;mol&#160;of oxygenated products, achieving an acetic acid selectivity of 81.8% at 50&#160;&#176;C for 2.0&#160;h. These results surpass the performance of the Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst, which produced 131.4&#160;&#181;mol of oxygenated products with an acetic acid selectivity of 58.4%. Spectroscopic characterizations and mechanistic studies revealed that the Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties in Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na facilitated electron donation to iron species, forming electron&#8208;rich iron sites. These electron&#8208;rich iron species promoted CO insertion and enhanced the formation of acetic acid through carbon&#8211;carbon coupling of methane and CO.

         <title>Anchoring and Competition: Weakly Solvated Structure of Glymes Enhances Stability in Lithium Metal Batteries Operating under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Originally, lithium ions coordinate with multiple O atoms on diglyme, which would result in a strong binding energy. With the addition of LiNO3, the strong binding energy of NO3&#8722; anchors the solvation structure on one side, and by adding a co&#8208;solvent, diglymes with single O atom coordination are generated, which significantly reduces the desolvation energy of the solvation structure to improve the performance of Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) face challenges from unstable and fragile solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C&#9472;O&#9472;C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25&#160;M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen&#8208;bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25&#176; and 80 &#176;C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P&#160;=&#160;1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles. The distinctive solvation regulation strategy has paved a novel research avenue for the realization of high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <dc:description>
First examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes, coupled with electrophilic fluorination, enable a one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls to 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;acyl&#8208;cycloalkanones.








Abstract
The Wacker oxidation is a powerful synthetic method widely employed for the transformation of monosubstituted alkenes into methyl ketones. Its substrate scope has progressively expanded to include internal disubstituted and, more recently, gem&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Herein, we report the first examples of Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes under Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis. In the presence of Selectfluor (2.3 equiv) and a catalytic amount of Pd(MeCN)4(BF4)2 (10 mol%), exocyclic trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds undergo a fluorinative one&#8208;carbon ring expansion to deliver 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good yields. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, including alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkyl tosylate, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, ester, secondary amide, ketone, cyano, and N&#8208;phthalimide. While a semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement of the Pd(IV) intermediate is a plausible mechanistic pathway given the excellent nucleofugality of the Pd(IV) atom, preliminary studies suggest that a 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement is operative in product formation.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture and Functionalization from a Molecular Ti(III) Oxo Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their communication, Mindiola and coworkers demonstrate how a reduced Ti complex can reversibly bind CO2 to produce organic and inorganic carbonates. They access this chemistry through a unique TiIII oxo anion that can be generated both chemically and electrochemically. The subtle electronic and structure parameters of this species promote its reactivity and establish an exciting route to the capture, functionalization, and release of CO2.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide capture and functionalization sequesters carbon dioxide in more robust products and offers a viable route to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We present herein a unique molecular TiIII&#160;oxo anion that reversibly binds CO2 to allow both its sequestration and functionalization. The reduction of [(PN)2Ti&#9552;O] (1) [PN = (2&#8208;PiiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)(mesityl)amide] with KC8 and 2.2.2&#8208;cryptand (crypt) resulted in formation of [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti&#9552;O] (2), which was fully characterized and shown to contain a Ti&#8208;centered radical. Complex 2 reacts with Al(CH3)3 to form [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti{O(Al(CH3)3}] (3), which can be independently prepared from [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti(OCP)] and Al(CH3)3. Whereas 1 does not react with CO2, 2 rapidly captures the gas (1 atm, 25&#160;&#176;C) to produce a TiIII carbonate [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti(&#954;2&#8208;O2C&#9552;O)] (4). Chemical and electrochemical oxidation of 4 releases CO2 to regenerate 1 while a soluble organic carbonate [Me3SiOC(O)OSiMe3, Me = CH3]&#160;is obtained from reaction of 4 with ClSiMe3.

&lt;p&gt;In their communication, Mindiola and coworkers demonstrate how a reduced Ti complex can reversibly bind CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce organic and inorganic carbonates. They access this chemistry through a unique Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; oxo anion that can be generated both chemically and electrochemically. The subtle electronic and structure parameters of this species promote its reactivity and establish an exciting route to the capture, functionalization, and release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Behavior Regulation of *CO over Self&#8208;Evolution Tandem Catalysts Under Tuned Interfacial Electric Field Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, three kinds of self&#8208;evolution tandem catalysts (Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu) are designed and the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO are evaluated by DFT calculations, COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in situ characterizations. The research figures out that although strong interfacial electric fields weaken the internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity for *CO is a key factor for C&#8211;C coupling in tandem catalysts.








Abstract
Tandem or self&#8208;evolution Cu&#8208;based catalysts effectively regulate *CO to promote the conversion of CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon (C2+) products. DFT calculations reveal that the adsorption capacity of *CO varies under different interfacial electric field intensities for the Cu, Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu models. Accordingly, we design three kinds of self&#8208;evolution tandem catalysts and investigate the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO under interfacial electric fields. Electrochemical CO2 reduction test results indicate that the higher CO selectivity of Au/Cu is attributed to its weak *CO adsorption capacity, confirmed by in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared and in situ Raman. The low C2+ selectivity of Pd/Cu is owing to its high reaction energy barrier and low catalytic activity. In contrast, Ag/Cu achieves a high FEC2+ of 89.2% and a partial current density (jc2+) of 553.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 thanks to the low reaction energy barrier and moderate *CO adsorption capacity. COMSOL multiphysics simulations reveal that the effect of the interfacial electric field on *CO external migration could be neglected in the nanometer range. Although a strong interfacial electric field increases the energy barrier for internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity of *CO still dominates C&#8211;C coupling in the *CO&#8208;rich microenvironment over tandem catalysts.

         <title>Bioorthogonal In Situ Formation of AIE Luminogens for Imaging Disease Progression via Sigmoidal Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal strategy featuring a double&#8208;lock mechanism has been developed for the in situ formation of AIEgens, enabling ultralow background, up to 1033&#8208;fold fluorescence turn&#8208;on, and sigmoidal amplification for high&#8208;sensitivity, multiplexed live&#8208;cell imaging and effective disease monitoring.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens are promising tools for biological imaging, yet their utility is often limited by nonspecific aggregation and elevated background fluorescence. Here, we present a bioorthogonal in situ formation strategy that enables precise, organelle&#8208;specific activation of AIEgens within live cells. This system employs a dual&#8208;lock mechanism&#8212;combining tetrazine quenching and twisted intramolecular charge shuttle (TICS) dynamics&#8212;to maintain an ultra&#8208;low fluorescence background in the precursor state, even under aggregating conditions. Upon bioorthogonal reactions and molecular aggregation, the resulting AIEgens exhibit tunable emission peaks ranging from 605 to 665&#160;nm, large Stokes shifts (up to 201&#160;nm), and an exceptional fluorescence enhancement (up to 1033&#8208;fold). Their high biocompatibility and spatial precision allow for multiplexed, simultaneous labeling of intracellular targets. Compared to conventional fluorogenic and bioorthogonal probes, these AIEgens exhibit a sigmoidal amplification response, enabling the sensitive discrimination of subtle biomarker expression differences and the effective identification of injured cells during disease progression. This strategy significantly enhances the specificity and sensitivity of live&#8208;cell imaging, expands the functional utility of AIE luminogens, and offers a versatile platform for high&#8208;resolution, multiplexed bioimaging in biomedical research and diagnostics.

         <title>A Streamlined Approach to Indoles, Pyrroles, and Benzimidazoles via Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization and CO Reduction Mediated by Cs2CO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have discovered a general method to convert vicinal alkyl and nitro groups on arenes or alkenes into various heteroaromatic compounds, including indoles, pyrroles, and benzimidazoles avoiding any transition metal. This protocol uses a redox&#8208;neutral aromatization and CO reduction sequence just using Cs2CO3, with high atom, step, and redox efficiency.








Abstract
The synthesis of nitrogen heteroarenes has a rich history, including many illustrious name reactions. These reactions often involve complex oxidative processes or the need for transition metal catalysts, and the synthesis of different N&#8208;heteroarenes typically requires a case&#8208;by&#8208;case approach. Here, we have discovered the conversion of vicinal alkyl and nitro groups on arenes or alkenes into an array of N&#8208;heteroarenes, including indoles and pyrroles. Moreover, our approach also facilitates the synthesis of benzimidazoles from ortho NH&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes. This versatile method leverages a redox&#8208;neutral aromatization and CO reduction sequence, uniquely utilizing Cs2CO3, and is remarkable for its omission of any transition metals. Our strategy is particularly noteworthy for its exceptional atom, step, and redox efficiency, offering significant advantages for the synthesis of alkaloids that are important in pharmaceutical applications. Extensive experimental and computational studies have allowed us to understand the preferred mechanistic pathways for these heteroarene formations.

         <title>Decoration of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Coenzyme Mimics for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple molecule of 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide, mimicking the NAD(P)H coenzyme, is modified onto a metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. This simulant behaves like a redox&#8208;active coenzyme, promoting proton and electron transfer by serving as their relays. The coenzyme&#8208;like regeneration mechanism is demonstrated in the involved photocatalytic process, giving rise to improved charge separation and significantly enhanced activity.








Abstract
Despite remarkable progress achieved in biomimetic catalysis, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on mimicking the structures of catalytic sites in metalloenzymes, while frequently neglecting the crucial roles of multifunctional coenzymes therein. In this study, the coenzyme mimics of nicotinic acid (NA) and 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide (NA&#8208;Me, simply denoted as NM) have been modified onto the metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, affording UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X&#9552;NA, NM) with varying the degree of mimicry for the nicotinamide nucleotide coenzyme. Remarkably, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NM showcases approximately five&#8208; and seven&#8208;fold activity higher than UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NA and the pristine UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, respectively, in the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the NM dangling on the MOF undergoes structural redox change similar to that in the regeneration process of NAD(P)H coenzyme, which serves as the proton and electron relays surrounding catalytic Pt sites, facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and thereby boosting photocatalytic activity. This work offers new insights and strategies for the design and fabrication of biomimetic heterogeneous catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The simple molecule of 3-carboxy-1-methylpyridinium iodide, mimicking the NAD(P)H coenzyme, is modified onto a metal-organic framework, UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. This simulant behaves like a redox-active coenzyme, promoting proton and electron transfer by serving as their relays. The coenzyme-like regeneration mechanism is demonstrated in the involved photocatalytic process, giving rise to improved charge separation and significantly enhanced activity.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Azaarene Migration to &#945;&#8208;Azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Enabled by a Tailored Ligand</title>

The first enantioselective catalytic benzilic ester rearrangement of vicinal dicarbonyl compounds is reported, providing a variety of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters in good yields and high enantiopurities. This transformation features an asymmetric 1,2&#8208;azaarene shift, which is systematically investigated here for the first time. A newly designed chiral BOX ligand with extended and rigid side arms was critical for achieving effective stereocontrol.








Abstract
Despite their prevalence in bioactive molecules, the stereoselective construction of &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates remains a formidable challenge. Notably, although the benzilic ester rearrangement (BER) is an efficient approach to &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates, asymmetric catalytic BER remains poorly developed, largely due to poor stereorecognition of the vicinal diketone substituents by common chiral catalysts. In response to these issues, here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene&#8208;derived 1,2&#8208;diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five&#8208;membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2&#8208;nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2&#8208;azaarene migrations.

         <dc:description>
Ir(I) catalysts featuring the electron&#8208;deficient bisphosphine ligand dFppe promote the hydrocarbonation of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products. This reaction is highly effective with C(3)&#8208;dialkylcarboxamidepyrroles as well as with other C&#9472;H donors, such as furans and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxamides. Employing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes as partners enabled the access to challenging products featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. DFT computational analysis that offers relevant mechanistic insights.








Abstract
An iridium complex featuring the perfluorinated bisphosphine ligand dFppe can catalyze intermolecular hydrocarbonation reactions of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products instead of the more common linear derivatives. Using N&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;carboxamide pyrroles as C&#9472;H donors, the reaction gives exclusively C&#8208;4 substituted products, while furan analogues yield C&#8208;2 substituted derivatives. &#946;&#8208;Unsubstituted acrylamides can also be used as C&#9472;H sources to give chiral skipped dienes. The additions are equally efficient using monosubstituted and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes, enabling the efficient formation of products bearing tertiary and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. Moreover, a preliminary analysis with chiral bisphosphinite ligands confirms the feasibility of an enantioselective variant. Computational (DFT) studies provide relevant insights into this remarkable ligand&#8208;driven branched selectivity.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active &#960;&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Carbon Nanohoop Featuring Unique Kasha/Anti&#8208;Kasha Dual Emissions: Structure, Photophysical Properties, and Photoconductivity</title>

exTTF[10]CPP, featuring shape&#8208;persistent architecture and curved conjugation, exhibits tunable Kasha/anti&#8208;Kasha dual emissions. Meanwhile, exTTF[10]CPP not only exhibits reversible redox responsiveness but also shows redox&#8208;dependent tunability in its binding interaction with C60. Moreover, its complex with C60 displays exceptional charge&#8208;transfer property, enhancing the photocurrent in C60&#8834;exTTF[10]CPP&#8208;based cast film.








Abstract
Developing functionalized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) that respond to various stimuli, particularly redox, remains challenging yet crucial for advanced nanocarbon applications. Here, we report the exploration of the synergy between the concave &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) and the curved CPP scaffold for constructing the rigid, conjugated nanohoop exTTF[10]CPP. X&#8208;ray analysis reveals a unique spherical packing arrangement in which six adjacent nanohoops interlock through concave and convex interactions. Interestingly, fluorescence studies revealed that exTTF[10]CPP exhibited unexpected anti&#8208;Kasha emissions originating from higher excited states, along with Kasha emission from S1 excited state in toluene and THF. However, in a PMMA film, it displayed a redshifted Kasha emission. The unique Kasha/anti&#8208;Kasha dual&#8208;emission behavior represents a rarely explored photophysical phenomenon within exTTF derivatives and nanocarbon&#8208;based systems. Ultraviolet&#8208;Visible (UV&#8211;vis) absorption investigations showed that exTTF[10]CPP demonstrated reversible redox responsiveness with tunable binding affinity for C60 up to 1.92&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;M&#8722;1. Notably, femtosecond transient absorption measurements further revealed a prolonged lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state, C60&#8226;&#8722;/exTTF[10]CPP&#8226;+, which provides sufficient time for charge utilization. This exceptional charge&#8208;transfer property enhances the photocurrent in C60&#8834;exTTF[10]CPP&#8208;based cast film, which is 2.43 times higher than that of exTTF[10]CPP alone, highlighting its potential in photoelectronic device.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimulus Programmed Multiphase Separation and Organization in Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;stimulus programmed coacervate transformation system is developed. The sequential application of pH and salt concentration induces transition of membrane&#8208;less coacervates into nested multiphase coacervates and, ultimately, into vesicular&#8208;like multiphase coacervates. This transition endows selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, and facilitates the spatial orchestration of enzymatic reactions.

Stimuli&#8208;responsive (multiphase) coacervates deserve significant attention as cell&#8208;like entities that can adapt to their environment and undergo morphological reconfiguration. In this study, a tandem&#8208;triggered transition system is presented that enables the transformation of single&#8208;phase coacervates into multiphase structures through the sequential application of two external stimuli: pH and salt concentration. A polyanion containing acid&#8208;labile amide bond is incorporated into the membrane&#8208;less coacervates. Upon exposure to an acidic pH, hydrolysis of the amide bond induces charge reversal from polyanion to polycation, triggering the first transition from single&#8208;phase to nested multiphase coacervates. This transformation alters the spatial redistribution and viscosity of coacervate components and influences sequestration behavior toward various (macro) molecules. Subsequently, the introduction of hypertonic environment as secondary stimulus induces selective dissociation and structural reconfiguration of nested multiphase coacervates into vesicular&#8208;like multiphase coacervates, further altering the coacervate components' fluidity and partitioning properties. Notably, the diverse inherent properties of coacervates among this tandem&#8208;triggered transition enables the variation of spatial organization for enzymatic reactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate a strategy for the sequential control of coacervate structural reconfiguration through dual stimuli, providing a versatile platform for the development of programable and adaptive coacervate&#8208;based protocells.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-stimulus programmed coacervate transformation system is developed. The sequential application of pH and salt concentration induces transition of membrane-less coacervates into nested multiphase coacervates and, ultimately, into vesicular-like multiphase coacervates. This transition endows selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, and facilitates the spatial orchestration of enzymatic reactions.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Relay for C&#9472;N Cleavage and Ring Expansion: Accessing Medium&#8208;Sized Lactams From Unstrained Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical relay approach has been successfully developed for the direct cleavage of the C&#9472;N bond in unstrained cyclic amines. This method allows for the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11&#8208;membered lactams containing a Z&#8208;olefin moiety. Control experiments and computational investigations have confirmed that the ring&#8208;expansion mechanism commences with the C&#9472;N bond cleavage induced by reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover. 








Abstract
The synthesis of medium&#8208;ring lactams constitutes a formidable yet pivotal frontier in modern chemical research. Persistent endeavors in this field are essential for overcoming the prevailing obstacles, particularly in the realm of ring expansion strategies for unstrained cyclic amines. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical relay process that accomplishes direct C&#9472;N bond cleavage in unstrained cyclic amines, thereby enabling the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11&#8208;membered lactams adorned with a Z&#8208;olefin moiety. Remarkably, our methodology exhibits exceptional compatibility with a broad spectrum of acids, encompassing &#945;&#8208;amino acids, peptides, and carboxylic acids, thus facilitating the ring expansion of readily accessible propiolamides. Control experiments and computational investigations provide compelling evidence that the ring expansion mechanism is initiated via a reductive radical&#8208;polar&#8208;crossover&#8208;induced C&#9472;N bond cleavage, offering profound insights into the underlying reaction dynamics. This advancement not only broadens the synthetic methodology for medium&#8208;ring lactam construction but also paves the way for future explorations in complex molecule synthesis and drug discovery.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly of Polar Chains for Rational Construction of UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure design strategy, Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly, has been successfully devised. Leveraging donor&#8211;acceptor pairing of hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8208;conjugated units are selectively screened and self&#8208;assembled into polar chains, which are interwoven into NCS structures. According to this strategy, we successfully designed two promising ultraviolet nonlinear optical crystals, [C(NH2)3]C3H3O4 and [C(NH2)3]C4H5O4.








Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) materials underpin a host of emerging technologies&#8212;from high&#8208;power lasers to optical communications and sensors&#8212;yet their targeted design remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly&#8221; strategy for the rational construction of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In this strategy, programmable hydrogen&#8208;bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units&#8212;C3H3O4&#8722;, C4H5O4&#8722;, and C(NH2)3+&#8212;and assembled them into two one&#8208;dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH2)3C3H3O4]&#8734; and [C(NH2)3C4H5O4]&#8734;. These modules crystallize as two new UV NLO materials, C(NH2)3C3H3O4 and C(NH2)3C4H5O4, which exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. By shifting the synthetic focus from serendipitous screening to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;guided, module&#8208;level engineering, our strategy establishes a predictive framework for the a priori design of NCS structures with tailored properties.

         <title>Constructing Synergistic Interactions Between Multi&#8208;Hydroxyl Molecules and Perovskite to Alleviate Mechanical&#8208;Thermal Mismatch for Achieving High&#8208;Performance Flexible Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
We introduced three hydroxy&#8208;substituted phenylacetic acid molecules into the perovskite films to investigate how the interaction patterns between multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules and perovskite affect the mechanical&#8208;thermal properties of flexible photovoltaic cells. The multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules reduced the Young's modulus and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the perovskite film by 11.1% and 38.5%, respectively, ultimately achieving a PCE of 25.01%. Additionally, these devices maintained 90% of their initial PCE after 3000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Due to the presence of residual tensile strain, as well as the inherent brittleness and film quality of the perovskite, flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) face ongoing challenges in stability. To address these issues, this study introduces a multi&#8208;hydroxyl regulated stress management strategy for f&#8208;PSCs. Three hydroxyl&#8208;substituted phenylacetic acids (p&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid) are incorporated into the perovskite films to investigate the significance of their interaction modes with perovskite in regulating f&#8208;PSC performance. These multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules, through their progressively enhanced synergistic interactions with the perovskite, effectively promote greater energy dissipation during stress deformation, reducing the Young's modulus of the perovskite by 11.1% and decreasing the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskite film by 38.5%, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the f&#8208;PSCs. Additionally, the multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI2 during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f&#8208;PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h.

The Zr17&#8208;oxo nanocluster&#8208;based solid enables efficient, site&#8208;selective hydrolysis of myoglobin, mimicking enzymatic proteolysis. Its recyclable, heterogeneous nature and tunable ligand shell allow control over peptide product profiles. This work highlights how nanocluster surface chemistry governs protein interaction and reactivity, enabling advanced catalyst design and nanocluster recovery for reuse.








Abstract
Selective proteolysis remains a significant challenge with relevance to industrial and pharmaceutical applications, motivating development of chemical strategies emulating the specificity of natural proteases. Here, we report that the discrete Zr&#8208;oxo nanocluster&#8208;based solid, [Zr17O8(OH)24(OH2)12(HCO2)12(SO4)8] &#183; 6 HCl &#183; 30 H2O (Zr17) serves as an efficient, recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for site&#8208;selective proteolysis with tunable fragment selectivity. A combination of solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy highlighted the importance of the ligand environment of solid Zr17 for enabling efficient protein&#8208;cluster interaction and controlling reactivity. We demonstrate that Zr17 achieves a proteolytic performance comparable to natural enzymes while allowing fine modulation of peptide product profiles by adjusting reaction parameters. Substrate adsorption and product desorption were found to be governed by the net charge of both catalyst and substrate, as well as rapid reorganization of the cluster's capping ligands, according to UV&#8208;Vis/IR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Crucially, the insoluble nature and excellent stability of Zr17, evidenced by pair distribution function analysis, allowed reuse across multiple catalytic cycles, overcoming a major limitation of proteolytic systems. This study reveals how cluster surface chemistry governs substrate interaction and catalysis, guiding rational design of next&#8208;generation cluster&#8208;based catalysts, including hybrid materials such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

         <title>Chiral Single Molecule with Biphenyl Component Exhibiting Both TADF and RTP Emissions Enables Highly Efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel chiral biphenyl&#8208;based single molecule emitter, CP&#8208;D3, with both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions, achieving the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.44% in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This represents the first report of a chiral single&#8208;molecule emitter incorporating a biphenyl component that exhibits simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions, as well as highly efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs. 








Abstract
Chiral single molecules that exhibit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) pose significant challenges, primarily due to their competitive luminescence mechanisms and the scarcity of studies on their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). In this work, we develop a novel chiral emitter, CP&#8208;D3, with an axially chiral biphenyl segment selected as the chiral center. As a result, CP&#8208;D3 successfully exhibits both TADF and RTP properties with a high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of 91%. The high dissymmetry factors (gCPPL) of &#8722;7.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and +7.47&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 are obtained for (R/S)&#8208;CP&#8208;D3, respectively. Notably, the CP&#8208;D3&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.44%, which represents the highest value among chiral luminance materials based on an axially chiral biphenyl component. The gCPEL is recorded as &#8722;8.13&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4/+5.92&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 for (R/S)&#8208;CP&#8208;D3&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs. This work presents the first report on a chiral single&#8208;molecule emitter incorporating an axially chiral biphenyl component, which exhibits simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions and enables highly efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Hofmeister &#8220;Salting&#8208;In&#8221; Assisted Slurry Homogenization for Ultra&#8208;Thin Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>

This work introduces a slurry&#8208;based strategy for ultrathin SSE fabrication leveraging Hofmeister &#8220;salting&#8208;in&#8221; effect to disperse binders in poor&#8208;solvent environments. The homo&#8208;dispersed and high dielectric binders formed a flexible ion&#8208;conductive network with Li&#8208;salts that creates Li+ pathways while providing cushioning to stabilize interfaces and enable long&#8208;term ASSB cycling. The thermal transfer printing renders ultrathin SSE compatible with industrial winding and lamination for scalability.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) demand ultra&#8208;thin electrolytes to achieve low impedance and high energy density, yet scalable fabrication remains bottlenecked by the incompatibility between binder/ solvent and sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, we introduce a pioneering slurry&#8208;based strategy leveraging Hofmeister &#8220;salting&#8208;in&#8221; effect to disperse binders in a poor&#8208;solvent environment, dramatically expanding the applicable binder spectrum. The copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVTC) was uniformly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran via Li&#8208;salts mediation, reducing chain aggregate to hundreds of nanometers. PVTC with reduced size was homo&#8208;dispersed in the Li6PS5Cl slurry, enabling the film&#8208;formation of SSE/ PVTC composite electrolytes (SCEs) with an ultra&#8208;low resistance of 0.69&#160;&#937; cm&#8722;2, synchronously facilitating the formation of continuous polymer networks to provide mechanical cushioning that stabilizes interfaces during cycling. The high dielectric PVTC enhances Li&#8208;salts dissociation, eradicating conduction barriers and establishing efficient Li+&#8208;pathways. Notably, the excellent thermal transfer capability of SCEs enables direct lamination onto electrodes, enabling industrial manufacturing. ASSBs featuring LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes and silicon&#8208;based anodes exhibited energy densities exceeding 380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and retained 80% capacity over 750 cycles. This work breakthrough traditional binder limitations for sulfide SSEs, addresses the transport obstruction through rational structure design, and ushers in a new era for scalable ASSB production.

         <title>Decoupling Roles of Cationic Dimensionality and Valence&#8208;Electron Compatibility on Structural Resilience and Kinetics in High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue with great mechanochemical compatibility is proposed as cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, contributing high reversible specific capacity, great rate capability and long&#8208;term lifespan over 9000 cycles due to the suppressed Jahn&#8211;Teller lattice distortion as well as the enhanced electron/ion transfer kinetics benefited from high&#8208;entropy effect. 








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have considered as high&#8208;performance cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the impact of high&#8208;entropy component compatibility on electrodes&#8217; lattice stress and kinetics remains underexplored. Herein, a series of high&#8208;entropy PBAs are served as cathode materials for SIBs. The tailoring Na2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2[Fe(CN)6] (HE&#8208;Cu) with superior mechanochemical compatibility shows superior phase stability without obvious lattice stress and faster electron/ion transfer kinetics. Intrinsic and accumulated lattice stresses can be obtained by ion&#8208;incompatible Sn&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;Sn) and valence&#8208;electron mismatched Ti&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;Ti), thereby exhibiting poor structure stability and dynamics. Serious Jahn&#8211;Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] with complicated Na&#8208;ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high&#8208;entropy effect, appearing a zero&#8208;strain solid&#8208;solution reaction mechanism for HE&#8208;Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co&#8208;ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation. Consequently, HE&#8208;Cu presents high initial specific capacity of 120.4&#160;mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, superior rate capability and outstanding cyclability with ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 9000 cycles with the lowest capacity&#8208;decay&#8208;rate of 0.0042% per cycle. Na&#8208;ion full cell demonstrates high initial energy density of 397.0&#160;Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 and perfect cycling stability with long lifespan over 2000 cycles.

Serious Jahn&#8211;Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] with complicated Na-ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high-entropy effect, appearing a zero-strain solid-solution reaction mechanism for HE-Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co-ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation. Consequently, HE-Cu presents high initial specific capacity of 120.4&#160;mAh&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, superior rate capability and outstanding cyclability with ultra-long cycling life of 9000 cycles with the lowest capacity-decay-rate of 0.0042% per cycle. Na-ion full cell demonstrates high initial energy density of 397.0&#160;Wh&#183;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and perfect cycling stability with long lifespan over 2000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helical Poly(isocyanide anthraquinones)&#8208;Based Cathodes for Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a palladium catalyst of Pd&#8208;II for living polymerization of side&#8208;chain anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;type pendant polyisocyanide achieves controllable molecular weight and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). This cathode maintains stability with no significant degradation after 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 in the lithium metal batteries (LMBs). What is more, polymer ionic liquid electrolytes are used to construct soft PIC&#8208;2AQ pouch batteries, which maintain performance after bending and cutting, combining safety and practicality.








Abstract
Thanks to the unique rigid conformation and designable side&#8208;chain structure, helical polymers are starting to be more widely considered as ideal electrode materials in secondary batteries. In this study, a series of helical poly(isocyanide anthraquinones) (PIC&#8208;AQs), including PIC&#8208;1AQn and PIC&#8208;2AQn, were designed and synthesized via living polymerization using a palladium catalyst (Pd&#8208;II). The polymers feature a helical polyisocyanide main chain and anthraquinone (AQ) pendants, offer high yields (approximately 90%), controlled number&#8208;average molecular weight (Mn), and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). Attributed to a narrow energy band gap, low unoccupied molecular orbitals, and high spatial freedom of PIC&#8208;2AQ, it exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), maintaining 141 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Additionally, an in situ polymerized poly(ionic liquid) electrolyte was prepared for assembling a PIC&#8208;2AQ all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;pouch battery. And it remained stable under extreme operations like bending or cutting. Such a battery significantly broadens the application scope of organic LMBs and offers great potential for their use in flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Ligand Coordination Equilibria&#8211;Drived Homogeneous Electrodeposition Enables Coatings with Superior Corrosion Resistance and Mechanical Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand coordination equilibrium (LCE) was proposed to precisely control the morphology of alloy electrodeposits. By synergistically regulating ion solvation structures, concentration distributions, and electrochemical reduction pathways, this approach achieved uniform and compact alloy coatings with substantially improved corrosion resistance and mechanical strength, highlighting its potential for industrial applications.








Abstract
Electroplating technology is crucial for interfacial engineering due to its flexible controllability and excellent protective performance. However, electroplated coatings often exhibit uneven deposition morphology due to the uncontrollable nucleation and growth of metal grains, which results in degraded coating performance. Here, we propose ligand coordination equilibria (LCE) that creates a dense coating by simultaneously modulating the solvation structure and optimizing the reduction process, exemplified by Al/Zr alloy electroplating. Multiscale calculations revealed that Cl&#8722; coordination with AlCl3 and ZrCl4 forms a dynamic equilibrium between active ionic species Al2Cl7&#8722; and ZrCl5&#8722;, which is predominantly governed by AlCl3 due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al2Cl7&#8722;, which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl5&#8722;, which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small&#8208;sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high&#8208;performance alloys.

         <title>Organic Surface Passivation on Rh@CeO2 Cocatalysts for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Rh@CeO2 cocatalysts modified with PPOA as a surface passivation layer, effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO2 overlayers, leading to a significantly enhanced performance in photocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Decorating Rh cocatalysts with Cr2O3 overlayers can enhance the performance of photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS). However, there is a general concern on the dissolution of Cr2O3, calling for the development of environment&#8208;friendly metal oxides. Here, we employ phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA) as a model surface modifier to decorate the model Rh@CeO2 cocatalysts and demonstrate the critical role of organic surface passivation in H2 evolution catalysis. We identify a &#8220;surface passivation effect&#8221; in photocatalysis, wherein the PPOA modification on CeO2 overlayers not only suppress the adsorption and activation of oxygen but exhibit strong resistance to hydrogen reduction during POWS. This dual functionality effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO2 overlayers, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to Rh@CeO2&#8208;PPOA systems; it also improves POWS performance in systems where other reducible oxides&#8208;organophosphonic acids structure are used as passivation layers on other noble metal cocatalysts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the universal principles of surface passivation in photocatalysis and offer a practical framework for regulating the reverse reactions and provide guidance for optimizing POWS through targeted surface organic modification.

This work demonstrates electric&#8208;field manipulation of a Ce(III)&#8208;based molecular qubit, uncovering a spin&#8208;electric coupling strength (|Txyz | = 2.04 (16) &#215;10&#8722;10 m &#8901; V&#8722;1) 194 times larger than the effective value. This contradiction is resolved by our simulation program. Pulsed experiments give a coherence time of 24.1(13) &#181;s under dynamic decoupling and an electric control efficiency approaching 0.1 Hz &#8729; m &#8729; V&#8722;1, establishing rare&#8208;earth molecules as viable candidates for electrically addressable quantum technologies.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric materials have attracted considerable interests due to their unique capability to facilitate reciprocal control between the charges and spins in matter. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) involving modulated and pulsed electric fields, we have studied a Ce (III)&#8208;based molecular qubit under electric control. We observed linear spin&#8208;electric coupling (SEC) in the powder sample, which challenges the previous routine of spectral analysis and strength estimation for SEC. We determined the SEC parameter |Txyz| to be 2.04(16) &#215; 10&#8722;10 m &#183; V&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude&#160;larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric&#8208;field&#8208;modulated (EFM) continuous&#8208;wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) &#181;s at 5&#160;K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz &#183; m &#183; V&#8722;1. Our work provides an insight into the EFM detection of the SEC effect of the uniaxial molecule and offers a reference for the coherent electric manipulation of rare&#8208;earth molecular quantum systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetoelectric materials have attracted considerable interests due to their unique capability to facilitate reciprocal control between the charges and spins in matter. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) involving modulated and pulsed electric fields, we have studied a Ce (III)-based molecular qubit under electric control. We observed linear spin-electric coupling (SEC) in the powder sample, which challenges the previous routine of spectral analysis and strength estimation for SEC. We determined the SEC parameter |&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;xyz&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;| to be 2.04(16) &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt; m &#183; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, two orders of magnitude&#160;larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric-field-modulated (EFM) continuous-wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) &#181;s at 5&#160;K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz &#183; m &#183; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work provides an insight into the EFM detection of the SEC effect of the uniaxial molecule and offers a reference for the coherent electric manipulation of rare-earth molecular quantum systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Flue Gas to Syngas: Composite Electrode Based on Ionic Liquid and Microporous Polymer for MEA&#8208;Based CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite gas&#8208;diffusion electrode (GDE) with a thin CO2&#8208;selective interlayer beneath the catalyst facilitates direct MEA electrolysis of simulated flue gas (with O2) to CO/syngas, eliminating costly pre&#8208;purification. The interlayer&#8212;an intrinsically microporous polymer scaffold infused with CO2&#8208;philic [Emim][BF4]&#8212;delivers high CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivity, directing CO2 to the catalyst layer, and greatly enhancing process economics.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2R) offers a promising pathway to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added products. While catalyst advances remain crucial, gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs) architecture is equally vital in CO2 electrolyzer design. Most ECO2R studies use pure CO2 feeds, whereas industrial sources like flue gas contain &#8764;15% CO2, requiring costly purification. Eliminating this step demands electrolyzers that directly process impure streams via in situ separation. Here, we introduce a composite GDE (CGDE) featuring a thin CO2&#8208;selective interlayer of intrinsically microporous polymer (PIM&#8208;1) reinforced with the CO2&#8208;philic ionic liquid [Emim][BF4]. This layer selectively adsorbs CO2 and suppresses N2/O2 existence at the catalyst interface. In simulated flue gas (15% CO2, 5% O2 in N2), the CGDE with 20 wt% [Emim][BF4]/PIM&#8208;1 achieved &gt;70% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, versus &#8764;20% FE for a pristine GDE. Multiphysics simulations confirmed effective CO2 delivery through the selective layer, with minimal O2 permeation. Cost estimation analysis indicates around 25% reduction in CO's minimum selling price using the integrated design and &gt;50% under ideal performance metrics by eliminating compression/transport. These results demonstrate that advanced electrode design with CO2&#8208;selective interlayer enables direct mixed&#8208;gas ECO2R, establishes key design criteria for selective layers, and significantly improves process economics.

         <title>Taiji&#8208;Inspired Synergistic Attraction&#8208;Repulsion Electrostatic Interactions Enable Dual&#8208;Electrode Stabilization for Durable High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Bromine Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The degradation mechanism of zinc&#8208;bromine (Zn&#8208;Br2) batteries is systematically investigated. Subsequently, a Taiji&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, thereby effectively suppressing polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized Zn&#8208;Br2 cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine (Zn&#8208;Br2) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the dissolution of polybromide species at the cathode and their subsequent shuttling and corrosive reactions at the zinc anode, which severely limit areal capacity and cycling stability. Herein, a Taiji&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, enabling durable high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8208;Br2 batteries. This design leverages the dynamic balance of opposing yet complementary electrostatic interactions, facilitating targeted attraction (Yin) and repulsion (Yang) of polybromides at cathode/anode interfaces, respectively. At the cathode, positively charged quaternary ammonium groups in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) enable strong electrostatic binding to polybromides, effectively confining them within the cathode and preventing diffusion into the electrolyte. Simultaneously, a lotus&#8208;leaf&#8208;biomimetic interphase with high electronegativity and hydrophobicity is constructed on Zn anode to repel polybromides and suppress parasitic reactions. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm the effective suppression of polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized KB&#8208;PDDA//Zn@ZnO&#8208;PFNA cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles, highlighting the critical importance of dual&#8208;interface engineering for advancing practical Zn&#8208;Br2 battery technologies.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Rearrangement Averaged Dye Design for Precise, Real&#8208;Time, and Portable Monitoring of Complex Solvent Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;rearrangement&#8208;averaged dye design was proposed to achieve high LE/TICT emission efficiency, exhibiting ratiometric dual&#8208;fluorescence with solvent&#8208;dependent emission modulation instead of quenching. Integrated into crosslinked polymers, these dyes enable precise mixed&#8208;solvent visualization and reusable heterogeneous detection. A portable sensor achieves self&#8208;calibrated ethanol tracking in E10 ethanol gasoline via smartphone photography, with a robust working curve.








Abstract
Although solvatochromic materials provide visual function to differentiate solvents, they fail to precisely monitor complex solvent environments where solvent composition varies dynamically, because of an insensitive absorptional shift in these environments. Relatively, their fluorescence signal change, which should be more sensitive, has always been inefficient, resulting from inherent challenges in excited&#8208;state dynamics. Here, we present a charge&#8208;rearrangement averaged dye design, instead of traditional donor&#8208;acceptor structures, to enable a high locally excited or twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission efficiency. A ratiometric dual&#8208;fluorescence behavior can be observed along with a solvent&#8208;dependent emission trade&#8208;off rather than complete quenching. In this case, the dyes can not only precisely visualize various mixed solvents but also enable heterogeneous detection with over hundreds of reuse cycles after being integrated into a crosslinked polymer. The leading portable material achieves a self&#8208;calibrated visual tracking of ethanol content (error&lt;0.2%) with a robust working curve (R2&#160;=&#160;0.9992) while applied to E10 ethanol gasoline, operable via user&#8208;friendly software analysis through mobile phone photography.

         <title>Fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; Induced Alkyne Concentrating and Orderly Arranged Sulfonate&#8208;Adjusted Interfacial Water Structure Promote Alkene Electrosynthesis at Large Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nafion ionomer&#8208;modified palladium nanotips are designed to achieve electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes with an 83% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; effect induces the alkyne concentrating around the electrode surface and the orderly arranged SO3&#8722; under bias potentials repels the water cation away from the electrode surface, which contributes to increasing the interfacial alkyne&#8211;water ratio, thus suppressing H2 evolution and improving the FE at a high current density.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with water at nearly industrial current densities is highly important. However, a low interfacial alkyne&#8211;water ratio leads to severe hydrogen evolution, making it extremely challenging to obtain alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, a strategy involving fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction&#8208;induced alkyne concentration and orderly arranged sulfonate&#8208;repelled interfacial water&#8208;cation is developed over commercial Nafion&#8208;modified palladium nanotips, enabling electrolysis of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) with up to 83% FE under &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; effect concentrates the alkyne via its adsorption enhancement, promotes electron transfer, and lowers the activation energy, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics. Under the bias potential, the side chain of Nafion undergoing rearrangement from disordered to nearly ordered significantly decreases the interfacial free water coverage and activity, thereby reducing the amount of in situ&#8208;generated surface&#8208;active hydrogen, which contributes to suppressing hydrogen evolution and improving the FE. An 82% FE and 18.9&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 reaction rate of MBE is achieved in a 10&#160;h continuous electrosynthesis at 1.25 A, demonstrating potential utility. Furthermore, the hydrogenation and deuteration of different alkynes with improved Faradaic efficiencies at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 rationalize the design concept.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Triazolate Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Water Oxidation Catalysts with Dual Photoanode Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal&#8208;substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) MOFs are reported as dual&#8208;function materials for light absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media, achieving a highest photocurrent of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 A cm&#8722;2 at bias&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is an emerging technology that achieves renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, from sunlight. Its realization depends on finding highly active and stable catalysts of water splitting and photoactive materials for light absorption. To be scalable, these should contain only abundant elements. Here, for the first time, Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are characterized as new dual&#8208;function materials for photo&#8208;absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media. The materials were studied by a range of structural, spectroscopic, and computational density functional theory (DFT) techniques. Fe(ta)2 and Fe&#8208;Mn(ta)2 were found to be highly active and stable in chemical and photochemical water oxidation, and in addition function as photoanodes, with photo&#8208;electrocatalytic currents (&#8764;2.00 x 10&#8722;3 Acm&#8722;2 at&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at pH&#160;=&#160;1. The possibility of a unique catalytic mechanism where O&#9472;O bond formation is possible from the coupling of two adjacent FeIV&#160;=&#160;O fragments was demonstrated by DFT analysis. Thus, Fe&#8208;triazolate MOF has been established as a new, stable, scalable, versatile, and efficient platform for sustainable energy conversion in the realm of artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Correlated Luminescence Enabled by Bright&#8211;Dark Radical Pairing in a Diradical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric luminescent diradical comprising a non&#8208;luminescent (dark) radical and a luminescent (bright) radical was designed. The dark radical significantly modulates the photoluminescence (PL) of the bright radical, yielding a unique three&#8208;stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response across distinct low&#8208;temperature magnetic field regimes: hyperfine coupling (HFC) (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), &#916;g&#8208;induced spin mixing (0.05&#8211;0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8&#8211;7 T).








Abstract
Spin&#8208;optical modulation lies at the core of emerging technologies in spintronics, spin&#8208;based optoelectronics, and quantum materials. Open&#8208;shell luminescent diradicals, featuring two unpaired and synthetically tunable spins, offer a molecular platform to achieve such control. However, previous studies have been restricted to symmetric systems, where spin interactions occur between two identical, luminescent radicals. Here, we demonstrate that a non&#8208;luminescent (dark) radical can effectively modulate the spin and photophysical behavior of a luminescent (bright) radical within an asymmetric diradical framework. The resulting molecule exhibits a unique three&#8208;stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response at low temperatures, arising from hyperfine coupling (HFC) (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), the &#916;g&#8208;induced spin mixing (0.05&#8211;0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8&#8211;7 T). Notably, the system exhibits pronounced ML enhancement (&gt;14%) under ultra&#8208;low magnetic fields (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), a previously unreported phenomenon in molecular spin&#8208;optical systems. These findings establish asymmetric bright&#8211;dark diradicals as a powerful new motif for spin&#8208;photon interface design, providing fresh insights into the fundamental photophysics of open&#8208;shell systems.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Diversified Biisoquinoline&#8208;Containing Polymers by Multicomponent C&#9472;H Activation/Annulation Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient multicomponent C&#9472;H activation/annulation polymerization was established for the in situ synthesis of diversified biisoquinoline&#8208;containing polymers (BCPs). The obtained BCPs possess good solution processability, film&#8208;forming ability, and tunable luminescent properties, and can be applied to fluorescent photopatterns. By using chiral rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP&#8211;metal complex are prepared.








Abstract
Biisoquinoline scaffolds with unique photophysical properties and latent axial chirality have received considerable attention in medical chemistry, asymmetric catalysis, and materials science. However, limited by the large synthetic difficulties, functional biisoquinoline&#8208;containing polymers (BCPs) have rarely been reported. Furthermore, the construction of optically active BCPs via asymmetric catalytic polymerization have not been achieved so far. Herein, we developed a multicomponent cascade C&#9472;H activation/annulation polymerization (CAAP) strategy that can facilely convert readily available benzil derivatives, internal diynes, and ammonium acetate into structurally diverse BCPs via successive C&#9472;H activation and N&#8208;annulation processes in a one&#8208;pot and one&#8208;step operation. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed CAAP reactions proceed efficiently under air, affording a variety of multisubstituted BCPs with high molecular weights (Mw up to 49900&#160;g mol&#8722;1) in good yields. Benefiting from the unique structures, the resulting BCPs exhibit excellent solubility, good film&#8208;forming capability, and readily tunable luminescent properties. The luminescent thin films of a photosensitive BCP can be applied for the generation of multiscale fluorescent photopatterns with high resolution. Moreover, by using different chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP&#8211;metal complex with stable axially chiral configurations are in situ generated from the asymmetric CAAP reactions.

The ultramicroporous pores of TUB41 selectively host water and CO2 molecules at distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments without competition. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the thermal and chemical stability, and the gas adsorption behavior, of a mixed&#8208;linker phosphonate MOF, [Cu(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)0.5(1,4&#8208;NDPAH2)], namely TUB41 (where bpy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine and NDPAH4&#160;=&#160;naphthalenediphosphonic acid). TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1&#8211;11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80&#160;&#176;C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO2 and H2O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO2 at a loading 0.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 and H2O at a loading of 0.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 are &#8722;41 and &#8722;38&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H2O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean&#8208;squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO2 reduction under challenging conditions.

         <title>Continuous Flow Electrochemistry Unlocks Broadly Applicable Arene C&#9472;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical C&#8211;H amination strategy enables efficient and scalable synthesis of (hetero)arylamines from electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arenes via a pyridination&#8211;aminolysis sequence. The method avoids strong oxidants and metal catalysts, delivering over 100 grams of product with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance.








Abstract
The direct C&#9472;H amination of arenes is a powerful strategy for synthesizing arylamines, yet existing methods often suffer from limited substrate scope, poor selectivity, or scalability issues, particularly for electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Here, we introduce a continuous flow electrochemical C&#9472;H amination via a pyridination&#8208;aminolysis sequence, enabling the efficient functionalization of arenes with diverse electronic properties. The method operates under continuous flow electrochemical conditions, avoiding the need for divided cells, strong chemical oxidants, or homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The broad substrate scope includes a wide range of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and halogenated arenes, as well as heterocycles, demonstrating excellent functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the process is readily scalable, as shown by a 4&#8208;day continuous operation in parallel microreactors, producing over 100 grams of aniline product with high efficiency. This study highlights the potential of continuous&#8208;flow electrochemistry as a versatile and practical platform for sustainable C&#9472;H functionalization in organic synthesis.

         <title>A Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;type Organic Molecule as an Effective Electrode to Form Rapid Diffusion Pathway for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A poorly soluble organic molecule, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI&#8208;DTMA), with a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, has been demonstrated to be an efficient anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries with fast Na+ transport kinetics. This has led to a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after stable 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing organic electrodes have been widely considered as ideal substitutes for traditional inorganic compounds in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent redox reversibility and structural tunability. However, constructing effective Na+ diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI&#8208;DTMA), containing a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure. The D&#8211;A&#8211;D architecture significantly enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI&#8208;DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for&#160;Na+ mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI&#8208;DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 owing&#160;to its fast Na+ kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI&#8208;DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.

         <title>Paired Pulse Electrocatalytic Conversion of Phenol for Co&#8208;Production of Cyclohexanol and Para&#8208;Benzoquinone</title>

         <dc:description>
The proposed paired pulse system achieves the selective conversion of phenol in wastewater for co&#8208;production of valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone, with an unexpected Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of organic pollutants in wastewater into value&#8208;added chemicals presents a dual solution for water treatment and sustainable synthesis, yet achieving high Faradaic and energy efficiencies remains challenging. Here we, for the first time, report the paired electrolysis strategy to produce valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) simultaneously from phenol in wastewater. More importantly, to address the dilemma of mismatched operation conditions between cathodic hydrogenation and anodic oxidation, we propose a pulse current strategy with alternating high&#8208;/low&#8208;current periods, which ensures the reduction kinetics of phenol at the cathode while effectively preventing the over&#8208;oxidation of generated p&#8208;BQ at the anode. By using tailored PdRu/C and NiRu/C as the cathode and anode, the paired pulse system realizes 84.9% phenol conversion and 83.9% cyclohexanol yield at the cathode, alongside 100% phenol conversion and 68.5% p&#8208;BQ yield at the anode, with an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1. Carbon emission accounting and techno&#8208;economic analysis highlight its environmental benefits and economic feasibility (US$1.36 profit per kg phenol). This work offers a green and efficient route for environmental remediation and resource recovery.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Polyoxometalate Supramolecular Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable Water Oxidation</title>

Three self&#8208;assembled polyoxometalate superstructures with ultrathin graphene&#8208;like morphologies exhibit enhanced conductivity and increased exposure of activity sites, leading to a significant improvement in catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Superstructures assembled from nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs) attract considerable interest due to their well&#8208;defined architectures and outstanding physicochemical properties. However, the targeted synthesis of self&#8208;assembled POM&#8208;based superstructures with high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of three POM&#8208;based superstructures with ultrathin graphene&#8208;like morphologies and well&#8208;organized frameworks via a simple self&#8208;assembled method, in which transition metals (TMs) bridge POMs into graphene&#8208;like planes, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) serves as an intercalation agent, endowing the structures with high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Among the resulting materials (denote as POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;TM, TM&#9552;Co, Ni, or Cu), POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a low overpotential of 292&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations underscore that the Co atoms within the POM serve as active sites and facilitate the rate&#8208;determining step of *OOH formation. Moreover, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer employing POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;Co as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates exceptional performance, delivering a current density of 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 2.247&#160;V, along with remarkable durability exceeding 2000&#160;h at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study develops a simple and efficient method for synthesizing supramolecular POM&#8208;based nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>De Novo Designed &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Peptides Mimicking the Copper&#8208;Binding Histidine Brace Motif of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the copper&#8208;binding histidine brace (His&#8208;brace) motif found in lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) enzymes was engineered in de novo designed peptides that fold as &#946;&#8208;hairpins (HisPins). Cu&#8208;HisPins complexes showed LPMO&#8208;like activity, including light&#8208;stimulated melanin&#8208;mediated oxidative cellulose degradation. Hence, they represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on folded peptide scaffolds.








Abstract
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu&#8208;containing enzymes that play a crucial role in lignocellulosic biomass degradation for use in biofuel production. These enzymes carry out the selective oxidation of C&#9472;H bonds in the sugar units, leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Creating LPMO mimics facilitates the study of the mechanism of action, the characterisation of the reactive species responsible for the C&#9472;H bond activation and the potential scale up for industrial application. Here, we report the design, structural and functional characterisation of two novel Cu&#8208;binding &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptides, called HisPins, that mimic the Histidine&#8208;brace site of LPMOs. Activity assays were conducted with p&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside (PNPG) and demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;HisPins show LPMO&#8208;like activity on the model substrate. Furthermore, the Cu&#8208;HisPins can also perform light&#8208;driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes. Hence, the Cu&#8208;HisPins represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on short, folded peptide sequences and show a light&#8208;stimulated melanin&#8208;mediated oxidative activity, which is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far. Thus, this work paves the way to further exploration of LPMO mechanism, structure&#8208;activity relationship and substrate scope expansion.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Cleavage of C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C Bonds in Lignin Linkages by Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models was achieved by taking advantage of the unique and strong alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, yielding value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals.








Abstract
Bulk water serves as an inert environment for lignin linkages, resulting in their natural half&#8208;lives that extend over centuries. In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals. The &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages, the most abundant interunit linkages in natural lignin, were selectively cleaved at C&#946;&#9472;O bonds, producing phenols in yields exceeding 70%. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages is derived from the unique alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, even in the absence of extra alkalis. The challenging cleavage of the highly stable C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bonds in &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 and &#946;&#8208;1 lignin linkages was also accomplished, yielding valuable benzoic acid product. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidation of the substrates by molecular oxygen is the key step for the C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage. Notably, all intermediates, including the fragile peroxide intermediates, were identified using mass spectrometry. Accompanied by evidence from radical scavenging and 18O labeling, the mechanisms for the selective C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavages have been unambiguously characterized, paving a new and green way for the cleavage of lignin linkages.

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Coupling to Form &#946;2,2,3&#8208;Amino Acid Esters by Synergistic Chiral Phosphoric Acid and Photocatalysis</title>

A mild, modular approach is described for the stereocontrolled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acid esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acids&#8212;characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter&#8212;represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical&#8208;radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, &#946;&#8208;keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox&#8208;active NHPI esters derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids are reduced via SET to form &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross&#8208;coupling to afford &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Extending the Chemistry of Scheelite&#8208;type Oxides with Borates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the first successful isolation of [BO2F2] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO2F2] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO2F2&#8212;the first borate compound adopting a scheelite&#8208;type structure.








Abstract
Scheelite&#8208;type oxides have been extensively investigated in diverse inorganic systems due to their exceptional structural versatility and promising multifunctional properties, ranging from luminescence to ionic conduction. However, despite decades of research, borates have remained conspicuously absent from this important structural family. This exclusion stems from a fundamental synthetic and structure chemistry challenge: the difficulty in achieving the essential zero&#8208;dimensional anionic framework composed of isolated tetrahedral units, a defining characteristic of scheelite&#8208;type materials. In this work, we break this long&#8208;standing barrier by reporting the first successful isolation of [BO2F2] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This breakthrough was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO2F2] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO2F2&#8212;the first borate compound adopting a scheelite&#8208;type structure. Through a combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first&#8208;principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite&#8208;type framework of SbBO2F2 and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence. This work not only expands the structural chemistry of scheelite&#8208;type oxides with borates but also opens new avenues for designing multifunctional materials through targeted anionic group isolation.

         <title>Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis via CO2&#8208;Recyclable Hydrogen Donation on Pb/Pb7Bi3 Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2&#8208;assisted Pb/Pb7Bi3 catalytic system enables efficient and selective electrochemical glycine synthesis from oxalic acid and nitrogen sources. The PbBi&#8208;II catalyst achieves a high glycine Faradaic efficiency of 91.8% via a cyclic hydrogen&#8208;donation pathway and maintains stable performance over 120 h, highlighting the effectiveness of heterointerface engineering and CO2 co&#8208;catalysis in facilitating C&#9472;N bond formation.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a sustainable platform in constructing C&#9472;N bonds for amino acid production. Glycine, a particularly valuable target compound, continues to experience escalating global demand, yet achieving simultaneous high efficiency and operational stability remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a CO2&#8208;mediated strategy for glycine electrosynthesis using oxalic acid and N2/nitrate as feedstocks. By using Pb/Pb7Bi3&#8208;CO2 catalytic system, a very high glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.8% with durable stability over 120 h could be achieved. Moreover, when using nonthermal plasma&#8208;activated N2 as the nitrogen source, the glycine production rate could maintain at 94.4&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with N&#8208;selectivity as high as 93.2%. Mechanistic investigations combining experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that CO2 undergoes facile protonation on the Pb/Pb7Bi3 heterointerfaces to form *OCOH intermediate, which donates hydrogen for the reduction of oxalic acid and nitrate into glyoxylic acid and NH2OH, respectively, while CO2 is simultaneously regenerated. Notably, hydrogenation via the *OCOH intermediate significantly lowers the energy barriers compared to direct protonation, thereby promoting the subsequent spontaneous C&#9472;N bond formation and enabling highly efficient electrosynthesis of glycine.

         <title>Cage Engineering in Anion&#8208;Pillared MOFs for Benchmark One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Cage engineering of anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) affords a dual cage framework material ZNU&#8208;27 with excellent recognition ability for both C2H2 and CO2, enabling the challenging one&#8208;step acquisition of high&#8208;purity C2H4 from C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures.








Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of ethylene (C2H4) from the ternary mixtures of acetylene/carbon dioxide/ethylene (C2H2/CO2/C2H4) is a critical industrial challenge due to their similar physical and chemical properties. Herein, we reported a cage engineering strategy in anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) for efficient C2H2 and CO2 capture simultaneously. Specifically, two stable ZrF62&#8722; anion&#8208;pillared cage&#8208;type MOFs (ZNU&#8208;17 and ZNU&#8208;27) are prepared with both ultramicroporous (&#8764;4&#160;&#197;) and microporous (&gt;7&#160;&#197;) cages but featuring different shapes. While ZNU&#8208;17 allows the efficient binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, ZNU&#8208;27 enables the benchmark ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 separation by increasing the adsorption affinity toward CO2. Notably, remarkably increased C2H2 (170.1&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;versus 120.1 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and CO2 (91.8&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;versus 64.5 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) adsorption capacities are achieved in ZNU&#8208;27, and the IAST selectivity of ZNU&#8208;27 for CO2/C2H4 is 4.3 times as high as that of ZNU&#8208;17 (6.5&#160;versus 1.5). The C2H2, CO2 and C2H4 binding sites in ZNU&#8208;27 are studied by gas loaded in situ single crystal structure and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which revealed that the unique fluorinated 8.5&#160;&#197; spherical cages provide strong hydrogen binding or electrostatic interactions for C2H2 and CO2. Dynamic breakthrough tests show that from a C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90) mixture, polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&#8805;99.99%) can be obtained in ZNU&#8208;27 with a high productivity of 12.04&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Preparation of Degradable Polymers Containing Tunable Ratios of Dithioacetals and Disulfides via Mixed Mode Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the preparation of redox degradable polymers containing tunable ratios of dithioacetals and disulfides via a one&#8208;pot mixed&#8208;mode reaction. The amount of dithioacetals is able to be increased by adding more of the methylene source.








Abstract
Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di&#8208;SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox&#8208;enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from &lt;1&#160;kDa to 16&#160;kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation.

     alt="Preparation of Degradable Polymers Containing Tunable Ratios of Dithioacetals and Disulfides via Mixed Mode Polymerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work describes the preparation of redox degradable polymers containing tunable ratios of dithioacetals and disulfides via a one-pot mixed-mode reaction. The amount of dithioacetals is able to be increased by adding more of the methylene source.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di-SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox-enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from &amp;lt;1&#160;kDa to 16&#160;kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di-SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Natural Redox Cofactor Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) Enables Photocatalytic Radical Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural alcohol and sugar dehydrogenases that utilize the redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) can be repurposed for enantioselective photoredox catalysis. Upon blue&#8208;light irradiation, redox&#8208;neutral radical cyclizations are catalyzed. This work adds a new class of enzymes to the toolbox of photobiocatalysis.








Abstract
Photoenzymatic catalysis facilitates stereoselective new&#8208;to&#8208;nature chemistry under mild conditions. In addition to the rational design of artificial photoenzymes, naturally occurring redox enzymes can be repurposed to promote photoredox catalysis in the chiral protein environment. Here, we show that enzymes utilizing the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor expand the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. PQQ absorbs visible light and is capable of single&#8208;electron transfer. It thus exhibits mechanistic similarities to flavin cofactors, which are widely used for photoenzymatic approaches. First, we established the trimethyl ester PQQMe3 as a stand&#8208;alone photoredox catalyst in pure organic solvent. Upon excitation, PQQMe3 enables the redox&#8208;neutral radical cyclization of an N&#8208;(bromoalkyl)&#8208;substituted indole. We then tested a panel of PQQ&#8208;dependent sugar and alcohol dehydrogenases for photoenzymatic catalysis in aqueous buffer, focusing on a redox&#8208;neutral radical reaction to form oxindoles. Under optimized reaction conditions, we obtained a 69% yield and an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio. Our work thus demonstrates that PQQ enzymes are capable of stereoselective photoredox catalysis. Future enzyme engineering efforts based on computational modeling and directed evolution will fully unlock their synthetic potential.

         <title>Engineering Anion&#8208;Diluent Matrix for Ion&#8208;Decoupled Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes toward Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a unique anion&#8208;diluent matrix (ADM) formed by amphiphilic zinc salt and diluent is proposed. The locally concentrated Zn2+ and de&#8208;anionized Zn2+ solvation structure reduce ionic transport barriers, yielding a high transference number (0.72). The electrolyte spontaneously segregates into biphasic H2O&#8208;rich/poor nanodomains that disrupt continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, restricting proton&#8208;hopping, and mitigating parasitic reactions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries suffer from electrolyte&#8208;induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation&#8211;anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion&#8208;decoupled LHCE (ID&#8208;LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1&#8208;propanol (TFP) as anion&#8208;affinity diluent. The TFP&#8208;mediated anion&#8208;diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF&#8722; from Zn2+ solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn2+&#8208;enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn2+ transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H2O&#8208;rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water&#8208;deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF&#8722; coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF2&#8208;ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level pouch cells (1.04&#160;Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.

         <title>Ultrafast Construct Local Acidic Microenvironment of Boron&#8208;Intercalated Osmium with Anti&#8208;Precipitation and Corrosion&#8208;Resistant for Seawater&#8208;splitting</title>

         <dc:description>
The interstitial boron in B&#8208;Os catalysts exhibit lower overpotential and superior stability compared with commercial Pt/C. Experimentally, the electron&#8208;rich Os can effectively inhibit precipitation formation and chloride corrosion in natural seawater environment, which is highly consistent with theoretical calculations and experimental observations. In addition, the catalyst also demonstrates outstanding performance in anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, which shows excellent prospects for commercial applications.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis represents a promising avenue for hydrogen production, nevertheless, the Cl&#8722; corrosion and surface deposition of Ca(OH)2/Mg(OH)2 hinder its practical application by deactivation. Herein, an interstitial boron doped osmium (B&#8208;Os) is ultrafast (10&#160;s) constructed by microwave quasi&#8208;solid approach, where theoretical and experimental analysis proves that the interstitial boron triggers electron enrichment at the Os site and the formation of negative charge centers. The modified electronic structure electrostatically inhibits Cl&#8722; corrosion as well as promotes H3O+ adsorption, creating a local acidic microenvironment in the natural seawater, neutralizing OH&#8722; and effectively avoiding Ca2+/Mg2+ deposition. In situ spectroscopy and local pH monitoring confirm the pivotal role of the microenvironment in regulating reaction kinetics and stability. Therefore, B&#8208;Os exhibits a remarkably low overpotential, for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), of 7 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater, while maintaining stable performance over 400 h of stable operation in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C. Economic evaluation highlights its hydrogen production costs ($0.81 GGE&#8722;1) undercutting the U.S. DOE target.
