         <title>A Bioinspired Diazafluorenone Catalytic System for Aerobic Oxidative Deamination of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper amine oxidases catalyzed aerobic oxidation of primary amines into carbonyl compounds is an important biological process, as well as a useful transformation for organic synthesis. A new bioinspired organocatalyst, 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), has been discovered, which exhibits impressive characteristics including simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity, enabling it to effectively mimic the function of copper amine oxidases. Oxidative deamination of &#945;&#8208;amino amides presents an attractive approach to access &#945;&#8208;keto amides, however, it is difficult to achieve due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric effect. The diazafluorenone displays high catalytic activity in this transformation, producing various biologically significant &#945;&#8208;keto amides in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the diazafluorenone catalyst is able to promote direct oxidation of benzylamines into aromatic aldehydes, instead of the generally formed product&#8208;reactant imines, which leads to not greater than 50% yields of the desired aldehydes. The current aerobic oxidative deamination proceeds via a pathway similar to the biological process, involving transamination, hydrolysis/aminolysis, and aerobic oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Selection of Ribofuranose&#8208;Isomer Among Pentoses by Phosphorylation with Diamidophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique structure&#8208;function relationship of the ribofuranose&#8208;ring in RNA has inspired various chemical pathways to select for the ribofuranose form (over the ribopyranose form), especially in a prebiotic context. Herein we show that the reaction of diamidophosphate (DAP) with the four pentoses &#8208; ribose, arabinose, xylose and lyxose &#8208; naturally selects the ribofuranose form more efficiently when compared to the other three pentoses. All four pentoses form the initial diamidophosphate&#8208;adduct &#8211; however, ribose undergoes rapid conversion to ribofuranose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while the other three pentoses show significant accumulation of the initially formed DAP&#8208;adducts and slow conversion to the cyclicphosphate products. Arabinose and xylose show a distribution between furanose&#8208;, and pyranose&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while lyxose forms the furanose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and &#8208;pyranose&#8208;2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products. This trend is also manifested when starting from a mixture of pentoses where ribofuranose 1,2&#8208;amidocyclicphosphate dominates the product distribution. Such selection for ribofuranose among pentoses by phosphorylation (a) provides another venue of how a ribofuranose&#8208;structure can selectively emerge through abiotic chemical reaction suitable for elaboration towards RNA and (b) adds to the body of experimental work addressing the chemical origin of RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Unbound in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript we report the first demonstration of controlled helicity in extended graphene nanoribbons. We present a wealth of new graphene nanoribbons that are a direct consequence of the high yielding and robust synthetic method revealed in this study. We created a series of defect&#8208;free, ultralong, chiral cove&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons where helical twisting of the graphene nanoribbon backbone is tuned through functionalization with chiral side chains. S&#8208;configured point chiral centers in the side chains transfer their chiral information to induce a helically chiral, right&#8208;handed twist in the graphene nanoribbon. As the backbone is extended, these helically twisted graphene nanoribbons exhibit a substantial increase in their circular dichroic response. The longest variant synthesized consists of an average of 268 linearly fused rings, reaching 65 nm in average length with nearly 10 full end&#8208;to&#8208;end helical rotations. The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&#949;| value of 6780 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 550 nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A 'Cocktail' Fluorescent Probe for Multi&#8208;ROS Imaging Unveils Ferroptosis&#8208;Driven Liver Fibrosis Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liver fibrosis is a pathological repair response triggered by chronic liver injury. Without treatment, it may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma, contributing to high mortality rates. To date, no approved therapies specifically target advanced liver fibrosis, thus exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis has become crucial. Previous studies have highlighted significant controversy regarding the role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis. Given that ROS serve as key mediators in both ferroptosis and liver fibrosis, ROS may serve as a molecular nexus connecting ferroptosis and liver fibrosis. To comprehensively elucidate the molecular network involving ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, we designed and synthesized the first multi&#8208;functional 'cocktail' fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, enabling highly sensitive and selective simultaneous imaging of O2&#8226;&#8211;, H2O2 and ONOO&#8722;. FP&#8208;ROS was successfully employed to assess ferroptosis levels in the livers of fibrosis mice following drug intervention. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we elucidated the signaling pathway NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a critical role in HSCs activation and further elucidates the molecular interplay between ROS and ferroptosis in fibrosis progression. These findings provide novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for liver fibrosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin PtSe2 Nanowires in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum selenide (PtSe2) has shown great potential for application in electrocatalysis. One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures are particularly advantageous for enhancing catalytic performance, as they expose abundant active sites at the edges and enable rapid charge transport. However, the synthesis of 1D PtSe2 nanostructures for efficient electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of ultrathin (0.4&#8208;2.0 nm) PtSe2 nanowires (NWs) using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a confined template via direct selenization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The atom&#8208;resolved electron microscope combined with spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, possessing zigzag edges and higher thermodynamical stability. Owing to the rich&#8208;edges with abundant unsaturated Pt atoms, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at an extremely low Pt loading of 4.684 wt%, with an overpotential of 47 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7 mV dec&#8208;1. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing 1D ultrathin NWs and offers the potential to achieve low&#8208;cost and efficient Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of N&#8208;monofluoromethyl Compounds from N&#8208;monofluoromethyl Carbamoyl/Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The distinctive chemical properties of fluorine atoms have enabled fluorine&#8208;containing compounds to make significant strides in the pharmaceutical and materials fields. However, due to the very limited synthetic methods, the enormous potential of N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds has not yet been unlocked. In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N&#8208;CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N&#8208;CH2F carbamoyl fluorides. Additionally, the reactivity of fluorine atoms located at different positions of the two building blocks toward nucleophilic substitution was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.</dc:description>

In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N-monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N-CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N-CH2F carbamoyl fluorides. Additionally, the reactivity of fluorine atoms located at different positions of the two building blocks toward nucleophilic substitution was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sila&#8208;Cycloaddition of Dichlorodisilanes: Selective Si&#8211;Cl Activation for Cyclic Disilanes and Enantioenriched Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disilanyl architectures holds significant value across diverse fields, particularly in the development of advanced materials. However, their limited accessibility has hindered broader exploration. Herein, we report a catalytic strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic disilanes through a [4+2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. This transformation proceeds under mild, reductive nickel catalysis via an unusual Si&#8211;Cl bond activation pathway and accommodates a broad range of dienes, including bulk feedstocks, cyclic, multi&#8208;substituted, aliphatic, aromatic dienes, and trienes. An asymmetric variant further enables the efficient construction of chiral disilane frameworks with high enantioselectivity. The resulting disilacarbocycle adopts boat&#8208;like conformations, as revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis, due to the elongated Si&#8211;Si and Si&#8211;C bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that a triplet Ni0 species engages in an SN2&#8208;type oxidative addition to the Si&#8211;Cl bond, favoring this pathway over a concerted Si&#8211;Si activation. The resulting Si&#8211;Ni(I) intermediates are energetically preferred over Si&#8211;Ni(II) analogs in the subsequent diene insertion step.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;&#173;&#173;Photosensitizer Repositioning Affords an Enantiocomplementary Enzyme for [2+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of genetic code expansion and directed evolution has recently given rise to enantioselective photoenzymes for [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of quinolone and indole derivatives. However, the enzymes reported to date only allow access to one enantiomeric series of the strained cyclobutane products. Here, guided by a crystal structure of our previously engineered enzyme EnT1.3, we show how judicious repositioning of the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer affords an enantiocomplementary [2+2]&#8208;cyclase, CEnT1.0. Following directed evolution, a proficient and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoenzyme (CEnT1.4) emerged that promotes [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of a quinolone derivative with exquisite enantiocontrol (99% e.e.) and substantially enhanced regioselectivity compared with EnT1.3 (r.r. 62:1 vs 9:1). Structural analysis of CEnT1.4, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, reveal a well&#8208;sculpted active site pocket that pre&#8208;organises the substrate for regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalysis. This study highlights the versatility offered by genetically programmed (photo)catalytic elements when developing enzymes for altered stereochemical outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multivalent Targeting Strategy for Developing Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Activated Tumor&#8208;Seeking Probe to Guide Precise Surgical Resection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical molecular imaging with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes provides a promising strategy for the visual detection of tumor tissues. However, conventional molecular probes often suffer from poor targeting specificity and low signal contrast during tumor detection. In this work, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe (termed MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2) based on a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. A bivalent biotin targeting ligand was bonded to an ROS&#8208;responsive molecular scaffold to maximize receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, resulting in significantly stronger tumor affinity and selectivity of the probe. The optical signal of the proposed probe was initially masked and could be selectively activated by overexpressed ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment. This activation led to the specific release of the clinical dye methylene blue (MB), offering high&#8208;contrast NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging signals for precise tumor visualization. MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2 demonstrated strong tumor selectivity, enabling the detection of tumors in different mice models, including accurate identification of small tumors (~3 mm). Consequently, the probe could delineate tumor boundaries during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery, significantly reducing postoperative tumor recurrence.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3.8V Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery Enabled by a Conjugated Ladder Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable batteries based on non&#8208;metal charge carriers like NH4+ recently have attracted intensive attention due to high safety, environmental friendliness, low cost and fast kinetics. However, NH4+ electrolytes suffer from a narrow electrochemical potential window, making it challenging to construct high&#8208;voltage and energy&#8208;dense devices. Here we report a quaternary ammonium (NR4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) working at a high voltage of 3.8V, which was enabled by a conjugated ladder polymer poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) anode for NR4+ storage and a graphite cathode for anion uptake. The BBL functions as an efficient NR4+ host by carbonyl/enol transformation, delivering a high capacity of 120 mAh/g, low average potential, high stability and excellent rate performance. In the redox process, the electronic and ionic conductivities of BBL change periodically, accompanied with the formation of radical anion (&#9679;&#8722;) and diradical dianion (2&#9679;&#8722;). In combination with an anion&#8208;intercalation graphite cathode, the assembled graphite//BBL DIB exhibits a maximum energy/power density up to 232 Wh/kg and 6865 W/kg based on mass of graphite, superior rate performance and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of NR4+ as cation carrier and its efficient host, which will inspire novel design for high&#8208;performance non&#8208;metallic energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>New Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Based on Covalent Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the applications of molecular cages hinge on their properties, understanding the true nature of the cage structures is imperative. Single&#8208;molecule conductance technique offered a unique opportunity to explore the property of an individual cage structure, yet the undefined cage&#8208;electrode connection remains challenging. Herein, we designed a new single&#8208;molecule junction based on covalent organic cages with sulfur atoms on the edges as defined anchor groups. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method, the single&#8208;molecule conductance was found at 10&#8208;3.5 G&#8320;, indicating the formation of a stable junction by the cage. The investigation combining control structures and theoretical studies, confirmed that the conductance signal originates from the connection between gold electrodes and sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups. This well&#8208;defined connection allowed us to analyze electron transport within the cage structure, providing new insights into the property investigation of functional cages.</dc:description>

         <title>From Corrosion to Creation: Interfacial De&#8208;electronation Drives Hydrogenation&#8208;Energy Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal corrosion, conventionally perceived as a destructive phenomenon driven by de&#8208;electronation, imposes significant economic burdens and safety hazards. To repurpose corrosion into a valuable resource, we demonstrate a macroscopic corrosion battery concept that harnesses galvanic corrosion to drive the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals and energy generation, challenging conventional corrosion mitigation paradigms. By spatially segregating corrosion process, the system couples anodic metal de&#8208;electronation with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) deposition, while integrating diverse cathodic reactions including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction, electrocatalytic hydrogenation, and hydrogen peroxide reduction with remarkable accelerated kinetics. The prototype system demonstrates concurrent production of p&#8208;aminophenol (14.3 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1) and zinc oxalate (86.9 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1) while generating 34.2 mW cm&#8208;2 of electrical power. Techno&#8208;economic analysis establishes the inaugural empirical validation of economic feasibility for corrosion&#8208;driven energy&#8208;matter symbiosis, highlighting its high gross profit. Transcending conventional corrosion engineering boundaries for inorganic synthesis, this methodology mechanistically deciphers MOF growth kinetics and advanced system design. By broadening the scope of corrosion utilization, this work enables a paradigm shift from damage mitigation to value creation, providing a blueprint for sustainable chemical&#8208;energy ecosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Power of Dark State Photocages: An Efficient Pathway to Triplet State under Near&#8208;Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocage platform provides a synergistic approach to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Before light activation, both pro&#8208;photosensitizers and pro&#8208;drugs remain inert, ensuring safety. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, they undergo photoactivation and controlled release in deep tissues. However, the low photolysis efficiency of conventional singlet&#8208;state photocages limits their in vivo applications, necessitating an exploration of how excited&#8208;state dynamics influence photolysis. In this study, we introduce the concept of a "dark state photocage" and establish a photocage platform responsive to NIR light by incorporating phenoxazine or phenothiazine groups. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the dark state enhances triplet&#8208;state formation and facilitates intersystem crossing, thereby promoting photolysis. These photocages achieve functional molecule release under low&#8208;power NIR light (15 mW&#183;cm&#8315;&#178;), with an efficiency of up to 90%. This advancement enables a sharp transition from an "OFF" to an "ON" tumor imaging signal and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer under NIR light irradiation, effectively integrating PDT and chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Acrylamide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via Mannich Polymerization for Efficient Gold Recovery from Complex E&#8208;waste Leachates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving both high stability and selectivity remains a critical challenge in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient gold recovery. Herein, we present a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization involving 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene, Meldrum&#8217;s acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide&#8208;linked COFs (Tb&#8208;PD&#8208;M, Tb&#8208;ND&#8208;M, and Tb&#8208;AD&#8208;M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C=O and N&#8208;H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au3+ binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, Tb&#8208;AD&#8208;M achieves 98.5% selective Au3+ recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Differentiation of Homologous Anisodimensional Frameworks Driven by Site&#8208;Selective Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretically, distinguished from the dimensional isomers in reticular chemistry, structures with different dimensions can also be formed by site&#8208;selective polymerization using identical building blocks bearing a high density of reactive sites. Unfortunately, the spatial confinement imposes significant challenges for molecular building blocks to achieve dimensional differentiation via their intrinsic site&#8208;selective reactivity. In this work, we first report the dimensional transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) driven by site&#8208;selective polymerization of identical molecular building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. This unique phenomenon was demonstrated for the first time to originate from the role of aniline in enhancing the reversibility of the reaction system and modulating the conformational flexibility of the monomers. We systematically elucidated the mechanism underlying this dimensional transformation and successfully demonstrated the generality of the synthetic strategy. Moreover, the residual benzaldehyde in the frameworks generated via the site&#8208;selective polymerization of the building blocks can serve as exciton acceptors, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work not only offers a novel strategy for regulating the dimensionality of COFs, but also provides a valuable reference for precisely controlling the conformational flexibility of building blocks to enable topological transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Macrocycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Strategy for Interchangeable Screwdriver&#8208;Like On&#8208;Demand Post&#8208;Functionalization of Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through post&#8208;functionalization constitutes one of the most important approaches to applications, but is frequently plagued by limited reaction types, tedious synthesis of different precursors, and time&#8208;consuming screening of synthetic parameters for COFs. Moreover, their functions are difficult to change once the functionalities are covalently attached to COF skeletons. Herein, we report a macrocycle&#8208;based supramolecular strategy for variable noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform like an interchangeable screwdriver. As a proof of concept, pillar[5]arene (P5A) with electron&#8208;rich cavity is incorporated into COF as macrocycle host to anchor different electron&#8208;deficient guests of various functions. Such a design allows tunable post&#8208;functionalization of COF through host&#8208;guest interactions for customized utilities, which has been demonstrated by using a series of guests including organic salts for iodine capture and cyano&#8208;based ligands for metal ion separation. Removing the guests enables recycling of COF, consecutive reinstallation of different guests, and continuous use for implementing expected tasks. This work establishes a general noncovalent approach to on&#8208;demand interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Cyanogen Vacancies in Prussian Blue for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue (PB), recognized as a promising cathode material, has gained significant attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost, and ease of synthesis. However, the influence of anion vacancies on the stability of the PB framework remains controversy, impeding a comprehensive grasp of their precise role in electrochemical performance and the controlled synthesis of PB with smaller unitary anionic vacancies remains challenging because of the limitations inherent in current synthesis strategy. Herein, we present an anion complexation method to synthesize PB materials with modulable cyanogen vacancy contents. Furthermore, we propose a vacancy&#8208;driven mechanism that promotes spin transitions coupled with lattice bending, which is more reversible at low&#8208;spin Fe sites, leading to excellent low&#8208;spin stability and the design of materials with outstanding electrochemical performance. This anion complexation method not only provides a novel synthetic pathway for PB materials but also advances the understanding of the composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships between cyanogen vacancy structures and spin transition mechanism, highlighting its potential for future energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Closed&#8208;loop Recycling of Polyester Waste using Reconstructed Defective&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical recycling of polyester waste presents a promising strategy for achieving a sustainable circular economy. However, the development of efficient, low&#8208;cost recycling methods that minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions remains challenging. Here, we report an approach for depolymerization polyester waste to bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) using a reconstructed metal&#8208;organic framework (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) catalyst under mild conditions. The r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT exhibited a space&#8208;time yield of 1035.8 gBHET gcat&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 at 190 &#186;C. Importantly, this is an order of magnitude higher than that reported for similar MOF&#8208;based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the depolymerization pathway involves the activation of oxygen and ethylene glycol adsorbed on r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT, forming nucleophilic intermediates. These intermediates then facilitate the cleavage of polyester C&#8211;O bond through nucleophilic attack, thereby gradually generating the BHET product. Sustainability evaluation results validated the circular economy feasibility of the recycling approach, with a minimum sales price (MSP) of 498 $/ton, much lower than the MSP of the traditional petroleum&#8208;based production route (1,000 $/ton). The approach also achieved a 61% reduction in energy use and a 52% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This work provides a sustainable solution for managing polyester waste accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Topochemical Polymerization of Retro&#8208;Isomeric Peptides for Tuning the Polymer Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidomimetic polymers containing hydrophobic amino acids and non&#8208;peptidic linkages are interesting for various applications, particularly hydrophobic coatings. We synthesized two retro&#8208;isomeric peptide monomers decorated with azide and alkyne,&#160;viz. N3&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M1) and its retro&#8208;isomer N3&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M2), for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. On heating the crystals at 100 &#176;C, both monomers underwent TAAC polymerization, yielding isomeric &#8216;difficult peptide&#8217; polymer mimics. The monomers showed stark differences in reactivity and regiochemistry of the product formed. Monomer&#160;M1&#160;yielded polymer&#160;P1&#160;having a 1:1 ratio of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linkages, and monomer&#160;M2&#160;reacted regiospecifically, giving 1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked polymer&#160;P2. We investigated the hydrophobicity of these isomeric polymers by measuring water contact angles (WCA) of surfaces coated with these polymers;&#160;P1&#160;and&#160;P2&#160;showed WCA of 120&#176; and 132&#176;, respectively. Our study demonstrates that sequence reversal is a novel approach for accessing structurally and functionally different polymers&#160;via&#160;topochemical polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;state NMR Reveals Reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cell Wall Due to a Host&#8208;Defence Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited availability of antifungal drug treatments and the rising issue of drug resistance highlight the urgent need for new antifungal drugs to combat drug&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. The host&#8208;defence peptide cathelicidin&#8208;2 has demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on azole&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus but its mechanism of action remains elusive. We applied a tailored set 1H and 13C detected solid state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments to elucidate the cell wall composition of Aspergillus fumigatus and to shed light on the mechanism of action of the peptide within the cell wall. Our results revealed that presence of the peptide affects galactosaminogalactan, an important component involved in the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis, as well as other specific polysaccharides and amino acids within the mobile cell wall domain. At longer exposure times, the peptide also influences the rigid cell wall domains by enhancing water penetration into the hydrophobic rigid cell wall domain. The findings reveal how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane and may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Seeding, Acid Stalling, and Solidifying: Time&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Nonclassical Pathways in Metal&#8211;Organic Gel Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise analysis reveals a distinct formation pathway for UiO&#8208;66(Zr) gels, starting with heterogeneous nucleation by zirconium hydrolysis nanoparticles (Zr(OH)4) and followed by rapid crosslinking of amorphous clusters into a fractal network. Unlike classical metal&#8208;organic framework crystallization, this study explains how self&#8208;generated acid inhibits coordination, stabilizing complex frameworks in gel state with high ligand deficiency. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic gels (MOGs), an innovative subset of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), feature hierarchically porous architecture and self&#8208;shaping monolithic morphologies, demonstrating them significantly potential for advanced applications in catalysis, gas storage, and energy conversion. Despite their functional versatility, the synthesis of MOGs remains empirical, as the actual formation mechanisms are largely unexplored. Here, a multiscale characterization strategy integrating time&#8208;resolved in&#8208;situ small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), Zr K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) analyses are systematically employed to elucidate the formation mechanism of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) gel. The synthetic techniques provide a multidimensional perspective: (1) At the mesoscale, self&#8208;induced heterogeneous nucleation triggers a rapid evolution from linear prenucleation clusters to a 3D fractal network governed by autocatalytic hydrolysis of Zr precursors. (2) At the atomic level, the reorganization of Zr&#8211;oxo clusters and the substitution of coordinating H2O molecules and chloride ions with terephthalate ligands over prolonged timescales are uncovered. Crucially, in&#8208;situ generated acid&#8208;mediated coordination suppression emerges as a pivotal factor preventing the conversion of MOGs into their crystalline MOF counterparts. These findings highlight a nonclassical evolution pathways distinct from classical MOF crystallization, thereby providing a mechanistic foundation for tailoring MOGs with programmable morphological and structural attributes.

         <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen&#8208;doped GNRs (chevron&#8208;GNR and chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O&#8208;doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron&#8208;GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, the band structure of O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2&#8208;hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Cryptographic Key&#8208;Based Fluorescence Encryption Enabled by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing threats of data forgery and security breaches necessitate the development of advanced encryption strategies beyond traditional cryptographic methods. Fluorescence&#8208;based encryption has emerged as a promising alternative, yet current systems suffer from low security due to simple, reversible stimuli responses. Here, we introduce a novel lock&#8208;and&#8208;key encryption system using a chiral cyclodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CDMOF), termed Zole@CDMOF (Zole = acetylated benzoimidazole), for enantioselective discrimination of phenylethylamine (PEA) enantiomers. In this framework, the confined Zole guest serves as the lock, while PEA enantiomers act as the key, selectively triggering fluorescence turn&#8208;on via acetyl&#8208;O bond cleavage and restoring excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of deacetylated Zole. Mechanistic studies reveal that enantioselectivity arises from thermodynamic differences and distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between PEA enantiomers. To enhance practical application, Zole@CDMOF is fabricated into a flexible sensor via a simple scotch tape strategy, enabling direct visual indexing of enantiomeric excess. Additionally, we propose a barcode&#8208;based chiral encryption model, establishing a quadruply encrypted system with ultra&#8208;high security&#8212;allowing only one out of approximately two million keys to unlock the data. This study pioneers the first chiral cryptographic key in fluorescence encryption, paving the way for ultra&#8208;secure encryption, advanced chiral sensing, and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Engineered Proton Transfer Pathways for Selective Pure Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte (SE) cells hold great promise for electrochemical synthesis of pure H2O2, yet the protonation mechanisms governing the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR) in such systems, particularly when using pure water as the proton source, remain unclear. While both Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (LH, surface *H&#8208;mediated) and Eley&#8208;Rideal (ER, water&#8208;derived proton&#8208;coupled) pathways are theoretically plausible, their practical dominance under SE conditions has locked experimental validation. Herein, we designed a hierarchical Ni&#8208;N2&#8208;C&#8208;O single&#8208;atom/NiO nanocluster co&#8208;decorated porous carbon nanosheet catalyst (NiSA&#8208;NiO/pCNs) that achieved exceptional 2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR performance, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a H2O2 partial current density of 356 mA cm&#8722;2 (equivalent to 6.6 mmol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 production rate) in a membrane&#8208;free SE cell. Through detailed analysis of reaction intermediates and the local pH using in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect and density functional theory simulations, we demonstrated the critical role of NiO nanoclusters in tuning the protonation pathway: the water dissociation (WD) capability of NiO activates the ER mechanism via fast proton transfer from solvent water, whereas NiSA/pCNs without NiO preferentially follow the LH mechanism through surface&#8208;adsorbed *H intermediates from the interfacial transferred proton. These findings establish a catalyst design principle for controlling interfacial proton transfer routes in solid&#8208;state H2O2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Eley&#8208;Rideal Mechanism in Electrochemical Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Eley&#8208;Rideal (ER) mechanism is pivotal in heterogeneous catalysis processes such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, which rely heavily on the interaction between solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;phase species. In this study, we examine the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene to explore the factors influencing the ER mechanism. We employed the density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the hydrogenation of acetylene on face&#8208;centered cubic metals and copper&#8208;based alloys. Microkinetic modeling identifies changes in the rate&#8208;determining steps of different alloys as electronegativity decreases. We then constructed the volcano plot for the adsorption energy towards C2H2 and the reaction rate, which predicted that Cu3Au is the best candidate alloy for the C2H2 semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Both extensive prior research and our experimental findings validated our volcano plot. Notably, our work points out the two key determinants of the ER mechanism: atomic activation and steric hindrance. For metals with weaker adsorption, steric hindrance primarily obstructs the ER mechanism, while for metals with stronger adsorption, the ER mechanism is hindered due to the challenge of atomic activation. Therefore, introducing weak adsorption sites into moderately adsorptive metals can improve the overall efficiency of the ER reaction by balancing these two factors.</dc:description>

         <title>Blood Retention and Kidney Clearance of Renal&#8208;Clearable Gold NanoparticlesStrongly&#160; Correlate with Renal Injury Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are typically filtered through the glomeruli and transported along the renal tubules before entering the bladder. However, the effects of glomerular leakage and tubular injury, two common features of kidney diseases, on nanoparticle transport remains poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the blood retention, kidney accumulation, and renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; in a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model. By correlating its transport with proteinuria and urinary kidney injury molecule&#8208;1 (KIM&#8208;1), endogenous biomarkers of glomerular leakage and proximal tubular injury, respectively, we found that glomerular leakage, as indicated by a &gt;50&#8208;fold increase in proteinuria, did not enhance its blood clearance. Instead, tubular injury significantly reduced glomerular filtration, resulting in elevated blood retention, increased kidney accumulation, and reduced renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328;. Moreover, Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; blood retention exhibited a very strong positive correlation with urinary KIM&#8208;1 (Pearson&#8217;s coefficient r = 0.90), much stronger than KIM&#8208;1 correlations with conventional glomerular filtration blood markers such as serum creatinine. This suggests that Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; could serve as a sensitive exogenous blood marker of tubular injury, expanding the diagnostic potential of renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles in kidney diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Porous Aromatic Framework Cathode with Fast Redox Kinetics for Ultralow&#8208;Temperature (&#8208;70 &#8451;) Potassium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;310) using p&#8208;type phenazine (PZ) and n&#8208;type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low&#8208;temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF&#8208;310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 A g&#8208;1) at 25 &#8451;. Furthermore, PAF&#8208;310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low&#8208;temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;20 &#8451; and 130.1 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;40 &#8451; at 0.2 A g&#8208;1). Even at &#8208;70 &#8451;, PAF&#8208;310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1). Moreover, various in/ex&#8208;situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co&#8208;storage mechanism of K+ and PF6&#8208; in PAF&#8208;310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low&#8208;temperature stabilized PIBs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low-temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor-acceptor (D-A) porous aromatic framework (PAF-310) using p-type phenazine (PZ) and n-type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low-temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF-310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g-1 at 50 A g-1) at 25 &#8451;. Furthermore, PAF-310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low-temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g-1 at -20 &#8451; and 130.1 mAh g-1 at -40 &#8451; at 0.2 A g-1). Even at -70 &#8451;, PAF-310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1).

         <title>Regioselective C&#8208;H Functionalization by the Combination of Enzymatic and Chemocatalytic Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often&#8208;high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo&#8208;enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic Halogenation, chemo&#8208;catalytic Heck coupling, and an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Hydrolysis reaction (H3 Catalytic Platform = H3CP) in a single reaction vessel. H3CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross&#8208;coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super&#8208;molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H3CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Dual&#8208;Responsive Ultrathin Polymersomes with Reversible Transitions on Acidochromism and Fluorochromism Performances for Multiple Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing dual&#8208;responsive ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) is crucial for achieving intelligent nanodevices. In their Research Article (e202507852), Haibao Jin and co&#8208;workers report an innovative strategy for fabricating pH/visible light dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with reversible acidochromism and fluorochromism performances via the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers. 2D Quick Response code was meticulously crafted through incorporating these fluorescent UTPSs inks into the patterning lithography, displaying a multi&#8208;level decryption activity.

         <title>Linking Metallacycle Transfer with Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis to Generate Polyacetylenes of Unprecedented Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unusual low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap polyacetylenes bearing ring&#8208;fused tellurophene and vinyl side chains were prepared by combining metallacycle transfer (Hf/p&#8208;block element exchange) with ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) into a single modular and efficient protocol. 








Abstract
A hafnium&#8208;based bicyclic precursor (COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Hf) has been prepared that enables tandem Hf/E metallacycle transfer (E&#160;=&#160;main group element) and the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclooctatetraene (COT) units to generate a new family of structurally unique polyacetylenes. Highlights from this work include a tellurophene&#8208;grafted polyacetylene, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Te, and a polyacetylene with unsaturated vinyl side chains, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;vinyl. The resulting polymers can be processed into films that yield optical band gaps as low as 1.6&#160;eV, representing promising new architectures for the optoelectronics community.

         <title>Hybrid Cathode Interlayer Engineering Enables Over 20% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy is developed by using polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine as a guest material to improve the photovoltaic performance of the perylene&#8208;diimide cathode interlayer. Benefitted from the improved ohmic contact, interfacial compatibility, and carrier dynamics of PDINN:F16CuPc, a remarkable efficiency of 20.17% is achieved in the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device, which is higher than that of the control PDINN&#8208;based device with an efficiency of 19.29%.








Abstract
The capability of cathode interlayer (CIL) in regulating the conductivity, interfacial dipole, and work function of the electrode plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). The widely used perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs suffered from the inbuilt limitation of finite conductivity and poor thickness tolerance. To address this issue, we develop a universal strategy to finely optimize the functionality of perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;type CIL (PDINN) by incorporating polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) derivative to form a hybrid CIL. It is found that the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between PDINN and CuPc can address the solvent processability issue of CuPc used as CIL. The incorporation of CuPc in the PDINN layer leads to better film morphology, increased conductivity, and reduced cathode work function, enabling greater CIL thickness tolerance and significantly improved photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Notably, the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device using PDINN:F16CuPc as hybrid CIL yields a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.17%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 19.29% for the control device based on PDINN CIL. Particularly, this strategy demonstrates a universality in multiple photoactive layers and various perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs, offering an effective approach to developing highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Fortification of FeS Clusters Reshapes Anaerobic CO Dehydrogenase into an Air&#8208;Viable Enzyme through Multilayered Sealing of O2 Tunnels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered CO dehydrogenase (CODH) that remains active in air through a multilayered gas tunnel is illustrated on the cover. The architecture selectively blocks O2 while allowing CO/CO2 to access the FeS cluster, thereby maintaining redox balance and preventing oxidative destabilization. The visual contrast between inactive and active forms highlights the tunnel's protective role. This work offers a tunnel&#8208;guided strategy for engineering air&#8208;stable metalloenzymes with practical potential, as described by Suk Min Kim, Hyung Ho Lee, Yong Hwan Kim et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202508565)

         <title>Coherently Coupled Frustrated Lewis Pairs in In2O3&#8722;x Nanoclusters for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) were constructed on the graphitic carbon nitride support, leveraging the privileged hydrogen&#8208;bond sewing interface. Significantly, the built&#8208;in electric fields and particularly multisite architecture reshape the kinetic landscapes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The downstream reduction follows the formate pathway, which preferentially inhibits CO production while promotes CH4 formation. 








Abstract
Co&#8208;catalysts integration presents unique opportunities to enhance photoactivity, yet selectivity control and mechanistic understanding within multistep reactions remain fundamental challenges hitherto. In this study, a reshaped kinetic landscape is demonstrated over coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on carbon nitride matrix, which mediates directed CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion with a selectivity of 65.3% (electron basis). The hydrogen&#8208;bonded interface fosters intimate electronic coupling, generating built&#8208;in electric fields that facilitate cascade charge transfer processes. Particularly, exceptionally robust FLPs sites were identified within the sub&#8208;nanosized In2O3&#8722;x nanoclusters, in contrast to easily deactivated counterparts in oversized crystalline structures. These enduring FLPs sites confer privileged adaptive binding with CO2 and mutative C1 intermediates. Correlated in situ infrared and mass spectroscopic analyses track the formation of FLPs&#8208;CO2 adducts and highlight the predominance of formate (HCOO&#8722;) pathway, surpassing competitive CO evolution. This work opens inspiring prospects for exploring multielectron photochemistry and achievable metrics through distinctive FLPs topologies on sub&#8208;nanostructures.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Hole&#8208;Selective Molecules for UV&#8208;Resistant High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
We develop a thiophene&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayer, referred to as Me&#8208;TPCP, which serves as the hole&#8208;selective layer for inverted perovskite solar cells. Me&#8208;TPCP demonstrates exceptional ultraviolet stability, superior hole extraction, and effective defect passivation capabilities. Consequently, we achieve a remarkable efficiency of 25.62% with excellent ultraviolet, operational, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced degradation, particularly occurring at the buried interface, has emerged as a significant stability challenge, severely limiting the widespread applications of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we rationally design and synthesize novel thiophene&#8208;modified self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated hole&#8208;selective molecules, namely (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;TPCP), affording UV&#8208;stable high&#8208;efficiency PSCs. Simultaneously incorporating phenyl and thiophene groups enhances molecular conjugation, effectively protecting the fragile bonds between the carbazole core and the phosphonic acid group. This modification results in enhanced intrinsic UV stability and improved hole transport ability of the molecule. Furthermore, thiophene grafted on the carbazole coordinates with the Pb2+ ions in perovskite, enhancing the binding of perovskite to hole&#8208;selective molecules. Consequently, the crystallinity of the perovskite film is significantly improved, along with decreased defect density, thereby inhibiting its degradation under UV light illumination. By introducing methyl groups, the molecular stability is further enhanced, and the energy level of Me&#8208;TPCP is finely tuned, resulting in a lower interfacial energy barrier that facilitates more efficient hole extraction. With these advantages, inverted PSC devices based on Me&#8208;TPCP achieve a significantly higher efficiency of 25.62% than the control devices (23.85%). Meanwhile, these devices demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in UV stability, as well as improved operational and thermal stability.

         <title>Engineering Crystalline/Amorphous Interfaces for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an amorphous indium&#8208;based catalyst, which could reconstruct into crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of metallic indium under working conditions. Therefore, it can exhibit excellent performance in CO2 electroreduction to formic acid at high current densities. The Faradaic efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to formic acid over the In/In&#9472;OH interfaces reaches 98%, which is a 66.1% increase compared to traditional In2O3. 








Abstract
In the request for carbon neutrality, CO2 electroreduction to high&#8208;value fuels and chemicals, particularly formic acid, has become as a promising approach. However, implementing it on an industrial scale is hindered by the catalyst instability under high current densities and the excessive energy consumption of conventional electrolysis systems. To tackle these challenges, we propose an amorphization strategy to regulate catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions. In particular, an amorphous In&#8208;based catalyst, InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x, was designed and achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 98% at &#8722;800 to &#8722;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction to formate, while maintaining stability for 100&#160;h. Mechanistic studies show that InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x undergoes partial reduction to stable crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of fully reducing to metallic In, enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and *OCHO intermediate. To improve the economic viability of electrolysis system, a CO2 electroreduction coupled with waste plastics electrooxidation system for formate production was constructed. Compared to conventional electrolysis system, the coupled system reduced energy consumption by 34.7% and increased formate production by 49.7%, offering a more energy&#8208;efficient and cost&#8208;effective approach to CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Decoupling Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation: A Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Assisted Dual&#8208;Site Synergy Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy mechanism is demonstrated to overcome the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru single sites drive selective CO&#8322;&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, while Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply H species to Ru single sites via spillover over N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, achieving 98.0% CO selectivity with ultrahigh activity (3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The persistent trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity remains a critical barrier to efficient CO2 valorization. Herein, we propose a concept of decoupling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the photothermal catalytic reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy. This concept is demonstrated through a hybrid catalyst constructed by immobilizing abundant Ru single sites and trace Ru clusters onto high&#8208;efficiency photothermal support of N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages (hNCNC). Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#9472;N4 sites are highly active and selective for the RWGS reaction, contingent on the efficient migration of dissociated *H species to adjacent C atoms of Ru. Importantly, we experimentally confirm that Ru single sites dominate CO2 hydrogenation to CO, whereas Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply hydrogen species to adjacent single sites via spillover over hNCNC. Leveraging this synergistic interaction, the hybrid catalyst achieves an exceptional CO production rate of 3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity over 98%. This mechanism shows universal applicability as demonstrated by the effective promotion of CO2 hydrogenation of Ru single sites by other typical hydrogen&#8208;spillover&#8208;active metal clusters, e.g., Pt and Pd clusters. This design concept liberates the potential to overcome the longstanding activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Dynamically Dual&#8208;Center Coupled Synergistic Catalysis for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism with multi&#8208;pathway for thorough oxygen reduction process in alkaline medium is demonstrated. In situ synchrotron infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations collectively reveal that the Pt single sites optimize the electronic structure of the PdRh nanosheets, thereby enhancing the overall oxygen reduction efficiency on PdRh&#9472;Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) suffers from inherent kinetic limitations arising from the competitive adsorption behavior of *OOH intermediates and their divergent conversion pathways toward either the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant route or the 2e&#8315;&#8208;peroxide byproduct. Conventional single&#8208;component catalysts fundamentally lack temporal&#8208;spatial control to simultaneously accelerate O&#9472;O bond cleavage while suppressing *H2O2 desorption. To overcome this kinetic dilemma, herein, we propose a dynamically dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism enabled by precisely engineered PdRh&#9472;Pt nanosheet binary&#8208;component interfaces. Multidimensional in situ synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the activated 4e&#8315; pathway primarily occurs at PdRh sites. Additionally, Pt centers selectively reduce *OOH to *O and *H2O2, whereas neighboring PdRh sites facilitate ultrafast *H2O2 migration and dissociation, effectively complementing the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant pathway. Hence, the DCCS catalysis redirects traditionally divergent product pathways toward a singular target product. This interfacial kinetic synergy achieves ultrahigh 4e&#8315; kinetics, demonstrated by a six&#8208;fold increase of turnover frequency compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the derived rechargeable Zn&#8210;air batteries demonstrate exceptional stability over 200&#160;h, establishing a new design principle for breaking kinetics trade&#8208;offs in heterogeneous catalysis through molecularly scheduling reaction pathways.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle Monolayer&#8208;Decorated Nanopipette Enabling in Situ Monitoring of Single&#8208;Cell Redox Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette was developed to visualize single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. Leveraging strong near&#8208;field coupling within the monolayer that forms uniform hotspots, our method enables highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of redox metabolism changes, which deepens the understanding of single&#8208;cell ferroptosis.








Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of how single cells respond to redox perturbations is pivotal for predicting cell fate decisions. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;active nanopipettes hold promise for single&#8208;cell analysis, yet challenges remain in achieving both signal sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, a plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette has been developed, which serves as a biomimetic endoscope to monitor single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. This is accomplished by the conformal transferring of gold nanoparticle monolayer onto the nanopipette followed by the functionalization of redox&#8208;responsive probes. The strong near&#8208;field coupling within monolayer forms uniform hotspots, enabling highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of SERS signals changes triggered by redox species. Modulated by the nanopipette technology, the endoscope allows for in situ monitoring of global redox states with low invasiveness and high spatial resolution. Further, study of ferroptosis events via simultaneous optical and electrical recording elucidates the correlation between redox imbalance and membrane damage during various ferroptosis&#8208;inducers stimulation, which has not been observed at the single&#8208;cell level. This work provides profound insights into the cellular redox dynamics, contributing to a deeper understanding of related physiopathological pathways.

         <title>Dynamic Active Site Evolution in Lanthanum&#8208;Based Catalysts Dictates Ethane Chlorination Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LaOCl&#8208;catalyzed C2H6 chlorination offers a low&#8208;carbon route for polyvinyl chloride synthesis, yet structural evolution occurs under Cl2 conditions. We establish structural sensitivity in La&#8208;catalyzed chlorination, and elucidate the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of LaCl3 and the role of hydroxyl groups in overchlorination, highlighting stabilization of LaOCl and hydroxyl chemistry modulation as key design principles to break selectivity limitations.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated chlorination of ethane presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) synthesis, yet selectivity toward 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane remains challenged by uncontrolled over&#8208;chlorination. Lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) has emerged as a promising catalyst, but its structural dynamics under Cl2&#8208;rich conditions and the origin of selectivity loss remain elusive. Here, we integrate advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations to address this knowledge gap. Our findings unveil a sequential LaOCl&#160;&#8594;&#160;LaCl3 transformation that dictates product distribution shifting from 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane to trichloroethane. Mechanistic insights reveal that surface hydroxyl groups, generated during catalyst chlorination, promote bidentate adsorption of 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane via hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, thereby activating C&#9472;Cl over&#8208;chlorination. Additionally, by employing Al2O3&#8208;supported LaCl3 model catalysts, the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of the LaCl3 species is demonstrated. The bonding of interfacial oxygen with monolayer&#8208;dispersed LaCl3 species generates empty 4f&#8208;states above the Fermi level, creating strong Lewis acid sites that stabilize Cl radicals and selectively convert chloroethane to 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. In contrast, aggregated nanoparticles are inactive due to their inability to stabilize chlorine radical. Our findings establish important structure sensitivity in lanthanum&#8208;catalyzed chlorination and provide guiding principles for catalyst design, highlighting the importance of stabilizing metastable LaOClx species and modulating surface hydroxyl chemistry to overcome selectivity limitations.

         <title>Intermolecular sp3C&#8208;H Metalation of Non&#8208;Nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted Bases Using Simple Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl substituted pyridines (tBu2&#8208;py) are widely used non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases. Their ubiquity is due to their highly hindered basic site and chemically robust nature. Herein we report that simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M = Al or Ga, X = Cl, Br or I) effect intermolecular sp3C&#8208;H metalation of tBu2&#8208;py bases under mild conditions. The sp3C&#8208;H metalated products can be converted in&#8208;situ into &#8208;BPin, &#8208;iodo, &#8208;bromo and &#8208;hydroxy derivatives for further elaboration. Mechanistic investigations indicate that: (i) a frustrated Lewis pair effects sp3C&#8208;H heterolysis to form the C&#8208;M bond and a protonated pyridine; (ii) C&#8208;H metalation requires singly halide&#8208;bridged super&#8208;electrophilic M2X6 dimers for sufficiently low barriers. Finally, sp3C&#8208;H metalation using M2X6 is not limited to tBu2&#8208;py bases. Thus, it is important to be aware of this facile sp3C&#8208;H functionalisation when using a range of non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Clinical Detection Accuracy of Large Structured Viral RNA via DNAzyme Cleavage and Antisense&#8208;Assisted Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that antisense oligonucleotides can be used to restructure secondary structural elements around the circular DNA template binding sites of the genomic RNA for subsequent rolling circle amplification. This strategy was employed to identify otherwise COVID &#8220;false negative&#8221; saliva samples by accurately detecting the presence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA in patient saliva samples, resulting in improved clinical sensitivity and specificity.








Abstract
Sensitive detection of viral RNA is critical for accurate diagnostic testing, particularly during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is a powerful isothermal amplification strategy that can be directly primed by RNA, eliminating the need for reverse transcription. Previous approaches have used 10&#8211;23 DNAzymes to cleave viral RNA, generating 3&#8242;&#8208;ends for hybridization to circular DNA templates (CDTs). However, the resulting RNA fragments often retained secondary or tertiary structures that hindered CDT binding and limited RCA efficiency. To address this challenge, we developed antisense oligonucleotide&#8208;assisted RCA (ASO&#8208;RCA), a general strategy that uses short upstream antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to remodel RNA structure and expose the CDT&#8208;binding site. Using five DNAzyme&#8208;CDT systems targeting distinct regions of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome, we show that ASO inclusion improves CDT hybridization and enhances RCA output&#8212;by up to 70&#8208;fold. This enhancement was observed using both linear and quasi&#8208;exponential RCA formats and remained effective in 50% pooled saliva. When applied to clinical saliva samples, ASO&#8208;assisted RCA markedly improved diagnostic performance, achieving 100% sensitivity and up to 97.5%&#8211;100% accuracy across multiple systems. These findings establish ASO&#8208;DNAzyme&#8208;RCA as a simple, robust, and clinically relevant platform for improving nucleic acid detection in structured RNA targets.

         <title>Development of a Vinylated Cyclic Allene: A Fleeting Strained Diene for the Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain&#8208;promoted Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the vinylated cyclic allene, a highly reactive strained all&#8208;carbon diene, was developed. Activation of the Kobayashi&#8208;type precursor with fluoride ion generated the vinyl cyclic allene, which was trapped by dienophiles to produce decalin derivatives under mild conditions. This method would provide an efficient route to synthesize natural product&#8208;relevant multicyclic skeletons in a convergent fashion.








Abstract
Fleeting molecules possessing strained multiple bonds are important components in organic synthesis due to their ability to undergo various chemical reactions driven by the release of strain energy. Although the use of strained &#960;&#8208;bonds as 2&#960; components, represented by dienophiles in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, has been well studied, &#8220;the strained diene (4&#960; component) approach&#8221; for molecular construction remains underexplored. Herein, we report the design of a vinyl cyclic allene (1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexadiene) as a highly reactive strained diene and the development of its Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. Experimental and computational studies of vinyl cyclic allenes revealed that this diene system undergoes cycloaddition with dienophiles regio&#8208; and stereoselectively under mild reaction conditions. These studies also provide insight into the reactivity and selectivity of the system. The strained diene approach enables the convergent construction of polycyclic molecules through bond disconnections distinct from conventional retrosynthetic analysis, thus offering an efficient strategy for the assembly of functional molecules.

         <title>Merging Photocatalysis with Chiral Lewis Acid Catalysis for Enantioselective Hydrosilylation/Hydrogermylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrosilylation and hydrogermylation reactions of &#593;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides under synergistic catalysis are reported. Various chiral organosilicon and organogermanium compounds were prepared by a radical process with good results, which could be transferred to drug intermediates. A series of experiments and DFT calculations revealed the reaction mechanism.








Abstract
Organosilicon compounds demonstrate widespread applications in many fields. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation represents one of the most common and effective methods to synthesize chiral organosilicon compounds, but it largely relies on electron&#8208;rich alkenes and structurally specific hydrosilanes. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a promising new platform for hydrosilylation. However, the enantiocontrol of photoinduced asymmetric hydrosilylation concerning highly reactive radical species is a great challenge. Herein, we report a synergistic catalytic strategy for enantioselective hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes by merging anthraquinone as a dual&#8208;tasked photocatalyst with a chiral Lewis acid catalyst. This protocol shows broad hydrosilane scope with efficient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, delivering diverse enantioenriched organosilicon compounds, which could be readily converted into a series of medicine molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between the photocatalyst and the alkene is crucial for enantiocontrol. Additionally, enantioselective radical hydrogermylation was also achieved under the visible light photoinduced synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Efficient Separation of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Products Using a Robust Polycatenated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed using an expanded aromatic tricarboxylate ligand, featuring the highest degree of catenation among known HOF analogues and enabling efficient C3H6/C2H4 separation with record productivity for this class of materials. 








Abstract
The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process produces mixtures of ethylene and propylene, driving demand for high&#8208;performance separation materials. We present HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework built from an expanded BTB (4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl&#8208;tribenzoate) linker, featuring the highest catenation degree observed in BTB&#8208;based HOFs. This unique architecture confers good stability under solvent, pH, and thermal conditions. With optimally sized pores and aromatic&#8208;rich surfaces, HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3 demonstrates excellent propylene/ethylene separation potential, outperforming its parent frameworks (HOF&#8208;BTB and HOF&#8208;BTB&#8208;NH2) under ambient conditions. Notably, the material accomplishes single&#8208;cycle purification of high&#8208;purity ethylene (99.95%) and propylene (99.5%) from equimolar binary mixtures, achieving a record ethylene productivity of 3.22&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 among HOF adsorbents. This study not only establishes HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3 as a benchmark HOF material for MTO product separation but also advances the structural design of HOFs for industrial olefin purification.

         <title>Decoy DNA Protects Molecular Tension Probes from DNase Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based probes are rapidly degraded by DNases in live&#8208;cell environments, limiting their use. We introduce a decoy DNA strategy, where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA acts as a competitive substrate for DNases, protecting functional DNA probes and significantly extending their stability for long&#8208;term live&#8208;cell studies.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular probes are essential tools for visualizing and quantifying mechanotransduction at the single&#8208;molecule level. However, their application in live&#8208;cell environments is severely limited by DNase&#8208;mediated degradation, which shortens probe lifespan and introduces false&#8208;positive signals. Here, we present a decoy DNA strategy where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA competitively binds DNases, effectively preserving functional DNA probes. This approach extends probe stability from 1&#8211;2 h to beyond 24 h, substantially improving signal integrity in live&#8208;cell tension imaging. In contrast to structurally modified nucleic acids, decoy DNA can be readily applied to existing DNA probe systems, enabling seamless integration without the need for additional validation or calibration. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy provides a generalizable framework for stabilizing DNA&#8208;based molecular tools in DNase&#8208;rich environments, enabling high&#8208;precision mechanobiology studies across diverse cell types and extended experiment durations.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Separation of MnWOx and NaWSiOx Phases Boosts Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is one of the most promising approaches for the chemical utilization of methane. In their research article (e202503767), Kang Cheng, Qinghong Zhang, Ye Wang et al. demonstrate that the nanoscale separation of Mn&#8208;based and Na2WO4&#8208;based phases, which facilitate O2 activation and enhance C2 hydrocarbon formation, respectively, results in a highly efficient OCM catalyst. This finding provides a novel decoupling strategy for designing heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Alterations of Protein Polyubiquitination Revealed by Mass&#8208;Spectrometric Ubiquitome Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To monitor small molecule&#8208;induced changes in protein polyubiquitination in an unbiased manner, we employ enrichment through tandem ubiquitin binding entities coupled to LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis (TUBE&#8208;MS). By applying the workflow to PROTAC, p97&#8208; and deubiquitinase&#8208;inhibitor treatment of cells, we demonstrate its broad applicability and reveal the induction of non&#8208;degradative ubiquitination on the E3 ligase UBE3A upon inhibition of the deubiquitinase USP7.








Abstract
Small molecules that alter protein ubiquitination are emerging as therapeutics due to their ability to modulate targets previously deemed undruggable. These compounds comprise PROTACs, molecular glue degraders, and DUB inhibitors, among others. However, methods for the proteome&#8208;wide monitoring of compound&#8208;induced changes in protein polyubiquitination, which may also detect non&#8208;degradative modifications, are lacking. Here, we report the utilization of polyubiquitin enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry to monitor small molecule&#8208;induced changes in cellular protein ubiquitination. We established enrichment through tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs) following semi&#8208;denaturing cell lysis and devised an elution protocol compatible with downstream LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the workflow by assessing ubiquitination changes induced by a PROTAC, a p97 inhibitor, and deubiquitinase inhibitors. Application of the assay to compounds inhibiting the deubiquitinase USP7 revealed the induction of non&#8208;degradative ubiquitination on the E3 ligase UBE3A. Collectively, we established a versatile proteomics method to facilitate the direct investigation of cellular polyubiquitination, with high relevance for the identification and characterization of protein degraders, stabilizers, and other molecules with ubiquitin&#8208;mediated bioactivity.

Organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of challenging cyclic tertiary amines is reported. In their Research Article (e202505275), Svetlana B. Tsogoeva and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of an in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt as an efficient organoautocatalyst, enabling double C(sp2)&#8208;N bond metathesis at room temperature via a domino reaction mechanism. This metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free transformation advances green, waste&#8208;reducing, and sustainable approaches in organic synthesis.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Induced Atomic Diffusion in a Molecular Metal Cluster Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of atomic vacancies in a close&#8208;packed material is believed to allow the migration of atoms adjacent to the vacancies, which induces dynamics of atoms. However, it is not known whether atoms in discrete molecules can undergo vacancy&#8208;induced dynamics. We describe herein the generation of a close&#8208;packed Pd12 cluster complex [Pd12(C7H7)6][B(ArF)4]n (n = 2, 3) with a Pd&#8208;atom vacancy, and the observation of the diffusion of Pd atoms. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis, X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretical calculations indicate that an atomic vacancy is located at the surface sites of the Pd12 core, and that it migrates rapidly on the NMR timescale. This means that all 11 palladium atoms at the surface undergo self&#8208;diffusion with a low energy barrier. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that atomic diffusion occurs within a molecule through the vacancy mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bifunctional Organic Photocatalyst for Efficient Single&#8208;Electron and Energy Transfer Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional photocatalysts capable of mediating both single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (EnT) processes are rare and typically metal&#8208;based. Here, we present 3&#8208;thioaryl&#8208;4hydroxycoumarins, a new family of cost&#8208;effective organic photocatalysts that leverage a stabilized charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state to achieve both strong reducing power and efficient energy transfer. The spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO stabilizes the CT state, enhancing SET reactivity (E*red = &#8722;3.08 V vs SCE) while maintaining a sufficiently high triplet energy (ET = 67 kcal/mol) for EnT&#8208;driven transformations. This dual reactivity enables the activation of redox&#8208;inert substrates (Ered &lt; &#8722;2.8 V vs SCE) via SET reduction, generating radicals suitable for diverse C&#8211;S, C&#8211;P, C&#8211;B, and C&#8211;C bondforming transformations, alongside EnT&#8208;based processes such as E/Z olefin isomerization and [2+2] photocycloadditions. Mechanistic studies, supported by photophysical and theoretical analyses, confirmed the catalyst&#8217;s bifunctionality.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;supported Ru&#8211;Ni: a Common Active Site for Hydrolysis, Hydrogen Oxidation, and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insights into the activation and conversion of hydrogen using a single&#8208;mode catalyst is crucial for advancing fuels and fine chemical production. In this paper, the activation and conversion of H2 molecular in hydrogen production and application were investigated on RuM (M = Ni, Co, Cu, Fe)&#8208;MXene catalysts. RuM (M = Ni, Co, Cu, Fe) bimetallic nanoclusters were uniformly distributed on Ti3C2 MXene. The optimal Ru2.5Ni2.5&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibites the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1833 min&#8208;1 toward ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalysts also showed good&#160;catalytic activity in hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The high activity is originl from the acceleration of the catalytic process by RuNi clusters&#8208;Ti3C2 and the promotion of molecular transport by the special interface of RuNi cluster&#8208;MXene. The RuNi clusters&#8208;Ti3C2 with suiable d&#8208;band provide a dependable platform for the regulated activation and conversion of H2 molecules and various reaction intermediates. The competitiveness of nano&#8208;cluster&#8208;MXene catalytic material is showcased for activation and conversion of hydrogen. This research of reaction&#8208;inducing adaptation uncovered the pathway to explore multi&#8208;functional catalysts in energy, chemistry and materials applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adapting Lattice Respiration Enabled by Crystal Design and d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization towards Highly Stable Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the appealing three&#8208;electron transfer feature, low cost and high safety. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Al3+ and host lattice induces severe lattice distortion and structural collapse, leading to poor cycle stability in RABs. Herein, we develop a new&#8208;type FeWO4 cathode with a comprehensive consideration of the crystal structure and electronic structure. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) open framework and strong W&#8211;O covalent network of the FeWO4 greatly improve the storage of high charge density Al3+. Moreover, the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen facilitates electron delocalization, which effectively weakens the interaction with the trivalent cation (Al3+). Importantly, combining in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that as&#8208;prepared cathode exhibits a &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration&#8221; (SALR) effect. Specifically, the reversible W&#8211;O bond elongation/compression (&#916;d&#8776;0.05 &#197;) during cycling reduces lattice strain and confines volume expansion to less than 3%. As results, the FeWO4 cathode delivers a high capacity of 192 mAh g&#8211;1 at 500 mA g&#8211;1 and long cycle life of over 2300 cycles with quiet low capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle in RABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dominated Calendar Aging in Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage. While the majority of current research focuses on cyclic aging, the impact of calendar aging on zinc anodes has received far less attention. Here, we reveal that zinc deposition morphology, governed by anion chemistry, plays a decisive role in calendar degradation by amplifying interfacial corrosion and accelerating &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc accumulation. Notably, intrinsic corrosion rates alone do not predict degradation severity; for instance, triflate anion shows low corrosion but induces highly porous deposits and rapid aging. To address this, we propose&#160;a comprehensive electrochemical descriptor to quantify deposition morphology beyond traditional morphological characterization. Moreover, we introduce an acetatization strategy that tailors Zn2+ solvation and promotes dense plating, effectively suppressing side reactions and &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc formation. This approach effectively curbs calendar degradation, yielding nearly a 49&#8208;fold improvement in capacity retention. Under demanding conditions (6&#8208;hour aging intervals per cycle), practical anode&#8208;free Cu||ZnI2 cells (~3 mAh cm&#8211;2) exhibit high cycling stability, maintaining 96.2% of their initial capacity over 1000 hours.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage. While the majority of current research focuses on cyclic aging, the impact of calendar aging on zinc anodes has received far less attention. Here, we reveal that zinc deposition morphology, governed by anion chemistry, plays a decisive role in calendar degradation by amplifying interfacial corrosion and accelerating &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc accumulation. Notably, intrinsic corrosion rates alone do not predict degradation severity; for instance, triflate anion shows low corrosion but induces highly porous deposits and rapid aging. To address this, we propose&#160;a comprehensive electrochemical descriptor to quantify deposition morphology beyond traditional morphological characterization. Moreover, we introduce an acetatization strategy that tailors Zn2+ solvation and promotes dense plating, effectively suppressing side reactions and &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc formation. This approach effectively curbs calendar degradation, yielding nearly a 49-fold improvement in capacity retention. Under demanding conditions (6-hour aging intervals per cycle), practical anode-free Cu||ZnI2 cells (~3 mAh cm&#8211;2) exhibit high cycling stability, maintaining 96.2% of their initial capacity over 1000 hours. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of zinc anode degradation and offer a viable route to address calendar aging in ZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Bonnadiene and ent&#8208;Polytrichastrene B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B has been accomplished. An enantioselective redox&#8208;relay Heck alkenylation was used to form the stereocenter at C7. The unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic structure was constructed via [5+2] cycloaddition. The functionalities in the spirotricycle have been strategically utilized to append the remaining moieties present in the natural product in a sequential manner. Moreover, two Fe&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes were employed to reduce the unactivated tetrasubstituted olefin and to construct the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring.








Abstract
We report herein the first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B, two diterpenoids that share a common spirotricyclic skeleton. Notably, ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B also features a highly strained, sterically congested tetrasubstituted cyclopropane moiety, presenting significant synthetic challenges in both its construction and stereochemical control. The synthesis features: (1) palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective redox&#8208;relay Heck alkenylation between electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenyl triflate and primary alkenol to form the stereocenter at C7; (2) diastereoselective intramolecular [5+2] cycloaddition to rapidly assemble the unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic skeleton; (3) sequential installation of the requisite alkyl groups and alkenes present in the targeted molecule by leveraging the functionalities positioned on the tricycle; (4) Fe&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;initiated hydrogenation to stereospecifically reduce the tetrasubstituted &#916;10,11 olefin and install the contiguous stereocenters; (5) Fe&#8208;mediated HAT&#8208;initiated 3&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization to rapidly forge the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring with excellent stereoselectivity.

         <title>Selective Phosphorylation of Phenols and Benzenediols by the Kinase PsiK and Variants Thereof</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PsiK from Psilocybe cubensis phosphorylates a diverse set of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate. High&#8208;throughput screening of active site mutant libraries using DESI&#8208;MS enabled protein engineering of PsiK, further expanding its substrate scope. The scalability of PsiK&#8208;catalyzed reactions was demonstrated, further highlighting its biocatalytic utility for selective phosphorylation.








Abstract
Phosphorylation plays important roles in biology by modulating the structure, reactivity, and biological function of a broad range of molecules. Biocatalytic phosphorylation has attracted attention from synthetic chemists due to its selectivity and mild reaction conditions using ATP as a phosphate donor. Given the potential synthetic utility of kinases with activity on small molecule substrates, we explored the activity of PsiK, the enzyme responsible for selective 4&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylation of 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine or psilocin in psylocybin biosynthesis by Psilocybe cubensis. We find that PsiK has good activity on a range of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate, enabling preparative phosphorylation of different substrates, and substantially expands the substrate scope of biocatalytic phosphorylation. We also show that active site mutations can further expand substrate scope and improve site&#8208;selectivity. This engineering effort was greatly expedited using DESI&#8208;MS screening, which enabled analysis of 2688 reactions in only 40&#160;min. Finally, gram&#8208;scale phosphorylation of a representative substrate was achieved with a turnover number over 10 000. Together, these results highlight the biocatalytic utility of PsiK and derivatives thereof for selective phosphorylation of phenols and benzenediols under mild conditions.

         <title>The Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster of Bacterioferritin&#8208;Associated Ferredoxin (Bfd): a &#8220;Biological Fuse&#8221; that Prevents Oxidative Damage to Cells?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When cellular iron is low, bacterioferritin (Bfr) releases its stored iron through a reductive process dependent on the [2Fe&#8211;2S] ferredoxin Bfd. Why accessing stored iron should depend on an iron&#8208;requiring protein when iron is scarce is unclear. Here, we show that the Bfd [2Fe&#8211;2S] cluster is sensitive to oxidative stress, suggesting that it may act as a &#8220;biological fuse&#8221;, shutting down iron release under conditions where free iron is toxic.








Abstract
Iron is in an essential micronutrient in living systems. However, it is also potentially toxic and so the concentration of chelatable iron within cells is tightly regulated to prevent catalytic formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferritins play a key role in iron homeostasis by storing excess iron as an insoluble ferric mineral within the protein. When bacterial cells become iron deficient, this store may be accessed by reduction/solubilisation of the iron. Bacterioferritins utilise heme, bound at an inter&#8208;subunit site, to support electron transfer to the stored mineral. Electrons for heme reduction are shuttled from NADPH via Bfd, a [2Fe&#8211;2S] cluster&#8208;containing ferredoxin. This raises the paradox that the synthesis of an iron&#8208;dependent protein co&#8208;factor is required under conditions of iron&#8208;deficiency so that stored iron can be utilised. Here, we show that exposure of Bfd to ROS suppresses the capacity of the protein to stimulate iron release from bacterioferritin. We propose that reliance of iron release on Bfd evolved to ensure that chelatable iron levels do not increase under oxidative stress conditions. Thus, the Bfd iron&#8211;sulfur cluster functions as a &#8220;biological fuse&#8221; in providing a fail&#8208;safe that immediately halts iron release once ROS accumulate to damaging concentrations.

         <title>Carbocation&#8208;Based Multiresonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters with Efficient Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbocation&#8208;based multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters featuring small energy gaps of less than 2.20&#160;eV have been developed by doping positively charged carbenium ions as strong electron&#8208;deficient groups and nitrogen as an electron&#8208;rich atom into a polycyclic aromatic skeleton. The resulting solution&#8208;processed OLEDs showed a yellow narrowband emission with an external quantum efficiency of 29.4%.








Abstract
Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters hold great promise for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, but are fundamentally restricted to wide&#8208;energy&#8208;gap heteropolycyclic systems typically with blue&#8208;to&#8208;green emissions, while their yellow&#8208;to&#8208;red emissions remain a major challenge. Here we propose a strategy for developing MR&#8208;TADF emitters with narrow energy gaps (less than 2.20&#160;eV) by doping positively&#8208;charged carbenium ion (C+) into polycyclic skeletons to create strong short&#8208;range charge transfer with electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atoms, achieving a significant 160&#160;nm emission redshift compared to the benchmark neutral boron&#8208;based counterpart. Furthermore, steric isopropyl groups and bulky tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate counter ions are synergistically integrated to suppress intermolecular aggregation, yielding high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum efficiencies up to 90%. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the emitters exhibit promising external quantum efficiency of 29.4% with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 0.17&#160;eV, opening the way for development of ion&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters toward efficient long&#8208;wavelength narrowband electroluminescence.

         <title>A Polyaromatic Metallotube With a Dual Multi&#8208;Functionalization Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyaromatic metallotube, formed from PtCl2 and bispyridine ligands, undergoes dual multi&#8208;functionalization via substitution on the metal hinges. The first multi&#8208;functionalized Pt(II)&#8208;tube exhibits high water solubility as well as binds one molecule of fullerene C60, which is subsequently released through the second multi&#8208;functionalization, in a quantitative fashion. 








Abstract
Post&#8208;functionalization is an advanced, key synthetic method in supramolecular systems, whereas the previous method relies heavily on the substitution on the organic frameworks. Here we report a polyaromatic metallotube capable of dually multi&#8208;functionalizing the metal sites in an efficient post&#8208;assembly fashion. The Pt(II)&#8208;linked tube with tetrachloro groups is prepared from two PtCl2 hinges and two bent bispyridine ligands in high yield. The new metallotube efficiently converts to tetra&#8208;substituted tubes by the first multiple functionalization, through the replacement of the chloro groups with various alkynyl groups. The tubular structures before/after the functionalization are unequivocally confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. A resultant tetraammonium&#8208;attached Pt(II)&#8208;tube exhibits high water solubility and uptake abilities toward spherical and rod&#8208;like compounds. The metallotube strongly binds one molecule of fullerene C60 in the polyaromatic cavity yet releases it through the second multi&#8208;functionalization by tetrabromination of the metal hinges in a quantitative and reversible manner. Even after Bingel reaction within the tube, sterically demanding bis&#8208;substituted fullerenes (&gt;&#8764;80% selectivity) are readily released by the second functionalization. The present method, i.e., the use of simple PtCl2 hinges, will be applicable to wide&#8208;ranging metallo&#8208;supramolecules to enhance their structural and functional versatilities via post&#8208;multi&#8208;functionalizations.

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Accompanying ATP Synthesis in Polydopamine Microreactors Covered by Lipid Bilayers with ATPase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global energy and environmental crises have stimulated increased efforts towards converting CO2&#160;into valuable chemicals or energy substance. Inspired by natural chloroplasts and mitochondria, we build&#160;an innovative polydopamine&#8208;armored multiple enzyme microreactor for co&#8208;immobilizing glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric phosphokinase (PGK), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and ATPase&#8208;incorporating proteoliposome, providing spatially confined microenvironments akin to natural systems. Within this microreactor,&#160;GAPDH and PGK catalyze the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate to 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric acid, reducing &#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH and generating a proton influx that drives ATP synthesis.&#160;The microreactor possesses strong affinity for CO2, combined with FDH, facilitates the reduction of CO2&#160;to formic acid, oxidizing NADH back to NAD+&#160;and enabling the recycling of the NAD+/NADH redox couple. This process further&#160;boosts ATP production by contributing additional protons. Such microreactor adeptly orchestrates the chloroplast's enzymes to fix CO2&#160;and the mitochondrion's enzymes to synthesize ATP into a unified artificial biomimetic system, effectively replicating the glycolysis process to simultaneously achieve CO2&#160;fixation, NADH regeneration and ATP synthesis. This strategy not only holds great potential to inspire significant design innovations for more efficient ATP synthesis from low&#8208;value substances, but also greatly expands the application scenarios for biomolecular motors.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Polyoxometalate Crosslinked Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Polymer as Artificial Interfacial Layer for Highly Persistent and Low&#8208;Temperature Tolerant Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The uncontrolled lithium (Li) dendrite growth and fragile native solid electrolyte interphase formation have severely hindered the practical development of Li metal batteries. Herein, a coordinatively cross&#8208;linked metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer as anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) is developed by utilizing titanium(IV)&#8208;polyoxometalates (Ti&#8208;POMs) as hexatopic linkers to bridge organic and inorganic moieties. The constructed MSP&#8208;IPL possesses high electrochemical stability, superior ion&#8208;transfer ability, and good air stability. Due to its high film formation uniformity and mechanical tenacity, the MSP&#8208;IPL can effectively avoid non&#8208;uniform Li deposition caused by the tip effect, thus inhibiting Li dendrite proliferation. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs in polymer skeleton can efficiently bind with PF6&#8208; anions, thus increasing Li+ transference number and promoting homogeneous Li+ distribution. The re&#8208;processability and self&#8208;healing ability endowed by dynamic coordination bonds enable the MSP&#8208;IPL to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interface contact. Consequently, high&#8208;loading Li||LiFePO4 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries based on MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li anodes demonstrate impressive cyclability and extraordinary rate capability. Even at a low temperature of &#8211;20 &#176;C, the MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li||NCM811 batteries can still cycle stably for over 500 cycles (equivalent to 138 days) with a considerable capacity retention of 86.8%. This work presents a promising solution for developing practical low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Lanthanide&#8208;based Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Multi&#8208;Mode Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of metal&#8208;organic framework materials expanded in a two&#8208;dimensional plane, which have a wide range of applications in fields of optoelectronic devices, sensors, and information storage due to their unique layered structure and excellent optical properties. Currently, research on luminescent 2D MOFs mainly focuses on down&#8208;shifting luminescence, while the exploration of upconversion luminescence remains in its early stages. Herein, a novel two&#8208;dimensional Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and red upconversion luminescence at 660 nm under 980 nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. In addition, multi&#8208;mode emitting MOFs with both upconversion and down&#8208;shifting luminescence were further constructed by co&#8208;doping Tb3+ or Eu3+. Inspired by the layered structure of 2D materials, multilayer stacked 2D MOFs composites were prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation method and upconversion luminescence was realized for the first time by interfacial energy transfer between different components. This strategy not only expands the optical modulation of luminescent 2D MOFs, but also provides new ideas for the construction of multifunctional luminescent materials. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous existing strategies struggle to mitigate reverse&#8208;current decay (RCD) during startup and shutdown in polymer electrolyte fuel cells to avoid cathode corrosion, but the added system complexity and cost are drawbacks. Here we report that modification of a molybdenum&#8208;nickel alloy through the doping of copper enables a non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) that efficiently catalyzes hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) while catalytically inactive toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, making it ideal for fuel&#8208;cell anode because the instantaneous interfacial potential jump originated from the parasitic ORR during device startup/shutdown can be surmounted. The catalyst, when assembled in the anode of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell, manifests substantially improved corrosion&#8208;resistant ability compared with that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt/C) catalyst. The basis for the achieved performances reveals to be the copper dopants that increase the hydrogen bonding of interfacial water for enhanced HOR, yet weaken molecular oxygen adsorption while stabilizing hydroxyl adsorption for ORR suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>Corrosion of Calcium Metal in Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc Electrolyte and its Solution via Alloy Interface and Competitive Solvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We revealed two types of corrosion of calcium metal in 0.3&#160;m Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc electrolytes: native passivation between Ca metal and DMAc solvent during initial aging and electrochemical corrosion between Ca metal and TFSI&#8722; anion upon charging/discharging afterwards. Bearing those failure mechanisms in mind, we proposed additive strategy to simultaneously mitigate both corrosion types through in situ alloying and competitive Ca2&#8314;&#8208;I&#8315; interactions.








Abstract
Calcium metal batteries (CMBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to calcium&#8216;s abundance and high theoretical capacity, but hindered by poor compatibility between electrolyte and calcium metal. Here, we unveil two corrosion types of calcium in calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide)/dimethylacetamide [Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc]&#160;electrolytes: native passivation from solvent reduction during aging and electrochemical corrosion from anion decomposition. The native passivation layer aggravates the electrochemical corrosion by the decomposition of TFSI&#8722; to the large grain Ca2+&#8208;insulator CaF2, leading to the calcium metal failure.

     alt="Corrosion of Calcium Metal in Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc Electrolyte and its Solution via Alloy Interface and Competitive Solvation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We revealed two types of corrosion of calcium metal in 0.3&#160;m Ca(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/DMAc electrolytes: native passivation between Ca metal and DMAc solvent during initial aging and electrochemical corrosion between Ca metal and TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion upon charging/discharging afterwards. Bearing those failure mechanisms in mind, we proposed additive strategy to simultaneously mitigate both corrosion types through in situ alloying and competitive Ca&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;-I&#8315; interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium metal batteries (CMBs) are promising for large-scale energy storage due to calcium&#8216;s abundance and high theoretical capacity, but hindered by poor compatibility between electrolyte and calcium metal. Here, we unveil two corrosion types of calcium in calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide)/dimethylacetamide [Ca(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/DMAc]&#160;electrolytes: native passivation from solvent reduction during aging and electrochemical corrosion from anion decomposition. The native passivation layer aggravates the electrochemical corrosion by the decomposition of TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to the large grain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-insulator CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to the calcium metal failure. We introduce a bifunctional SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte additive to simultaneously mitigate both corrosions. Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; facilitate the spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction to form the Ca-Sn alloy, inhibiting native passivation, while I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; replace TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to participate in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; primary solvation shell and prevent the electrochemical TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition.

         <title>Synthesis of Chirally Chimeric Protein Nanoparticle Vaccines via Mirror&#8208;Image Spy Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study illustrates a versatile strategy for creating chirally chimeric protein constructs by merging natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) protein motifs through a combination of L&#8208;sortase&#8208;mediated transpeptidation and D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8208;mediated ligation. This approach has enabled the development of protein nanoparticle vaccines with improved stability and the ability to elicit potent antibody responses.








Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image proteins and nucleic acids exhibit remarkable biostability and bioorthogonality, offering a promising strategy to enhance the longevity of biological therapeutics. Here, we present a modular approach for constructing complex protein architectures that integrate both natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) motifs. Key to this strategy is the development of D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8212;a chemically synthesized, chirally inverted ligase that enables the efficient conjugation of D&#8208;SpyTag and D&#8208;BDTag. By exploiting the achirality of glycine (Gly), we used L&#8208;sortase to covalently link D&#8208;peptides (e.g., SpyTag or BDTag, bearing an N&#8208;terminal poly&#8208;Gly motif) to L&#8208;proteins (e.g., GFP, VLP&#8208;forming Mi3, or antigens) containing a C&#8208;terminal LPXTG sorting signal. The resulting D&#8208;SpyTagged and D&#8208;BDTagged proteins were further assembled via D&#8208;SpyStapler. This method enabled the construction of chirally chimeric VLP vaccines displaying antigens derived from malaria parasites and coronaviruses in various forms&#8212;recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides&#8212;providing significant flexibility and modularity for vaccine design. The resulting chirally hybrid vaccines exhibited enhanced proteolytic resistance in vitro and elicited potent immune responses in vivo. This study provides a versatile platform for developing long&#8208;acting therapeutics and vaccines.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Ammonia Synthesis via Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Using Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Atomic Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism shown in nitrite reductase with dual&#8208;atomic Cu sites, a PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC catalyst specifically engineered for gram&#8208;scale ammonia production was designed. The Cu dual&#8208;atomic sites facilitate the rapid transfer of *H, thus diminishing the protonation energy barrier of *NO intermediate species and consequently resulting in considerable ammonia production.








Abstract
The potential application prospects of green electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO&#8323;RR) technology for the production of valuable ammonia have garnered widespread attention. However, designing electrocatalysts with remarkable activity and stability for the NO&#8323;RR to realize gram&#8208;level ammonia production remains a significant hurdle in terms of practical application. In nature, the synergistic effect of the dual&#8208;site copper of nitrite reductase promotes the substrate adsorption and protonation, achieving efficient conversion of nitrite. Herein, enzyme&#8208;inspired Cu dual&#8208;atomic sites are constructed on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC). Systematic investigations indicate the dual&#8208;atomic Cu sites in the catalyst exhibit stronger proton transfer and synergistic nitrate adsorption interaction, thereby reducing the energy barrier for *NO protonation. Studies have shown that the PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC catalyst presents a remarkable ammonia (NH&#8323;) yield (467&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 cat. and 102&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and achieves 11&#160;g d&#8722;1 NH&#8323; yield at 6 A of current for 360&#160;h. This work demonstrates the concept of mimicking natural nitrite reductase toward the continuous reduction of nitrate wastewater and promotes the production of NH3.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Benzannulation of Oxaquadricyclanes Promoted by a Polyoxometalate Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Polyoxometalate {Mo&#8327;O&#8322;&#8324;@&#947;&#8208;FeO(OH)}&#8208;catalyzed benzannulation of in situ generated oxaquadricyclane was achieved under visible light irradiation. The Anderson&#8208;type [Mo&#8327;O&#8322;&#8324;]&#8310;&#8315; anions enhance the stability of the photoactive &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore, offering superior thermal and oxidative stability. This novel photocatalyst enabled the synthesis of benzindene and dihydrophenanthrene from dienyl sulfoxonium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes.








Abstract
Given the significance of strain&#8208;release reactions, various spring&#8208;loaded molecules have emerged as important building blocks in diverse fields of chemical science. Despite progress in this area, oxaquadricyclanes remain an understudied class of molecules. In the present report, the strain energy of in situ generated oxaquadricyclane was utilized for benzannulation reaction, which was photocatalyzed by a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based photocatalyst ({Mo&#8327;O24@&#947;&#8208;FeO(OH)}), in which the Anderson&#8208;type polyoxomolybdate [Mo&#8327;O&#8322;&#8324;]&#8310;&#8315; anions enhance the stability of photoactive &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. The band alignment of this POM&#8208;based complete inorganic semiconductor enables the harvesting of photons from visible light and provides superior thermal and oxidative stability while addressing the cost and performance limitations of conventional organo&#8208;photocatalysts. Using this novel photocatalyst, we successfully synthesized benzindene and dihydrophenanthrene scaffolds from dienyl sulfoxonium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes through unusual photochemical rearrangements. These benzannulated compounds are notable for their structural similarity to bioactive aromatic steroids and demonstrate their potential as lead candidates for therapeutic development. Through systematic optimization and mechanistic studies, we highlight the critical role of the POM catalyst, the challenges of controlling strain energy&#8208;driven reactivity, and the selective rearrangement of oxaquadricyclane scaffolds.

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Mediated Luminophore Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The choice of anion selectively directs the solution&#8208;state aggregation of a cationic luminophore, dictating its photoluminescence. Some anions cause emission from a monomeric state, some induce excimer formation, and others lead to dimers, while the triflate counterion gives multichromatic emission from all three species.








Abstract
Emissive organic salts have long been integral to the discovery of fluorescence phenomena and functional luminescent dyes. Typically, one component of the salt acts as the photoactive unit (luminophore) and its nonemissive counterion is selected to independently tune bulk physical properties, such as solubility. However, the impact of counterion choice on the aggregation and resulting emissive state of organic salts in solution has not been widely investigated. Here, we report that a single cationic luminophore gives rise to either monomer, dimer, excimer, or multichromatic emission under otherwise identical conditions by varying only its counterion. We employ N&#8208;methyl quininium (MeQn+) as a permanently charged cationic luminophore, which we pair with a series of monovalent anions. At low solution&#8208;state concentrations, all the salts give identical absorption and emission spectra that correlate with the MeQn+ monomer. However, at higher concentrations, the emission, excitation, and absorption data differ, revealing the presence of monomer, dimer, excimer, or all three, depending on the structure of the anion. Understanding and modulating the formation of dimeric or other well&#8208;defined aggregated species by specific ion effects could be exploited in the design of molecular probes for biological systems or emissive thin&#8208;film dispersions for optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Emissive organic salts have long been integral to the discovery of fluorescence phenomena and functional luminescent dyes. Typically, one component of the salt acts as the photoactive unit (luminophore) and its nonemissive counterion is selected to independently tune bulk physical properties, such as solubility. However, the impact of counterion choice on the aggregation and resulting emissive state of organic salts in solution has not been widely investigated. Here, we report that a single cationic luminophore gives rise to either monomer, dimer, excimer, or multichromatic emission under otherwise identical conditions by varying only its counterion. We employ &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl quininium (&lt;b&gt;MeQn&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as a permanently charged cationic luminophore, which we pair with a series of monovalent anions. At low solution-state concentrations, all the salts give identical absorption and emission spectra that correlate with the &lt;b&gt;MeQn&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monomer. However, at higher concentrations, the emission, excitation, and absorption data differ, revealing the presence of monomer, dimer, excimer, or all three, depending on the structure of the anion. Understanding and modulating the formation of dimeric or other well-defined aggregated species by specific ion effects could be exploited in the design of molecular probes for biological systems or emissive thin-film dispersions for optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Twisting Chiral Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Macrocycles into a Microhelix with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) active macrocycle structures (CP1, CP2) were designed and synthesized. Compared to the macrocycle RCP2 containing phenyl spacers, the rigid RCP1 macrocycle self&#8208;assembled into left&#8208;handed microhelix by body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) supramolecular packing with left&#8208;handed tendency, resulting in circularly polarized luminescence materials with high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) value. 








Abstract
The design and assembly of chiral macrocycles remain an underexplored frontier in supramolecular science. In this study, we synthesized a pair of enantiomeric macrocyclic molecules (CP1) through the condensation of chiral cyclohexanediamine with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) dialdehyde. These molecules exhibited remarkable circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties at the supramolecular level. Through supramolecular assembly in mixed solvent systems, we achieved a rare micron&#8208;scale helical structure, exhibiting a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.32&#8212;one of the highest values reported to date for macrocyclic self&#8208;assemblies. Furthermore, by designing a chiral macrocycle with phenyl spacers (CP2), we revealed that the confinement of macrocycles and restricted internal molecular rotation are critical for achieving high glum values and helical structure formation. This work not only advances the design of chiral macrocycles but also provides new insights into the relationship between molecular structure and supramolecular assembly, paving the way for the development of advanced chiral materials with potential applications in optics, sensing, and nanotechnology.

         <title>Photoswitchable Catalytic Divergent Synthesis by a Viologen&#8208;Functionalized Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Tetrahedral Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here a viologen&#8208;functionalized lanthanide&#8208;organic coordination cage with photo&#8208;redox activities, representing the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage.








Abstract
Photoswitchable catalysis presents a significant challenge, particularly in the modulation of reaction pathways. In this study, we describe a redox&#8208;active lanthanide&#8208;organic tetrahedral cage 1, self&#8208;assembled from a viologen&#8208;functionalised ditopic tridentate ligand and Eu(III) ions. Complexation&#8208;induced charge redistribution and spatial rearrangement of ligands in the assembly endow 1 with distinct photochromic properties and redox activities compared to free ligand L. 1 can serve as a photoswitchable catalyst for divergent chemical transformations of various tetraarylborates, giving biaryls and phenols via photo&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction under 365&#160;nm light irradiation, or producing mono&#8208;arene products through catalytic de&#8208;composition process in the absence of light. This work represents the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, paving the way for the design and construction of novel supramolecular edifices with switchable functions.

         <title>Selective Chemo&#8208;Divergent Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate Enabled by Multi&#8208;Functional Poly(Ionic Liquids)&#8208;Stabilized Ru Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and selective chemo&#8208;divergent hydrogenation of cyclic carbonates is promoted by in situ generated poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;stabilized ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru@PIL) catalysts. Under solvent&#8208;free conditions, ethylene carbonate is transformed into either ethylene glycol and CH4 or EtOH and CO2, following a &#8220;direct hydrogenation&#8221; or a &#8220;hydrogenative decarboxylation&#8221; pathway, respectively.








Abstract
Cyclic carbonates, in particular ethylene carbonate (EC), are pivotal compounds across chemical sciences because of their unique properties. Although, their transformation into valuable products has attracted great attention, efficient and selective transformations remain challenging. In this work, we report a catalytic system composed of Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs) stabilized by poly(ionic liquids) (Ru@PIL), that enables the selective chemo&#8208;divergent hydrogenation of EC into either EtOH and CO2 or EG and CH4, under solvent&#8208;free conditions. Those transformations relied on the multi&#8208;task ability of poly(ionic liquids) (PILs), which provides efficient electro&#8208;steric protection of the NPs, good solubility in neat carbonates, and organocatalytic activity depending on the nature of the PIL counter&#8208;anions. Hence, PIL incorporating nucleophilic anions, such as I&#8722;, triggers the cascade transformation of EC into EtOH via a sequential decarboxylation&#8208;hydrogenation process. Conversely, in the presence of non&#8208;nucleophilic anions, the PIL is catalytically a spectator, yielding to the &#8220;direct hydrogenation&#8221; of EC by the RuNPs.

         <title>Embedded&#8208;Type Cu Nanoparticle with Largely Enhanced Catalytic Activity and Stability Toward Methanol Steam Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst with a unique embedded structure was prepared via an interface reconstruction strategy, which exhibited an extraordinary catalytic performance and stability toward hydrogen production from methanol steam reforming. A CH3OH conversion of 99.3% and an H2 production rate of 124.6&#160;&#181;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 were obtained with a 400&#160;h stream&#8208;on&#8208;line stability, which was preponderant to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. 








Abstract
Hydrogen production through low&#8208;temperature methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction plays a critical role in the development of new energy but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst, which is prepared via an interface reconstruction strategy. Interestingly, this catalyst is featured with a unique mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon structure: Cu nanoparticles are embedded into the Zn(Ga)Ox substrate, which ensures a stable Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Cu+&#8211;Ov&#8211;Ga&#948;+ interface structure. The resulting Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst exhibits 99.3% CH3OH conversion with an H2 production rate of 124.6&#160;&#181;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at 225&#160;&#176;C, which is preponderant to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Furthermore, an ultra&#8208;high catalytic stability was demonstrated through a 400&#160;h stream&#8208;on&#8208;line test without obvious decline. Kinetic isotope analysis, in situ spectroscopy characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveal that the MSR reaction over Cu/Zn(Ga)Ox catalyst follows the formaldehyde oxidation route. The CH3O* and H2O molecule adsorb at the adjacent Cu+&#8722;Ov interface (intrinsic active site) with an oxygen&#8208;terminal adsorption configuration, which promotes electron transfer from the d&#8208;band center of Cu to the O (s,p)&#8208;band of the substrate molecule. This significantly reduces the energy barrier of C&#9472;H bond cleavage in CH3O* dehydrogenation (the rate&#8208;determining step) and H2O dissociation, accounting for the extraordinarily enhanced H2 production.

         <title>Regioreversed Carbosulfenylation of Fluoroalkenes via Nickel&#8208;Mediated Radical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbosulfenylation of olefins represents an important class of reactions for the synthesis of structurally diverse organosulfur compounds. Previous studies typically yield 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity. In the context of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis, accessing the regioreversed products is desirable, significantly broadening the scope of these reactions. In this study, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, using free thiols and benzyl bromides as sulfur and carbon sources, respectively. The unusual regioselectivity observed is enabled by a &#8216;radical sorting&#8217; mechanism. The Ni catalyst activates benzyl bromide to generate a benzylic radical that undergoes HAT with the thiol to form a sulfur&#8208;centered radical. The sulfur radical subsequently adds to the fluoroalkenes, resulting in an &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl C&#8208;radical. This radical undergoes SH2 with a Ni&#8211;CH2Ar to form a C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond and quaternary center, ultimately producing valuable fluoroalkyl thioethers. Isotopic labeling experiments corroborate a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event within the working mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Delocalized Cu2+ Activates Spin Channels in Spinel Oxides to Selectively Produce 1O2 for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blocked electron transfer in the catalyst during advanced oxidation processes causes sluggish singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency and sacrifices catalyst stability. In this work, we propose an electron&#8208;delocalization strategy that unlocks ATd2+&#8208;O&#8208;BOh3+ electron&#8208;transfer pathways within spinel oxide (Cu0.8Fe2.2O4), inducing the intermolecular electron transfer of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selective 1O2 generation. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the electron&#8208;delocalized Cu2+ triggers a high spin&#8208;state of O in FeTd2+&#8208;O&#8208;FeOh3+, thus creating a spin channel for the spontaneous intermolecular electron transfer of PMS from the FeOh3+ adsorption site to the FeTd2+ adsorption site through FeTd2+&#8208;O&#8208;FeOh3+. This process allows for the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of PMS, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the formation of SO4&#8226;&#8211; and SO5&#8226;&#8211; radicals. Subsequently, the interfacial SO4&#8226;&#8211; rapidly oxidizes SO5&#8226;&#8211; into 1O2, enhancing 1O2 generation efficiency without sacrificing catalyst stability. The selectivity of 1O2 in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system reaches 98.4%. Multiple pollutants are removed in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system without interference from coexisting substances. The scale&#8208;up experiment realizes 100% contaminant removal during the continuous operation process (48 h). This work exhibits a novel strategy for selective 1O2 generation to achieve the goal of practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Atom La2 Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare earth lanthanum element has large atomic radius, multi&#8208;shell orbital electrons, and Fenton&#8208;like reaction inertia, on which a localized high&#8208;coordination structure can be easily formed for the favorable adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, for single&#8208;atom lanthanum sites, due to the loss of all the outmost s and d electrons, the practically vacuous outmost orbitals are stable but sleepy for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we synthesize a novel dual&#8208;atom La catalyst onto N&#8208;doped graphene (La2&#8208;NG) by a Joule ultrafast heating method, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.893 V for the ORR. The La2&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrates a great open circuit voltage of 1.52 V and a maximal power density of 192 mW cm&#8722;2. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the change of valence states of La and the dynamic structural evolution of La2&#8208;N6 moiety embedded onto the graphene during the ORR, through which the adsorption/desorption of oxygen reduction intermediates can be reasonably regulated. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the La2&#8208;N6 structure can decrease the reaction energy barrier and promote charge transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Persistent Lithium Protection and Revival with Dissolution&#8208;Equilibrium&#8208;Driven Sustainable Additives Reservoir</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a dissolution equilibrium&#8208;driven AgI additive reservoir that provides a durable lithium protection. The sustainably released trace amounts of Ag+ and I&#8722; promote a constantly stable interphase on the anode and facilitate the reactivating of inactive lithium. The practical pouch cells utilizing this strategy demonstrate a prolonged cycle life over 200 cycles with 82% capacity retention.








Abstract
Additive chemistry plays a pivotal role in enhancing the cycling stability of lithium metal batteries. Conventional additives with high solubility facilitate the formation of a stable interface in the early stages of cycling, yet typically act as &#8220;sacrificial agents&#8221;, failing to maintain a durable interface over long time. Herein, we demonstrate a sustainable lithium protection and retrieval strategy based on additive reservoirs driven by chemical dissolution equilibrium. A sparingly soluble AgI coating on the separator provides a continuous supply of constant concentration of Ag+ and I&#8722;, where Ag+ contributes to the formation of a Li&#8211;Ag alloy interphase, promoting uniform Li deposition, while I&#8722; assisting in the recovery of inactive Li. With this strategy, symmetric Li||Li batteries deliver an extended cycle life over of 1000 h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Additionally, practical pouch cells demonstrate a prolonged cycle life of over 200 cycles with 82% capacity retention. This work offers new insights into additive chemistry and paves the way for the development of durable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Lattice Compression&#8208;Driven Electron Localization and Ir&#8208;O Coupling Synergistically Enable Ultralow Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high chemical stability of Li2CO3 severely impedes its decomposition, limiting the efficiency of the CO2 evolution reaction. Herein, a lattice compression strategy is employed to enhance electronic localization, accelerating CO2 reduction, and strengthening Ir&#8211;O coupling, which induces low&#8208;crystallinity Li2CO3 formation. This approach significantly reduces overpotential and extends battery cycle life.








Abstract
Developing efficient cathode catalysts plays a crucial role in improving the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER) kinetics in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. However, the chemical stability of the wide&#8208;bandgap insulator Li2CO3 severely hinders the CO2ER. To address this challenge, this study proposes a lattice compression strategy in which electronic localization accelerates the CO2RR, thereby enhancing Ir&#8211;O coupling and inducing the formation of low&#8208;crystallinity Li2CO3, ultimately optimizing the CO2ER process. This approach enables the Li&#8211;CO2 battery to achieve an ultralow overpotential of 0.33&#160;V and an exceptionally high energy efficiency of &#8764;88.7%. Moreover, even after over 1100 h of operation, the battery maintains a stable charging potential of 3.3&#160;V, representing the best performance reported to date. Through in situ and ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations, we reveal that lattice compression leads to changes in the coordination environment, thereby enhancing electronic localization effects. This accelerates Li+ migration near the catalyst surface, facilitating its rapid participation in CO2RR. Subsequently, the strengthened Ir&#8211;O coupling modulates the symmetry of Li2CO3 molecules, reduces their crystallinity, and ultimately promotes their efficient decomposition. This study provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance bidirectional cathode catalysts through crystal facet engineering.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Catenane&#8208;Branched Dendrimers with Tunable Dimension for Reversible Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;generation catenane&#8208;branched dendrimers with up to twenty&#8208;one [2]catenane branches have been precisely constructed through a controllable divergent approach, not only achieving the construction of novel high&#8208;order catenane dendrimers with well&#8208;defined topological arrangements, but also providing a new platform for dynamic multifunctional supramolecular materials.








Abstract
To tackle the challenge of the precise construction of catenane&#8208;based mechanically interlocked macromolecules with well&#8208;defined topological arrangements, starting from a novel [2]catenane building block with dendrimer growth sites, catenane&#8208;branched dendrimers have been precisely constructed via an efficient and controllable divergent approach. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, the third&#8208;generation dendrimer which consists of twenty&#8208;one [2]catenane branches is the most complicated discrete [2]catenane oligomer synthesized to date. Interestingly, the switchable coconformation transformations of [2]catenane branches triggered by sodium ions and cryptands lead to an integrated and amplified expansion&#8211;contraction motion of the resultant dendrimers, achieving reversible size regulation at the nanoscale. The unique recognition sites of the resultant catenane&#8208;branched dendrimers also facilitate the reversible binding of drug and dye guests. This work not only addresses the synthetic challenge of highly branched catenane dendrimers but also provides a new platform for dynamic supramolecular functional materials.

         <title>All Iron&#8208;Group and Platinum&#8208;Group Elements Metal High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles containing nine late transition elements adjacent on the periodic table (Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt) are synthesized using a simple, low&#8208;temperature wet chemical method. Compared to nanoparticles containing only precious platinum&#8208;group metals, adding the cheap and earth&#8208;abundant iron&#8208;group metals into the alloy results in superior activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEA) are promising catalyst materials for important energy transformations. So far, the focus has been on platinum&#8208;group metals, which possess excellent catalytic performance and similar properties, thus being easy to synthesize. However, incorporating more abundant and cheaper elements is preferable for large&#8208;scale applications and is fundamentally more interesting, as elements with different properties are expected to greatly affect the structural and electronic characteristics of the resulting alloy. Unfortunately, significant differences in elemental properties greatly complicate the synthesis and require extreme reaction conditions. In this work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles containing the nine neighboring elements used most often in heterogeneous catalysis: all the iron&#8208;group metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) and all the platinum&#8208;group metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt) through a simple low&#8208;temperature solution process. Remarkably, alloying the iron&#8208;group base metals with the platinum&#8208;group metals results in 30% increase in the catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions (TOF@25&#160;mV&#160;=&#160;1.58 s&#8722;1) compared to the equivalent alloy containing only platinum&#8208;group metals conditions (TOF@25&#160;mV&#160;=&#160;1.2 s&#8722;1). This activity is three times that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (TOF@25&#160;mV&#160;=&#160;0.58 s&#8722;1), demonstrating simultaneous reduction in precious metal content and performance enhancement of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Articular Cartilage Inspired Ultra&#8208;Strong and Tough Bio&#8208;Based Polyurethane Nanofiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic crystalline bio&#8208;based nanofiber membrane is constructed via a rigid&#8208;flexible coupled supramolecular network strategy. The nanofiber membrane exhibits a three&#8208;stage fracture mechanism during the stress process. demonstrating exceptional mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based polyurethanes are promising sustainable elastomers whose polymeric network structure has a decisive impact on their properties. However, existing bio&#8208;based polyurethanes face challenges in simultaneously enhancing mechanical strength and toughness. Inspired by the multilevel heterogeneous structure of articular cartilage, we propose a bionic design strategy of rigid&#8208;flexible coupled supramolecular cross&#8208;linking networks to prepare bio&#8208;based polyurethane elastomers with enhanced strength and toughness. By incorporating the asymmetric coupling of rigid furan rings and flexible aliphatic side chains into the molecular chains, a dynamic hydrogen bond network with a gradient distribution of bond energy was constructed, achieving uniform microphase separation between the soft phase (amorphous) and the hard phase (crystalline). Nanofiber membranes were fabricated by rigid&#8208;flexible coupled polyurethane electrospinning, where the microphase&#8208;separated structure is further transformed into dynamic crystalline domains. Under external force, multilevel energy dissipation is achieved through the breaking and controllable recombination of hydrogen bonds within the crystalline domain. resulting in polyurethane nanofiber membranes with significantly enhanced mechanical strength and toughness (fracture strength: 31.37&#160;MPa, fracture strain: 731.04%, toughness: 102.13&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). This network design strategy expands the potential of bio&#8208;based elastomers in smart wearable textiles, flexible electronic devices, and biomedical applications, thereby advancing the development of sustainable high&#8208;performance polymers.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Lattice Selenium in Electrocatalytic Self&#8208;Reconstruction for Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides insights into the cathode reconstruction of CoP perturbed by Se and unveils the Se&#8208;accelerated two&#8208;stage structural evolution by operando techniques. As a result, the reconstructed Se&#8208;CoP achieves a performance breakthrough for transition metal phosphides in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Cathode reconstruction is equally crucial for water electrolysis, yet it has received less attention than anode. Lattice selenium (Se) doping is an effective strategy to improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in cathodes, but many fundamental questions concerning the actual role of Se on the active species as well as catalytic kinetics remain to be clarified, especially in those electrocatalytic self&#8208;reconstruction systems. Here, we showcase the accelerated two&#8208;stage structural evolution of Se&#8208;doped cobalt phosphide (Se&#8208;CoP) during alkaline HER by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the in situ formed dual&#8208;component heterostructure of highly crystalline Co(OH)2 and robust Co nanoclusters, which are decorated with residual Se, is responsible for the high HER performance. The reconstructed Se&#8208;CoP on carbon cloth delivers a low overpotential of 79 &#177; 2&#160;mV at 100 mA&#160;&#183;&#160;cm&#8722;2 and achieves an impressive charge transfer amount of 6.3&#160;&#215;&#160;105 C cm&#8722;2 operating at 500 mA cm&#8722;2, surpassing the reported electrocatalysts constructed by non&#8208;noble metal phosphides. This work provides brand&#8208;new perspectives on the self&#8208;reconstruction perturbed by heteroatoms for well&#8208;designed composite electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ultrafast (600&#160;ps) Vacuum&#8208;UV Reflective Scintillation Enabled by Surface Exciton Recombination in Layered Perovskite PEA2PbBr4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is the first to report the ultrafast (600&#160;ps) decay time of the layered perovskite PEA2PbBr4 and its mechanism. The ultrashort photon penetration length in PEA2PbBr4 SC under vacuum&#8208;UV light generates a high&#8208;density exciton population on the crystal surface, significantly increasing the radiative recombination and nonradiative recombination probability. This highlights the potential application of PEA2PbBr4 SC in the VUV field.








Abstract
Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodetection is pivotal for space exploration and radiation monitoring, yet its dynamic imaging capability is significantly hindered by the slow response of conventional scintillators. However, existing scintillators exhibit microsecond&#8208;to&#8208;nanosecond decay time, failing to meet sub&#8208;nanosecond ultrafast imaging demands. Here, we uncovered a surface exciton recombination mechanism in layered perovskite PEA2PbBr4, where lattice contraction induced exciton localization, achieving ultrafast decay time of 600&#160;ps&#8212;over 100&#8208;fold faster than commercial scintillation. A reflective optical configuration was designed to suppress self&#8208;absorption, improving the light utilization efficiency.

     alt="Ultrafast (600&#160;ps) Vacuum-UV Reflective Scintillation Enabled by Surface Exciton Recombination in Layered Perovskite PEA2PbBr4"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is the first to report the ultrafast (600&#160;ps) decay time of the layered perovskite PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and its mechanism. The ultrashort photon penetration length in PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SC under vacuum-UV light generates a high-density exciton population on the crystal surface, significantly increasing the radiative recombination and nonradiative recombination probability. This highlights the potential application of PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SC in the VUV field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodetection is pivotal for space exploration and radiation monitoring, yet its dynamic imaging capability is significantly hindered by the slow response of conventional scintillators. However, existing scintillators exhibit microsecond-to-nanosecond decay time, failing to meet sub-nanosecond ultrafast imaging demands. Here, we uncovered a surface exciton recombination mechanism in layered perovskite PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where lattice contraction induced exciton localization, achieving ultrafast decay time of 600&#160;ps&#8212;over 100-fold faster than commercial scintillation. A reflective optical configuration was designed to suppress self-absorption, improving the light utilization efficiency. This work established a material paradigm for ultrafast dynamic imaging and opens avenues for advancing space science and high-energy physics detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aluminum Distribution in Ferrierite Zeolites Influences the Performance of Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FER&#8208;type aluminosilicate zeolites with preferential Al occupancy at T4 site favor direct methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol oxidation, while those with&#160;Al concentrated at T3 sites within 10&#8208;ring channels facilitate tandem conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol on oxidative sites, followed by methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons on acidic sites.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free aluminosilicate FER&#8208;type zeolite has been demonstrated to effectively catalyze methane to methanol using N2O as the oxidant with distorted tetra&#8208;coordinated aluminum (AlIV&#8208;2) and penta&#8208;coordinated aluminum (AlV) as potential active sites. However, the specific effects of Al distribution on the active Al species have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, aluminosilicate FER&#8208;type zeolites with controllable Al distribution were developed. Al distribution, including the arrangement and location of Al atoms, was characterized using 27Al MQMAS/MAS and 29Si MAS NMR spectra. The arrangement of aluminum, particularly the isolated Al and paired Al in as&#8208;synthesized samples, influenced the proximity between oxidative and acidic sites in H&#8208;type samples. Al locations involved the specific positioning of bifunctional sites and affected the final product. The increased CH4 conversion at 250&#8211;275 &#176;C of FER zeolite with Al preferential population at T4 sites confirmed the higher activity of Al species from T4 sites. Additionally, a higher proportion of Al atoms in 10&#8208;ring channels facilitated the tandem conversion of methane to methanol on oxidative sites, followed by methanol to hydrocarbons on acidic sites at 300&#8211;375&#160;&#176;C. This study corroborated and expanded upon our recent research and highlighted the significant impact of Al distribution in FER zeolite on methane oxidation.

         <title>Phosphorylation Regulation Promotes Bidirectional Dynamic Adaptive Interface for Achieving Stable Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular phosphorylation strategy is taken for optimizing zinc&#8211;iodine batteries. The produced phosphorylated additive enables a self&#8208;constructing dynamic interface for guiding homogeneous Zn2+ kinetic transfer and balancing pH environment at the anode while real&#8208;time capturing polyiodides at the cathode simultaneously.








Abstract
Unstable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces resulting from severe cathodic polyiodide shuttling, anodic parasitic corrosion reactions, and dendrite growth significantly impede the performance of zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries. Here, phosphorylation regulation is proposed to create dynamically adaptive water&#8208;lean interfaces for long&#8208;term Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. Phosphorylation reinforces the adaptive interface construction through the increased adsorption capability on the Zn anode and introduces a dynamic pH&#8208;balancing capability while simultaneously offering extra sites for the real&#8208;time capture of polyiodide intermediates at the cathode. Consequently, extended durability (4400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), boosted coulombic efficiency (99.8% for 7500 cycles), and ultralong cycling for 8000 cycles at a high loading of 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 were maintained. These findings provide crucial insights into the optimization of adaptive interfaces through phosphorylation regulation for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>A Recyclable Cooperative Approach for Selective Lithium Recovery from Industrial&#8208;Grade Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Black Mass via Oxidative Delithiation and Complexation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel method to extract lithium selectively from spent LIBs under mild conditions. The cooperative actions of anthraquinone ligand with H2O2 generate reactive oxygen species that drive oxidative delithiation with concurrent lithium abstraction and coordination by the ligand, enabling efficient and rapid lithium extraction.








Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively from an industrial&#8208;grade lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) black mass having multiple metal ions is challenging but crucial from an industrial standpoint. However, most of the methods involve harsh conditions and sacrificial reagents, are energy&#8208;intensive and time&#8208;consuming, and generate secondary pollution. This study presents a lithium selective, ligand&#8208;assisted cooperative approach for the selective leaching of lithium under mild conditions. It is revealed that the synergistic actions of anthraquinone salt (Na2AQAc) and H2O2 generate highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as &#8226;OH, &#8226;O2&#8722;, and 1O2 that facilitate oxidative delithiation supported by spin trapping EPR and quenching experiments. As a result, a phase transition of cathode material and concurrent lithium abstraction by the ligand, forming an octanuclear lithium complex ([Li8(AQAc2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH2)2(H2O)12]4+) in the leachate was observed. Consequently, a leaching efficiency of 97% with over 99% selectivity was achieved under the optimized conditions of 3.5% H2O2 (v/v), 30&#160;&#176;C, 72&#160;mM Na2AQAc, 40&#160;g L&#8722;1 pulp density, and a reaction time of 1&#160;h. A recycling strategy was demonstrated to recover anthraquinone acid, and lithium was separated as high&#8208;purity Li&#8322;CO&#8323;. This method offers the advantages of room&#8208;temperature operation, neutral pH conditions, shorter time duration, minimal reagent usage, and the ability to recycle the reagents.

         <title>Highly Efficient Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Polymerization Enabled by Direct Transmetalation with Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The longstanding challenge of competitive protodeboronation side reactions has critically hindered the synthetic utility of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings in polymer science. We herein report an optimized Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling polymerization protocol that enables efficient synthesis of device&#8208;grade conjugated polymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a novel pathway involving direct transmetalation of boronic esters plays a pivotal role in the success of the polymerization.








Abstract
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction plays a pivotal role in the construction of carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, utilizing low&#8208;toxicity and readily available organoboron substrates. However, competitive protodeboronation of arylboronic acids has significantly limited its synthetic applications, particularly in the synthesis of optoelectronic polymer materials. Herein, a novel sulfonium salt&#8208;mediated Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling protocol is developed to synthesize high&#8208;quality &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs). The universality of this method was exemplified by successfully synthesizing twelve CPs with various electrophiles and nucleophiles. Impressively, the synthesized CPs exhibited enhanced optoelectronic properties, e.g., charge carrier mobilities, compared to those synthesized by traditional methods. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that direct transmetalation of boronic esters without prior conversion to more reactive intermediates play a critical role in this protocol, thus avoiding the problematic deboronation associated with unstable boronic acids. This method provides an environmentally benign approach to synthesize device&#8208;quality CPs.

         <title>An Integrated Tandem&#8208;Structured Separator Enables Dual&#8208;Enhanced Stable Interfaces for Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life and High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>

The integrated tandem&#8208;structured ISO&#160;+&#160;Co@CNF separator is designed to enable dual&#8208;enhanced stable interfaces in high&#8208;capacity AZIBs. The anode&#8208;side ISO layer works based on the buffer&#8208;release&#8208;repair mechanism, simultaneously neutralizing OH&#8722; from HER and dynamically releasing soluble indium species to repair interface environment. Meanwhile, the cathode&#8208;side Co@CNF layer effectively anchors polyiodide and catalyzes conversion kinetics. Consequently, zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with the ISO&#160;+&#160;Co@CNF separator achieve a high areal capacity of 2.97 mAh cm&#8722;2 and remarkable cycling stability over 20&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (AZIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to their inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, unstable interfacial chemistry manifested as polyiodide formation and accumulation at the cathode, alongside dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the anode results in capacity loss. Moreover, polyiodide migration toward the anode further triggers severe Zn corrosion, exacerbating interfacial instability. Herein, we design an integrated tandem&#8208;structured separator comprising an In2O3&#8208;SiO2 (ISO) layer with a buffer&#8208;release&#8208;repair mechanism and a polyiodide adsorption&#8211;catalysis layer featuring Co nanoparticles&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanofiber (Co@CNF) to achieve dual&#8208;enhanced stable interfaces. Specifically, amphoteric In2O3 within the ISO layer effectively neutralizes OH&#8315; generated by localized HER, concurrently releasing soluble indium species. These indium species subsequently electrodeposit to form zincophilic and HER&#8208;inhibiting sites on the affected regions, restoring interfacial environment and mitigating Zn anode degradation. Meanwhile, the Co@CNF layer anchors polyiodides and significantly catalyzes conversion kinetics, suppressing the shuttle effect and preventing polyiodide&#8208;induced anode corrosion. Benefiting from the synergistic stabilization of both electrode interfaces, the as&#8208;fabricated Zn||ISO&#160;+&#160;Co@CNF||I2 full cells achieve a high areal capacity of 2.97 mAh cm&#8722;2 and remarkable cycling stability over 20&#160;000 cycles. This work provides valuable insights into designing functional separators for practical AZIBs.

         <title>Advancing Sulfinyl Radical Chemistry: An Asymmetric Smiles Rearrangement with Chiral Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, asymmetric sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement enables the enantioselective trifunctionalization of chiral sulfoxides via radical addition, 1,5&#8208;aryl migration, and sulfinyl radical interception. By tuning the redox potentials of key components, this cascade forms two C&#9472;C and one C&#9472;S bond in a single step, yielding enantioenriched sulfoxides and sulfones (up to 96:4 er) that can be further diversified into complex motifs.








Abstract
Chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl amides have recently emerged as powerful reagents for asymmetric, radical&#8208;mediated Smiles rearrangements, imparting excellent levels of relative and absolute stereocontrol in the intra&#8208; and intermolecular translocation of aryl groups. Here, we capitalize on the much more readily available and abundant chiral sulfoxides, which, in combination with radical precursors and alkylating reagents, afford enantioenriched sulfur&#8208;containing molecules via a photocatalytic multicomponent asymmetric sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement with retention of &#8220;SO&#8221;. This cascade process involves radical addition, a stereocontrolled 1,5&#8208;aryl migration, and subsequent C&#9472;S bond formation, forging two new C&#9472;C bonds and a C&#9472;S bond in a single step under mild conditions. The resulting enantioenriched sulfur&#8208;containing scaffolds are not only common in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds but also serve as versatile synthetic intermediates, as demonstrated by their efficient derivatization into diverse motifs.

         <title>Communicative Nanomotors Reprogram Cancer Cell Death via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomotors offer significant advantages over passive nanoparticles in biomedical applications. However, their potential has been largely restricted to cargo transport, with limited capacity for interaction with biological systems. Here, we present next&#8208;generation self&#8208;assembled nanomotors that not only exhibit chemotactic motility but also actively communicate with cells, reprogramming cell fate by inducing pyroptosis. These nanomotors are designed to respond to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment, triggering nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;driven propulsion and selective mitochondria targeting via triphenylphosphine (TPP) surface engineering. This interaction induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and activation of gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Furthermore, their chemotactic motility facilitates deeper tumor tissue penetration in 3D spheroids, demonstrating their ability to navigate physiological barriers. By shifting the paradigm from motility&#8208;driven to interactive nanomedicine, this study establishes a transformative platform for targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable yet Strongly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Anions Enabling Cooperative Catalysis with Cationic Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic transition metal complexes play a crucial role as catalysts in organic transformations. Their counter&#8208;anions often stand aside from the catalytic cycle or occasionally participate in the catalytic cycle as a Br&#248;nsted base due to their nucleophilic character. Herein, we developed a stable yet Lewis acidic anion, BBcat, based on tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and featuring Lewis acidic catechol borane moieties and applied it to transition metal catalysis to recognize Lewis basic substrates. Upon admixture with Bu4N&#8208;BBcat, 31P NMR chemical shift of O=PEt3 significantly lower&#8208;shifted implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a non&#8208;coordinating counter&#8208;anion. Ir/PHOX&#8208;BBcat exhibited an 8.2&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX&#8208;BArF consisting of the non&#8208;coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis basic sites, located at remote positions to the C&#8211;H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition metal center and the counter&#8208;anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Si/Carbon&#8208;dots with Surface N&#8208;C Sites Promoting Proton and Electron Transfers in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed through either a two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron pathway, both of which are important for a wide range of applications. The intermediate conversion of *O2&#8722; + H+ &#8594; *OOH recognized as the rate&#8208;determining step in ORR, with its efficiency strongly dependent on the nature of active sites at the surface of a catalyst. Herein, Si&#8208;supported carbon dots (Si&#8208;CDs) are introduced as co&#8208;catalysts in a photocatalytic system, where their nitrogen&#8208;carbon sites play a pivotal role in lowering the energy barrier for *OOH formation by promoting proton and electron transfers, thus enhancing the H2O2 production rate in ORR. This strategy is broadly applicable across a wide range of photocatalysts, both with and without use of sacrificial agents. The H2O2 production rate for Zn0.5Cd0.5S (30 mg) increased from 13.0 to 40.9 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 when 0.6 mg of Si&#8208;CDs were added. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations are conducted to reveal the reaction pathway and the reduced energy requirements for the *O2&#8722; + H+ &#8594; *OOH conversion. This study provides a unique example of overcoming a key barrier in ORR using a metal&#8208;free catalyst and promotes potential applications in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Activity of Cu4 Clusters Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands play a crucial role in modifying catalytic environments and enhancing performance through various mechanisms. However, the multivariate synergistic mechanisms, dynamic evolution patterns, and universal design principles of ligand effects remain to be thoroughly investigated. Metal clusters, with their atomically precise structures, serve as ideal models for studying ligand regulation mechanisms. Herein, we synthesized two copper clusters of N,S&#8208;bidentate ligand&#8208;protected Cu4(PTI)4 and Cu4(BTT)4 featuring identical metallic core structures but distinct ligand architectures, and evaluated their catalytic performance for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Notably, the Cu4(PTI)4 cluster with stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands achieved near&#8208;100% Faradaic efficiency at optimal potentials, significantly surpassing the Cu4(BTT)4. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we unveiled that enhancing the electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of ligands induces alterations in the local microenvironment and electronic structure of metal active sites, thereby exerting positive impacts on electrocatalytic NO3RR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Multilevel Chiroptical Activity in Organic Supramolecular Microcrystals for High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic materials are rapidly emerging as a promising platform for circularly polarized lasing. However, the lag in mechanistic research has severely hindered the development of organic circularly polarized lasers. Here, we attempt to probe multilevel chiroptical activity in organic supramolecular microcrystals for exploring high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. The evolution of chiroptical activity is tracked spanning from chiral molecular monomers to dimers to supramolecular helices. The crucial roles of excimers and supramolecular helices in achieving high optical gain and large chiroptical activity are revealed. Accordingly, circularly polarized lasing with low thresholds and large dissymmetry factors is realized in the organic supramolecular microcrystals. Our work marks the beginning of mechanistic research on chirality induced circularly polarized lasing, which will initiate the rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;temperature, High&#8208;voltage, Flame&#8208;retardant Electrolyte for 4.8V Li||NCM94 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries attract great interest, but their poor safety and cycling performance hinder their applications, especially with high cut&#8208;off voltage nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature, and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for Li|| LiNi0.94Co0.05Mn0.01O2 (NCM94) batteries with excellent cycling performance through constructing highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). Such CEI exhibits a gradual decrease in C&#8208;F and a gradient increase in LiF and LiBxOy from the outside to the inside, which effectively inhibits structural degradation of the NCM94 cathode. With an excellent CEI, Li|| NCM94 batteries show outstanding cycling stability and wide temperature applicability (&#8208;40~60 &#176;C). The battery could exhibit a capacity retention of 87 % after 200 cycles at 4.8 V, and deliver 112 % (or 56 %) of their room&#8208;temperature capacity at 60/&#8208;40 &#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, as&#8208;constructed 7.6 Ah pouch cell could run 145 cycles with an energy density of 541 Wh kg&#8208;1. This work provides the guidance on designing electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces for wide&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold and Bismuth Trimetallic Synergistic Redox Catalysis for Non&#8208;Directed C&#8208;H Arylation with Aryl Bismuth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of substituent effects plays an important role on the efficiency and regioselectivity toward C&#8208;H activation of non&#8208;directed arenes. Here, an unprecedented trimetallic synergistic redox catalysis system has been developed to achieve a highly efficient and orthogonal C&#8211;H arylation of non&#8208;directed arenes with aryl bismuth. Both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;deficient aryl bismuth can proceed C&#8208;H arylation readily, thus affording an elegant strategy for the synthesis of challenging electron&#8208;rich and sterically hindered biaryls by means of gold catalysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Bi(V) species generated in&#8208;situ from Ar&#8208;Bi(III) and NFSI is not only an arylating reagent but also an oxidant to form a critical Au(II)&#8208;Au(II)&#8208;Bi intermediate (detected by HRMS). Interestingly, the binding Bi&#8208;moiety can modulate the electronic and steric environment of gold center through cooperative interactions, thus promoting the intramolecular transmetallation and reductive elimination. In addition, the synthetic robustness of this protocol has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiments and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Length Ratio&#8208;Driven Configurational Modulation of Heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular configurational&#160;modulation&#160;is essential for maintaining the stability and functionality of biological systems. Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, we present a strategy to modulate the configurations of heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 cages by systematically varying the ligand length ratio (r). Although theoretical analysis suggests that these Pd6L6L'6 assemblies could adopt up to 48 possible configurational isomers, we successfully modulated the thermodynamic preference between two dominant configurations (Type&#8208;A and Type&#8208;B) by implementing energetic differentiation through careful optimization of r. Specifically, the system exclusively forms Type&#8208;A cages at r = 1.0, whereas Type&#8208;B becomes the predominant configuration when r &#8805; 1.4. Control experiments demonstrate that the introduction of bulky steric groups does not induce configuration changes. This research offers valuable insights and serves as a useful reference for the design and configurational modulation of heteroleptic cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Photocatalytic Methane&#160;Oxidation toward Ethanol by Tuning Spin&#8208;States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective oxidation of methane (CH4) has attractive potentials for mitigating global warming and producing value&#8208;added chemicals, while the efficient generation of multicarbon products such as ethanol remains challenging, due to the short lifetimes and high unpaired concentrations of reactive intermediates (like &#8226;OH, &#8226;CH3, &#8226;OCH3, &#8226;CH2OH). Herein, we developed a medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8208;O&#8208;Fe(MS) catalyst with tunable Fe(III) spin states, which can efficiently photo&#8208;oxidize CH4 to ethanol at ambient conditions. The unpaired electrons in d&#8208;orbitals of Fe sites allow for efficient adsorption of &#8226;OH, and the eg&#8208;orbital occupancy enables stabilizing different key carbon&#8208;containing intermediates (&#8226;OCH3&#160;vs. &#8226;CH2OH). By balancing those two descriptors, the medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8208;O&#8208;Fe(MS) catalyst allows to achieve selective generation of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates with a moderate *OH coverage, and subsequent coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH to ethanol. With a light intensity of 100 mW&#183;cm&#8208;2 and water as a weak oxidant, the Zn&#8208;O&#8208;Fe(MS) catalyst exhibited a peak photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol yield of 372 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 without the use of photosensitizers or sacrificial reagents, which is ~ 3 times higher than the previously best reported photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol under similar conditions. Our study suggests an attractive potential of converting CH4 to multicarbon products by modulating spin states of the catalytic sites.</dc:description>

         <title>High Turnover Frequency in the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrous Oxide to Dinitrogen at a Binuclear Copper Complex of 3,5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone&#8208;depleting substance. Electrocatalytic N2O reduction (e&#8208;N2ORR) is a promising approach to remove N2O from the air under ambient conditions. However, developing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free e&#8208;N2ORR electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and turnover frequency (TOF) remains a challenge because of the weak binding of N2O and the high kinetic barrier for deoxygenation reaction. In this work, inspired by the multinuclear copper active site of nitrous oxide reductases, a binuclear copper complex of 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole supported on carbon black of Ketjenblack (CuHdatrz/KB) was utilized for the e&#8208;N2ORR at pH 13 and 298 K. CuHdatrz/KB achieves a high FE of &#8776;100% at &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE for the e&#8208;N2ORR to N2 and TOF up to &#8776;700 h&#8208;1, which is one&#8211;two orders of magnitude higher than those of the previously reported molecular&#8208;based catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that Cu(II) ions of CuHdatrz/KB are reduced to Cu(I) keeping the binuclear core, suggesting that the multinuclear copper active sites is crucial to efficiently catalyze the e&#8208;N2ORR like the nitrous oxide reductase.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone-depleting substance. Electrocatalytic N2O reduction (e-N2ORR) is a promising approach to remove N2O from the air under ambient conditions. However, developing noble-metal-free e-N2ORR electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and turnover frequency (TOF) remains a challenge because of the weak binding of N2O and the high kinetic barrier for deoxygenation reaction. In this work, inspired by the multinuclear copper active site of nitrous oxide reductases, a binuclear copper complex of 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole supported on carbon black of Ketjenblack (CuHdatrz/KB) was utilized for the e-N2ORR at pH 13 and 298 K. CuHdatrz/KB achieves a high FE of &#8776;100% at -0.3 V vs. RHE for the e-N2ORR to N2 and TOF up to &#8776;700 h-1, which is one&#8211;two orders of magnitude higher than those of the previously reported molecular-based catalysts. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that Cu(II) ions of CuHdatrz/KB are reduced to Cu(I) keeping the binuclear core, suggesting that the multinuclear copper active sites is crucial to efficiently catalyze the e-N2ORR like the nitrous oxide reductase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Covalent Organic Frameworks via Isoreticular Design, Isomerism, and Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational structural engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has significantly advanced their application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) from water splitting. However, the practical application of COFs for scalable solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion remains limited due to their insufficient photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we achieved an exceptionally high hydrogen evolution rate of 364 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 using HCl protonated COF&#8208;920 under ultraviolet&#8208;visible light, as confirmed by water&#8208;drainage and gas&#8208;gathering experiments, exceeding most previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Three series of isoreticular COFs were synthesized, incorporating benzene, biphenyl, and triphenyl linkers, along with their structural isomers featuring reversed imine bond orientations, to systematically investigate the collaborative influences of linker length, structural isomerism, and protonation on the photocatalytic performance. Experimental results revealed that COFs employing biphenyl&#8208;based linkers exhibited superior photocatalytic activity compared to those with benzene or triphenyl linkers. Moreover, the performance difference resulting from variations in imine orientation decreases with increasing linker length, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealing narrower energy differences between units connected by imine bonds (&#8208;C=N&#8208;). Our findings not only provide new insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships in COF photocatalysts but also highlight the potential of COF materials for sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Regulation of Radical Photochromism and Photoluminescence via Polymer Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While polymer matrices are widely used to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from oxygen and moisture quenching by providing a network that enables long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the influence of polymer polarity on phosphors for stable free radicals with radical luminescence (RL) has not been well studied. In this work, naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives, denoted as NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH (X = 2&#8208;6), featuring different alkyl alcohol chains, exhibit multi&#8208;responsive and tunable RTP and RL properties through polymer matrix polarity regulation. Experimental results reveal that NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH&#8226;&#8722; anion radicals are generated via not only photoinduction in the excited state but also intermolecular interactions of polar matrix in the ground state. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that polar polymers rich in hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors (e.g., &#8208;NH2, &#8208;NH&#8208; and &#8208;OH), where electrostatic interactions dominate over dispersion (E/D &gt; 1), more readily induce anion radicals compared to polar polymers rich in acceptors (e.g., &#8208;CN and &#8208;CO&#8208;), where dispersion interactions outweigh electrostatic effects (E/D &lt; 1). These derivatives exhibit potential applications in information encryption and volatile amine detection due to their chromic and luminescent properties. These findings offer perspectives on the role of polymer matrix polarity in modulating anion radical behavior, and mechanistic insights into the balance between RTP and RL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Post&#8208;Modification of Pyridine&#8208;Imine COFs for Enhanced Hydrolytic Stability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging as a type of promising materials for proton conduction, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) assembled from dynamic imine bonds face a challenge of surmounting hydrolytic instability to achieve long&#8208;term performance in humid environments. In this work, we report a post&#8208;synthetic strategy to simultaneously enhance the hydrolytic stability and hydrophilicity of a pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;LIFM7, without compromising its crystallinity and porosity. A bifunctional monomer containing amino and acetal groups was employed to construct the primary framework, which was subsequently modified via amide formation and pyridine N&#8208;oxidation to yield COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide and COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide&#8208;N+O&#8211;. These stepwise modifications increased the polarity and hydrogen&#8208;binding sites within COF pores to improve water affinity, leading to a three&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in the proton conductivity for COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide&#8208;N+O&#8211;, reaching 1.9 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S/cm at 95% relative humidity and 70&#8239;&#176;C. This study highlights a generalizable post&#8208;synthetic approach for tuning the pore chemistry of COFs to achieve high performance in proton&#8208;conducting applications under humid conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) offer a cutting&#8208;edge synergy between battery&#8208;level energy density and supercapacitor&#8208;like power density, yet face critical challenges in balancing the kinetic and capacity mismatch between Faradaic anodes and capacitive cathodes. Herein, we present a penta&#8208;element doped gradient&#8208;porous carbon (PE&#8208;GPC) with a nanosphere architecture, engineered with high&#8208;entropy principles and a gradual pore density variation to enhance mass transport and charge storage. Operando spectroscopy and machine learning potentials unveil a concerted penta&#8208;element interplay: Thiophene&#8208;like S configurations mediate dynamic redox processes, enabling pseudocapacitive Na+ and anion storage, while fluorine functionalities foster a self&#8208;rejuvenating NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), stabilizing long&#8208;term cycling. Meanwhile, the synergistic N/B/P triad engineers a hierarchical defect network that enhances electronic conductivity and fine&#8208;tunes ion adsorption energetics. This orchestrated interplay empowers the SIHC full&#8208;cell with a high energy density of 196 Wh kg&#8722;1, a formidable power density (10.4 kW kg&#8722;1), and an impressive 88.2% capacity retention after 9000 cycles.

         <title>Absolute Asymmetric Synthesis of a Homochiral Polymer from an Achiral Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the absolute asymmetric synthesis of a homochiral polymer from an achiral monomer. Owing to the preservation of symmetry and anisotropy in topochemical reactions, the supramolecular chirality inherent in the crystal packing of achiral monomers can be translated into molecular chirality in the resulting polymer. These findings may provide valuable insights into abiogenesis, particularly into the unresolved question of how the first chiral polymers emerged in the prebiotic world. 








Abstract
A compelling hypothesis for the origin of homochirality that led to the origin of life is that a chiral informational polymer, formed somehow from achiral monomers, biased the early chemical events, leading to the exclusive synthesis of chiral building blocks of life. However, the formation of a chiral polymer from achiral monomers continues to be a mystery. We exploited the ability of achiral molecules to rarely crystallize in chiral space groups to design achiral monomers for topochemical polymerization to obtain chiral polymers. One such achiral monomer synthesized, viz. a tripeptide monomer containing alkene and azide at its termini, crystallized in a chiral space group, forming a conglomerate as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Upon heating at a temperature above 70&#160;&#176;C, each enantiomorphic crystal underwent a regiospecific and stereospecific topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion to give a triazoline&#8208;linked homochiral helical polymer. We characterized several homochiral polymer crystals at atomic resolution either by SCXRD or by 3D electron diffraction.

         <title>Divergent Upcycling of Polystyrene into Phenol and Hydroquinone Derivatives by Photocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel divergent upcycling of PS to high value&#8208;added phenol and hydroquinone derivatives by photocatalysis and electrocatalysis with high chemical selectivity. This method operates under 1 atm air and room temperature with an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful depolymerization of real&#8208;life polystyrene (PS) using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, highlighting its promising potential for the chemical recycling of PS waste.








Abstract
The selective upcycling of polystyrene (PS) waste into value&#8208;added aromatics has emerged as a compelling strategy toward sustainable plastic valorization, drawing significant scientific and industrial interest. While most existing methods involved oxidative C&#9472;C bond cleavage predominantly yield benzoic acid, the direct conversion of waste PS into phenolic compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first example of photocatalytic upcycling of PS into phenol derivatives with high chemoselectivity. This economical method proceeds under ambient conditions (1 atm air and room temperature) using an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The use of strong acid effectively suppresses the formation of benzoic acid, playing a critical role in high selectivity. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cis configuration of neighboring phenyl rings in PS raises the barrier for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from the benzylic C&#9472;H bond, thereby contributing to the low polymer conversion. Furthermore, the novel divergent upcycling of PS to hydroquinone derivatives was achieved by a photo&#8208;electro tandem strategy. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by depolymerization of real&#8208;life PS using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, underscoring its promising potential for sustainable and scalable upcycling of PS waste.

         <title>Modular Synchronous Synthesis of Amides and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides Realized by Matching Electrolysis&#8208;Paired Tandems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing a metalloenzyme&#8208;like bifunctional molecular&#8208;based electrocatalyst, electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem offers a strategic approach to advancing multifunctional synthesis that integrates environmental management, renewable energy optimization, and value&#8208;added chemical production. 








Abstract
Feasible electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem synthesis represents an elaborately organized and high&#8208;efficiency strategy balancing energy consumption and value&#8208;added synthesis. Herein, we developed an exotic electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem synthesis system driven by a metalloenzyme&#8208;like bifunctional single&#8208;molecular heterostructure catalyst (MimNiPc/CNT), which enables the modular synchronous synthesis of amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides through cathodic CO&#8208;relayed aminocarbonylation and anodic iodine (I2)&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;amidation tandem reactions, respectively. Notably, the established MimNiPc/CNT is not only effective for parallel electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem reactions with various substrates but also adaptable for both divergent and sequential electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem reactions, producing value&#8208;added amide and &#945;&#8208;ketoamide compounds with isolated yields up to &#8764;90%. Detailed isotope labeling and mass spectrometry tracking experiments meticulously unveiled the reaction mechanisms, the processes at both electrodes can be refined into sequential electrocatalysis and chemocatalysis steps. Our work also demonstrates the flexibility and scalability of this &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; synthetic protocol, providing an experimental reference for precise synthesis.

         <title>Efficient Harvesting of Triplet Excitons via a T1&#8208;Blocked TADF Mechanism in Series MOFs for Optimal X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of a T1&#8208;blocked TADF mechanism within an AIE&#8208;active molecule not only broadens the scope of available TADF materials but also pioneers the incorporation of the TADF effect in metal&#8208;organic frameworks.








Abstract
Scintillators play vital roles in fields such as medical imaging, high&#8208;energy physics, astronomy, and radiation monitoring. Their operational principle, rooted in the excitation of high&#8208;energy radiation, underscores that luminescence efficiency in scintillators is fundamentally limited by their capacity to harness triplet excitons. In this context, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules present a promising avenue, enabling the efficient utilization of triplet excitons through thermally activated up&#8208;conversion, thereby advancing the development of superior scintillators. Our investigation reveals a T1&#8208;blocked TADF mechanism in H4TCPE, where efficient singlet&#8208;triplet exciton transfer arises from the minimized S1&#8208;T2 energy gap (0.18&#160;eV). Unlike conventional TADF molecules, H4TCPE features carboxylic acid groups that enable heavy metal coordination to enhance X&#8208;ray attenuation. Using tetravalent metals (Zr, Hf, and Th) as nodes and H4TCPE as linkers, we fabricated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that synergize H4TCPE's TADF properties with metal&#8208;enhanced radiation absorption. The resulting MOFs show X&#8208;ray detection and imaging performances superior to pure H4TCPE (20.0 lp mm&#8722;1 and 1.15 &#181;Gy s&#8722;1 for Th&#8208;TCPE vs. &lt;14.3 lp mm&#8722;1 and 5.01 &#181;Gy s&#8722;1 for H4TCPE), with efficacy correlating to metal atomic number. This work not only broadens TADF molecular diversity through a new energy transfer mechanism and pioneers TADF&#8208;MOF integration for advanced radiation detection.

         <title>Strategic Secondary Coordination Implantation Towards Efficient and Stable Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in PEMFCs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel Fe&#8208;based catalyst breaks the longstanding activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in PEMFCs through precise atomic&#8208;level electronic modulation. By constructing a dynamic electron reservoir around Fe&#8208;N4 active sites, the optimized catalyst simultaneously achieves an 86% improvement in ORR activity (reaching 1.73&#160;W cm&#8722;2 peak power density, comparable to Pt) and remarkable stability (97% Fe retention after long&#8208;term MEA stability tests, an 8.8&#8208;fold improvement over the pristine Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C material), demonstrating an unprecedented balance between significantly enhanced catalytic activity and long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
While state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts demonstrate platinum&#8208;comparable initial activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), their operational durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) remains fundamentally limited by progressive destabilization of Fe&#9472;N bond under electrochemical cycling, resulting in irreversible metal leaching, catastrophic catalyst degradation and the so&#8208;called activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principles screening, we demonstrate that the strategic implantation of transition metal ions with d&#8208;orbital characteristics analogous to the active site into the secondary coordination sphere, functioning as non&#8208;catalytic stabilizers, enables dynamic neutralization of reaction intermediates&#8208;induced electronic polarization, thereby achieving stabilization of metal&#9472;nitrogen bonds during the ORR cycle. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the integration of isovalent Ru ions as electron&#8208;buffing site in the designed FeRu dual&#8208;atom catalyst not only achieves a high peak power density of 1.73&#160;W cm&#8722;2 with a current density of 58&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.9&#160;V, but also exhibits exceptional durability, with a current decay rate of just 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and over 97% Fe retention after prolonged stability tests. This stands in stark contrast to Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C counterparts, which retain less than 11% of Fe sites under identical conditions.

Herein, guided by first-principles screening, we demonstrate that the strategic implantation of transition metal ions with &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital characteristics analogous to the active site into the secondary coordination sphere, functioning as non-catalytic stabilizers, enables dynamic neutralization of reaction intermediates-induced electronic polarization, thereby achieving stabilization of metal&#9472;nitrogen bonds during the ORR cycle. As a proof-of-concept, the integration of isovalent Ru ions as electron-buffing site in the designed FeRu dual-atom catalyst not only achieves a high peak power density of 1.73&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a current density of 58&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9&#160;V, but also exhibits exceptional durability, with a current decay rate of just 0.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and over 97% Fe retention after prolonged stability tests. This stands in stark contrast to Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C counterparts, which retain less than 11% of Fe sites under identical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Persistent Radicals Catalyze Redox&#8208;Neutral C&#9472;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kuhn verdazyls, discovered over 60 years ago, are shown as effective catalysts for the first time. Their tunable redox properties enable organocatalytic redox&#8208;neutral C&#9472;H arylation and C&#9472;H trifluoromethylation reactions without light activation. In these reactions, verdazyl radicals mimic transition metals and photoredox catalysts in emulating catalytic single&#8208;electron shuttling. The reactions are practical and require low catalyst loadings.








Abstract
We report that nitrogen&#8208;centered persistent radicals, Kuhn verdazyls, are effective, tunable ground&#8208;state redox organocatalysts for single electron transfer (SET)&#8208;initiated radical transformations. Verdazyls uniquely emulate catalytic single&#8208;electron shuttling, a hallmark of redox catalysis, without light or external stimuli. They enable redox&#8208;neutral C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming reactions, such as C&#9472;H arylation and C&#9472;H trifluoromethylation, typically driven by transition metals, photoredox catalysts, or mechanoredox mediators, while avoiding the self&#8208;inhibition that limits organic super electron donors and nitroxides in such applications.

         <title>Modulating Spin State of Ni Single Atomic Center for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two well&#8208;designed Ni&#8211;N4C single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with different coordinated nitrogen species have been developed via a gas&#8208;protected fast Joule&#8208;heating strategy. The pyridinic&#8208;type nitrogen coordinated Ni&#8211;Npyridinic&#8211;C exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity than the pyrrolic&#8208;type nitrogen coordinated Ni&#8208;Npyrrolic&#8208;C for CO2 reduction in H&#8208;type cell, with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for CO. Remarkably, excellent catalytic activities are also achieved in all alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes with industrial&#8208;level CO partial current densities. The outstanding durability and CO selectivity originate from modulating the spin&#8208;state of Ni center with different coordinated&#8208;N species, which significantly strengthens the interaction and facilitates the electron transfer between Ni center and *COOH intermediate, leading to the decreased energy barrier for *COOH formation and boosted reaction kinetics for *COOH further reduction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely investigated and regarded as promising electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. However, studies on the impact of coordinated&#8208;nitrogen species in the active center on the spin state and catalytic activity remain scarce. Herein, two single Ni atom electrocatalysts with distinct pyridinic&#8208;N and pyrrolic&#8208;N coordination through a rapid Joule&#8208;heating method that preserves precursor nitrogen configurations. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that pyridinic&#8208;N induces a high&#8208;spin state in Ni centers, while pyrrolic&#8208;N stabilizes a low&#8208;spin configuration. The high&#8208;spin Ni&#8211;Npyridinic&#8211;C demonstrates an exceptional performance in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, achieving 98.8% CO Faradaic efficiency in H&#8208;cells and maintaining&#160;&gt;99% Faradaic efficiency at industrial current densities (&#8805;250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) across alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes in a gas&#8208;diffusion flow cell. A maximum power density of 1.89&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent charge&#8211;discharge cyclability also achieve in zinc&#8211;CO2 battery, further demonstrating the applicability of Ni&#8211;Npyridinic&#8211;C. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the high&#8208;spin state enhances d&#8208;orbital dispersion, strengthening hybridization with &#960;* orbital of CO2 and stabilizing *COOH intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation. This study not only establishes a novel strategy for spin&#8208;state engineering through coordination control but also advances scalable electrocatalyst design for efficient carbon cycling.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Biosensing of Drug&#8208;Induced Cell&#8208;Heterogeneous Injuries with an Ultrahigh Turn&#8208;On Ratio</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo biosensing of oxidative injury with a high turn&#8208;on ratio in the near&#8208;infrared, i.e., 800&#160;nm and beyond, is critical for drug development, disease diagnosis, and surgery. We developed a novel probe&#8208;design strategy, namely asymmetric conjugative addition, for a bisbenannulated xanthoid dye (EC5). Fluorescence emission at 890&#160;nm exhibited over 200&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on upon detection of oxidative species. Its feasibility for macroscopic and microscopic detection of drug&#8208;induced toxicities is demonstrated.








Abstract
Fluorescence probes of reactive oxygen species in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region, i.e., 800&#160;nm and beyond, are desired for in vivo biosensing, diagnosis, and pharmacology. However, the NIR dyes are typically prone to oxidative destruction, and the probes based on these dyes exhibit a poor fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratio and a low detection sensitivity. EC5 is a bright and stable NIR fluorochromic scaffold and yet has not been exploited for probe design. Despite the structural analogy of EC5 to xanthene dyes, the classic spiro&#8208;cyclization at the central methine carbon was surprisingly not applicable to EC5. Here, we report the rational development of a novel probe design strategy for EC5 dye, i.e., asymmetric conjugative addition at the quinone&#8208;methide carbon. EC5&#8208;H3 via this approach is a robust probe for highly oxidative species. Its merits include an ultrahigh turn&#8208;on ratio of ca. 200&#8208;fold and high resistance of the detection product toward ONOO&#8722;&#8208;mediated destruction. The feasibility of EC5&#8208;H3 for practical applications was showcased by in vivo biosensing of drug&#8208;induced oxidative injuries to the liver. The high turn&#8208;on ratio and high brightness of the probe allow tissue injuries to be imaged with confocal microscopy to reveal the heterogeneity in oxidative injuries to different liver cells.

         <title>Is the Smallest Molecular Trefoil Knot Actually the Tightest One?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tightness engineering has evolved as an efficient strategy for the design of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials with desired properties and functions since tightness is a primary parameter that determines the property of a knotted strand. However, as an attractive topic that inspires mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and biologists, whether the smallest knot is exactly the tightest one remains unaddressed experimentally. To tackle this challenge, a series of organic trefoil knots with the backbone&#8208;atom as short as 70 have been successfully synthesized by developing a new modular self&#8208;assembly approach in this study. To our great surprise, with the help of gradient tandem mass spectrometry, the quantitative tightness evaluation suggested that the molecular trefoil knot with a backbone crossing ratio (BCR) of 24.0 is even tighter than the one with a BCR of 23.3 (i.e. the smallest organic trefoil knot with the shortest ropelength synthesized so far), thus demonstrating an unexpected yet interesting odd&#8208;even effect to enhance the understanding of the tightness regulation of molecular knots.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with asymmetric coordination configurations is essential for enhancing peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, precisely regulating the electronic structure and coordination environment of metal centers to further improve activation kinetics remains a key challenge. Herein, we designed asymmetric CoN1O2 single&#8208;atoms (SAs) sites and Co nanoclusters (NCs) that were spatially confined in highly graphitized carbon layers and supported on holey MXene nanosheet (CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX) via a dual&#8208;coordination microenvironment strategy. The CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance on bisphenol A (BPA) removal, achieving a corrected rate constant (kvalue) of 2750 min&#8208;1 M&#8208;1 and a total organic carbon removal efficiency of 78.2%. Mechanistic studies revealed that BPA removal was dominated by a non&#8208;radical electron transfer process (ETP, ~100%), which facilitated rapid polymerization of BPA. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that Co NCs synergistically enhanced the ability of asymmetric CoN1O2 SAs sites to adsorb and activate PMS, significantly accelerating interfacial charge transfer. Furthermore, a catalytic membrane fabricated by crosslinking of CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX and graphene achieved 100% BPA removal in single&#8208;pass mode with a hydraulic retention time of just 40 ms over 24 h of continuous operation. This work provides new insights into designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for pollutant removal via ETP&#8208;driven polymerization pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Counterintuitive Photochemistry of an Isolated Acridinyl Radical: ConPET via Preassembly, Solvated Electrons, or a Long&#8208;Lived Excited State?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox chemistry has seen a dramatic rise in popularity in recent years, but mechanistic understanding has persistently lagged behind reaction development itself. This is particularly true for the emerging area of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (conPET), which has attracted both great interest due to its ability to activate inert substrates selectively and under mild conditions, and continuing controversy over its mechanistic feasibility. We describe herein the isolation of the key radical intermediate state of an acridinium&#8208;based conPET catalyst and detailed investigations of its photochemistry by a suite of (photo)reactivity, photoluminescence, and transient absorption techniques, supported by computational studies. We observe strong wavelength and solvent dependencies in the reactivity profile, which correlate well with observations of a long&#8208;lived, fluorescent excited state that would be compatible with diffusion&#8208;limited reactivity. However, photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies suggest that, counter&#8208;intuitively, this state does not actually participate in reactivity. Instead, changes occur far faster than the diffusion limit, which provides strong, direct evidence for preassembly of the photocatalyst and substrate prior to photoexcitation. Further inspection also indicates parallel formation of solvated electrons, likely providing the major pathway under previously reported synthetic conditions, suggesting that otherwise competing rationales for conPET can in fact operate simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversing Blocking Order of Trithiocarbonate&#8208;Mediated RAFT Polymerizations using Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many acrylic&#8208;methacrylic block copolymer sequences remain inaccessible due to synthetic limitations. Herein, photoinduced electron/energy transfer (PET) catalysis is leveraged to reverse blocking order limitations in trithiocarbonate (TTC)&#8208;mediated reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We synthesized poly(methyl acrylate&#8208;b&#8208;methyl methacrylate) by PET&#8208;RAFT using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3, achieving predictable, linear increases in molecular weight with conversion. Kinetics studies showed that adding a tertiary amine (triethanolamine) introduced a reversible redox reaction to stabilize the TTC radical during chain extensions, leading to more uniform block copolymers (&#208; &lt; 1.47) compared to block copolymers synthesized without amine (&#208; &lt; 1.56). To highlight the utility of this method, previously inaccessible triblock copolymers of poly(methyl acrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) blocks were investigated. The order of acrylic and methacrylic blocks impacted the physical properties of compositionally similar polymeric materials. For example, a high molecular weight triblock copolymer (P(MMA&#8208;b&#8208;MA&#8208;b&#8208;MMA), Mn = 564 kg/mol) thermoplastic elastomer showed exceptional strain (&gt; 1600%) with full shape recovery. Overall, we report (i) a new methodology to unlock synthetic access to acrylic&#8208;methacrylic block copolymers using TTCs and photocatalysis, (ii) insight into photocatalyst&#8208;mediated radical polymerization, and (iii) synthesis of new high&#8208;performance materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2025)</title>

A novel photocatalyst (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) of bismuth oxychloride with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies was synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield after photocatalytic N2 reduction under solar light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to overcome confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect, leading to &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing their transfer path from (001) to (101) crystal plane. As a result, a new nitrogen reduction pathway with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation is found, as reported by Wen Liu et&#160;al. (e202503097).

         <title>Mechanistic Insights: Correspondence on &#8220;Tuning Co&#8208;Operative Energy Transfer in Copper(I) Complexes Using Two&#8208;Photon Absorbing Diimine&#8208;Based Ligand Sensitizers&#8221;</title>

One photon or two photons, that is the question. A closer look at the recently presented photosensitizer [Cu(bathocupSANI)2]BF4 revealed that a single red/NIR photon per catalytic turnover is sufficient for photooxygenation reactions. Mechanistic challenges, pitfalls, and opportunities for future research in photocatalysis are identified.








Abstract
In a recent communication, Collins and coworkers presented a Cu(I) complex with photocatalytic activity under red light LED conditions, mainly for singlet oxygen&#8208;driven reactions. Guided by steady&#8208;state emission measurements with 800&#160;nm excitation, the authors suggested that the underlying mechanism for the generation of the photoexcited key species is a simultaneous two&#8208;photon absorption via a virtual state.

&lt;p&gt;One photon or two photons, that is the question. A closer look at the recently presented photosensitizer [Cu(bathocupSANI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; revealed that a single red/NIR photon per catalytic turnover is sufficient for photooxygenation reactions. Mechanistic challenges, pitfalls, and opportunities for future research in photocatalysis are identified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent communication, Collins and coworkers presented a Cu(I) complex with photocatalytic activity under red light LED conditions, mainly for singlet oxygen-driven reactions. Guided by steady-state emission measurements with 800&#160;nm excitation, the authors suggested that the underlying mechanism for the generation of the photoexcited key species is a simultaneous two-photon absorption via a virtual state. However, such a mechanism requires pulsed laser excitation and cannot compete when a conventional one-photon excitation is also feasible with the selected excitation wavelength range. Using several spectroscopic techniques and reactivity assays under different light color and intensity conditions, we unambiguously demonstrate that a conventional one-photon excitation followed by rather inefficient singlet oxygen generation (quantum yield&#160;&amp;lt;5%) is responsible for the observed photoreactivity of the Cu(I) complex. In addition, we briefly summarize general mechanistic considerations, estimate typical photon densities required for a variety of two-photon mechanisms, highlight the importance of optical filters and impurities to avoid artifacts in the emission spectra, and present some guidelines for the differentiation between one- and two-photon mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantiomerically Enriched Aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Kinetic Resolution of 2H&#8208;Azirines</title>

Kinetic resolution by copper hydride catalyzed reduction of 2H&#8208;azirines secured optically enriched N&#8208;H aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and good enantioselectivity (up to 94% ee). DFT calculations and non&#8208;covalent interaction analysis established the reaction pathway and revealed two key non&#8208;covalent interactions that account for the enantioselectivity.








Abstract
We present the first reductive kinetic resolution of racemic 2H&#8208;azirines to prepare optically enriched N&#8208;H aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates, which are bench stable and readily diversifiable building blocks, concomitantly with the corresponding enantiomerically enriched 2H&#8208;azirines. The N&#8208;H aziridines were obtained with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94%). A Hammett study revealed a linear free energy relationship between the &#916;&#916;G&#10727; of the diastereomeric transition states and the &#963;p&#8722; values. density functional theory (DFT) calculations and non&#8208;covalent interaction analysis suggested that non&#8208;classical H&#8211;bonding interactions and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face aromatic interactions between the substrate and the ligand are responsible for the stereoselectivity and also for the substrate electronic effects observed in the Hammett study.

         <title>Identification of an Activity Selector for the Nitroso&#8208;Forming Activity in Bacterial Type&#8208;III Copper Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small but crucial difference: Type&#8208;III copper enzymes, like tyrosinase (TYR) and o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase (AO), catalyze the oxidation of o&#8208;aminophenols (AP) to quinone imines. Unlike TYR, AO can further oxidize AP to nitrosophenols. This nitroso&#8208;forming activity is controlled by a key amino acid near the Cu(A) ion. Mutating Asn to Ile in the AO SgGriF converts it to a TYR, while the homologous Ile to Asn mutation in SzTYR switches it from a TYR to an AO. 








Abstract
O&#8208;aminophenol oxidases, a specialized subclass of type&#8208;III copper proteins, play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of bioactive nitrosophenols, which display antiretroviral and blood cholesterol&#8208;lowering activity. Another related subclass of type&#8208;III copper proteins, tyrosinases, closely resemble o&#8208;aminophenol oxidases structurally and enzymatically but lack their unique ability to oxidize o&#8208;aminophenols into nitrosophenols. To unpuzzle the catalytic disparities of both subclasses, highly conserved amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center were identified. Notably, the Asn43 residue in the o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase from Streptomyces griseus (SgGriF) plays a pivotal role in its nitroso&#8208;forming activity. Mutating the Asn43 residue in SgGriF to isoleucine, which is present at the homologous position Ile42 in the tyrosinase from Streptomyces sp. ZL&#8208;24 (SzTYR), resulted in the loss of the nitroso&#8208;forming activity in SgGriF. Conversely, exchanging Ile42 in SzTYR to asparagine generates nitroso&#8208;forming activity in SzTYR. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of converting an o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase into a tyrosinase and vice versa through a single amino acid mutation, underscoring the potential of these findings for future applications in medicinal and material sciences.

         <title>Tuning Multi&#8208;Active Sites in Cu Catalyst via Ag/Ni Doping for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni multi&#8208;metal sites can effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, ultimately achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) for the synthesis of C2+ products.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to C2+ products is a promising sustainable carbon conversion pathway, yet simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density remains a challenge. Herein, we found that creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni multi&#8208;metal sites could effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, thereby achieving highly efficient ECR to synthesize C2+ products. In situ measurements coupling theoretical calculations indicated that by systematically altering the spatial arrangement and distribution of active sites in Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalysts, the electronic structure and the local *CO coverage on the Cu surface could be tuned, consequently steering the ECR to C2+ pathway. In particular, Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalyst with dispersed multi&#8208;sites (CuxAgNi DNPs) could more effectively reduce the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling than Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalyst with phase&#8208;separated multi&#8208;sites (CuxAgNi PNPs). As a result, the Cu40AgNi DNPs catalyst with dispersed multi&#8208;sites yielded C2+ products with a FE of 93.2% and a current density up to 818.1 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.38&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), which are higher than most reported up to date for C2+ production. This work provides a methodology for designing robust multi&#8208;metallic ECR catalysts with tailored multi&#8208;active site configurations.

         <title>Deciphering the Crystallographic Effect in Radially Architectured Polycrystalline Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we reveal the crucial role of crystallography in high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes. Unlike the belief that radial architecture's preferential texture enhances performance, we show it alters misorientation distribution by increasing low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries. This reduces chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation, improving Li+ diffusion and ultimately enhancing rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes.








Abstract
Layered oxide cathode materials with primary&#8211;secondary architecture face challenges of inhomogeneous Li+ diffusion and chemomechanical degradation due to misorientations between equiaxed primary particles. Although a radial architecture, featuring elongated grains, is widely believed to enhance diffusion, it does not address the root cause of chemomechanical failure&#8212;crystallographic misorientation. The impact of crystallography on the electrochemical performance of radially architectured secondary particles, compared to conventional designs, remains poorly understood. Here, by combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we decipher the crucial role of crystallography in the performance and stability of polycrystalline high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode materials. Contrary to the conventional belief that a preferential texture induced by the radial architecture is the key to performance enhancement, we uncover that the radial architecture primarily alters the misorientation distribution by introducing substantially increased low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries that significantly mitigate chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation. This crystallographic refinement facilitates enhanced Li+ diffusion between primary particles, ultimately boosting the rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes. By quantitatively uncovering the crystallographic influence on performance, this work provides a new avenue for optimizing Li+ diffusion kinetics and chemomechanical resilience in polycrystalline cathode materials through crystallographic engineering.

     alt="Deciphering the Crystallographic Effect in Radially Architectured Polycrystalline Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we reveal the crucial role of crystallography in high-Ni layered oxide cathodes. Unlike the belief that radial architecture's preferential texture enhances performance, we show it alters misorientation distribution by increasing low-angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries. This reduces chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation, improving Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and ultimately enhancing rate capability and long-term stability of the cathodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered oxide cathode materials with primary&#8211;secondary architecture face challenges of inhomogeneous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and chemomechanical degradation due to misorientations between equiaxed primary particles. Although a radial architecture, featuring elongated grains, is widely believed to enhance diffusion, it does not address the root cause of chemomechanical failure&#8212;crystallographic misorientation. The impact of crystallography on the electrochemical performance of radially architectured secondary particles, compared to conventional designs, remains poorly understood. Here, by combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we decipher the crucial role of crystallography in the performance and stability of polycrystalline high-Ni layered oxide cathode materials. Contrary to the conventional belief that a preferential texture induced by the radial architecture is the key to performance enhancement, we uncover that the radial architecture primarily alters the misorientation distribution by introducing substantially increased low-angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries that significantly mitigate chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation. This crystallographic refinement facilitates enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion between primary particles, ultimately boosting the rate capability and long-term stability of the cathodes. By quantitatively uncovering the crystallographic influence on performance, this work provides a new avenue for optimizing Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics and chemomechanical resilience in polycrystalline cathode materials through crystallographic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoconfined Ultrathin Polymer Membrane for Ultrafast Separation of Biobutanol from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging dissolution&#8211;crosslinking competition of linear polymer during an interfacial cross&#8208;linking reaction, a sub&#8208;10 nm thick polymer membrane was fabricated and precisely confined within the permanent voids of alumina supporting nanolayer. Through this nanoconfined ultrathin polymer membrane, 1.0&#160;wt% of aqueous n&#8208;butanol can be concentrated 14.2&#8208;fold, with a record&#8208;breaking liquid flux of 110&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Efficient recovery of biobutanol, a next&#8208;generation biofuel, from fermentation liquor remains challenging due to its low concentration and volatility. This study introduces ultrathin rubbery polymer membranes developed through an interfacial dissolution&#8211;crosslinking method, with cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane confined within the permanent nanovoids of ceramic alumina substrates. The resulting membranes, which are less than 10&#160;nm thick, achieve unparalleled performance: concentrating 1.0&#160;wt% aqueous n&#8208;butanol 14.2&#8208;fold with a record&#8208;high liquid flux of 110&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#8212;one to two orders of magnitude greater than those of previously reported membranes. These advancements suggest significant reductions in the membrane area and operational costs for large&#8208;scale biobutanol separation, establishing a sustainable and economical solution for biofuel production.

         <title>Adaptive Defluoroamination of Aryl Fluorides: Harnessing the Catalytic Potential of a Unique Zinc Amide Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed an effective and adaptable catalytic protocol for the radical&#8208;mediated defluoroamination of fluoroarenes, utilizing a redox&#8208;active amide ligand&#8208;supported zinc(II) compound. Intriguingly, this accommodative protocol offers several advantages, e.g., the mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope (covering most types of fluoroarenes and diverse N&#8208;nucleophiles) with excellent functional group tolerance, selective C&#9472;F bond functionalization, and access to tertiary aryl amines in one&#8208;pot manner starting from the primary amine itself via double C&#9472;N bond formations.








Abstract
The activation and functionalization of C&#9472;F bonds, the strongest bonds between carbon and any other element, via C&#9472;N bond formation to generate complex molecules has remained a compelling challenge. Herein, we present a ligand&#8208;centered redox&#8208;controlled effective strategy employing a zinc amide catalyst (C) to achieve facile defluoroamination of fluoroarenes with several N&#8208;nucleophiles (&gt;90 substrates) under mild conditions. Notably, this adaptable protocol works readily with most types of fluoroarenes and a diverse range of N&#9472;H moieties that include secondary and primary amines, indoles, azoles, and&#160;amides under the same reaction conditions and encouragingly offers excellent functional group compatibility. Intriguingly, we also demonstrated its application in one&#8208;pot synthesis of (un)symmetrical triaryl amines from primary amine itself and the selective activation of C&#9472;F bonds to access F&#8208;containing amines, relevant to drug synthesis. Finally, detailed mechanistic probes via active&#8208;intermediate&#8208;capture, EPR analysis, and various control experiments indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical&#8208;mediated C&#9472;N coupling pathway. Importantly, use of Zn(II) center as a template to hold the two amide moieties together in C enables facile intramolecular electron transfer to generate the radical intermediates for the present protocol. Finally, the practical utility of this methodology was&#160;showcased by synthesizing various drug derivatives.

         <title>Catching Fullerenes: Synthesis of Molecular Nanogloves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we disclose the synthesis of curved cavitands. The efficient and straightforward hybridization of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene results in well&#8208;defined rigid receptors capable of capturing fullerenes with high affinity. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a new series of rigid, all meta&#8208;phenylene, conjugated deep&#8208;cavity molecules, displaying high binding affinity towards buckyballs. A facile synthetic approach with an overall combined yield of approximately 53% in the last two steps has been developed using a templating strategy that combines the general structure of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene. These two moieties are covalently linked via four acetal bonds, resulting in a glove&#8208;like architecture. 1H NMR titration experiments reveal fullerene binding affinities (Ka) exceeding &#8805;106&#160;M&#8722;1. The size complementarity between fullerenes and these scaffolds maximizes CH&#8943;&#960; and &#960;&#8943;&#960; interactions, and their host:guest adduct resembles a ball in a glove, hence their name as nanogloves. Fullerene recognition is tested by suspending carbon soot in a solution of nanoglove in 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrachloroethane, where more than a dozen fullerenes are observed, ranging from C60 to C96.

The first total syntheses of rearranged ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids (&#8208;)&#8208;Wallichanol A, (&#8208;)&#8208;Sanguinolane, and (&#8208;)&#8208;Wallichanol B were accomplished via a concise sequence featuring an intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition to forge a unique tricyclo[3.3.1.02,&#8311;]nonane core. Key steps include a selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reduction, Robinson annulation, and aerobic oxidations to &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of three rearranged ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids, (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol A (1), (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol B (2), and (&#8211;)&#8208;Sanguinolane (3), using a 13, 17, and 14 step longest&#8208;linear sequences respectively, featuring a novel intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition to construct the unique pentacyclic framework containing an unprecedented tricyclo[3.3.1.02,7]nonane motif. Other key steps in the synthetic route include a highly challenging, selective alkene reduction via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), leveraging the thermodynamic preference for a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical; a Robinson&#8208;type annulation to construct the tricyclic terpenoid building block; and applying aerobic oxidation at two distinct points to form &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, facilitating the enantioselective syntheses of these diterpenoids.

Other key steps in the synthetic route include a highly challenging, selective alkene reduction via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), leveraging the thermodynamic preference for a tertiary carbon-centered radical; a Robinson-type annulation to construct the tricyclic terpenoid building block; and applying aerobic oxidation at two distinct points to form &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy ketones, facilitating the enantioselective syntheses of these diterpenoids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>S&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced &#8220;Proton Fence Effect&#8221; Enables Selectivity Switching between CH4 and CO in Photo&#8208;Assisted CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective switching of C1 product between CH4 and CO during photo&#8208;assisted CO2 electroreduction is realized by a &#8220;proton fence&#8221; effect resulting from sulfur vacancies (SV). CO2 undergoes complete hydrogenation to CH4 (93.6% FE) over CuInS2/CuS stabilized by photo&#8208;generated holes, while *OH anchored on Sv of CuInS2/CuS1&#8208;x hinders local proton migration with preferential *CO desorption, exclusively furnishing CO (95.3% FE).








Abstract
Upcycling CO2 into high&#8208;value C1 products is impressive for achieving carbon neutrality and energy sustainability, while rational modulation of C1 product selectivity is one of the biggest challenges in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) due to the competing reaction pathways and thermodynamic limitation. Here, we showcase a &#8220;proton fence&#8221; strategy enabled by in situ adsorbed *OH on sulfur vacancies (SV) to ultraselectively switch the C1 product between CH4 and CO during CO2RR, with Faraday efficiency of 93.6% and 95.3%, respectively. In situ measurements uncover that the photo&#8208;generated holes counteract Cu2+ electroreduction to retain the intact structure of CuInS2/CuS, while *OH dissociated from water can spontaneously anchor toward SV to hinder the local proton migration, completely circumventing multiproton products. Meanwhile, the preferential desorption of *CO from Cu centers adjacent to the *OH&#8208;anchored SV renders the exclusive formation of CO. In the absence of SV, *CO can be further hydrogenated in a lower free energy/even spontaneously to afford CH4. The proposed proton confinement effect furnishes a promising reference for the selectivity control of eCO2RR, and the photo&#8208;assisted electroreductive protocol demonstrates a paradigm of in situ stabilization of electron&#8208;intolerant catalytic structures.

         <title>Solvent Induced Transformation of Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Large Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Three homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2 were synthesized. Upon stimulation with methanol, Ag98 undergoes an intercluster reaction with in situ generated Ag74 to form Ag86, which subsequently transforms into the thermodynamically stable Ag74. This study represents the first observation of an intercluster reaction during the cluster transformation process.








Abstract
Structural transformation of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters is of significant interest because of its relevance to the formation mechanisms and stability of metal clusters. Herein, we report three large homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2, synthesized from the same precursor 2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;CAg via fine&#8208;tuning the reduction rate. X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrates that Ino decahedral Ag13 units serve as building blocks in all three nanoclusters. Remarkably, Ag98 undergoes an intercluster transformation in methanol. It initially converts into Ag74, then Ag74 reacts with Ag98 to form Ag86, which eventually is transformed into the thermodynamically stable Ag74. Time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) confirms such a multi&#8208;step reaction process during the transformation, identifying Ag86 as the key intermediate. Our findings not only provide new insights into the structural transformation pathways of nanoclusters but also enhance the understanding of transformation mechanisms, contributing to the rational synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters.

         <title>A Programmable Nanoparticle Conversion Pathway to Monodisperse Polyelemental High Entropy Alloy, Intermetallic, and Multiphase Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelemental nanoparticles, composed of four or more elements, encompass high&#8208;entropy alloys, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics, and multiphase structures such as Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. These nanoparticles were obtained through the thermal transformation of colloidally synthesized core&#8208;shell nanoparticles. Systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity of the precursor nanoparticles, combined with atomistic simulations evaluating phase stability, reveal that the final mixing states of these nanoparticles are dictated by the interplay between enthalpy and entropy of mixing.








Abstract
Polyelemental nanoparticles (PE NPs), those consisting of four or more elements, exhibit unique properties from synergistic compositional effects. Examples include high entropy alloys, high entropy intermetallics, and multiphase types, including Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. Although colloidal syntheses offer excellent structural control for mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;elemental compositions, achieving the same control for PE NPs remains challenging. Here, this challenge is addressed with a NP conversion strategy wherein different types of PE NPs &#8211; including high entropy alloy, high entropy intermetallic, and multiphase Janus nanoparticles &#8211; are achieved through thermal transformation of readily synthesized colloidal core&#8208;shell NPs. Through systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity to the core&#8208;shell precursor NPs, along with atomistic simulations that probe phase stabilities, we deduce that the final mixing states of the various NPs are governed by the balance between the enthalpy and entropy of mixing. Moreover, our annealing method allows us to trap NPs at intermediate states of mixing, creating distinct surface ensembles that were evaluated as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report colloidally derived precursor NPs enabling the synthesis of all types of PE NPs in a single process. This NP conversion strategy offers a general route to diverse PE NPs.

Self&#8208;photosensitizing non&#8208;noble metal complexes achieve CO2 photoreduction coupled with CH3OH photooxidation, simultaneously synthesizing formic acid in the absence of any additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants.








Abstract
The use of metal complexes as homogeneous molecular catalysts has attracted considerable attention regarding photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Enhancing these complexes with photosensitivity and photooxidation capabilities, aiming to create multifunctional molecular devices, presents significant challenges. In response to these challenges, we successfully designed and synthesized three innovative metal complexes. The complexes demonstrate a remarkable ability to perform CO2 photoreduction in tandem with methanol photooxidation, allowing for the simultaneous production of formic acid without requiring additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants. An optimal turnover number (TON) value of 855 was obtained under simulated sunlight. Even under natural sunlight, the TON can reach 207, much higher than the value of the physical mixture of the photocatalytic reductive and oxidative moieties. Spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that integrating reduction and oxidation sites in one molecular catalyst can promote charge transfer kinetics and enhance activity for CO2 reduction and methanol oxidation. This is the first report that non&#8208;noble metal homogeneous catalysts can simultaneously possess photosensitivity, photoreduction, and photo&#8208;oxidation functions, offering new insights into designing homogeneous catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

Electrocatalysis is governed by elusive, dynamic interfacial processes. In their Research Article (e202423177), Charlotte Vogt and co&#8208;workers introduce dynamic response spectroscopy (DRS) to isolate time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic features of the electric double layer during CO2 electroreduction over copper. This method reveals discrete restructuring events and water dynamics correlated with CO2 turnover, offering a new paradigm for probing electrochemical interfaces (Cover design: Thomas Hartman).

Enzyme specificity defines function: aminophenol oxidase uniquely converts aminophenols into nitrosophenols, whereas tyrosinase transforms them into quinone imines. This distinction is governed by a key amino acid near the copper(A) active site. In their Research Article (e202501560), Annette Rompel et&#160;al. demonstrated that a single amino acid exchange&#8212;swapping asparagine in SgGriF with isoleucine in SzTYR&#8212;can effectively invert the enzymes&#8217; functions.

A single&#8208;molecule liposome assay for membrane permeabilization using confocal microscopy paired with a fast&#8208;flow microfluidics device is reported by Scott L. Cockroft, Mathew H. Horrocks et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202503678). Liposomes, encapsulating calcium&#8208;sensitive dye, pass through the channel aligned with the microscope. Membrane&#8208;permeabilizing agents allow calcium influx, sensitizing the dye which is detected as the liposome passes through the confocal volume. As successive liposomes pass through the volume, signals acquired indicate the permeabilising properties of the analyte.

Changes in electrode surface chemistry under electrochemical conditions critically influence electrocatalytic performance. In their Communication (e202500965), Julia Kunze&#8208;Liebh&#228;user et al. employed in&#8208;situ electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor the surface state of tungsten carbide (WC) powder electrodes during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and at oxidative potentials. Upon electrochemical polarization, the ubiquitous oxide layer dissolves, which causes exposure of the catalytically active carbide surface under HER conditions.

         <title>Functional SELEX and Biomedical Applications of Aptamers: Beyond Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the limitations of traditional aptamer selection methods, which often ignore functional performance in biological contexts. Functional SELEX now selects aptamers with both high specificity and biological activity (F&#8208;aptamers), making them valuable for therapy and cellular regulation. This minireview further highlights advances, challenges, and opportunities in F&#8208;aptamer research, emphasizing the transformative potential of F&#8208;aptamers in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers, developed through SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), are generally short oligonucleotide molecules with remarkable specificity and binding affinity to diverse biological targets. These molecules have shown promise across such fields as biosensing, molecular diagnostics, and bioimaging. However, while conventional aptamer selection strategies predominantly emphasize binding affinity, they overlook the broader spectrum of potential biological functionalities. This oversight results in aptamers that frequently exhibit limited capacity for direct biological regulation. This inherent limitation in the selection process significantly constrains both the widespread application of aptamers across diverse fields and their therapeutic potential as direct drug candidates. Functional SELEX represents an advancement by refining selection library construction and selection processes to create F&#8208;aptamers that integrate precise molecular recognition with specific biological activities. F&#8208;aptamers hold transformative potential as therapeutic agents, diagnostic tools, and molecular regulators, marking a significant step forward in biomedical applications. This minireview critically assesses recent developments in F&#8208;aptamer SELEX strategies, addressing challenges, and exploring opportunities for future research in this dynamic field.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Polymer Delivery Platforms for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the molecular and vector design strategies, and responsive mechanisms of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, covering pH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), enzymes, hypoxia, and dual/multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive vectors. In parallel, it also provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms for drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Furthermore, the review discusses the current challenges and future directions in the field, offering feasible insights for the development of next&#8208;generation TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms in terms of molecular and vector design.








Abstract
Most chemotherapeutic and bioimaging agents struggle with inadequate bioavailability, primarily due to their limited biocompatibility and lack of specificity in targeting, leading to low or decreased anticancer efficacy and inaccurate imaging. To surmount these obstacles, the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, predominantly leveraging the tumor microenvironment (TME), has emerged as a promising strategy. Therapeutic and diagnostic agents can be released controllably at the tumor site by virtue of the bond cleavage or hydrophobic to hydrophilic transformation of TME&#8208;sensitive linkages in TME&#8208;responsive systems, thus augmenting cancer treatment and imaging precision, while simultaneously attenuating the damage to healthy tissues and false imaging signals caused by non&#8208;specific drug leakage. In this comprehensive review, we scrutinize recent studies of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, encompassing pH&#8208;, ROS&#8208;, GSH&#8208;, enzyme&#8208;, and hypoxia&#8208;responsive vectors, significantly from the perspective of their molecular design and responsive mechanism, and further summarizing their bio&#8208;application in drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Moreover, this review encapsulates the critical challenges and offers an insightful perspective on the future prospects of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms in terms of molecular and vector design.

         <title>Tuning Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters for Selective Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a summary of the structure&#8211;property relationship of atomically precise gold nanoclusters and their application in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. It delves into the underlying mechanisms of CO2 reduction process and identifies the key factors influencing the performance of these nanoclusters. Furthermore, future research directions are discussed to improve efficiency and expand the diversity of multicarbon products from CO&#8322; reduction using gold nanoclusters.








Abstract
The electroreduction of greenhouse gas CO2 into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity is a promising way to mitigate climate change and realize carbon cycling. Atomically precise thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters have shown great potential for selective electrochemical conversion of CO2 toward CO due to their quantum confinement effect and unique electronic structures. Additionally, the atomic precision of gold nanocluster is advantageous for investigating the CO2 reduction mechanism, which is typically challenging to understand due to the complexity of the catalytic interface, and unknown structure of the active site in more conventional catalysts. By summarizing CO2 reduction catalyzed by gold nanoclusters, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to the activity, selectivity, and stability of nanocluster catalysts, as well as elucidate the CO&#8322; reduction pathway, thereby contributing to the design of more active and selective nanocluster catalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Sequence Control in Sulphur&#8208;Containing Ring&#8208;Opening Co&#8208; and Terpolymerisations</title>

Sulphur&#8208;containing polymers offer unique avenues for degradability, recyclability and optical performance&#8212;but their synthesis is often plagued by side reactions. This minireview outlines recent strategies to control or harness O/S scrambling in ring&#8208;opening co&#8208; and terpolymerisations, enabling precise sequence control. Emerging applications in dynamic materials, self&#8208;assembly, and sustainable plastics are highlighted. 








Abstract
Sulphur&#8208;containing polymers uniquely expand the catalogue of accessible material properties compared to current commodity materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped. Combining sulphur&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing monomers in ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation leads to a reshuffling reaction of the sulphur centres, which has been challenging to control &#8212; a central task for reliably tailoring properties. However, very recent methodologies have emerged that not only suppress but also utilise this phenomenon to precisely access sulphur&#8208;containing polymer structures. These structures can exhibit improved degradability, chemical recyclability, refractive indices and crystallinity compared to their all&#8208;oxygen analogues. Furthermore, underutilised and even entirely untapped monomer feedstocks can become accessible as a result. This minireview aims to provide a roadmap of the tools currently available to selectively access sulphur&#8208;containing co&#8208; and terpolymer structures to enable emerging applications that leverage the chemistry of sulphur.

         <title>Exploring the Interplay of Lattice Dynamics and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors: Progress Toward Rational Phonon Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights recent advances in understanding the role of lattice dynamics and electron&#8211;phonon coupling in organic semiconductors. Emphasis is placed on mode&#8208;resolved insights into dynamics&#8208;induced electronic disorder, emerging strategies for phonon engineering, and the implications of both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency vibrations on charge transport.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential use in flexible, lightweight, and cost&#8208;effective electronic devices. Despite their promise, the assembly of organic molecules into the condensed phase promotes a diverse set of lattice dynamics that introduce a detrimental modulation in the intermolecular electronic structure&#8212;termed dynamic disorder&#8212;that results in charge carrier mobilities that are orders of magnitude lower than inorganic semiconductors. This dynamic disorder is generally associated with low&#8208;frequency phonons, yet whether a small subset of modes or a broad range of phonons&#160; drives dynamic disorder remains contested. Resolving this debate is critical for defining how targeted phonon engineering could practically improve OSC performance. In this review, we explore progress toward uncovering the interplay between lattice dynamics and charge transport in OSCs, focusing on the critical role of thermally activated phonons. We describe the powerful insight that mode&#8208;resolved analyses of electron&#8211;phonon interactions lends toward the rational design of new materials. We highlight recent efforts to achieve this, showcasing proposed strategies to mitigate dynamic disorder through molecular and crystal design.

     alt="Exploring the Interplay of Lattice Dynamics and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors: Progress Toward Rational Phonon Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Minireview highlights recent advances in understanding the role of lattice dynamics and electron&#8211;phonon coupling in organic semiconductors. Emphasis is placed on mode-resolved insights into dynamics-induced electronic disorder, emerging strategies for phonon engineering, and the implications of both low- and high-frequency vibrations on charge transport.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential use in flexible, lightweight, and cost-effective electronic devices. Despite their promise, the assembly of organic molecules into the condensed phase promotes a diverse set of lattice dynamics that introduce a detrimental modulation in the intermolecular electronic structure&#8212;termed dynamic disorder&#8212;that results in charge carrier mobilities that are orders of magnitude lower than inorganic semiconductors. This dynamic disorder is generally associated with low-frequency phonons, yet whether a small subset of modes or a broad range of phonons&#160; drives dynamic disorder remains contested. Resolving this debate is critical for defining how targeted phonon engineering could practically improve OSC performance. In this review, we explore progress toward uncovering the interplay between lattice dynamics and charge transport in OSCs, focusing on the critical role of thermally activated phonons. We describe the powerful insight that mode-resolved analyses of electron&#8211;phonon interactions lends toward the rational design of new materials. We highlight recent efforts to achieve this, showcasing proposed strategies to mitigate dynamic disorder through molecular and crystal design. This work offers an overview of the insight gained toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing charge transport in OSCs and outlines pathways for enhancing performance via targeted manipulation of interatomic/intermolecular interactions and resulting phonon&#160;modes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Disruption of 1D Wire&#8208;Like Arrays of Monoatomic Ag(I) Ions: Single&#8208;Crystal Reaction with Crystal Softening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

An Ag(I)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic crystal featuring 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies undergoes UV&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photodimerization, transforming periodic metal arrays into dimers, creating voids, and decreasing crystal stiffness.








Abstract
The exploitation of noncovalent bonding in the solid state is attractive to generate one&#8208;dimensional (1D) wire&#8208;like assemblies of metals and uncover dynamic and physical properties of such intriguing structures. Herein, we describe a metal&#8208;organic crystal based on Ag(I) ions that assemble to be organized into 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies maintained by argentophilic interactions. UV&#8208;light irradiation of the crystal composed of the 1D structures results in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization that transforms the 1D periodic metal arrays to isolated metal dimers. The structural reconfiguration creates small voids in the crystal and the resulting solids exhibit a substantial increase in softness up to 60%.

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208;Promoted Decomposition of Cysteine Ester (ITPDC): A General Platform for Controllable Release of Reactive Sulfur Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive sulfur species (RSS) are important endogenous molecules relevant to human health, but general approaches for the controllable release of distinct RSS are still lacking. In this work, we report a well&#8208;defined and safety donation platform for developing triggered RSS donors with sulfur oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4. This work should extend the applicable chemical space for RSS delivery and research.








Abstract
Endogenously generated reactive sulfur species (RSS) play critical roles in various physiological processes. RSS donors can enhance our understanding of RSS chemical biology and open new avenues for treating RSS&#8208;associated diseases. Nevertheless, general strategies for the controllable release of distinct RSS remain lacking. Herein, we present the first general platform for controllable release of RSS with sulfur oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4, based on the intramolecular thiol&#8208;promoted decomposition of cysteine ester (ITPDC). We first rationally designed ITPDC&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donors that avoid electrophilic byproducts and exhibit high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;50%). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations elucidated the detailed pathways of pH&#8208;controllable H2S release from ITPDC, and computational studies also predicted other H2S&#8208;related RSS release from the ITPDC&#8208;based motifs. Importantly, we developed a series of ITPDC&#8208;based donors capable of releasing various RSS, including persulfide, hydrogen persulfide, sulfenic acid, sulfinic acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Moreover, fluorescent imaging demonstrated the successful cellular delivery of H2S, persulfide, and SO2 from these donors, and the ITPDC&#8208;based motif was employed to create a light&#8208;triggered donor. We anticipate that these innovative chemistries will provide valuable tools for studying sulfur biology and for developing new RSS donors and bio&#8208;orthogonal cleavage techniques.

         <title>Spatio&#8208;Temporal Processes of Diffusion&#8208;Controlled Communication in Hierarchical Multi&#8208;Compartments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the molecular communication of neighboring biomimetic populations in pH&#8208;responsive hierarchically and non&#8208;covalently organized multi&#8208;compartments (HMC) through the assembly of micro&#8208; and nanocompartments. HMC unify key roles for cyclic spatio&#8208;temporal diffusion processes and spatio&#8208;temporal enzyme(&#8208;like) reactions.








Abstract
Exploring the synergy of feedback behavior and molecular communication between micro&#8208; and nanocompartments is of great implication for the development of advanced hierarchical living&#8208;like materials. Non&#8208;covalent interactions are the driving forces for dynamic and temporal events in biomimetic structures. Herein, pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical multi&#8208;compartments (HMC) are constructed via hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic interactions between azobenzene units and phospholipid layers through the integration of two distinct structural units: phospholipid&#8208;membranized coacervates (Coa@DMPC) and azobenzene&#8208;functionalized polymersomes (Azo&#8208;Psomes). This enables us to study spatio&#8208;temporal signal pathways for biomimetic pH homeostasis and the triggering of feedback&#8208;controlled peroxidase&#8208;like behavior of Azo&#8208;Psomes within HMC. Compared with undocking systems, the information transmission process within HMC shows a high efficiency. Besides the continuous addition of nutrients, the synchronization of two different biomimetic reactions in HMC requires the spatial loading of glucose oxidase and L&#8208;phenylalanine ammonia lyase in coacervates and of L&#8208;phenylalanine or beta&#8208;cyclodextrin/hemin complexes in Azo&#8208;Psomes. Azo&#8208;Psomes exhibit pH&#8208;responsive feedback&#8208;controlled behavior. The pH&#8208;responsive membrane of Azo&#8208;Psomes is responsible for the spatio&#8208;temporal peroxidase&#8208;like activity of lumen&#8208;integrated beta&#8208;cyclodextrin/hemin complexes in Azo&#8208;Psomes. Finally, this strategy provides a new approach for constructing more complex biomimetic systems by interconnecting at least two membrane&#8208;containing compartments to further explore the synergistic mechanisms and feedback behaviors among artificial cell communities.

These biotransformations offer a sustainable strategy for synthesizing valuable chiral N&#9472;N containing products that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.








Abstract
Enantioselective reduction of hydrazones provides a convergent and versatile route to synthesize hydrazine&#8208;containing motifs that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, current methods require the use of precious metals, costly chiral ligands, and/or forcing reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a biocatalytic approach for enantioselective hydrazone reduction using engineered imine reductases. Following evaluation of an in&#8208;house panel of &gt;400 IRED sequences, we identified a single IR361 I127F L179V variant that promotes reduction of Cbz&#8208;protected hydrazones. The introduction of additional two mutations via directed evolution afforded HRED1.1 that is 20&#8208;fold more active than the parent template and promotes reduction of a variety of protected hydrazones in high yields and selectivities (&gt;99% e.e.), including in preparative scale biotransformations. Structural analysis of HRED1.1 provides insights into the origins of its unique hydrazone reductase activity. This study offers a powerful biocatalytic route to synthesize valuable chiral hydrazine products and further expands the impressive range of transformations accessible with engineered imine reductases.

         <title>Luminescent Detection of Photomagnetic Effect in a Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Neodymium(III)&#8211;Octacyanidotungstate(IV) Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic neodymium(III)&#8211;tungsten(IV) layered cyanido&#8208;bridged framework combines 4f&#8208;metal&#8208;centered near&#8208;infrared emission with a thermally reversible octacyanidotungstate(IV)&#8208;based photomagnetic response. As a result, it exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescent read&#8208;out of photo&#8208;induced changes in magnetization relying on the ratio between two selected peaks of excitation spectra and their temperature dependence.








Abstract
Photomagnetic materials form a class of magnetic systems, in which light irradiation changes their magnetization. Photomagnetic behavior is often observed in spin transition materials, including spin&#8208;crossover complexes, and can lead to long&#8208;range magnetic ordering. Photo&#8208;induced magnetization can affect different physical properties, including second harmonic generation. Still, despite a growing number of luminescent spin&#8208;crossover systems, the simultaneous switching of both magnetism and luminescence was not yet explored. In this regard, we present systematic studies for a novel coordination polymer composed of anionic NdIII&#8211;[WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; layers, crystallizing with chiral organic cations embedded in the interlayer space. Not only we observe and rationalize theoretically near&#8208;infrared emission of NdIII centers sensitized by [WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; units, but we also found a plausible pathway to track the photomagnetic effect throughout the analysis of the Nd3+ excitation spectra and their temperature dependence. The observed thermally reversible effects in luminescence were correlated with the results of photomagnetic studies, providing an attractive pathway to monitor the light&#8208;induced magnetization changes through a photoluminescent read&#8208;out.

         <title>Mesoporous Enhanced Heterostructured Halide Solid Electrolytes with High Air Stability and High Abundance for Sustainable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NaCl&#8208;based solid electrolyte reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3 is introduced. This heterostructure halide electrolyte effectively balances the ion conductivity and air stability, with a high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD kg&#8722;1 when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding conversion&#8208;type Na//FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Chlorides and fluorides solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) exhibit contrasting extremes in ionic conductivity and moisture sensitivity. In light of these conflicting factors, we introduce a NaCl&#8208;based SE reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3 (denoted as HS&#8208;AlF3), leading to a heterostructure halide architecture, designated as NHxy (where x/y represents the mass ratio of NaCl to HS&#8208;AlF3). The high dispersion of NaCl and HS&#8208;AlF3 during mechanochemical process enables the generation of defective and amorphous structures and nanodomains in NHxy along with F&#8208;Cl anion substitution effect at grain boundaries. These factors collectively promote Na ion transport in NHxy, especially along the NaCl based heterostructures with AlF3 and NaF. This class of SEs achieves the high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. Specifically, NH54 exhibits excellent long&#8208;term air stability at 35% relative humidity, maintaining high ion conductivity without degradation. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD kg&#8722;1 when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding Na//Na symmetric cells demonstrate the stable cycling for at least 1000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 cells assembled with the NH54 after air exposure exhibit the remarkable longevity, sustaining over 400 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. The conversion&#8208;type Na/NH54/FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh g&#8722;1. This work opens the new pathways for inorganic SEs with enhanced economic value, ion conductivity, air stability and suitability for energy&#8208;dense conversion reaction batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Abiotic Synthesis of Ribose on Chiral Mesostructured Hydroxyapatite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective abiotic synthesis of ribose was found to be catalyzed by hydroxyapatite endowed with helically lattice&#8208;distorted chiral mesostructure. Ribose with a significant d&#8208;enantiomeric excess was synthesized on the right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite nanorods due to its enantiomeric adsorption selectivity, which provides new insights and potential evidence supporting the &#8220;RNA world&#8221; hypothesis on the origin of life.








Abstract
The prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose are crucial processes in the origin of life. However, the prebiotic emergence of enantiomerically enriched ribose on primitive Earth remains an unresolved challenge. Herein, we propose that the prebiotic enantioselective synthesis of ribose from glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde can be catalyzed by minerals naturally endowed with chiral structure. The chiral mesostructured hydroxyapatite films (CMHAPFs), which consist of lattice&#8208;distorted helical nanorods, can be formed under a hydrothermal condition in the presence of l/d&#8208;malic acid (MA), a compound that may have been present during the early stages of life's emergence. An enantiomeric excess (ee) of 22.5% for d&#8208;ribose was achieved on the d&#8208;CMHAPFs formed by d&#8208;MA. The adsorption conformation of d&#8208;ribose on the surface of right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite is more stable than that of l&#8208;ribose. The different energy barriers for the transition states of ribose enantiomers result in the enantioselective synthesis of ribose, which is attributed to the similar conformation between ribose and the corresponding transition state. Our findings provide valuable insights into the possible role of chiral inorganics in the prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose.

Design and convergent synthesis of 5mC, 5mdC and 5mCpG mimics to interact with MBD2 reader protein and disrupt the DNA/MBD2 interaction. NMR studies confirm compound binding at the DNA/MBD2 interface, highlighting the advantage of l&#8208;configuration of 5mdC.








Abstract
DNA methylation modulates gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns characterise a wide range of diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, and serve as validated therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Among the proteins involved in DNA methylation regulation, the human reader methyl&#8208;CpG binding domain 2 protein (MBD2) exhibits a strong preference for methylated DNA and initiates signalling cascades predominantly resulting in gene repression. The full description of this mechanism is still to be elucidated. Here, we developed original chemical compounds to interfere with MBD2 and its interaction with DNA. Through convergent chemical pathways, we modified 5&#8208;methylcytosine at position N4 and synthesised the corresponding deoxynucleosides and CpG dimers. We tested 70 compounds in two screening assays to assess their interaction with MBD2 and their ability to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex. Remarkably, substituting modified nucleobases into CpG dimers significantly boosted the biological activity. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the configuration (d/l) of the modified nucleosides and identified four dimers (5d, 7e, 15e and 16e) able to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex, highlighting the advantage of the l&#8208;configuration. Importantly, NMR experiments confirmed their interaction with amino acids of MBD2 involved in methylated DNA binding.

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of RNA Using O6&#8208;alkylguanine SNAP&#8208;Tag Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SNAPR is a ribozyme that repurposes O6&#8208;benzylguanine SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for site&#8208;specific labeling of RNA with bioorthogonal alkyne and azide functional groups, fluorophores or photocrosslinkers. The N1A&#8208;alkylated RNA products were converted to N6A&#8208;modified RNA by Dimroth rearrangement. RNA&#8208;catalyzed fluorescent labeling was shown for tRNA, and protein&#8211;RNA photocrosslinking was demonstrated for an m6A reader protein.








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of RNAs with functional handles enables studies of RNA structure, fate, function, and interactions. Ribozymes provide an elegant way to covalently modify RNA of interest (ROI). Here, we report that the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 can be employed as a versatile tool for RNA modification and labeling. Using O6&#8208;alkylguanine cofactors, designed in analogy to SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for protein labeling, MTR1 installs various bioorthogonal functional groups at N1 of a specific adenosine in the RNA target. In this application of ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed RNA labeling, MTR1 is now called SNAPR. In contrast to the self&#8208;labeling SNAP&#8208;tag, which is appended to the protein of interest, SNAPR is a truly intermolecular RNA catalyst (active in trans). SNAPR assembles with the ROI to the active ribozyme, allowing for the transfer of clickable tags, such as azide and alkyne moieties, as well as photolabile groups or cross&#8208;linkers from the guanine cofactor to the ROI. Moreover, we demonstrate a two&#8208;step approach to attach labels at N6 of the target adenosine: first, SNAPR generates N1A&#8208;modified RNA, followed by preparative Dimroth rearrangement to produce N6A&#8208;modified RNA. We demonstrate this strategy with p&#8208;azidobenzyl groups as photocrosslinker to generate covalent RNA&#8211;protein conjugates. Overall, this work expands the toolbox for site&#8208;specific RNA modification.

         <title>Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12: A Geometrically Closed, but Electronically Open Triple&#8208;Shell Icosahedral Gold Cluster and its Geometrically Open Counterpart</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first triple&#8208;shell icosahedral metal cluster, Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12, is stabilized by phosphines and thiolates but does not show stable motifs. This cluster fills the gap between single&#8208;shell clusters and nanoparticles in the form of an icosahedron. This geometrically closed but electronically open cluster co&#8208;crystallizes with an Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)12 cluster, which is in contrast geometrically open but electronically closed. Both clusters provide a unique view of the transition between molecules and nanoparticles.








Abstract
The aesthetic platonic solids have been known since ancient times, and the structure of all five platonic solids is also found in chemical compounds. While gold sub&#8208;nanometer clusters and gold nanoparticles with an icosahedral structure have been known for a long time to exist, a multi&#8208;shell icosahedral gold cluster at the intermediate size between 13 and thousands of atoms has been elusive. Here we present the synthesis and crystallographic characterization of the first triple&#8208;shell icosahedral metal cluster, Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12 1. The gold core in 1 is stabilized by phosphines and thiolates, but surprisingly no staple motifs are formed. A second cluster, Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)12 2, cocrystallizes and is identified as having a closed electronic shell but can be considered as a geometrically open pendant of 1. The unique clusters are characterized experimentally by EDX, UV/vis, DLS, and EPR and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>A C&#8211;H Arylation&#8208;Based Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the synthesis of planar chiral macrocyclophanes via Pd0&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation is reported. It relies on the design of new bifunctional ligands showing optimal noncovalent interactions with the substrate, and involves the dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile precursors. The obtained macrocyclophanes show interesting chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Despite the growing importance of planar chiral macrocyclophanes owing to their unique properties in different areas of chemistry, methods that are effective in controlling their planar chirality are restricted to certain molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report the first Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H arylation that induces planar chirality by installing bulky aryl groups through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). A computer&#8208;assisted approach allowed a fine&#8208;tuning of the structure of the employed chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands to achieve high enantioselectivities. A range of planar chiral macrocyclophanes were successfully synthesized from configurationally labile macrocyclic precursors via C&#8722;H arylation with various perfluoroarenes. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction proceeds via reversible oxidative addition and enantiodetermining C&#8722;H activation. Selected macrocyclophane products showed interesting photophysical and chiroptical properties, which depended on both the nature of the ansa chains and the aromatic moieties.

The zero&#8208;field splitting effect of the high spin center turned out to be very sensitive to the small oblate and prolate distortion of the fullerene cage, showing that interaction between fullerenes and porphyrins followed the order of PtTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;PdTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;NiTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;ZnTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;H2TPP.








Abstract
Weak binding between molecules is becoming a renowned aspect of molecular engineering, offering an alternative to the tuning of conventional chemical bonds. However, the subtle nature of these interactions poses challenges for characterization using standard techniques. Herein, an efficient method of weak binding characterization based on the zero&#8208;field splitting of a high&#8208;spin probe by electron paramagnetic resonance is presented. Using endofullerene as the high spin center, we achieved direct comparison of the weak binding strengths in F&#8208;MTPP (M&#160;=&#160;H2, Zn, Ni, and Pd) and 2F&#8208;3MTPP (M&#160;=&#160;H2, Ni, Pd, and Pt) through the zero&#8208;field splitting parameters. The high&#8208;spin resonance spectrum is sensitive to the small variation in the supramolecular structure. By examining fullerene&#8211;porphyrin co&#8208;crystals with various metal centers and packing arrangements, the relation between intermolecular weak binding and microstructural strain on the fullerene cage is elucidated.

         <title>Thionated Perylenebisimides as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers: Intersystem Crossing, Electron Spin Dynamics, and Application in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found the triplet state lifetime becomes shorter (ca. 0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) with thionation of the carbonyl groups in the PBI chromophore (ca. 127 &#181;s). Both theoretical computation and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra demonstrate the enhanced spin orbit coupling (SOC) upon thionation. Intersystem crossing was observed for dianion of the thionated PBIs, and the triplet state lifetime (18&#8211;85 &#181;s) are long, thus the photoexcited dianions with ISC ability can be used as strong electron donor (the oxidation potential is &#8722;1.47 to &#8722;1.77&#160;V versus Fc/Fc+) in photocatalytic redox organic reactions.








Abstract
The thionation induced intersystem crossing (ISC) in perylenebisimide (PBI) derivatives was studied. The triplet state lifetimes of the thionated PBIs are substantially shortened (0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) as compared to the unsubstituted PBI (ca. 130 &#181;s). Moreover, there is a clear trend of shortening of the triplet excited state lifetimes and the degree of thionation of the carbonyl groups in PBI. These findings rationalize the previous report of the contradictory lower 1O2 quantum yields for the PBI derivatives with more carbonyl groups thionated. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectral study shows that the zero field splitting parameters D (1625&#8211;1992&#160;MHz) of the lowest triplet states of thionated PBI are larger than that of the pristine PBI chromophore (D&#160;=&#160;1166&#160;MHz), which is attributed to the influence of sulfur atoms. Interestingly, the electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern of the TREPR spectra is inverted at longer delay time. Importantly we observed ISC for the dianion of the thionated PBI derivatives, and photoexcited dianion species can be used as super strong reductant for photocatalysis with the advantage of long excited state lifetimes (18&#8211;85 &#181;s), and the excited state oxidation potentials are &#8722;1.47 to &#8722;1.77&#160;V (versus Fc/Fc+).

         <title>Uncovering the Photochemical Conversion of Atmospheric Chlorinated Organics on Mineral Dust: In&#8208;Field Evidence of a New Source of Dioxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining in&#8208;field experiment, laboratory simulations, and theoretical calculations, this work identifies a new pathway of photochemical conversion of atmospheric chlorinated organics into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans on mineral dust particulates, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial chlorinated organics and their secondary transformation particulates in the atmosphere.








Abstract
Hazardous chemicals are typically assessed based on their inherent toxicity, often neglecting the fact that their atmospheric secondary transformation products may exhibit increased toxicity and persistence, potentially exceeding the risks associated with the parent chemicals. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) are a significant class of commercial chemicals, but their secondary conversion in the atmosphere remains largely unknown. Herein, by combining laboratory and in&#8208;field experiments, we have identified a new conversion pathway that the CVOCs can be photochemically transformed into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) on mineral dust particulates under atmospheric conditions. We showed that mineral components, particularly Fe&#8208; and Al&#8208;related oxides, can efficiently convert monochlorobenzene, dichloromethane, and perchloroethylene into PCDD/Fs under light irradiation. By combing reaction product measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that the &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 exhibited much higher propensity for dioxin formation than &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, as evidenced by its lower reaction energy barriers for both the initial phenol formation and subsequent chlorination processes. In particular, histopathological assays showed the photochemically&#8208;reacted &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 can cause severe damage to the lung and brain tissues of mice, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial CVOCs and their secondary transformation products.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials, integrated with active learning, reveal novel reduced surface reconstructions of rutile TiO2 (110). These include subsurface shear plane structures, verified experimentally. Theoretical and experimental insights into structural, electronic, and catalytic properties highlight their implications in catalysis.








Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as a catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active&#8208;learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results by comparing experimental and theoretical high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Filler with Anion&#8208;Constrained Centers in Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designed cationic imidazolium&#8208;based units to prepare PAF&#8208;142 containing anion&#8208;constrained centers and fast diffusion channels for Li+, thus facilitating the dissociation of Li+ and its rapid transport. The composite polymer electrolyte PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE, exhibited high Li+ conductivity and remarkable suppression of lithium dendrite formation, achieving excellent long cycle stability.








Abstract
The widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) based on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is hindered by their low Li+ conductivity and safety risks posed by the growth of lithium dendrites. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we designed a cationic porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;142) and introduced it as a filler into SPEs to obtain a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE.

&lt;p&gt;This work designed cationic imidazolium-based units to prepare PAF-142 containing anion-constrained centers and fast diffusion channels for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thus facilitating the dissociation of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and its rapid transport. The composite polymer electrolyte PAF-142-CPE, exhibited high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity and remarkable suppression of lithium dendrite formation, achieving excellent long cycle stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widespread use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is hindered by their low Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity and safety risks posed by the growth of lithium dendrites. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we designed a cationic porous aromatic framework (PAF-142) and introduced it as a filler into SPEs to obtain a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE), PAF-142-CPE. The cationic imidazolium sites could effectively constrain the movement of anions through electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the design of the imidazolium-based building units allowed the cationic sites to be located within the framework, which promoted the transport of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which PAF-142 promoted the dissociation of lithium salts and enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Benefiting from these advantages, the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity of quasi-solid composite polymer electrolyte (QCPE), PAF-142-QCPE reached 8.77&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#160;&#176;C. Additionally, a stable interface with abundant inorganic components was formed between PAF-142-QCPE and the lithium electrode, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites, thereby achieving stable long cycle of the Li//PAF-142-QCPE//Li cell for more than 8500&#160;h.

         <title>Construction of Nonadjacent Stereocenters Through Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Hydroheteroarylation of Cyclopentenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iridium catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#9472;H addition of diverse heterocycles including furan, benzofuran, thiophene, and indole to cyclic alkenes. This process occurs diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectively, delivering enantioenriched cyclopentane structures containing 1,3&#8208;tertiary&#8211;tertiary and 1,3&#8208;quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8211;catalyzed direct addition of (hetero)aryl C&#9472;H bond to an alkene provides an expedited route to construct benzylic stereocenter from readily available arene and alkene feedstocks with complete atom&#8208;economy. However, creation of more than one stereocenter through enantioselective C&#9472;H (hetero)arylation remains a challenging goal. Here we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydroheteroarylation of cyclopentenes to construct 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. A series of heteroaryl C&#9472;H bonds were cleaved site&#8208;selectively and added regio&#8208; and enantioselectively to an unactivated alkene containing an amide coordinating group, delivering valuable enantioenriched cyclopentane scaffolds containing 1,3&#8208;tertiary&#8211;tertiary or 1,3&#8208;quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters with exclusive diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Based &#8220;Transfer Stations&#8221; at Carbon&#8208;Immobilized Metal Particles Enable Rapid Hydrogen Transfer for Efficient Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct engineering of metal&#8208;solution interaction by &#9472;NH2 modified metal sites is demonstrated for boosting the formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD). The as&#8208;generated surface H species are more concentrated compared to the previously reported catalyst where the metal is loaded on an &#9472;NH2 modified support, this enabling a significantly enhanced H2 production.








Abstract
The interaction of surface metal species with the solution plays a key role in engineering heterogeneous catalytic processes. Herein, we present the facile synthesis of L&#8208;histidine&#8208;coordinated PdAg nanoparticles (4.03&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08&#160;nm) anchored on pristine carbon supports (denoted as PdAg&#8208;NH2/C) and their use for formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD). Significant acceleration of FAD related to the histidine is observed, and the enhancement mechanism is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The presence of L&#8208;histidine at metal sites promotes rapid binding of formic acid molecules due to acid&#8211;base interactions. The local enrichment of both protons and formate at the metal&#8208;solution interfaces promotes the subsequent formate decomposition and hydride transfer to the metal surface. The as&#8208;generated surface H species are more concentrated compared to the previously reported catalyst where the metal is loaded on an amino modified support, this enabling a significantly enhanced H2 production. The optimal Pd1Ag1&#8208;NH2/C catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 6493.5&#160;h&#8722;1 at 333&#160;K based on the total amount of Pd, together with an H2 selectivity of 100%. This study emphasizes the critical role of optimizing local transport pathways near catalytic centers chemically and further provides insights into the rational development of heterogeneous catalysts for FAD technologies.

Direct coupling of free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes&#8212;a longstanding challenge due to inherent polarity mismatches&#8212;is achieved via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform featuring cerium(IV) benzoate catalysts.

Abstract
We present a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform utilizing cerium(IV) benzoate complexes to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of directly coupling free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes, overcoming inherent polarity mismatches. This approach effectively circumvents the typical selectivity in single&#8208;electron transfer processes, enabling the selective generation of electrophilic alkoxy radicals from free alcohols in the presence of redox&#8208;labile electron&#8208;rich alkenes. The Ce&#8208;benzoate&#8208;based photocatalytic protocol promotes regioselective hydroetherification via both intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular addition pathways, showcasing broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and versatility across a diverse array of alkenes, including silyl enol ethers and enamides/enecarbamates. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate catalyst, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation, thereby establishing a practical and atom&#8208;economical framework for hydroetherification.

         <title>A General Strategy for Enhanced Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging Through Intramolecular Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging through the development of intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) cassettes, optimizing both photostability and photon budget. The cassettes, incorporating rhodamine as the donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as the acceptor, achieve an impressive 94.8% energy transfer efficiency and a 670% increase in survival time compared to rhodamine alone at the single&#8208;molecule level.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule imaging demands fluorophores with exceptional photostability and photon budget. This study presents an intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) strategy to enhance these critical properties. We developed xanthene&#8208;based IMET cassettes by covalently linking donor and acceptor, achieving significant improvements in single&#8208;molecule imaging performance. While extensive spectral overlap is generally beneficial in bulk systems, single&#8208;molecule imaging necessitates careful optimization to minimize direct acceptor excitation at the high excitation powers typically used. Our optimized cassettes, featuring rhodamine as donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as acceptor, exhibit 94.8% energy transfer efficiency. This configuration effectively minimizes direct excitation&#8208;induced acceptor bleaching, as 94.9% of molecules exhibit donor photobleaching prior to acceptor photobleaching. This efficient energy management leads to a 670% enhancement in photostability, arising from the competition between IMET and photobleaching pathways, which effectively channels excitation energy away from photo&#8208;destructive processes. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that IMET occurs on a picosecond timescale, significantly faster than both fluorescence relaxation (nanoseconds) and photobleaching (seconds). Notably, these IMET cassettes demonstrated superior performance in single&#8208;molecule tracking applications, including on supported lipid bilayers and in live&#8208;cell tracking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dynamics, highlighting the broad potential of the IMET strategy for advancing single&#8208;molecule imaging.

     alt="A General Strategy for Enhanced Single-Molecule Imaging Through Intramolecular Energy Transfer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a strategy to enhance single-molecule fluorescence imaging through the development of intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) cassettes, optimizing both photostability and photon budget. The cassettes, incorporating rhodamine as the donor and Si-rhodamine as the acceptor, achieve an impressive 94.8% energy transfer efficiency and a 670% increase in survival time compared to rhodamine alone at the single-molecule level.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-molecule imaging demands fluorophores with exceptional photostability and photon budget. This study presents an intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) strategy to enhance these critical properties. We developed xanthene-based IMET cassettes by covalently linking donor and acceptor, achieving significant improvements in single-molecule imaging performance. While extensive spectral overlap is generally beneficial in bulk systems, single-molecule imaging necessitates careful optimization to minimize direct acceptor excitation at the high excitation powers typically used. Our optimized cassettes, featuring rhodamine as donor and Si-rhodamine as acceptor, exhibit 94.8% energy transfer efficiency. This configuration effectively minimizes direct excitation-induced acceptor bleaching, as 94.9% of molecules exhibit donor photobleaching prior to acceptor photobleaching. This efficient energy management leads to a 670% enhancement in photostability, arising from the competition between IMET and photobleaching pathways, which effectively channels excitation energy away from photo-destructive processes. Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that IMET occurs on a picosecond timescale, significantly faster than both fluorescence relaxation (nanoseconds) and photobleaching (seconds). Notably, these IMET cassettes demonstrated superior performance in single-molecule tracking applications, including on supported lipid bilayers and in live-cell tracking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dynamics, highlighting the broad potential of the IMET strategy for advancing single-molecule imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Mediated Mass Transfer Toward Industrial Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalytic process that bridges the inherent gap at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, thereby overcoming the barrier for the migration of reactant ions to catalytic sites. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH and formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated water electrolysis.








Abstract
The rapid migration of reactive ions across the electrolyte&#8211;catalytic sites interface is crucial in various catalytic processes. Herein, we introduce hydrogen bonds to bridge the intrinsic gap at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, mediating the diffusion of hydroxide ions. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH, wherein the oxygen atom within the oxyanions established hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules in the electrolyte. Operando spectroscopy indicated that both water electrolysis activity and hydroxide concentration exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped dependence on the electrostatic potential of functionalized group, which formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalysis. The sulfate&#8208;modified NiCo OOH achieved an ultralow energy consumption of 4.23&#160;kWh m&#8722;3 H2 in the industrial electrolyzers, predicting that the electricity consumption can be reduced by 16&#160;000&#160;TWh.

         <title>Cyclization Polymerization of Elemental Sulfur and Diisocyanate: New Polymerization Toward High&#8208;Performance Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a new polymerization reaction, cyclization polymerization of aliphatic diisocyanate with elemental sulfur. It is the first report about directly converting elemental sulfur and isocyanate into a high&#8208;performance polymer. The polymer exhibits remarkably strong adhesion to a variety of substrates either in air or underwater.








Abstract
The development of polymer materials heavily relies on new polymerization reactions. Herein, we report the discovery of cyclization polymerization of element sulfur (S8) and aliphatic diisocyanate at room temperature with 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) organic base as the catalyst, where the two monomers are covalently linked via the formation of thiadiazolidinone (TDZD) or a cyclic isocyanurate ring. The polymer of S8 and 1,6&#8208;diisocyanatohexane (HDI) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and mechanical properties. Particularly, it has exceptionally high adhesion to various substrates in air or under water, e.g., the underwater adhesion strength is as high as &#8764;26.5&#160;MPa for poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PETG) and &#8764;2.3&#160;MPa for poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon). The cyclization polymerization provides the basis for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance polymers with elemental sulfur.

         <title>Mixing and Matching of Hybrid Megasynthases is a Hub for the Evolution of Metabolic Diversity in Cyanobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural combinatorics: Evolutionary mixing and matching of three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters resulted in the emergence of minutumamides, a novel family of peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids. Retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis led to the discovery of nostopeptolide KVJ3, an evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis and sheds light on cluster mixing as a widespread strategy in the evolution of metabolic diversity.








Abstract
Modular megasynthases, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), are molecular assembly lines that biosynthesize many pharmaceutically and ecologically important natural products. Understanding how these compounds evolve could inspire the artificial evolution of compound diversity by metabolic engineering. Over the past two decades, a number of seminal studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of natural product evolution. However, the evolution of NRPS and PKS assembly lines remains poorly understood, especially for NRPS/PKS hybrids. Here, we provide substantial evidence for a remarkable cluster&#8208;mixing event involving three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), resulting in the emergence of novel peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids that were named minutumamides. By combining retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis with structure&#8208;guided genome mining, we could discover a potential evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis. In addition, we were able to trace nostopeptolide&#8208;related module and domain blocks in various other biosynthetic pathways, indicating a surprisingly vivid mixing and matching of biosynthesis genes in the evolution of NRPS and cis&#8208;acyltransferase PKS/NRPS pathways, which was previously regarded as a unique feature of trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS. These remarkable insights into the evolutionary plasticity of NRPS&#8208;PKS assembly lines provide valuable guidance for pathway engineers looking for productive combinations that yield &#8220;nonnatural&#8221; hybrid natural products.

         <title>Why Does the Performance of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalysts Decrease in Acidic Conditions?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts proceeds through electron injection into the &#960;* orbital, triggered by the hydrogenation of pyridinic nitrogen. By closely tracking the changes in the electronic state during the reaction, we have reported that the decrease in ORR activity in acidic electrolytes is due to the protonation of pyridinic nitrogen, which precedes its hydrogenation.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has emerged as a promising low&#8208;cost and durable alternative to platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, its catalytic activity decreases significantly in acidic electrolytes, limiting the practical applications. Here, we report the degradation mechanisms of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts, focusing on the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N), which serves the primary active site. We found that the electrochemical hydrogenation of pyri&#8208;N to pyri&#8208;NH, coupled with oxygen adsorption, is a critical process. Although this reaction occurs at higher potentials in basic electrolytes, it shifts to lower potentials in acidic environments due to the protonation and stabilization of pyri&#8208;N. These results demonstrate that the decrease of the catalytic activity in acidic electrolytes is tied to the basicity of pyri&#8208;N. By controlling the basicity of pyri&#8208;N, specifically its pKa, a guideline for enhancing the ORR and other electrode reactions has been established.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing and Interfacial Contact via Halogenated N&#8208;Glycidyl Carbazole Small Molecules for Low Energy Loss and Highly Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Carbazole&#8208;based small molecules with different halogen atoms not only reduced the carrier transport energy barrier and non&#8208;radiative voltage loss through self&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions, but also regulated perovskite crystal growth, providing a minimal energy barrier of 0.10&#160;eV, an impressive charge collection efficiency of 93.6%, and an exceptional power conversion efficiency of 26.57% (certified 26.4%).








Abstract
Nonideal interfacial contact and non&#8208;radiative voltage loss in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) limit their further development. Herein, two carbazole&#8208;based molecules with different halogen atoms (X&#8208;OCZ, X = Cl or Br) are developed as efficient interfacial regulators. The halogen effect not only finely modulates the molecular packing, crystallinity, and surface contact potential of the MeO&#8208;2PACz analogue via self&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions but also significantly influences the subsequent crystal growth of perovskite, thus resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity, improved energy level alignment, and depressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Importantly, the Cl&#8208;OCZ&#8208;mediated device exhibits a minimal interfacial carrier transport energy barrier of 0.10&#160;eV and an impressive charge collection efficiency of 93.6%. Moreover, the target device (aperture area: 0.09 cm2) shows an exceptional efficiency of 26.57% (certified 26.4%) along with enhanced thermal and operational stability. The strategy is also extended to large area devices, delivering efficiencies of 25.0% for a 1&#160;cm2 device and 22.9% for a 12.96&#160;cm2 minimodule. This study highlights the halogen role of interfacial small molecules in optimizing molecular packing and interfacial contact toward highly efficient PSCs with minimized energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination.

         <title>An Autonomously Liquefied Hydrogel Adhesive for Programmable Bioelectronic Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present transient hydrogel adhesives driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface, which collects high&#8208;quality electrophysiological signals on hairy skins without hair removal. The autonomous liquefication of hydrogel adhesives allows easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any damages to hairy skins and electrode.








Abstract
Hydrogel adhesives have many important applications in the fields of drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and bioelectronics. The detachment of hydrogel adhesives under the benign conditions is vital to the definitive surgical repair and implanted devices. Although stimuli&#8208;mediated detachment of hydrogel adhesives has been achieved, it is still a grand challenge to develop a transient adhesive with programmable adhesion and autonomous detachment from the substrate, especially the hairy skins. Here, we report a transient hydrogel adhesive driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface. The transient hydrogel shows tunable mechanical properties, adjustable adhesive strength, and autonomous sol&#8208;gel&#8208;sol transition with a programmable lifetime. Moreover, the transient hydrogel adhesive enables conformable and stable adhesion to various materials. In particular, the bioelectrode coated by the transient hydrogel adhesive allows to record stable and high&#8208;quality electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and electroencephalogram signals directly on the hairy skins without hair shaving. Notably, the autonomous liquefication of the hydrogel adhesives enables the easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any noticeable damages to the hairy skins and electrode. This work paves a new avenue in the innovative development of hydrogel adhesives for the conformable and detachable bioelectronic interface.

         <title>Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuth oxychloride material with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) was synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield due to overcoming confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect. 








Abstract
During photocatalytic nitrogen fixation for ammonia synthesis, the photo&#8208;Dember effect causes direct transmission of photogenerated electrons from the illuminated surface to the bottom of photocatalyst, thus significantly reducing the number of charge carriers migrating on the surface and nitrogen fixation efficiency. Herein, a bismuth oxychloride material with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) is synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield of 591.94&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) after photocatalytic N2 reduction under simulated solar light irradiation. The designed (101)/(001) interface in BOC(101)&#8208;OVs generates a self&#8208;built electric field (Eself) on the material surface due to different atomic arrangements. Therefore, the newly developed material achieved &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing the transfer path, i.e., from bulk phase transfer to surface lateral transfer path, thus escaping confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect. Meanwhile, after OVs construction, each adsorbed N2 molecule simultaneously bonds with three Bi atoms of material through N 2p&#8211;Bi 6p bonding, accelerating the filling of high&#8208;energy electrons into the &#960;* orbital of N2, leading to a new nitrogen reduction path with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation. This study greatly advances the beneficial effect of charge carrier migration through overcoming the photo&#8208;Dember effect for ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Iron(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Hydroxylation of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene Coupled with Short Chain Branching Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative degradation enables C&#9472;H hydroxylation of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) along with the growth of methyl and ethyl short&#8208;chain branches. Fluorine on the ligand enhances the interaction with LDPE while facilitating hydrogen peroxide activation. The growth of short&#8208;chain branches occurs via &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. The oxidized LDPE exhibits significantly improved mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) is widely used in packaging applications, but after being discarded its environmental impact is a pressing concern due to a lack of effective chemical recycling strategies, especially owing to its chemical inertness and nonpolar nature. To address these challenges, we present a mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative upcycling of LDPE in which C&#9472;H hydroxylation of LDPE occurs coupled with the growth of methyl short chain branching (Me&#8208;SCB) and ethyl shortchain branching (Et&#8208;SCB). As a result, the resulting products achieve significant improvements in surface wettability, crystallinity, and mechanical properties despite a concomitant reduction in molecular weight. CH&#8230;F interactions and &#963;&#8211;&#960; interactions are found between LDPE and the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the catalytic mechanism that fluorine on the ligand facilitates hydrogen peroxide activation and subsequent deprotonation, leading to the formation of high&#8208;valent ironoxo species. The growth of short&#8208;chain branching (SCB) involves the &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. This work represents a transformative advancement in deep understanding of polyolefin upcycling and opens a new approach of polyolefin functionalization and architecture modulation.

         <title>Probing the Catalytic Degradation of Unsaturated Polyolefin Materials via Fe&#8208;Based Lewis Acids&#8208;Initiated Carbonyl&#8211;Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic degradation of unsaturated polyolefins using iron&#8208;based Lewis acids in solution was systematically studied. This carbonyl&#8211;olefin cross&#8208;metathesis strategy was proved to be highly effective in cleaving polymers containing carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds into short segments, even basic molecules for other compounds, e.g., pharmaceutical synthesis, confirming its universal applicability.








Abstract
Degradation and recyclability of polymeric materials, including extensively used polyolefins, are becoming increasingly necessary. Chemically stable saturated polyolefin backbones make their degradation frustratingly challenging. The current effective strategy is to create cleavable defects, e.g., C&#9552;C double bonds along the backbone, and subsequently depolymerize them via cross&#8208;metathesis reaction with olefins. High&#8208;value chemicals or reusable polymeric segments are obtained. This two&#8208;step protocol provides operable means for alleviating plastics problems. There are several approaches to introduce unsaturation into a polymer backbone, like dehydrogenation or copolymerization of olefins and conjugated dienes.

&lt;p&gt;Catalytic degradation of unsaturated polyolefins using iron-based Lewis acids in solution was systematically studied. This carbonyl&#8211;olefin cross-metathesis strategy was proved to be highly effective in cleaving polymers containing carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds into short segments, even basic molecules for other compounds, e.g., pharmaceutical synthesis, confirming its universal applicability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degradation and recyclability of polymeric materials, including extensively used polyolefins, are becoming increasingly necessary. Chemically stable saturated polyolefin backbones make their degradation frustratingly challenging. The current effective strategy is to create cleavable defects, e.g., C&#9552;C double bonds along the backbone, and subsequently depolymerize them via cross-metathesis reaction with olefins. High-value chemicals or reusable polymeric segments are obtained. This two-step protocol provides operable means for alleviating plastics problems. There are several approaches to introduce unsaturation into a polymer backbone, like dehydrogenation or copolymerization of olefins and conjugated dienes. However, for the second step, to conduct a cross-metathesis reaction, only noble metal catalysts can be used most of the time. Regardless of their limited availability, the fact that these organometallics are unfavorably sensitive to impurities would raise barriers in industrial practices. Herein we employed earth-abundant and inexpensive iron-based Lewis acids to initiate carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis reactions between ketone/aldehyde reagents and unsaturated polyolefins.

         <title>Pore Engineering in Isoreticular Titanium&#8208;Isophthalate Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we designed titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination polymers with functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. We conducted extensive investigations to explore how pore engineering influences adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings address the synthesis challenge of isostructural Ti&#8208;coordination polymers and offer insights into structure&#8211;property relationships through modulation of their chemical environments.








Abstract
Pore engineering through chemical environment modification is vital for developing industrial porous materials. Understanding the effects of substitutions in isoreticular porous coordination polymers&#8212;such as steric hindrance, vibrational capabilities, electronic influences, and hydropathy&#8212;is key to elucidating structure&#8211;property relationships. However, accurately assessing the impact of functional groups on properties remains challenging due to limitations in current methodologies. In this study, we designed a series of titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination&#8208;polymers with various functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. The unique spatial arrangement and electronic distribution of isophthalate and its functional groups provide an ideal platform to address these challenges. We conducted extensive investigations combining experimental methods with computational simulations to explore how pore engineering affects adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings not only tackle the synthesis challenge of isostructural titanium&#8208;coordination polymers but also offer new insights into understanding structure&#8211;property relationships achieved through modulation of their chemical environments.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Sourced 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dithiolanes for Recyclable Poly(disulfide)s with High Performance</title>

         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis was developed to access aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers. The resulting aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability and stability, as well as a range of desirable thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, showing potential toward sustainable materials.








Abstract
The development of recyclable polymers presents a solution to the urgent issues of circular plastics economy. To this end, there is an increasing interest in expanding the utility of poly(disulfide)s, which contains dynamic covalent S&#9472;S bonds to enable intrinsic degradability. Lipoic acid and its derivatives represent the most widely used class of monomers for the preparation of poly(disulfide)s. However, their physical properties are usually on the soft side of thermoplastics and can face challenges in wider applications. In this contribution, we report a scalable synthesis of a new class of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolane monomers from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers and their ring&#8208;opening polymerization to aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s. The aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability without the cost of stability. The introduction of aryl side chains systematically improves the thermal properties of poly(disulfide)s. The optical properties of aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s are competitive and so are the mechanical properties of the crosslinked network, showing potential for applications in sustainable materials.

The rapid screening of compounds capable of disrupting or permeabilizing biological membranes is essential to the search for new therapeutics.

Abstract
Cell membrane disruption is associated with numerous diseases and underlies the activity of various antimicrobial agents. The rapid screening of compounds capable of disrupting or permeabilizing biological membranes is essential to the search for new therapeutic drugs. Here, we present a single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy assay integrated with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics to study membrane permeabilization in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing as few as seven dye molecules. This assay eliminates the need for liposome immobilization and achieves detection rates in the range of 1000 vesicles per minute, offering unparalleled sensitivity and detection limits as low as 135 pM, corresponding to just eight permeabilizing molecules per vesicle for active compounds such as ionomycin. It provides a robust platform for investigating membrane&#8208;disrupting agents, including those with antimicrobial properties or implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>In Situ Cation Exchange Enables Air&#8208;Processed Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with over 25% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ cation exchange strategies were utilized to fabricate a PbI&#8322; shell on perovskite surfaces, improving crystallinity, the energy level alignment, and reducing defects of perovskite films. The devices fabricated in ambient air could achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% with excellent stability under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I protocols. 








Abstract
The scalable fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) in humid air with an antisolvent&#8208;free process is essential for future industrial applications. However, high humidity poses significant challenges for achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films, making it difficult to attain efficient IPSCs under ambient conditions. Here, we present an in situ cation exchange strategy to create a compact and uniform PbI&#8322; shell on the perovskite surface by using ZnI&#8322; in acetonitrile (ACN), where Zn2+ replaces Pb2+. This transformation is attributed to the surface defects of the perovskite, which undergo a cation exchange reaction in humid air, forming a compact PbI&#8322; shell. The n&#8208;type PbI&#8322; shell effectively encapsulates the perovskite films, minimizing air exposure while optimizing energy level alignment, thereby enhancing electron transport and extraction. As a result, we demonstrate IPSCs with efficiencies of 25.2% under ambient conditions (25&#176;&#8211;30&#160;&#176;C, 60%&#160;&#177;&#160;10% relative humidity [RH]), on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices fabricated in inert atmospheres. The devices demonstrated remarkable stability, enduring aging tests under the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I for over 4770 and 2000&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Unnatural Triggers Converted From Tetrazine&#8208;Attached Sialic Acid for Activation of Optoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazine precursors (SiaTz) based on a nonO&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold are rationally designed and synthesized, which can be efficiently converted into unnatural tetrazine (Tz) triggers on cancer cell surfaces via metabolic glycoengineering. These Tz triggers activate theranostic agents for multispectral optoacoustic tomographic (MSOT) imaging, enabling localization and image&#8208;guided therapy of orthotopic and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Constructing chemical groups on cell membranes through metabolic glycoengineering of unnatural sugars is an effective means to solve the issue of insufficient or even lack of targets in cancer theranostics. Herein, we address the limitations by developing a tetrazine precursor (SiaTz) based on a nonO&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold and then utilizing it to create unnatural tetrazine triggers on the surface of cancer cells. SiaTz exhibits a good balance between the stability and reaction kinetics under physiological conditions and can be efficiently converted into corresponding tetrazine trigger through bypassing several size&#8208;limiting steps in metabolic glycoengineering process. We also prepare a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept theranostic combination of a trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivative (CyTCO) and a thermal&#8208;sensitive drug 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane]&#8208;dihydrochloride (AIPH) to verify the activation function of tetrazine triggers in theranostics of orthotopic and metastatic tumors. In the presence of tetrazine triggers, CyTCO can be activated via bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction to induce optoacoustic signal enhancement, enabling high&#8208;contrast diagnostic imaging and precise tumor localization to guide subsequent treatments. Tetrazine trigger&#8208;activated CyTCO displays high photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, which can cause an obvious increase in temperature under laser irradiation and then initiate AIPH decomposition to produce toxic radicals for combined therapy.

         <title>Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C with High&#8208;Density Atomically Dispersed Mn Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;step incorporation of manganese into the nitrogen&#8211;carbon materials results in an atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with a high Mn density. This strategy promotes Mn content and anti&#8208;demetallization, enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability. After 30&#160;000 square&#8208;wave potential cycles, the fuel cell retains 81.6% of its initial peak power density.








Abstract
The utilization of transition metal&#8211;based catalysts as alternatives presents an attractive solution for enhancing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and reducing costly platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts in hydrogen fuel cells. Manganese&#8208;based nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C) is anticipated to exhibit durability due to its weaker Fenton reaction propensity. However, a key obstacle lies in boosting intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and increasing the density of Mn active sites, crucial for practical integration into fuel cell operations. Herein, a three&#8208;step method is developed to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C materials with a rich mesoporous structure as highly effective ORR catalysts. The high Mn loading (3.42 wt%) promotes the generation of Duo&#8208;MnN4 active sites, demonstrating outstanding performance and durability for fuel cells. Specifically, the exceptional performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) reaches 649&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC) achieves 770&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Notably, the durability of the Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst in PEMFC is reported for the first time, showing only 18.4% decay after 30&#160;000 square&#8208;wave cycles. This work provides a unique perspective and a systematic design strategy for building feasible nonprecious metal catalysts with a high active site density, addressing the challenges of inefficiency and performance limitations across various electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>A Fluorine&#8208;Free Organic/Inorganic Interphase for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) is proposed as an additive for achieving aqueous Zn batteries combining performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness, which not only modulates the Zn2+ solvation structure but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of an F&#8208;free organic (zinc chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer. 








Abstract
Construction of robust solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) has proved effective in mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions of zinc (Zn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes. Fluorinated SEIs, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional electrochemical stability and high Zn2+ conductivity. However, the formation of such SEIs typically relies on the use of fluorine (F)&#8208;containing precursors, which inadvertently raise environmental and biological concerns because they show high resistance to degradation in natural environments. Herein, we develop an F&#8208;free organic/inorganic hybrid SEI for aqueous Zn batteries using a low&#8208;cost N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) electrolyte additive. The NAG additive not only modulates the solvation structure of Zn2+ but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of a robust organic (Zn chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer, thereby enhancing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and Zn plating/stripping reversibility. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling over 6500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8210;2, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8210;2, and greatly extended cycling stability in full cells (up to 2000 cycles). Our electrolyte design paves a promising avenue toward practical Zn batteries that combine performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness.

         <title>Adaptive Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S Clusters: Consistent Redox Behavior Versus Reversible Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters containing structurally analogous or differentiated cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in distinct oxidation states have been synthesized, which prove to be chemically interconvertible. The analysis of the strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtained from the solution of these clusters indicates that they are electrochemically interconvertible through either reversible or irreversible pathways. This work provides a reference on how Fe&#8208;S/Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters mediate the electron transfer processes through redox&#8208;adaptive structural transformations.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are critical in a number of important biological processes, where their structural integrity can be maintained or reversibly transformed. However, it remains ambiguous how Fe&#8208;S clusters adapt to electrochemical demands for electron transport through redox&#8208;induced structural transformations. In this study, three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters comprising similar or distinct cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in different oxidation states have been synthesized. These chemically interconvertible clusters exhibit strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, irrespective of the structural differences in the core. Subsequent investigations indicate that the chloride ligand in cluster 2 is spontaneously replaced by the solvent molecule in solution and therefore only the solvent&#8208;ligated species exhibits an observable redox behavior that is almost identical to that of the chloride&#8208;free clusters 3 and 4. A comprehensive analysis of the redox behavior suggests that the intriguing redox events in the CV curves can be correlated to the electrochemical transformations between the chloride&#8208;free clusters. This work provides an insight into how Fe&#8208;S clusters maintain a stable redox behavior through structural transformations that can facilitate electron transfer in certain cases.

         <title>Leaching&#8208;Induced Ti Trapping Stabilizes Amorphous IrOx for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Ir/TiN evolves into Ti&#8208;trapped IrOx, owing to the TiN leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect under long&#8208;term oxygen evolution conditions, which helps to stabilize the Ir(III) and lattice oxygen sites on the amorphous IrOx while realizing self&#8208;thickening of the ultrathin catalyst layer in the realistic device, benefiting low&#8208;Ir based water electrolysis.








Abstract
Transition metal nitrides are promising conductive support materials in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas it is unclear if their electrochemical oxidation during prolonged test would affect the OER catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that the leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect from TiN supports effectively stabilizes the electrochemically oxidized amorphous IrOx catalyst. Structural characterizations reveal that the TiN support experiences severe leaching during OER test, leaving minor amounts of Ti&#8211;O species trapping on IrOx clusters, which mitigate the overoxidation of Ir(III) species and elongate the Ir&#8211;O bonds. This leads to 70% reduction of lattice oxygen oxidation and the substantially reduced Ir leaching. Additionally, self&#8208;thickening of the catalyst layers is found during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), enabling an ultralow catalyst loading of 87 &#181;gIr cm&#8722;2 to obtain a stable operation at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 for 500&#160;h. This work deepens the understanding of TiN&#8208;supported catalysts for long&#8208;term stable OER electrocatalysis.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Mediated Rearrangement of Bis(alkynyl)boranes: B&#9472;C Activation versus C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Bis(alkynyl)boranes bearing different B&#8208;substituents reacted with Cp*2Ti(Me3SiCCSiMe3), leading to the formation of B&#9472;C activation products (top right) and C&#9472;H activation products (bottom right), respectively.








Abstract
Reactions between Rosenthal's titanocene (Cp2Ti) and decamethyltitanocene (Cp*2Ti) synthons with various bis(alkynyl)boranes were investigated. A series of titanium&#8208;fused boracyclobutenes were obtained through the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)2NB(CCR)2 or PhB(CCPh)2. This represents the first realization of approaching this structural motif via the rearrangement of bis(alkynyl)boranes within the coordination sphere of a d&#8208;block metal. These findings break the previous limitation that the boron substituent must be an amino group. Furthermore, the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)PhNB(CCPh)2 or (Mes2B)PhNB(CCPh)2 (Mes&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) led to the formation of novel tethered metallocene complexes, in which the titanacyclopentadiene structure is linked to one of the cyclopentadienyl groups via a &#9472;CH2&#9472;BR&#9472; bridge. Both experimental and theoretical studies provided insights into an unprecedented reaction mechanism. The process involves the initial formation of an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated bis(alkynyl)borane intermediate, which was detected and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This intermediate subsequently undergoes either B&#9472;Calkynyl bond activation or CMe&#9472;H activation of the Cp* ligand, leading to the formation of two distinct types of products.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dearomative Epoxidation of Naphthalenes with Aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective epoxidation of naphthalenes into their corresponding arene oxides with aqueous hydrogen peroxide is described. The reaction combines dearomatization with installation of chemically versatile functionality in an enantioselective manner. Chemo and enantioselectivity relies in the synergy of a novel e&#8208;rich and sterically encumbered manganese catalyst and amino acids featuring tert&#8208;butyl leucine moiety as coligands. 








Abstract
Arenes are abundantly occurring molecules of significant interest as versatile starting materials in organic reactions. Typically, oxidation of arenes yields planar molecules such as phenols and quinones. However, several iron dependent oxygenases can disrupt the aromaticity of arenes through oxidation and introduce C(sp3)&#9472;O stereogenic centers, resulting in precious enantioenriched epoxide or diol products. Emulating this enzymatic behavior with synthetic catalysts has met little success until now. Herein we describe a catalytic chemo&#8208; and enantioselective dearomative epoxidation of naphthalenes. The singular chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity features of the reaction critically rely on a manganese catalyst that combines electron donating groups and steric demand on the ligand and activates hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions and short reaction times. Assisted with an N&#8208;protected amino acid, this catalyst epoxidizes a range of naphthalenes providing chemically versatile diepoxides in moderate to good yields and high levels of enantioselectivity. Straightforward elaboration gives diverse access to densely functionalized 3D structurally rich oxygenated molecules. The reaction constitutes a paradigmatical example of expedient access to stereochemically rich, valuable oxygenated molecules from readily available feedstocks, enabled by highly reactive yet selective biologically inspired oxidation catalysts.

         <dc:description>
Polyhydroxybutyrates are key sustainable polyesters, but controlling the stereoregularity is crucial for exhibiting the most promising thermal and mechanical properties. Highly active rare&#8208;earth metal salan/salalen complexes yield isotactic (Pm up to 0.96 at 0 &#176;C) or syndioenriched (Pr up to 0.91) PHB, depending on the steric demand of the ligand and non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) in the catalytic system.

We herein report the influence of the ligand framework on the isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;butyrolactone using highly active in situ generated salan [ONNO]H2 and salalen [ONNO]H rare&#8208;earth metal complexes. The stereochemistry was found to be highly dependent on the ortho&#8208;substituents, enabling the synthesis of either isotactic poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) (up to Pm&#160;=&#160;0.92) or syndiotactic PHB (up to Pr&#160;=&#160;0.91). To obtain further information on the mechanism of the isoselective ROP, which exhibits an enantiomorphic site control (ESC), a new hybrid Y[ONNO]H(N(SiHMe2)2)(THF) complex was isolated and characterized via NMR, DFT, and mass&#8208;spectrometry experiments. The impact of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) was demonstrated by the addition of NCI inhibitors. Kinetic studies revealed a secondary kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) of 1.14, indicating that the pre&#8208;coordination of the monomer plays a significant role in the mechanism. These findings provide a foundation for the future design of catalysts for isoselective ROP.

         <title>Cooperative Iron&#8211;Aluminium Reactivity for Dinitrogen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen activation was achieved through cooperative bimetallic reactivity of a Fe&#9472;Al system, which features flexible, covalent metal&#8211;metal bonding, and captures two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination. Subsequent alkylation of the Al site leads to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex that facilitates the silylation of the terminal N atom. 








Abstract
We report a novel bimetallic approach utilizing cooperative Fe&#9472;Al reactivity for N2 activation on the Cp*Fe(1,2&#8208;Cy2PC6H4AlEt) platform, effectively capturing two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination. Characterizations of the N2&#8208;bridged Fe&#9472;Al dimer (2) using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy coupled to density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals its electronic structure as a resonance hybrid between Fe(II)&#8208;Al(I) and Fe(0)&#8208;Al(III). The flexible, covalent Fe&#9472;Al bonding facilitates the subsequent alkylation of the Al site with nBuLi, leading to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex (3) that enables the silylation of the terminal N atom. Our findings highlight the significance of leveraging Fe&#9472;Al effects as an electron buffer to achieve facile N2 activation.

         <title>A Sustainable and Scalable Approach for In Situ Induction of Gradient Nucleation Sites in Biomass&#8208;Derived Interface Layers for Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass&#8208;based Cu2+&#8208;carboxymethyl chitosan&#8208;kaolin (CuCK) layer composed of in situ galvanically and galvanostatically induced gradient alloy nucleation sites to achieve durable Zn anodes (Zn@CuCK) is designed, which significantly enhances adhesion to the Zn anode, demonstrates abundant zincophilicity, promotes continuous vertical zinc deposition with high plating/stripping reversibility, regulates Zn2+ flux, and facilitates Zn2+ transfer and desolvation. This study provides a sustainable and scalable method to in situ induce gradient nucleation sites in interface layer for engineering durable Zn anodes, promising for practical aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;grid energy storage due to their safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and durability. However, challenges like dendrite growth, corrosion, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the zinc anode hinder their performance. Herein, we propose a sustainable and scalable approach to form a copper gluconate@carboxymethyl chitosan@kaolin (CuCK) interface layer, inducing gradient nucleation sites via in situ galvanic and galvanostatic processes. The biomass&#8208;based CuCK coating features a gradient CuxZny alloy structure that homogenizes interfacial electric field distribution and enhances electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the incorporated Cu2+&#8208;loaded kaolin and carboxymethyl chitosan regulate Zn2+ flux, accelerate Zn2+ desolvation, and suppress HER. The resulting Zn@CuCK anode achieves a high cumulative capacity of 5500&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, exhibits excellent durability in Zn@CuCK//NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells across a wide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 60&#160;&#176;C), and endows the assembly of pouch cells with high energy density.

         <title>Structures of Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthase PhaC from Aeromonas caviae, Producing Biodegradable Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PHA synthase (PhaC) is the key enzyme in the polymerization of a biodegradable plastic&#8212;polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). Structures of full&#8208;length PhaC reveal three key regions essential for substrate specificity and polymerization. Additionally, this study also highlights the critical role of N&#8208;domain&#8208;dependent dimerization in PhaC activity. These findings provide a foundation for enzyme engineering to enhance bioplastic production.








Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a biodegradable polyester that can serve as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, which present a serious source of pollution. PHA synthase (PhaC) is a key enzyme responsible for producing a wide variety of PHAs in microorganisms. Here, we present crystal structures of full&#8208;length PhaC from Aeromonas caviae, a high&#8208;performance PhaC employed for industrial use. The structure reveals an N&#8208;terminal helical domain that mediates head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization and stabilizes the C&#8208;terminal &#945;/&#946; catalytic domain to form a tunnel that connects the catalytic center embedded inside the protein to the protein surface. We showed that this tunnel is a putative egress tunnel for the product PHA chain. Our results establish a fundamental understanding of the PhaC machinery that should lead to improvement of this enzyme in industrial applications.

         <title>NO&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Nanovesicles with Co&#8208;Stimulatory Molecule Self&#8208;Presentation for Multidimensional Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasonic&#8208;empowered nanoDC that integrates NO&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer with artificial DC membrane is utilized to orchestrate a potent T cell immune response. The artificial membrane from genetically engineered CD86+ tumor cells directly activates infiltrating T cells, which are recruited by ultrasound&#8208;triggered protein S&#8208;nitrosylation and tumor ICD. The nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune activation in tumor sono&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Synergistically improving T cell responsiveness represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors; however, current treatments struggle to fully activate cancer&#8208;immunity cascade. We propose a novel gas&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanoplatform, triggering ultrasonic&#8208;sensitive tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) and cascading immune activation. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the nanocore liberates reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, generating highly toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) in situ. The ONOO&#8722; then orchestrated several intracellular events, including protein S&#8208;nitrosylation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and ICD&#8208;enhanced immune cell recruitment.

&lt;p&gt;An ultrasonic-empowered nanoDC that integrates NO-assisted sonosensitizer with artificial DC membrane is utilized to orchestrate a potent T cell immune response. The artificial membrane from genetically engineered CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells directly activates infiltrating T cells, which are recruited by ultrasound-triggered protein &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosylation and tumor ICD. The nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune activation in tumor sono-immunotherapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergistically improving T cell responsiveness represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors; however, current treatments struggle to fully activate cancer-immunity cascade. We propose a novel gas-assisted sonosensitizer-loaded biomimetic nanoplatform, triggering ultrasonic-sensitive tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) and cascading immune activation. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the nanocore liberates reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, generating highly toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in situ. The ONOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; then orchestrated several intracellular events, including protein &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosylation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dyshomeostasis-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and ICD-enhanced immune cell recruitment. Furthermore, the biomimetic artificial dendritic cell (DC) membranes, from genetically engineered tumor cells, simultaneously present peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHC-I) and CD86, enabling homologous tumor targeting but also mimicking the antigen presentation and costimulatory signaling of DCs to directly activate infiltrating T lymphocytes. In multiple murine models, this nanovaccine demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy, including tumor suppression, long-lasting antitumor immunity, and tumor metastasis inhibition.

         <title>High Performance Capacitive Deionization Cathode of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Doped with Trace Molybdenum: Breaking the Capacity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>

The high valence metal Mo&#8208;doped NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF electrode exhibits excellent desalination properties, including amazing adsorption capacity and remarkable cycling stability. Structural characterization and DFT studies show that NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF possesses multiple redox sites, low Na+ migration barriers, excellent reaction reversibility, and remarkable structural stability, resulting in an unprecedented improvement in desalination performance.








Abstract
Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) is considered one of the most promising electrode materials for capacitive deionization (CDI) because of its excellent cycling stability and other advantages. However, the poor desalination ability and low adsorption capacity caused by a single reaction site seriously restrict its practical application. Here, a high&#8208;valence transition metal element Mo&#8208;doped strategy is proposed to utilize traces of Mo6+ to activate the inert&#8208;sites within NiHCF. The Mo&#8208;doped NiHCF electrodes (NiMox&#8208;HCF) with multiple pairs of redox active sites and long cycling capability were designed, breaking the trade&#8208;off between high adsorption capacity and cycling stability. The results show that the preferred NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF not only retains the excellent cycling stability (91% after 200 cycles), but also possesses a high adsorption capacity of 90.92&#160;mg g&#8722;1 at 1.2&#160;V, which is much better than those of NiHCF under the same conditions. In addition, it has good practical application in simulated brackish water and circulating cooling water. Structural characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the Mo doping strategy enhanced electronic conductivity while maintaining structural stability. This research proposes a new method to activate inert sites using high&#8208;valence elements, thus effectively balancing the adsorption capacity and cycling stability of the electrode.

         <title>Supramolecular Recognition of a DNA Four&#8208;Way Junction by an M2L4 Metallo&#8208;Cage, Inspired by a Simulation&#8208;Guided Design Approach</title>

         <dc:description>
DNA Holliday junctions, or four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) are an attractive therapeutic target due to their prevalence in DNA replication and repair, and viral disease. Combining experimental and computational methods, we show that quadruple&#8208;stranded dinuclear platinum metallo&#8208;cages are an excellent size and shape match for the cavity of the 4WJ open conformation, binding with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity for junctions. 








Abstract
DNA four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) play an important biological role in DNA repair and recombination, and viral regulation, and are attractive therapeutic targets. Compounds that recognise the junction structure are rare; in this work, we describe cationic metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages as a new type of 4WJ binder with nanomolar affinities. A combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical experiments show that the size and shape of a compound comprising square planar Pd or Pt and anthracene&#8208;based ligands is an excellent fit for the 4WJ cavity. Whilst the cage is also capable of binding to three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) and Y&#8208;fork structures, we show that the 4WJ is the preferred DNA target, and that duplex B&#8208;DNA is not a competitor. Among 3WJs, T&#8208;shape bulged 3WJs are bound more preferably than perfect Y&#8208;shaped 3WJs. Whilst previous work studying M2L4 metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages has focused on binding inside their structures, this work exploits the external aromatic surfaces of the supramolecule, creating a supramolecular guest that ideally matches the DNA host cavity. This approach allows available structures to be identified as potential junction binders and then screened for their fit to a nucleic acid junction target using simulations. This has potential to significantly accelerate discovery.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Ortho&#8208;Arylation Reaction of Benzoic Acids with Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic ortho&#8208;arylation method has been developed to convert arylthianthrenium salts into carboxylate&#8208;functionalized biaryls, which can be removed in situ or used for further derivatization. This reaction is broadly applicable to (hetero)arenecarboxylic acids, with excellent functional group compatibility and orthogonality to cross&#8208;couplings, enhancing the utility of thianthrenium salts in drug discovery.








Abstract
Arylthianthrenium salts have become key intermediates for late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug&#8208;like molecules. Ruthenium&#8208;phosphine catalysts are now shown to enable their use as aryl sources in high&#8208;yielding ortho&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of benzoic acids. The arylthianthrenium salts are converted chemo&#8208;selectively, leaving aryl halides and boronates untouched. The carboxylate groups are uniquely effective as directing groups, ensuring exclusive ortho&#8208;selectivity even in the presence of competing pyridine or amide groups. This makes the reaction orthogonal to cross&#8208;couplings and conventional C&#9472;H arylations. The carboxylate group can be removed via decarboxylation or serve as an anchor for downstream transformations. Mechanistic studies identify C&#9472;H ruthenation as the rate&#8208;limiting step and highlight the unique efficiency of P(Cy)&#8323; ligands.

         <dc:description>
A hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h&#8208;AAFHFC) achieves 200% FE and 94&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 power density via dual&#8208;electrode H2 generation, enabling CO2&#8208;free energy production. 








Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO), a promising yet challenging hydrogen carrier, offers a unique opportunity for efficient hydrogen generation through electro&#8208;oxidation, simultaneously eliminating harmful HCHO and contributing to environmental sustainability. This study rises to the challenge by pioneering a hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h&#8208;AAFHFC), an integrated system that integrates anodic partial electro&#8208;reforming of aldehydes at low potential with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The device introduces a new self&#8208;powered paradigm for hydrogen generation, driven by electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE), featuring high Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen production, co&#8208;generation of electricity, and HCOOH. The h&#8208;AAFHFC attains an open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.11&#160;V and a peak power density of 94&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, enabling simultaneous hydrogen production at both electrodes with an extraordinary Faradaic efficiency of approximately 200%. This breakthrough marks a transformative shift, moving from traditional electricity&#8208;driven systems to self&#8208;sustaining H2 generation. Our work demonstrates a promising pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, advancing the potential of clean hydrogen energy technologies.

Herein, a high polarity interface material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). CNCB exhibits the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation. The CNCB&#8208;modified FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% with exceptional operational stability.








Abstract
Designing new interface materials with the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation is crucial for developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a high polarity interfacial material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the PSCs. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that CNCB interacts with perovskite precursors (PbI2 and FAI) to regulate crystallization kinetics, yielding perovskite films with preferred orientation and reduced defects. Simultaneously, CNCB chemically interacts with both SnO2 and perovskite surfaces, effectively passivating oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and undercoordinated Pb2&#8314; defects at the perovskite buried surface. Furthermore, the high dipole moment of CNCB induces beneficial interfacial polarization, optimizing energy level alignment and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. The CNCB&#8208;modified FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% with exceptional operational stability, retaining 87.14% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination. This work establishes a molecular design paradigm for multifunctional interfacial materials in perovskite optoelectronics, highlighting the synergistic roles of crystallization control, defect passivation, and dipole engineering in high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>Altering the Symmetry of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C by Axial Cl&#8208;Mediation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

This work reveals the &#8220;Cl&#8208;mediation&#8221; strategy to alter the symmetry of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration via axial coordination of chlorine atoms to FePc molecules on CNTs matrix. The elongated Fe&#9472;N bonds and the transformation of Fe&#9472;N4 symmetry (from D4h to C4v) mitigate the dissolution of Fe centers, by which it allows to lower the ORR overpotential, optimize *OH desorption, and suppress harmful molecule adsorption, substantially improving ORR activity and the stability in zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is acknowledged as a promising alternative for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy conversion/storage applications. Herein, a &#8220;Cl&#8208;mediation&#8221; strategy is proposed on Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C for modulating the catalyst's electronic structure toward achieving remarkable ORR activity. By coordinating axial Cl atoms to iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) matrix, a Cl&#8208;modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C (FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs) catalyst is synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs exhibit an improved ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#160;V versus RHE in alkaline solution, significantly outperforming the parent FePc&#8208;CNTs (0.88&#160;V versus RHE). The advanced nature of the as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs is evidenced by a configured high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery, which operates stably for over 150&#160;h. The experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil that axial Cl atoms induce the transformation of FePc from its original D4h to C4v symmetry, effectively altering the electrons distribution around the Fe&#8208;center, by which it optimizes *OH desorption and subsequently boosts the reaction kinetics. This work paves ways for resolving the dilemma of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts&#8217; exploration via engineering Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration.

         <title>Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Copper(I) Alkynyl Nanoclusters with Exposed Polyoxomolybdate Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

The catalytic active sites located on the periphery of the Mo&#8211;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters significantly contributed to their exceptional photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction, demonstrating an impressive selectivity of nearly 100% toward CO.








Abstract
The directed synthesis of copper(I) nanoclusters with atomically precise active sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses notable challenges. By carefully regulating the acidity of the reaction system, a set of five atomically precise Mo&#8211;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters were effectively synthesized. The adjustment of the reaction system's acidity stimulates the polymerization of molybdate, consequently influencing the encapsulation structure of the outer copper(I) shell and thereby controlling the number of catalytically active sites located at the periphery of these nanoclusters. When subjected to xenon lamp irradiation, the synthesized Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters, which showcase exposed polyoxomolybdates, exhibit significantly activity in the conversion of CO2 to CO (up to 160.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) while maintaining an impressive selectivity of up to 99.9% without any additional sacrificial agent, cocatalyst or photosensitizer. When sacrificial agent and photosensitizer were added to the CO2RR system, the maximum CO production rates for Mo16Cu36&#8208;1 and Mo22Cu30 were 5672.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 7370.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, with CO selectivities of 90.3% and 90.6%. The Mo&#9472;O&#9472;Cu active sites play a dual role in enhancing both CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as facilitating charge separation. This study not only elucidates the synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters with potent photocatalytic activity in CO2RR but also contributes to advancing our comprehension of the structure&#8208;property relationship inherent in nanocluster photocatalysts.

         <title>Metal Synergistic Dual Activation Enables Efficient Transesterification by Multinuclear Titanium Catalyst: Recycling and Upcycling of Polyester Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that facilitates the methanolysis of PET waste with record&#8208;high activity through a synergistic bi&#8208;titanium&#8208;facilitated dual activation mechanism. This catalyst also enables the re&#8208;polymerization of recovered monomers, promoting an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, it can be directly applied to upgrade PET waste into value&#8208;added engineering plastics, biodegradable polyesters, and thermoplastic elastomers.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient and selective catalysts for chemical recycling and upcycling of plastic waste is essential for establishing a sustainable plastics economy and reducing environmental impact. Here, we report a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that enables highly efficient transesterification reactions of esters and polyesters. Detailed experimental and computational studies have revealed that a bi&#8208;titanium framework facilitates a dual activation mechanism, activating both alcohol and ester simultaneously, thereby significantly enhancing the transesterification process.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that facilitates the methanolysis of PET waste with record-high activity through a synergistic bi-titanium-facilitated dual activation mechanism. This catalyst also enables the re-polymerization of recovered monomers, promoting an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, it can be directly applied to upgrade PET waste into value-added engineering plastics, biodegradable polyesters, and thermoplastic elastomers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing highly efficient and selective catalysts for chemical recycling and upcycling of plastic waste is essential for establishing a sustainable plastics economy and reducing environmental impact. Here, we report a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that enables highly efficient transesterification reactions of esters and polyesters. Detailed experimental and computational studies have revealed that a bi-titanium framework facilitates a dual activation mechanism, activating both alcohol and ester simultaneously, thereby significantly enhancing the transesterification process. This catalyst demonstrated exceptionally high activity in the methanolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with an activity up to 1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;PET&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;mol&lt;sub&gt;Ti&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.005&#160;mol% catalyst loading, producing polymerizable dimethyl ester and glycol monomers. Additionally, it effectively catalyzed the re-polymerization of the recovered monomers, yielding the original polyester with high molecular weight and thereby achieving an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, this catalyst can also be utilized for the efficient upgrading of PET waste via transesterification with 1,4-butanediol, polybutylene adipate, and poly(tetramethyene ether glycol), yielding engineering plastic, biodegradable polyester, and thermoplastic elastomer, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fullerene Network&#8208;Buffered Platinum Nanoparticles Toward Efficient and Stable Electrochemical Ammonia Oxidation Reaction for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using covalently bonded two&#8208;dimensional fullerene (C60) polymeric network (PNW&#8208;C60) as unique support of Pt nanoparticles (NPs), we succeed in modulating the binding strengths of the key intermediates in the AOR process owing to the electron transfer between PNW&#8208;C60 and Pt NPs, which can enhance the recombination of NxHy species, avoiding the poisoning of adsorbed nitrogen&#8208;containing species. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Pt NPs/PNW&#8208;C60 exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A gPt&#8722;1 for the AOR as well as remarkable long&#8208;term durability, which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C and graphene&#8208;supported Pt NPs.








Abstract
Green ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier due to its well&#8208;established production, storage, and transportation infrastructure. Moreover, hydrogen production via electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) requires a significantly lower theoretical potential than water electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor stability of AOR hinder the industrial application of ammonia electrolysis. Herein, we report the construction of two&#8208;dimensional covalently bonded fullerene polymeric network (PNW&#8208;C60) supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) as a highly active and stable AOR electrocatalyst. The unique electron buffering effect of PNW&#8208;C60 enhances the desorption of nitrogen&#8208;containing species and prevents their poisoning on the Pt NPs surface. Consequently, the as&#8208;obtained PNW&#8208;C60&#8208;buffered Pt NPs exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A gPt&#8722;1 as well as good stability, outperforming commercial Pt/C and graphene&#8208;supported Pt NPs AOR catalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Multi&#8208;Interface Chemistry by Functional Carbon Dots for High&#8208;Performance Composite Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of synergistic multi&#8208;interfacial regulation is proposed to construct high&#8208;performance composite solid electrolytes, and N,S,F&#8208;codoped carbon dots play the key role in regulating multi&#8208;interfacial structures, including the conversion of surface residual alkali of LLZTO into ionic conductor interlayer and the formation of bridging interlayer between PEO and LLZTO.








Abstract
Low ionic conductivity, poor mechanical strength, and unstable interface structure are still the main factors hindering the practical application of polymer solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). In this work, we have developed a unique composite filler (LLZTOCDs) for solid polymer electrolytes to address these challenges through synergistic regulation of multi&#8208;interface chemistry. The LLZTOCDs is prepared via thermal treatment of N,S,F&#8208;codoped carbon dots (NSFCDs) and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) inorganic electrolyte. Here, the detrimental Li2CO3 on the LLZTO surface is converted into a fast ion&#8208;conducting and an electron&#8208;insulating interlayer of LiF and Li3N, and the carbon dots self&#8208;assemble into a functional organophilic coating on the outermost layer, which acts as a bridge between the LLZTO and the polymer. This unique structure enhances the compatibility and ion&#8208;exchange kinetics between the LLZTOCDs and the polymer, significantly improving the mechanical strength and Li+ transport. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies formed in situ at the LLZTOCDs interface provide an anion confinement effect, increasing lithium salt dissociation, and enhancing the Li+ transference number to 0.85. Therefore, the solid battery constructed with LLZTOCDs exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, long&#8208;cycle life, and high ionic conductivity (1.96&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), providing a feasible strategy for practical applications.

         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system integrating plasma circular RNA (circRNA) biomarkers for diagnosing biliary tract cancer (BTC). By identifying four differentially expressed circRNAs, we designed a logistic regression model (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.970) translated into a DNA computation framework, demonstrating cost&#8208;effective, rapid diagnostics without complex instrumentation.








Abstract
Molecular diagnosis of biliary tract cancer (BTC) remains a significant clinical challenge due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Although large panels based on multi&#8208;biomarkers have demonstrated potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, their clinical application is hindered by complexity and high costs. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system that integrates the detection of plasma circular RNAs (circRNAs) with molecular computation, enabling intelligent and rapid diagnosis of BTC. By identifying and validating a specific and small set of circRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in BTC patients, we designed a DNA computation framework that directly translates biomarker levels into diagnostic outcomes without the need of external analysis and interpretation. In a validation cohort of 70 individuals, our approach achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its potential as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient tool for rapid diagnosis of BTC. This work highlights the potential of molecular computation in enhancing integrated and rapid cancer diagnostics, paving the way for clinical implementation.

         <title>Accelerated Design of Fenton&#8208;Like Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Adaptive Learning with Genetic Programming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an advanced adaptive learning genetic algorithm (ALGA) to optimize Fenton&#8208;like Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) synthesis, markedly reducing experimental iterations. Unlike traditional methods, ALGA integrates genetic principles with active learning, identifying high&#8208;performance Fenton&#8208;like SACs with minimal experimentation. Results demonstrate a threefold efficiency gain in phenol degradation with our optimized SACs, showcasing ALGA's potential in accelerating the design of SACs.








Abstract
Traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods for optimizing catalyst synthesis are time&#8208;consuming and costly, exploring only a small fraction of the vast combinatorial space. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative but still has the limitation of relying on well&#8208;selected initial datasets, which the recent development of active learning (AL) could be addressed. Here, we novelly integrate an AL&#8208;derived algorithm, the adaptive learning genetic algorithm (ALGA), into experimental workflows to optimize the synthesis of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Our results show that the closed&#8208;loop ALGA framework effectively learns from limited and sparse datasets, greatly reducing the research cycle compared to traditional ML and AL frameworks. By iteratively retaining better&#8208;performing genetic information and proactively expanding the search space through mutation and crossover, ALGA identifies the highest&#8208;performing Fenton&#8208;like Cu SACs with less than 90 experiments. The maximum phenol degradation rate k&#8208;value (0.147&#160;min&#8722;1) achieved within the ALGA framework is approximately three times higher than that of the initial dataset and surpasses the reported best Fenton&#8208;like Cu SACs. Our successful implementation of ALGA signifies an advancement in SACs synthesis assisted by the AL&#8208;derived algorithm, offering a guiding methodology for the exploration of other functional materials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional trial-and-error methods for optimizing catalyst synthesis are time-consuming and costly, exploring only a small fraction of the vast combinatorial space. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative but still has the limitation of relying on well-selected initial datasets, which the recent development of active learning (AL) could be addressed. Here, we novelly integrate an AL-derived algorithm, the adaptive learning genetic algorithm (ALGA), into experimental workflows to optimize the synthesis of Fenton-like single-atom catalysts (SACs). Our results show that the closed-loop ALGA framework effectively learns from limited and sparse datasets, greatly reducing the research cycle compared to traditional ML and AL frameworks. By iteratively retaining better-performing genetic information and proactively expanding the search space through mutation and crossover, ALGA identifies the highest-performing Fenton-like Cu SACs with less than 90 experiments. The maximum phenol degradation rate &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-value (0.147&#160;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) achieved within the ALGA framework is approximately three times higher than that of the initial dataset and surpasses the reported best Fenton-like Cu SACs. Our successful implementation of ALGA signifies an advancement in SACs synthesis assisted by the AL-derived algorithm, offering a guiding methodology for the exploration of other functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing the Hofmeister Effect for Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition with tunable transition time and hydrogel stiffness have been realized by coupling the Hofmeister effect&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly with a simple enzymatic reaction. This new finding not only furthers the understanding of specific ion effect in control of biological functions but also offers a new opportunity for the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating soft materials.








Abstract
Dynamic regulation of intermolecular interactions is essential for the creation of dynamic supramolecular materials with lifelike self&#8208;regulating functions. Yet specific ion effect, which is known to possess potent effect on intermolecular interactions, has remained unexplored for such a purpose. Here, we demonstrate our access to dynamic self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular hydrogels by orchestrating the Hofmeister effect through a simple enzymatic reaction. The involved gelators containing carboxylate moieties self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel1) at acidic pH and dissolve at basic pH. We surprisingly find that the dissolved gelators at basic pH can be driven to self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel2) by kosmotropic ions through the disruption of gelator&#8211;water interactions. By coupling to the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, Gel1 gradually disintegrates over time because of the production of basic NH3. However, interestingly, with the accumulation of kosmotropic ions, NH4+ and CO32&#8722;, the dissolved gelators are driven to self&#8208;assemble into Gel2, realizing a self&#8208;regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition process. The transition rate and stiffness of Gel2 are tunable by adjusting the concentrations of urea or urease. This work may shed light on the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating supramolecular materials using Hofmeister effect for many enticing applications such as ion&#8208;programmed biosensing and drug delivery.

         <title>Bismuth Meets Olefins: Ethylene Activation and Reversible Alkene Insertion into Bi&#9472;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined cationic bismuth compounds have been exposed to simple &#945;&#8208;olefins, including the benchmark substrate ethylene. Unprecedented and facile insertion, extrusion, and olefin exchange scenarios have been realized. The scope, mechanism, and functional group tolerance of these peerless transformations have been investigated in a combined experimental and theoretical approach.








Abstract
Owing to its fundamental properties as the parent olefin, its outstanding industrial relevance, and the challenges associated with its activation, ethylene remains a benchmark substrate, especially in main group chemistry. Here we report the unprecedented activation of ethylene and related simple &#945;&#8208;olefins by well&#8208;defined cationic bismuth complexes. The polarization of a substrate by a softly Lewis&#8208;acidic central atom and a nucleophilic functional group positioned in a constrained geometry is for the first time exploited in the activation of ethylene and related olefins by compounds of a heavy p&#8208;block element. Mechanistic investigations point toward a coordination&#8208;insertion&#8208;reaction mechanism. The bonding properties of the cationic bismuth species facilitate unprecedented reversible reactivity patterns and unusual characteristics in chemoselectivity.

         <title>Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Pure Nitrate Reduction via Tuning Bimetallic Sites in Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction was enhanced by modulating the adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption of species in the CoN4&#8211;NiS4 system. a The [CoN4] site selectively adsorbs and reduces nitrate, while the [NiS4] site mimics ferredoxin to accelerate nitrite conversion. Dynamic *H equilibrium suppresses the HER and enhances ammonia selectivity. The thiophene unit facilitates electron transfer and optimizes reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) represents a promising approach for ammonia synthesis, but existing application has been constrained by the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and the sluggish kinetics induced by various intermediates. Herein, we synthesized a series of metalized covalent organic frameworks: NiTP&#8208;MTAPP MCOFs (M&#160;=&#160;2H, Co, Cu, and Fe), based on dual redox&#8208;active centers: thiophene&#8208;substituted Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) ligand&#8208;Ni[C2S2(C4H2SCHO)2]2 and metallic porphyrin. Through regulating the adsorption and desorption of species at the catalytic sites, we have identified the optimal NITRR electrocatalyst: NiTP&#8208;CoTAPP MCOF, which achieved the highest faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 85.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V (vs. RHE) in pure nitrate solution, with an impressive yield rate of 160.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. The generation of active hydrogen at [NiS4] sites achieved dynamic equilibrium with the timely hydrogenation reaction at CoN4 sites, effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the incorporation of thiophene (TP) groups and metal ions facilitates charge transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the reduction in energy barriers at different catalytic sites. The CoN4&#8722;NiS4 system exhibited the optimal adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption capability and the lowest energy barrier (0.58&#160;eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO&#160;&#8594;&#160;*HNO), which is supported by the moderate d&#8208;band center and Bader charge value.

         <title>Constructions of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles Through Phosphine&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Controlled Switch of Selectivity Between Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discloses phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled switch of the chemoselectivity between Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular and intermolecular cyclizations. Easily dissociating P(tBu)3 ligand promotes intramolecular macrocyclization due to favorable interaction of Pd&#8208;catalyst with coordinating groups of substrates to construct strained and strain&#8208;free 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles, and PPh3 ligand affords strained&#8208;free macrocycles via intermolecular coupling pathway.








Abstract
The rigid biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles serve as core scaffolds in numerous bioactive molecules. However, constructing biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles smaller than 14&#8208;membered ring remains challenging, partially due to the strain present in the cyclic intermediates formed during their synthesis. Here, we report that a Pd catalyst supported by P(tBu)3 effectively promotes the intramolecular ortho C&#9472;H arylation of phenols with aryl bromides, leading to the efficient synthesis of both strained 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles and strain&#8208;free bimolecular counterparts. The success of this Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization in generating strained macrocycles originates from the dissociation of the P(tBu)3 ligand from the Pd center, which facilitates dual chelation of functional groups of substrates to the Pd center of palladacycle intermediate for alleviating its strain. Additionally, Pd catalysts supported by PPh3 promote intermolecular cyclization of the same substrates, enabling formation of larger macrocycles bridged by two 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl motifs. These two distinct cyclization modes illustrate how phosphine ligands control the switch of chemoselectivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

These two distinct cyclization modes illustrate how phosphine ligands control the switch of chemoselectivity in Pd-catalyzed cyclizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling an In Situ H2O2 Production: Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;H2O2 Battery Powering 26 LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed an aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery, which targets two birds&#8208;one stone approach via generating H2O2 while discharging and O2 while charging. In situ electrochemical Raman and in situ infrared spectroscopic measurements exhibited the formation of real&#8208;time analysis of products. Local pH insights were examined via micro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Moreover, Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries powered 26 LEDs for more than 7 days.








Abstract
Looking toward ever&#8208;growing energy demand, the advancement in energy storage devices and carrying out electrocatalytic reactions in an efficient way is the need of the hour. Herein, we have employed the two birds&#8208;one stone approach, viz. fusing energy conversion and storing system enabling 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to value&#8208;added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) product and its utilization in the energy storage devices using MnWO4 catalyst, without any external H2O2 source. The designed catalyst exhibited a remarkable H2O2 production of 98% @ 0.37 V versus RHE. The real&#8208;time H2O2 production was monitored by in&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopic measurements. The pivotal influence of electrolyte composition, viz. local pH and the formation of carbonate species on H&#8322;O&#8322; production was meticulously examined through micro&#8208;electrochemical studies using gold (Au) microelectrodes. Further, we have explored an aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery utilizing MnWO4 as bifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable H2O2 production simultaneously producing the electricity. The Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery exhibited a remarkable cycle life of 136&#160;h and an practical energy efficiency of 43%. The galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge measurement of Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery attained a capacity of 25&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The battery also demonstrated &#8805;90% cycle efficiency. Interestingly, the designed Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery (two connected in series) exhibited a stable open circuit voltage (OCV) with a promising power density of 10.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries by powering 26 blue LEDs for more than 180&#160;h (7 days) without fading in the illumination of LEDs.

         <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Alkenylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine and Naphthalene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic dual chiral primary amine and naphthalene catalysis was identified through enamine&#8208;redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) to enable effective electrochemical singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO)&#8208;type coupling with alkenyl trifluoroborate. Mechanistic studies reveal ion&#8208;pair interactions between the protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate, leading to exceptional enantioselectivity.








Abstract
External tuning of enamine intermediate has significantly expanded reaction space of typical aminocatalysis. Notwithstanding the progress of chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;oxidation of enamine intermediate, electro&#8208;oxidation was left as a much less explored area, in stark contrast to the prosperous renaissance of electrochemistry in recent years. Challenges mainly come from the reactivity barrier as a consequence of heterogeneous electron transfer and subtle stereocontrol in ionic electrolyte solution under the influence of electric field. Herein, we report asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of carbonyl compounds using potassium alkenyl trifluoroborate as a model reaction to demonstrate the capability of primary amine catalysis under electrochemical conditions. By employing enamine redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) strategy, a new organic mediator, dimethoxyl naphthalene, was found to greatly enhance reactivity. Mechanistic studies uncover an ion&#8208;pair interaction between protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate that accounts for the exceptional enantioselectivity. This catalytic system demonstrates the best level of enantioselectivities in electro&#8208;oxidative enamine transformations so far.

         <title>Isomerisation and Insertion Chemistry of Imidosilanes Enabled by Reversible Si(IV)/Si(II) Redox Shuttling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report rearrangement and functionalisation chemistry at silicon facilitated by reductive ligand migration and Si(II)/Si(IV) redox shuttling.








Abstract
Spontaneous redox shuttling at silicon is very rare, primarily reflecting the thermodynamic challenges associated with reduction processes for lighter p&#8208;block elements. Here we show that the reactions of boryl&#8208;substituted silylene {PhC(tBuN)2}Si{B(NDippCH)2} with an organo&#8208;azide proceed through a Si(IV)&#8208;Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV) series of redox processes involving both oxidative and reductive ligand migration steps. Each of the isomeric compounds related through this reaction manifold is isolable (and can be structurally characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography), with the overall free energy profile being close to thermo&#8208;neutral. Broader studies within group 14 imply that this redox shuttling is unique to silicon and that reductive ligand migration also plays a role in O&#8208;atom insertion chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched propargyl nitriles via copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyanation of propargylic radicals, which are generated from silyl&#8208;substituted allenes or alkynes. These reactions proceeded through a highly site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) with Cu(II)&#8208;bound nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs). Notably, silyl&#8208;substituted allenes demonstrate exceptional allenic sp2 C&#9472;H bond activation selectivity, outcompeting alternative reactive sp3 C&#9472;H bonds in HAA processes.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Ethynylation of Oxindoles: Total Synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;Corynoxine, (&#8208;)&#8208;Isorhynchophylline, (&#8208;)&#8208;Aspidospermidine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;Limaspermidine</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;ethynylation of oxindoles is realized by virtue of spiropyrrolidine amide (SPA)&#8208;triazolium organocation catalysis. Taking advantage of this methodology and development of 1,6&#8208;aza&#8208;Michael additions with and without an aminolysis process, the collective total synthesis of two types of indole alkaloids was also accomplished.








Abstract
The all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center of oxindoles is a crucial structural element of a broad spectrum of indole alkaloids, imparting these molecules with rigid three&#8208;dimensional configurations essential for their biological activities. Here, we present a catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;ethynylation reaction of oxindoles taking advantage of the catalysis of a spiropyrrolidine amide (SPA) triazolium. This transformation enables the enantioselective construction of the C3 quaternary carbon stereocenter of oxindoles while introducing a versatile ethynyl functionality. Employment of this methodology has been demonstrated in the divergent total synthesis of indole alkaloids (&#8208;)&#8208;corynoxine, (&#8208;)&#8208;isorhynchophylline, (&#8208;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;limaspermidine, featuring a protecting group&#8208;dependent 1,6&#8208;Michael addition or an aminolysis/1,6&#8208;Michael addition sequence to generate two distinct types of spiro&#8208;indoles, tailored for different late&#8208;stage synthetic purposes.

         <title>Desulfurizative Fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 Thioformamides for the Efficient Synthesis of N(CF3)(CF2H) Amines with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines, which display a 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability over N&#8208;CF3 amines. The compounds are synthesized through a desulfurization&#8211;fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides. 








Abstract
With poor metabolic stability being a major cause of failure in drug development, there is a pressing need for strategic molecular modifications to optimize for desired properties and function. N&#8208;substitution has emerged as a powerful approach, with N&#8208;CF3 amines previously demonstrating enhanced lipophilicity and reduced susceptibility to oxidation, albeit inherent instability to hydrolysis. This report discloses the further evolution of this motif&#8212;the introduction of an additional N&#8208;difluoromethyl unit, resulting in an extraordinary 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability. We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines. The method relies on an operationally simple desulfurization&#8211;fluorination strategy of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides and is characterized by broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Reductive Arylation and Alkenylation of Sulfinylamines to Access Sulfinamides Enabled by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for the enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines was developed, yielding enantiopure aryl and alkenyl sulfinamides with high efficiency. Mechanistic insights indicate that migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group is crucial for enantioselectivity.








Abstract
This study reports a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for the enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines, facilitating the efficient synthesis of enantiopure sulfinamides. By employing a cobalt/chiral diphosphine and tridentate ligand system, a range of diverse aryl and alkenyl iodides were successfully transformed into sulfinamides, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. This methodology underscores the utility of sulfinylamines as versatile electrophilic sulfur sources. Detailed mechanistic insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the key step involves migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group, which plays a crucial role in enantioselectivity. These findings offer a sustainable approach for the development of biologically relative enantiopure sulfur&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Day&#8208;Long Organic Persistent Luminescence in Flexible Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A day&#8208;long organic afterglow (28&#160;+&#160;h) is achieved via electron donor/acceptor exciplexes, where polyethylene naphthalate serves dual roles as acceptor/charge&#8208;storage unit and spirobifluorene&#8208;carbazole acts as donor, enabling efficient UV/sunlight&#8208;triggered charge separation.








Abstract
The progress in organic afterglow materials has drawn significant attention due to their extensive applications in fields such as optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bioimaging. Nonetheless, a general limitation of organic afterglow materials is their short emission lifetimes, typically spanning from milliseconds to seconds, which creates a substantial challenge in developing day&#8208;long organic afterglow (DOA). In this study, a DOA system is demonstrated through the incorporation of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Polyethylene naphthalate is used for both the electron acceptor and charge storage units, coupling with a spirobifluorene&#8208;carbazole derivative as the electron donor, providing effective charge separations under UV&#8208;light and sunlight excitation. The resulting DOA polymers demonstrate an exceptional bluish&#8208;green afterglow that endures for over 28&#160;h under ambient conditions, setting a new record for the longest afterglow duration in polymeric materials. Moreover, the DOA&#8208;doped polymers, as both films and fibers, exhibit outstanding flexibility and transparency, making them highly suitable for flexible technologies and wearable devices.

         <title>Stable Mg2+ Dication Weakly Stabilized/Coordinated in Solution: Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity, and Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating carborates was first prepared and structurally characterized as a soluble salt in organic solvents. Combined experimental and theoretical data provided valuable insights into its behavior/reactivity in solution. All data agree with a strong Lewis acidic Mg2+ center, readily coordinating alkenes and alkynes and effectively catalyzing alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation and imine hydrogenation.








Abstract
The first soluble and stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating and chemically robust carborate anions [HexCB11Cl11]&#8722; is described. Mg[HexCB11Cl11]2 (1), prepared by reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with 2 equiv of [Ph3C][HexCB11Cl11], consists, in the solid state, of a central Mg2+ surrounded by two [HexCB11Cl11]&#8722; anions. In solution, experimental and classical molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) agree with cation/anion association being retained, reflecting the high electrophilicity of the Mg center. Yet, reflecting only weak anion/cation interactions, species 1 polymerizes 1&#8208;hexene and coordinates alkynes. However, 1 displays no reaction with HSiEt3 at room temperature, consistent with a low hydridicity of the hard (HSAB) Mg2+ center. Contrasting with 1 (FIA&#160;=&#160;264&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1; FIA: Fluoride Ion Affinity), salt Mg[(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]2 (2), incorporating the more basic ammoniododecaborate [(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]&#8722; anion, is significantly less Lewis acidic (FIA&#160;=&#160;214.7&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) and unreactive with alkenes and alkynes. Salt 1 effectively catalyzes alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation via an initial alkene/alkyne coordination/initiation, as suggested by experimental and computational data. It also efficiently catalyzes (with a catalyst loading down to 0.1 mol%) the hydrosilylation of CO2 to CH4 in the presence of HSiEt3. Salt 1 smoothly promotes the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, and it is also an active imine hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of H2.

&lt;p&gt;The first soluble and stable Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating and chemically robust carborate anions [HexCB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is described. Mg[HexCB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), prepared by reaction of Mg(&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with 2 equiv of [Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C][HexCB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;], consists, in the solid state, of a central Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; surrounded by two [HexCB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. In solution, experimental and classical molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) agree with cation/anion association being retained, reflecting the high electrophilicity of the Mg center. Yet, reflecting only weak anion/cation interactions, species &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; polymerizes 1-hexene and coordinates alkynes. However, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; displays no reaction with HSiEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature, consistent with a low hydridicity of the hard (HSAB) Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center. Contrasting with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (FIA&#160;=&#160;264&#160;kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; FIA: Fluoride Ion Affinity), salt Mg[(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), incorporating the more basic ammoniododecaborate [(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion, is significantly less Lewis acidic (FIA&#160;=&#160;214.7&#160;kJ&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and unreactive with alkenes and alkynes. Salt &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; effectively catalyzes alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation via an initial alkene/alkyne coordination/initiation, as suggested by experimental and computational data. It also efficiently catalyzes (with a catalyst loading down to 0.1 mol%) the hydrosilylation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of HSiEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Salt &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; smoothly promotes the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1,1-diphenylethylene, and it is also an active imine hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Tunnel TaOx Passivating Interlayer Enables Long&#8208;Term Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin TaOx interlayers via ALD boost n&#8208;Si/Ni photovoltage to 500&#160;mV and extend the stability to 500&#160;h in 1&#160;M KOH (&gt;90% performance). The amorphous TaOx layer passivates surface defects and resists corrosion, enabling durable solar&#8208;driven water splitting. This scalable strategy addresses interfacial degradation, advancing PEC technologies for clean fuel production.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells offer significant advantages for solar&#8208;to&#8208;clean fuel conversion but face challenges such as surface recombination and poor stability, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of device failure mechanisms and effective mitigation strategies. Using nickel&#8208;decorated n&#8208;type silicon (n&#8208;Si/Ni) as a model photoelectrode, we demonstrate that surface restructuring during operation initially passivates surface recombination but eventually blocks photogenerated hole transfer, leading to device failure. To mitigate this challenge, an ultrathin (&lt;1&#160;nm) tantalum oxide (TaOx) interlayer is introduced via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This TaOx layer serves as both a passivating contact and a corrosion&#8208;resistant coating. The n&#8208;Si/TaOx/Ni electrode achieves an increased photovoltage from 150 to 500&#160;mV during the activation process,&#160;and then significantly extends the device lifespan, maintaining over 90% performance for 500&#160;h in 1&#160;M KOH at 1.52&#160;V versus RHE. These results highlight the implementation of amorphous TaOx in enhancing both the efficiency and durability of silicon&#8208;based PEC systems, providing a simultaneously passivating and protective strategy for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies under harsh conditions.

         <title>Fused Dual&#8208;Donor Design for Accelerating Reverse Intersystem Crossing Rates of Spatially Folded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially folded A&#8211;D|D&#8211;A type TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2) with dual&#8208;donor fusion design have been developed, which achieve the accelerated RISC rates (up to 1.05&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1) through dense excited&#8208;state engineering, enabling solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with high EQEs (23.9%) and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
The development of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT)&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is defective in relatively low reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates (commonly &lt;5&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1). Herein, we fuse two 3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IAc) donor units to obtain large planar donors (m&#8208;bIAc and p&#8208;bIAc) for forming spatially folded A&#8211;D|D&#8211;A configured TSCT emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2). The configuration of highly parallel and large&#8208;plane intramolecular multiple &#960;&#8208;stacking has been achieved. The symmetrical multi&#8208;channel charge transfer networks of emitters induce multiple energetically proximal excited states within a small energy range (&lt;0.12&#160;eV) at the lowest excited state, creating additional configuration interaction and spin&#8208;orbit coupling channels to accelerate the RISC process. This molecular configuration yields enhanced RISC rates of 6.19&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 for DCT&#8208;1 and 1.05&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1 for DCT&#8208;2. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies of 18.9% (DCT&#8208;1, 474&#160;nm sky&#8208;blue emission) and 23.9% (DCT&#8208;2, 498&#160;nm green emission), with attenuated efficiency roll&#8208;offs of DCT&#8208;2 (12% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2). This work provides a critical pathway for manipulating dense excited states to address the bottleneck of the RISC rates while maintaining structural rigidity, promoting further advancement of TSCT&#8208;TADF materials.

         <title>The Mechanism of Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#9472;H Arylation of Arenes: The Key Role of Bis&#8208;Cyclometalated Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;directed C&#9472;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes is addressed through experimental stoichiometric, catalytic kinetic, and DFT studies. These reveal a key role for bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species and show bromoarene activation proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition. Bromoarene activation at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species is ruled out.








Abstract
The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;directed C&#8208;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes has been under intense scrutiny over the last decade, with conflicting proposals concerning the relevance of various catalytic intermediates and the nature of the key steps. This work presents experimental and computational studies that address these long&#8208;standing questions. Stoichiometric, catalytic, and mechanistic kinetic studies, supported by DFT calculations, reveal that bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species are key intermediates in these reactions. These studies also show that oxidative addition with bromoarenes proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition pathway, as demonstrated by DFT and experimental kinetic orders. Bromoarene activation does not proceed at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species. In the catalytic process, zero order kinetics are observed on both reaction substrates, an observation that is rationalized by DFT calculations which predict a rate&#8208;limiting step within the product&#8208;release stage. These results showcase how detailed experimental and DFT studies can combine to probe mechanistic questions, as well as resolving opposing views around the mechanism of these Ru&#8208;catalyzed arylations that form the basis of promising mild C&#9472;H functionalizations.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Interconversion of Pyridine Dicarbanion&#8208;Bonded Ag13 Nanocluster Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the interplay between solvent environments and structural evolution of in situ formed polynuclear organometallic cluster intermediates. The solvent&#8208;mediated interconversion between two structural isomers reveals distinct stability and reactivity profiles, which stem from solvent&#8208;regulated variations in metal&#8211;metal bonding interactions and adaptive ligand configurations.








Abstract
Solvent screening is pivotal for optimizing metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, yet its impact on the in situ formation and reactivity of polynuclear organometallic clusters remains underexplored. We herein isolate two distinct thirteen&#8208;membered silver cluster isomers, Ag13&#8208;A and Ag13&#8208;M, in acetone and methanol, respectively. Significantly, we demonstrate the interconversion of these isomers facilitated by solvent manipulation. Mechanistic studies on the solvent&#8208;driven Ag13&#8208;A to Ag13&#8208;M transformation reveal this transformation proceeds with a low activation energy (23.39 &#177; 0.81 kcal mol&#8722;1) and positive entropy, involving counter anion dissociation, ligand twisting, and re&#8208;coordination. The observed differences in thermal stability and reactivity between two isomers are attributed to variations in Ag&#8211;Ag interactions and surface ligand arrangements, underscoring the critical role of solvent selection in affecting the whole organic transformation through in situ formed clusters. These results highlight the necessity of considering organometallic cluster intermediates in solvent screening.

         <title>Cooperative Dinuclear Gold Catalysis Unlocking 1,2&#8208;Reductive Elimination Elementary Reaction in Oxidative C&#9472;C Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#160;dinuclear PNP&#8208;Au2 catalyst has been synthesized according to ligand micro&#8208;environmental regulation, which positions two gold centers in close proximity, facilitating favorable geometric and electronic interactions for the synergistic activation of alkynes and vinyl boron reagents. Computational studies reveal a unique 1,2&#8208;cooperative activation mode for 1,2&#8208;reductive elimination process, significantly reducing the free energy barrier and stabilizing key intermediates, and provide new opportunities for cooperative catalysis.








Abstract
Cooperative catalysis enabled by dinuclear metal complexes can integrate the catalytic properties of each metal center, thus opening new avenues to achieve challenging reaction selectivity that are difficult to accomplish with mononuclear metal catalysts. Here, we present a cooperative catalysis strategy using a newly synthesized dinuclear PNP&#8208;Au2 catalyst, which positions two gold centers in close proximity, facilitating favorable geometric and electronic interactions for the synergistic activation of both coupling partners (alkynes and vinyl boron reagents) in the oxidative C&#9472;C coupling. It demonstrates a broad substrate tolerance for both terminal and internal alkynes, providing a versatile platform for the synthesis of enynes and dienes. Mechanistic and computational studies reveal a unique 1,2&#8208;cooperative activation mode, significantly reducing the free energy barrier and stabilizing the key intermediates, thus promoting C&#9472;C bond formation in an efficient manner. The DFT calculations indicate a less explored 1,2&#8208;reductive elimination elementary step. Interestingly, the use of B(OiPr)3 as an additive can effectively prevent the decomposition of dinuclear gold catalyst under oxidative fluoride&#8208;containing conditions.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Networks Mediated by Redox&#8208;Responsive Neighboring&#8208;Group&#8208;Participating Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) effect of selenium&#8208;bridged bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane bis&#8208;alkyl halide (Se&#8208;BCN) demonstrates great potential as a crosslinker for the synthesis of covalent adaptable networks. The activity of selenium&#8208;based NGP can be regulated by oxidation and reduction of the selenium atom, thus allowing the dynamic performance of such crosslinked networks to be controlled through redox response.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) typically require external catalysts to facilitate efficient crosslinker exchange, which can limit the reprocessability of the network due to leaching and degradation of the catalyst. In this study, the use of catalysts was avoided by employing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (BCN) bis&#8208;alkyl halide crosslinker with selenium&#8208;based neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) to enhance the rate of bond exchange. This thermally mediated C&#9472;N alkyl exchange and the associated flow behavior enabled the intrinsically ionic network (which possesses antimicrobial properties) to be both chemically recycled and repaired and reprocessed under mild conditions. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of the network can be regulated by the reversible redox responsiveness of selenium atoms within the network. This novel type of NGP&#8208;based CAN therefore has the potential to enrich designs for catalyst&#8208;free dynamic networks with high performance and modulated dynamicity.

         <title>Coronal Complexation Induces Snowman&#8208;Shaped Janus Polymersome Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snowman&#8208;like Janus polymersomes were produced in a simple, yet versatile two&#8208;step approach involving a plasticizing agent and a cationic polymer additive to complex with the charged polymersome. Shape transformation was driven by coronal complexation altering membrane structure, followed by segregation of the polymer additive to form a protruding bleb of the Janus polymersome.








Abstract
Engineering polymersome shape is a keen area of interest because minimal variations in polymersome properties can greatly affect the performance of nanoreactors, drug delivery vehicles, and more. Although methods to transform polymersome shapes have been evolving rapidly, limitations remain in the scope of applicable polymersome compositions and adaptability to engineer a desired shape. In this work, we developed a method utilizing cationic polymer additives and coronal complexation to transform charged spherical polymersomes into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. The resulting morphologies feature a hollow polymersome compartment conjoined to a protruding bleb consisting of the complexed polymer additive, which we propose forms via a dewetting process. This methodology provides enhanced shape control through adjustments in additive composition or plasticizer content, offering additional routes to engineering novel polymersome structures.

         <title>Decoding Double Layer Dynamics for CO2${\rm CO}_2$ Electroreduction over Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different regions of the electrode/electrolyte interface, such as the interfacial layer and diffuse double layer, are spectroscopically discerned by analyzing multi&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectra. In this way, discrete events relating to reorientation of water molecules in the double layer are elucidated, which correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2${\rm CO}_2$ to CO.








Abstract
Understanding the nature and role of the electric double layer (EDL) at electrocatalytic interfaces and its dynamic evolution, is critical to optimizing electrochemical processes such as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR${\rm CO}_2{\rm RR}$). Despite its postulated significant influence on CO2RR${\rm CO}_2{\rm RR}$ activity, direct spectroscopic evidence of the complex interplay between EDL structure and reaction kinetics has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Dynamic Response Spectroscopy (DRS), a novel approach that isolates spectroscopic signatures of key physicochemical features of the EDL, including the compact (interfacial) layer and the diffuse double layer based on their time&#8208;variance profiles. By analyzing multi&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectral data recorded during sequential potential steps, we reveal that EDL equilibration is not continuous but involves discrete restructuring events. We provide spectroscopic evidence that these sudden EDL reorganizations correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2${\rm CO}_2$ to CO. Furthermore, we show that saturation of aqueous NaHCO3 electrolytes with CO2${\rm CO}_2$, as opposed to Ar, induces more frequent and pronounced water reorientation in the diffuse double layer, characterized by less ice&#8208;like ordering and increased randomness. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic nature of the EDL and its synergistic role in electrocatalysis, establishing a paradigm to better understand, and thus optimize, electrochemical&#160;systems.

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism for Unconventional Anodic Reaction of Aldehyde Oxidation for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy of nonelectrochemical steps and electrochemical steps enables the unconventional anodic reaction of aldehyde oxidation for hydrogen production (AOR&#8208;H2), which is expected to break through the limit of existing energy conversion systems. Additionally,&#160;decorating Cu catalysts with metallic Pt species leads to a 12&#8208;fold increase in the intrinsic activity of AOR&#8208;H2 because the Pt species favor the electrochemical O&#9472;H bond cleavage.








Abstract
Anodic reactions involving non&#8208;faradaic processes have significantly expanded the potential application of anodic oxidation half&#8208;reactions. Metallic Cu materials can catalyze an unconventional anodic aldehyde oxidation reaction involving the non&#8208;faradaic H2 production (AOR&#8208;H2). AOR&#8208;H2 has distinct advantages of ultra&#8208;low thermodynamic potentials and high value&#8208;added redox products, etc., but the question of exactly how reduction steps occur during AOR&#8208;H2, is something which has long puzzled scientists. Here we illustrate the novel synergistic mechanism of nonelectrochemical/electrochemical redox steps in AOR&#8208;H2. Aldehyde undergoes hydration, deprotonation, and spontaneous C&#8211;H homolytic cleavage to generate H2, and then is electrochemically oxidized to form carboxylate. Decorating Cu catalysts with metallic Pt species, supported by theoretical calculations, leads to a 12&#8208;fold increase in the intrinsic activity of AOR&#8208;H2. This work inspires researchers to develop novel cathodic and anodic reactions involving the non&#8208;faradaic process for breaking through the limit of existing energy conversion systems.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of WC Powder Electrocatalysts Probed In Situ with NAP&#8208;XPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a highly active catalyst for the HER. The reasons for its activity are, however, unclear due to its delicate susceptibility to oxidation and thus passivation. Electrochemical near ambient pressure XPS reveals dissolution of the passive film into the electrolyte under electrochemical working conditions, which effectively enables the electrocatalyst's enduring activity.








Abstract
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a renowned compound catalyst material for electrochemical water splitting, and its high electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been repeatedly reported. However, its susceptibility to oxidation raises the fundamental question of the underlying reason for its high activity, especially since passivation and thus potential deactivation can occur not only in air but also during reaction. Hence, the investigation of the surface chemistry under true operating conditions is crucial for a fundamental understanding of the electrocatalytic process. In this work, we use electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (EC&#8208;XPS) to revisit the surface chemistry of WC powder electrodes in alkaline electrolyte in situ and under full potential control. Our results show that although the surface is initially covered with oxide, this passive film dissolves in the electrolyte under electrochemical reaction conditions. This clarifies the active surface termination during the HER and highlights the potential of laboratory&#8208;based EC&#8208;XPS to study applied energy conversion materials.

         <title>Integrating Multifunctionalities into a 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich supramolecular cages and porphyrin moieties as well as single&#8208;atomic metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) together, two metalated photoactive covalent organic frameworks are constructed for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion is still challenging. Herein, integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich organic cages and the photoactive porphyrin moieties together, a 3D covalent organic framework (COF), Cage&#8208;PorCOF, is successfully synthesized. After incorporating metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) into the cage&#8208;based COF, Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni) are subsequently constructed for the CO2 photoreduction. Catalytic experiments show impressive performance in CO2 photoreduction with CO generation rates of up to 48&#160;748 and 28&#160;446&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the first initiating hour for Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni), respectively, which is attributed to the synergistic effects from CO2&#8208;affinity of the porous frameworks and incorporated metal atoms, the light&#8208;absorption and charge separation ability of metalloporphyrin groups as well as the fully exposed single&#8208;atomic catalytic sites confirmed by both experimental and theoretical analyses. This study demonstrates that by the integration of multiple functionalities into 3D porous solids, highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 conversion can be achieved.

         <title>To Make a Painstaking Investigation: Revealing the Electrochemical Reactions in Aqueous Zn&#9472;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition mechanism is not clear. To verify the underlying mechanism, skillfully managing compositional Zn||MnO2 battery, revealing the dual&#8208;discharge platform chemistry due to dissolution reaction rather than Zn2+/H+ intercalation. They influenced by proton concentration and Zn2+ hydrolysis, with Discharge Plateau I driven by excess H+ and Plateau II by Zn2+ hydrolysis.








Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries have been extensively explored, but the electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in terms of Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, are still not fully understood. Herein, a Zn||MnO2&#8208;based battery system is constructed and the variation of the battery composition is skillfully regulated by the separation of variables. The possibility of Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry is ruled out and the dominance of the dissolution/deposition mechanism is strongly demonstrated. This study confirms that the chemistry of the controversial double&#8208;discharge platform is a dissolution reaction, determined by different proton concentrations and zinc ions hydrolysis. Discharge Plateau I is the MnO2 dissolution dominated by the surplus H+ in the electrolyte, while Discharge Plateau II is the smooth discharge plateau resulting from the hydrolysis of Zn2+ releasing protons when the proton concentration decreases to the point of Zn(OH)2 generation. This work provides a better understanding of the dissolution/deposition mechanism of Zn||MnO2 and paves the way for the practical application of manganese&#8208;based aqueous batteries. It also provides a comprehensive method to study the mechanism of electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Precise Engineering of Asymmetric Tri&#8208;Active Sites by Symbiotic Strategy for Photocontrolled Directional Reforming of Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symbiotic strategy is proposed by DFT predictions for the rational design of CuxTiO2 SACs. The Cu SAs are introduced to form an asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ov&#8211;Ti structure, which significantly enhances the adsorption and activation of O2 and HMF on the catalyst. This strategy achieves the targeted oxidation of HMF to DFF and FDCA through effective microenvironmental modulation.








Abstract
Sunlight&#8208;driven production of high&#8208;value chemicals from renewable resources represents a pivotal driver toward achieving sustainable energy supply. However, fundamental barriers include inadequate use of light energy and insufficient understanding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulating mechanisms in photocatalytic processes. To address this, a novel symbiotic strategy for the design of Cux/TiO2 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations was proposed. The developed catalyst achieved nearly 100% conversion and selectivity for the directional photooxidative transformation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) or 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) under both vis&#8208;light and UV&#8211;vis light conditions. Importantly, compared to previous works, this catalyst exhibited the highest photooxidation activity reported to date while effectively suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of HMF to CO2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that rational construction of Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) could effectively create the asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ov&#8211;Ti structure, which significantly enhanced the activation of O2 and HMF, facilitating generation of oxygen vacancy (Ov) and Ti3+. Furthermore, Cu SAs served as hole (h+) extractors in the photooxidation process, promoting rapid charge carrier transfer and ROS formation. The applicability of this developed strategy was further demonstrated for photooxidative conversion of various bio&#8208;feedstocks, including HMF and alcoholic substrates, indicating its great potential for harnessing light energy for sustainable valorization of biomass into high&#8208;value chemicals.

A strategy to construct pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator by ordered co&#8208;assembly of block copolymer and metal&#8208;organic framework is proposed to sequentially combine zincophilic and zincophobic properties. Multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure accelerates zinc migration and desolvation processes, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling stability to 1900 h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 5200 cycles.








Abstract
Constructing a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer to suppress dendrite growth is an effective approach in Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries. Traditional SEI layers are limited by their simple structure and composition, enabling only one functionality of either providing nucleation sites or facilitating desolvation. In this study, a pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator is constructed by kinetics&#8208;controlled co&#8208;assembly of zincophilic micelles and zincophobic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). The closely packed soft micelles, in conjunction with the hard MOF host particles, form a multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure that accelerates adsorption, pre&#8208;desolvation, and subsequent desolvation processes, facilitating the (002) crystal plane dendrite&#8208;free deposition. As a result, stable cycling over 1900 h (31&#160;mV polarization) in symmetric cell and 5200 cycles in the Zn//Cu battery (99.8% coulombic efficiency) can be achieved. These findings will effectively promote the development of stable and long&#8208;cycling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Scalable and Ultrathin Dual Entangled Network Polymer Electrolytes for Safe Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

A 9.7&#160;&#181;m ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;network polymer electrolyte with a decent voltage tolerance, improved tensile strength, and higher thermal stability was manufactured for safer sodium&#8208;metal batteries, in which the ether&#8208;oxygen segments were complexed with sodium ions, and the electronegative channels formed by the carbonyl and cyanogen groups acted as sodium ion transport channels to accelerate ion migration.








Abstract
Identifying ultrathin and flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance is crucial for scale&#8208;up production of solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) metal batteries (SSMBs). However, the challenges of poor processing scalability, insufficient intrinsic mechanical strength, and limited ionic transport capacity remain unaddressed. Herein, an ultrathin 9.7&#160;&#181;m solid&#8208;state electrolyte membrane featuring a dual&#8208;polymer entangled network is meticulously engineered through an arrayed multi&#8208;nozzle electrospinning technique with a swelling and hot pressing process using polyacrylonitrile and poly(ether&#8208;block&#8208;amide), which exhibits an exceptional voltage tolerance, enhanced tensile strength, and superior thermal stability. The soft ether oxygens segments in multiblock copolymers complex with Na+ to promote the rapid hopping transport of Na+. Meanwhile, interconnected electronegative channels based on carbonyl and cyanogen groups serve as Na+ conduits to smooth ion fluctuations and accelerate Na+ selective conduction simultaneously. The obtained inorganic&#8208;organic composite solid electrolyte interface with the improved mechanical strength of ultrathin solid&#8208;state electrolytes effectively suppresses Na dendrites with low overpotential over 500&#160;h. The solid&#8208;state cells paired with layered oxides deliver a capacity retention of over 91.1% between 25&#160;&#176;C and 65&#160;&#176;C, and assembled pouch cells exhibit impressive energy density over 100 cycles, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale application of ultrathin structure in the SSMBs.

         <dc:description>
A molecular catalyst is demonstrated to be unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions. The mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.3%, and exclusive carbon selectivity are the best known to date in H&#8208;cell. The whole synthetic and separation process is projected to be profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8722;1, which is much lower than the breakeven point (&#8764;$10&#160;000 ton&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal the intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8722;, and selective NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH catalytic reduction for C&#9472;N bond in situ. The unprecedented results obtained offer an ideal platform for the benign, economical, and sustainable production of cyclohexanone oxime as an alternative to the current existing processes. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime from rich nitrogen resources is a promising alternative to traditional industrial processes. However, the difficulties in unraveling atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanisms and managing selective C&#9472;N coupling still pose great challenges to realizing considerable yield and selectivity, and therefore rational catalyst design to boost collaborative C&#9472;N coupling for oxime synthesis is particularly attractive. In the present work, molecular catalysts are demonstrated to be unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions, i.e., iron bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;bipyridine (FeBPAbipyH) modified MWCNTs@CP (multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber paper) cathodes produced cyclohexanone oxime from NO2&#8722; and cyclohexanone, attaining mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00&#160;mg h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;mgcat&#8722;1, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.3%, and exclusive carbon selectivity, which is the best efficiency known to date in H&#8208;cell. Mechanistic studies showed that the FeBPAbipyH molecular skeleton exhibited intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8722;, and catalyzed selective NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH reduction for C&#9472;N bond in situ. The in&#8208;depth understanding of substrate&#8208;catalyst interactions and synergic C&#9472;N coupling from molecular points of view offers valuable insights to boost collaborative synthesis of organic nitrogen compounds. Further integrating plasma&#8208;driven N2 oxidation and electrocatalysis enabled cyclohexanone oxime formation at 61.73&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 on the FeBPAbipyH/MWCNTs@CP electrode, and the whole synthetic and separation process is projected to be profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8722;1, which is much lower than the breakeven point (&#8764;$10&#160;000 ton&#8722;1), representing a sustainable pathway to nitrogenous chemical synthesis from abundant resources under ambient conditions.

         <title>Guideline for Analysis and Prevention of Contamination Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ongoing efforts to discover new catalysts in coupling reactions have provided an effective toolkit for chemists over the last decades. However, metal impurities often lead to costly misinterpretations and reproducibility issues. Our guideline provides a practical roadmap for identifying true catalysts, eliminating impurity&#8208;driven errors, and ensuring reliable research outcomes. Designed primarily for handling trace metal challenges, this framework sets a new standard for robust, impurity&#8208;free catalyst discovery. 








Abstract
Over the last decades, numerous efforts have been made to replace metal catalysts with cheaper and earth&#8208;abundant alternatives or to completely exclude metals from cross&#8208;coupling reactions while maintaining high efficiency in the target transformation. However, follow&#8208;up studies often revealed the role of metal impurities in the catalytic process. Thus, active metal impurities can lead to mechanistic misinterpretations, and these could initiate erroneous research directives and lead to severe reproducibility problems. Milestone precedents of the impurity effect in cross&#8208;coupling reactions are well documented in the literature. Interestingly, this fallacy has reoccurred repeatedly over the years due to a lack of thorough mechanistic studies and appropriate research study schemes for identifying impurity effects. Herein, we propose a guideline to elucidate the real catalyst of future catalytic transformations, aiming to reveal the correct mechanism and help exclude the role of impurities in novel catalytic processes. Although this guideline mainly focuses on problems related to trace transition metals, it also offers the basis for more general catalyst research.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance FeP Catalyst for Electrochemical Ammonia Production and Recovery via Joule&#8208;Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposited high&#8208;surface&#8208;area FeP is introduced as a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst for nitrate reduction in alkaline media. Exploiting the high stability of the catalyst in alkaline media, a novel Joule&#8208;stripping strategy is implemented to recover the produced ammonia as solid ammonium salt, using the heat generated at high current densities to directly volatilize and separate in situ formed ammonia from the aqueous solution. 








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO&#8323;RR) offers a promising route for decentralized and sustainable ammonia production while addressing environmental challenges associated with nitrate pollution. However, the development of practical implementations has been slowed by the challenge of creating highly stable and selective catalysts for strongly basic environments, along with the difficulty of efficiently recovering ammonia from dilute solutions. Here, we introduce a partially oxidized amorphous iron&#8208;phosphide (POA&#8208;FeP) electrocatalyst that combines high activity and stability with an innovative Joule&#8208;stripping strategy for ammonia recovery. Electrodeposited onto nickel foam (NF), the POA&#8208;FeP catalyst achieves benchmark partial current densities of &#8722;720&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in neutral media and &#8722;932&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, and near quantitative Faradaic efficiencies (FE). The robustness of the POA&#8208;FeP/NF catalyst was highlighted by its ability to maintain FE above 90% during continuous operation for over 1000 h at a total current density of &#8722;300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. We demonstrate that the Joule heating resulting from the operation of the electrolyzer at high current density can be exploited to induce the volatilization of ammonia, which can then be recovered as solid ammonium chloride with &gt;95% yield. This integrated Joule&#8208;stripping approach simplifies ammonia recovery and opens up new possibilities for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient nitrate reduction systems.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Planar Chiral Paracyclophanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective acylative (dynamic) kinetic resolution of racemic paracyclophanols catalysed by a chiral isothiourea (5 mol%) is described (up to s&#160;=&#160;50 at 49% conversion or up to 98:2 er and 96% yield in 30 examples). Rotational barriers were analysed for paracyclophanols and selected ester products.








Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for the catalytic enantioselective preparation of planar chiral paracyclophane derivatives is of considerable interest to the synthetic community. To date, relatively few successful and effective organocatalytic approaches to this molecular class have been reported. This manuscript describes effective isothiourea catalysed acylative kinetic (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to the generation of a range of planar chiral paracyclophane macrocycles with excellent levels of enantioselectivity. Effective KR of configurationally stable planar chiral paracyclophanols with 12&#8208; and 13&#8208;membered ansa&#8208;chains is demonstrated (6 examples, s&#160;=&#160;up to 50) using 5 mol% of the isothiourea (R)&#8208;BTM and isobutyric anhydride. Application to configurationally labile macrocyclic phenols with 14 to 18&#8208;membered ansa&#8208;chains allows their effective acylative DKR, generating the desired products with excellent enantioselectivity (25 examples, up to 95% yield and 98:2 er).
