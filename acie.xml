      <title>Optimized immobilization strategy for dirhodium (II) carboxylate catalysts for C&#8211;H functionalization and their implementation in a packed bed flow reactor</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate a sustainable, scalable packed bed flow reactor capable of achieving highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8211;H functionalization reactions using a newly developed Rh  2  (  S  &#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8208;5&#8208;CF  3  TPCP)  4  catalyst. To optimize the immobilized dirhodium catalyst employed in the flow reactor, we systematically study both (i) the effects of ligand immobilization position, demonstrating the critical factor that the catalyst&#8208;support attachment location can have on the catalyst performance, and (ii) silica support mesopore length, demonstrating that decreasing diffusional limitations leads to increased accessibility of the active site and higher catalyst turnover frequency. We employ the immobilized dirhodium catalyst in a simple packed bed flow reactor achieving comparable yields and levels of enantioselectivity to the homogeneous catalyst employed in batch and maintain this performance over ten catalyst recycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Size and Halide Dependent Auger Recombination in Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) hold strong promise for a variety of light harvesting, emitting and detecting applications, all of which, however, could be complicated by multicarrier Auger recombination. Therefore, a complete documentation of the size and composition dependent Auger recombination rates of these NCs is highly desirable, as it can guide the system design in many applications. Here we report the synthesis and Auger measurements of monodisperse APbX  3  (A= Cs and FA; X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs in an extensive size range (~3&#8208;9 nm). The biexciton Auger lifetime of all the NCs scales linearly with the NC volume. The scaling coefficient is virtually independent of the cation but rather depends sensitively on the anion, which is 0.035, 0.085 and 0.142 ps per nm  3  for Cl, Br, and I, respectively. All of these are much faster than that in standard CdSe and PbSe NCs (~1 ps per nm  3  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Syntheses of Strychnos and Chelidonium Alkaloids via Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled Cooperative Catalysis.</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we describe enantioselective syntheses of  strychnos  and  chelidonium  alkaloids. In the first case, indole acetic acid esters were established as excellent partner nucleophiles for enantioselective cooperative isothiourea/Pd catalyzed a &#8208;alkylation. This provides products containing indole&#8208;bearing stereocenters in high yield and with excellent levels of enantioinduction in a manner that is notably independent of the  N  &#8208;substituent. This led to concise syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;akuammicine and (&#8211;)&#8208;strychnine . In the second case, the poor performance of  ortho  &#8208;substituted cinnamyl electrophiles in the enantioselective cooperative isothiourea/Ir catalyzed a &#8208;alkylation was overcome by appropriate substituent choice, leading to enantioselective syntheses of (+)&#8208;chelidonine, (+)&#8208;norchelidonine and (+)&#8208;chelamine.</dc:description>

      <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Homometallic Interface of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au Nanorods and their Photothermal Therapy in NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
      <dc:description>The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of plasmonic nanomaterials is highly dependent on their structures. Going beyond simple shape and size, methods of further structural modification usually involve the growth of a wetting layer on seeds, or the growth of a non&#8208;wetting island. In general, the structural tunability is still low and it hinders the exploration of plasmonic nanostructures. Here, we provide two new dimensions of synthetic controls in Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au homometallic nanohybrids: the number of the Au islands and the emerging shapes. By controlling the interfacial energy and growth kinetics, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;AuNR hybrid structures are successfully obtained, with the newly grown Au domains being sphere, polyhedron, and branched wire (nanocoral). The structural variety allowed the LSPR to be fine&#8208;tuned in full spectrum range, making them excellent candidates for plasmonic applications. Importantly, the nanocorals exhibit black&#8208;body absorption and outstanding photothermal conversion capability in NIR II window.  In vitro  and  in vivo  experiments verified them as excellent photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Design of Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes for Three&#8208;Photon Phosphorescence Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to two&#8208;photon excitation (2PE) microscopy, three&#8208;photon excitation (3PE) microscopy has superior spatial resolution, deeper tissue penetration, and less defocused interference, and is, therefore, of great interest in the field of bioimaging. The design of suitable agents which can meet the various needs of the technology, such as large Stokes shift, good three&#8208;photon absorption (3PA), subcellular targeting, and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) properties, is a formidable challenge. In order to address this, two iridium(III) complexes (3PAIr1 and 3PAIr2) were developed as efficient three&#8208;photon phosphorescence (3PP) agents for bioimaging. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of a new group to the molecular scaffold confers a quadruple promotion in three&#8208;photon transition probability. Herein, the confocal and lifetime imaging of mitochondria as using Ir(III) complexes as 3PP agents is demonstrated for the first time. The complexes exhibit the advantages of low working concentration (50 nM), fast uptake (5 min), and low threshold for three&#8208;photon excitation power (ca. 0.5 mW at 980 nm). Moreover, the impressive tissue penetration depth achieved with these 3PA agents (ca. 450 &#181;m) allowed the 3D imaging and reconstruction of brain vasculature from a living specimen. These results indicate that the Ir(III) complexes are highly promising for medical imaging applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Chainmail for Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Encapsulating transition metal nanoparticles inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or spheres has emerged as a novel strategy of designing highly&#8208;durable non&#8208;precious metal catalysts. The stable carbon layer protects the inner metal core from the destructive reaction environment and thus is vividly described as chainmail for catalysts. Electron transfer from the active metal core to the carbon layer stimulates unique catalytic activity on the carbon surface which has been extensively utilized in a variety of catalytic reaction systems. Here, we elaborate the underlying working principle of the chainmail for catalysts as well as the key factors that determine their catalytic properties, and provide insights into the physicochemical nature of such catalyst architectures for further application of the strategy in rational catalyst design.</dc:description>

The stable carbon layer protects the inner metal core from the destructive reaction environment and thus is vividly described as chainmail for catalysts. Electron transfer from the active metal core to the carbon layer stimulates unique catalytic activity on the carbon surface which has been extensively utilized in a variety of catalytic reaction systems. Here, we elaborate the underlying working principle of the chainmail for catalysts as well as the key factors that determine their catalytic properties, and provide insights into the physicochemical nature of such catalyst architectures for further application of the strategy in rational catalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Activation of a metal&#8208;halogen bond by halogen bonding</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, the non&#8208;covalent interaction of halogen bonding (XB) has found increasing application in organocatalysis. However, reports of the activation of metal&#8208;ligand bonds by XB have so far been limited to a few reactions with elemental iodine or bromine. Herein, we present the activation of metal&#8208;halogen bonds by two classes of inert halogen bond donors and the use of the resulting activated complexes in homogenous gold catalysis. The only recently explored class of iodolium derivatives were shown to be effective activators in two test reactions and their activity could be modulated by blocking of the Lewis acidic sites. Bis(benzimidazolium)&#8208;based halogen bonding activators provided even more rapid conversion, while the non&#8208;iodinated reference compound showed little activity. The role of halogen bonding in the activation of metal&#8208;halogen bonds was further investigated by NMR experiments and DFT calculations, which support the mode of activation occurring via halogen bonding.</dc:description>

      <title>Stretchable perovskite solar cells with extremely recoverable performance</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising photovoltaic technology to sustainably drive stretchable applications, due to their flexible, light&#8208;weight and low&#8208;cost superiorities. However, fragility of crystals and poor crystallinity of perovskite on stretchable substrate afford an inevitable performance loss. In fact, the grain boundary defects are the Achilles&#8217; heel for the optoelectronic and mechanical degradations. Herein, we incorporate a self&#8208;healing polyurethane (s&#8208;PU) with dynamic oxime&#8722;carbamate bonds as a scaffold into the perovskite films, which simultaneously enhances crystallinity and passivates grain boundary of the perovskite films. The stretchable PSCs with s&#8208;PU deliver a stabilized efficiency of 19.15% with negligible hysteresis, which are comparable to the performance on rigid substrates. The PSCs can maintain over 90% of the initial efficiency after 3000 h under air environment because of their self&#8208;encapsulating structure. More importantly, the self&#8208;healing function of s&#8208;PU scaffold is in&#8208;situ verified. The s&#8208;PU can release the mechanical stress and repair the crack at grain boundary on multiple levels. The devices recover 88% of their original efficiency after 1000 cycles at 20% stretch. This ingenious growth strategy of crystalline semiconductors will enable a new approach for development for flexible and stretchable electronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystals of benzamide, the first polymorphous molecular compound, are helicoidal</title>
      <dc:description>The formation of spontaneously twisted crystals is a common but poorly understood growth phenomenon. Here, we analyze the formation of twisted crystals of a metastable benzamide polymorph (form  II  ) crystallizing from highly supersaturated aqueous and ethanol solutions.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation of spontaneously twisted crystals is a common but poorly understood growth phenomenon. Here, we analyze the formation of twisted crystals of a metastable benzamide polymorph (form  II  ) crystallizing from highly supersaturated aqueous and ethanol solutions. Benzamide, the first polymorphic molecular crystal reported (1832), would have been the first helicoidal crystal observed had the original authors undertaken an analysis by light microscopy. Polymorphism and twisting frequently concur as they are both associated with high crystallographic driving forces.

      <title>The Rb7Bi3&#8208;3xSb3xCl16&#160; family: A Fully Inorganic Solid Solution with Room&#8208;Temperature Luminescent Members</title>
      <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional ns  2  &#8208;metal halide compounds have recently received immense attention for applications in solid&#8208;state lighting, optical thermometry and thermography, and scintillation. However, these are based primarily on the combination of organic cations with toxic Pb  2+  or unstable Sn  2+  , and a stable inorganic luminescent material has yet to be found. Herein we present the zero&#8208;dimensional Rb  7  Sb  3  Cl  16  phase, which is comprised of isolated [SbCl  6  ]  3&#8208;  octahedra and edge&#8208;sharing [Sb  2  Cl  10  ]  4&#8208;  dimers and demonstrates room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (RT PL) centered at 560 nm with a quantum yield of 3.8&#177;0.2% at 296&#160;K (99.4% at 77&#160;K). The temperature dependent PL lifetime of this material rivals that of previous low&#8208;dimensional materials with a specific temperature sensitivity above 0.06&#160;K  &#8208;1  at RT, showcasing it as an excellent thermometric material.

      <title>Understanding Role of Parallel Pathways via In Situ Switching of Quantum Interference in Molecular Tunneling Junctions</title>
      <dc:description>This paper describes the modulation of tunneling probabilities in molecular junctions by switching one of two parallel intramolecular pathways. A linearly&#8208;conjugated molecular wire provides a rigid framework that allows a second, cross&#8208;conjugated pathway to be effectively switched on and off by protonation, affecting the total conductance of the junction. This approach works because a traversing electron interacts with the entire quantum&#8208;mechanical circuit simultaneously; Kirchhoff's rules do not apply. We prove this concept by comparing the conductances of a series of compounds with single or parallel pathways in large&#8208;area junctions using EGaIn contacts and single&#8208;molecule break&#8208;junctions using gold contacts. We affect switching selectively in one of two parallel pathways by converting a cross&#8208;conjugated carbonyl carbon into a trivalent carbocation, which replaces destructive quantum interference with a symmetrical resonance, causing an increase in transmission in the bias window.</dc:description>

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;III Absorbing and Emitting Dyes: Energy Gap Engineering of Expanded Porphyrinoids via Metallation</title>
      <dc:description>The rational synthesis of organometallic complexes of modified 26 &#960; &#8208;conjugated hexaphyrins with third near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;III) absorption and emission capabilities is described. Symmetry alteration of the frontier molecular orbitals of bis&#8208;Pd(II) and bis&#8208;Pt(II) complexes of hexaphyrin via N&#8208;confusion modification led to substantial metal d  &#960;  &#8211;p  &#960;  interactions. This MO mixing, in turn, resulted in a significantly narrower HOMO &#8211; LUMO energy gap. A remarkable long&#8208;wavelength shift of the lowest S  0  &#8208;&gt; S  1  absorption beyond 1700 nm was achieved with the bis&#8208;Pt(II) complex,  t  &#8208;Pt  2  &#8208;3  . The emergence of photoacoustic (PA) signals maximized at 1700 nm makes  t  &#8208;Pt  2  &#8208;3  &#160; potentially useful as a NIR&#8208;III PA contrast agent. The rigid bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes,  t  &#8208;Pd  2  &#8208;3  and  c  &#8208;Pd  2  &#8208;3  , are rare examples of NIR emitters beyond 1500 nm.

      <title>Synthesis of Honeycomb&#8208;Structured Beryllium Oxide via Graphene Liquid Cells</title>

      <dc:description>Li and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide (LMR&#8208;NMC) is one of the most promising cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries with high theoretical energy density. Its practical application is, however, hampered by the capacity and voltage fade after long cycling.

Theoretical modeling reveals a recurring partially reversible LiMn  2  O  4  &#8208;like sub&#8208;nanodomain formation/dissolution process during each charge/discharge, which accumulates gradually and accounts for the Mn phase transition. From modeling of spectra and maps of the valence state over large regions of cathodes, it was found that the phase change is size&#8208;dependent.

      <dc:description>Autocatalysis and self&#8208;assembly are key processes in developmental biology and are involved in the emergence of life. In the last decade both features were extensively investigated by chemists with the final goal to design synthetic living systems. Herein, we describe the autonomous growth of a self&#8208;assembled soft material, i.e. a supramolecular hydrogel, able to sustain its own formation through an autocatalytic mechanism not based on any template effect and emerging from a peptide (hydrogelator) self&#8208;assembly. A domino sequence of events starts from an enzymatically triggered peptide generation followed by their self&#8208;assembly into catalytic nanofibers inducing and amplifying their production over time, resulting in a 3D hydrogel network.

      <title>ZIF&#8208;induced d&#8208;band Modification in Bimetallic Nanocatalyst: Achieving &gt;44% Efficiency in Ambient Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) offers a sustainable solution towards ammonia production but suffers poor reaction performance due to preferential catalyst&#8208;H formation and the consequential hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we electronically modify PtAu electrocatalyst d&#8208;band structure using zeolitic&#8208;imidazole framework (ZIF) to achieve a faradaic efficiency (FE) of &gt;44% with high ammonia yield rate of &gt;161 &#181;g.mg  cat  &#8208;1  .h  &#8208;1  at ambient conditions. Our strategy lowers electrocatalyst d&#8208;band position to weaken H adsorption and concurrently creates electron deficient sites to kinetically drive NRR by promoting catalyst&#8208;N  2  interaction. The ZIF coating on electrocatalyst doubles as a hydrophobic layer to suppress HER, further improves FE by &gt;44&#8208;fold compared to without ZIF (~1%). Experimental and in&#8208;silico studies reveal PtAu&#8208;N  ZIF  interaction is key to enable strong N  2  adsorption over H atom. Our electrocatalytic design is universal and can be extended across metal electrocatalysts for diverse applications in NRR and air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</dc:description>

Our electrocatalytic design is universal and can be extended across metal electrocatalysts for diverse applications in NRR and air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sulfur&#8208;Preloaded Double&#8208;shelled C@MoS2 Structures As an Additive Reservoir for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>The notorious growth of Li dendrites is one of the main hindrances for the practical application of the lithium metal anode (LMA). In this work,  a sulfur&#8208;preloaded hollow nanostructure based on hierarchical MoS  2  coated hollow carbon particles  (C@MoS  2  /S) was designed to modify the LMA.

More importantly, the encapsulated sulfur could gradually release lithium polysulfides during the Li plating/stripping processes, which act as an effective additive to promote the formation of a mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer embedded with crystalline hybrid lithium&#8208;based components. These two factors together effectively suppress the growth of Li dendrites. The as&#8208;modified LMA shows a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98 % over 500 cycles at the current density of 1 mA cm  &#8208;2  .

      <title>Simulation vs. Understanding: A Tension, in Quantum Chemistry and Beyond. Part A. Stage Setting</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a wave breaking over us&#8212;a wave of simulation and artificial intelligence. In three reflective Essays we make a case for true understanding, for scientific story&#8208;telling, as well as a role for pleasure and the emotions within science in general and quantum chemistry in particular.







Abstract
We begin our tripartite Essay with a triangle of understanding, theory and simulation. Sketching the intimate tie between explanation and teaching, we also point to the emotional impact of understanding. As we trace the development of theory in chemistry, Dirac's characterization of what is known and what is needed for theoretical chemistry comes up, as does the role of prediction, and Thom's phrase &#8220;To predict is not to explain.&#8221; We give a typology of models, and then describe, no doubt inadequately, machine learning and neural networks. In the second part, we leave philosophy, beginning by describing Roald's being beaten by simulation. This leads us to artificial intelligence (AI), Searle's Chinese room, and Strevens&#8217; account of what a go&#8208;playing program knows. Back to our terrain&#8212;we ask &#8220;Quantum Chemistry, &#8224; ca. 2020?&#8221; Then move to examples of AI affecting social matters, ranging from trivial to scary. We argue that moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer. At this point, we try to pull the reader up, giving the opposing view of an optimistic, limitless future a voice. But we don't do justice to that view&#8212;how could we? We return to questioning the ascetic dimension of scientists, their romance with black boxes. Onward: In the 3rd part of this Essay, we work our way up from pessimism. We trace (another triangle!) the special interests of experimentalists, who want the theory we love, and reliable numbers as well. We detail in our own science instances where theory gave us real joy. Two more examples&#8208;on magnetic coupling in inorganic diradicals, and the way to think about alkali metal halides, show us the way to integrate simulation with theory. Back and forth is how it should be&#8212;between painfully&#8208;obtained, intriguing numbers, begging for interpretation, in turn requiring new concepts, new models, new theoretically grounded tools of computation. Through such iterations understanding is formed. As our tripartite Essay ends, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact&#8208;seekers, and searchers for understanding. Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a passage to art and to perceiving, as we argue we must, the sacred in science.

      <title>Early Transition Metal Catalysis for Olefin&#8211;Polar Monomer Copolymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst design: This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations are discussed, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.







Abstract
Introducing polar functional groups into widely used polyolefins can enhance polymer surface, rheological, mixing, and other properties, potentially upgrading polyolefins for advanced, value&#8208;added applications. The metal catalyst&#8208;mediated copolymerization of non&#8208;polar olefins with polar comonomers represents the seemingly most straightforward, atom&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficient approach for synthesizing polar functionalized polyolefins. However, electrophilic early transition metal (groups 3 and 4)&#8208;catalyzed processes which have achieved remarkable success in conventional olefin polymerizations, encounter severe limitations here, largely associated with the Lewis basicity of the polar co&#8208;monomers. In recent years, however, new catalytic systems have been developed and successful strategies have emerged. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Furthermore, we discuss advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.

      <title>Methanol synthesis at a wide range of H2/CO2 ratios over Rh&#8208;In bimetallic catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in capturing hydrogen generated from renewables with CO  2  to produce methanol. However, renewable hydrogen production is currently expensive and in limited quantity as compared to CO  2  . Excess CO  2  and limited H  2  in the feedstock gas mixture is not favourable for the CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol reaction, which causes low activity and poor methanol selectivity. Here we report a new class of Rh&#8208;In catalysts with optimal adsorption property to the intermediates of methanol production. The Rh&#8208;In catalyst can effectively catalyse methanol synthesis but inhibit reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction under H  2  &#8208;deficient gas flow and shows the best competitive methanol productivity under industrially applicable conditions in comparison with the literature reported values. This work demonstrates a strong potential of Rh&#8208;In bimetallic composition, from which a convenient methanol synthesis based on flexible feedstock compositions (e.g. H  2  /CO  2  from biomass derivatives) with lower energy cost can be established.</dc:description>

The Rh&#8208;In catalyst can effectively catalyse methanol synthesis but inhibit reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction under H  2  &#8208;deficient gas flow and shows the best competitive methanol productivity under industrially applicable conditions in comparison with the literature reported values. This work demonstrates a strong potential of Rh&#8208;In bimetallic composition, from which a convenient methanol synthesis based on flexible feedstock compositions (e.g. H  2  /CO  2  from biomass derivatives) with lower energy cost can be established.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Water&#8208;Soluble&#160;Polymers with Appending Porphyrins as Bioinspired Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular design to improve catalyst performance is significant but challenging. In enzymes, residue groups that are close to reaction centers play critical roles in regulating activities. Using this bioinspired strategy, we designed three water&#8208;soluble polymers with appending Co porphyrins and different side&#8208;chain groups to mimic enzyme reaction centers and activity&#8208;controlling residue groups, respectively. With these polymers, we achieved high hydrogen evolution efficiency in neutral aqueous media for electro&#8208; ( turnover frequency &#160;&gt; 2.3&#215;10  4  &#160;s  &#8211;1  ) and photo&#8208;catalysis (turnover number &gt; 2.7 &#215; 10  4  ). Porphyrin units are surrounded and protected by polymer chains, and more importantly, the activity can be tuned with different side&#8208;chain groups. Therefore, instead of revising molecular structures that is difficult from both design and synthesis points of view, we can use polymers to improve molecular solubility and stability and simultaneously regulate activity by using side&#8208;chain groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Fullerene&#8208;Based Molecular Torsion Balance for Investigating Noncovalent Interactions at C60 Surface</title>
      <dc:description>In order to investigate the nature and strength of noncovalent interactions at the fullerene surface, molecular torsion balances consisting of C60&#160;and organic moieties connected through a biphenyl linkage were designed, synthesized, and characterized.

      <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Allylic Substitution via Synergistic Palladium/Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis: Insight into Stereoinduction through Statistical Modeling.</title>
      <dc:description>The mode of asymmetric induction in an enantioselective intramolecular allylic substitution reaction catalyzed by a combination of palladium and a chiral phosphoric acid was investigated by a combined experimental and statistical modeling approach. Experiments to probe nonlinear effects, the reactivity of deuterium&#8208;labeled substrates, and control experiments revealed that the nucleophilic attack to the &#960; &#8208;allylpalladium intermediate is the enantio&#8208;determining step, in which the chiral phosphate anion is involved in stereoinduction. Using multivariable linear regression analysis, we identified that the presence of multiple noncovalent interactions with the chiral environment of the phosphate anion are integral to enantiocontrol in the transition state. The synthetic protocol to form chiral pyrrolidines was further applied to the asymmetric construction of C &#8722; O bonds at fully&#8208;substituted carbon centers in the synthesis of chiral 2,2&#8208;disubstituted benzomorpholines.</dc:description>

      <title>Cationic Oligomer as an Organic Template for Direct Synthesis of Aluminosilicate ITH Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>Despite great progress in the synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolites, there are still a large number of zeolites that could not be prepared in the aluminosilicate form. One of typical examples is ITH zeolite, where direct synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH is currently still challenging. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the successful synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH zeolite using a simple cationic oligomer as an organic template. The key to this success is that the cationic oligomer has a strong complexation ability with aluminum species combined with a structural directing ability for the ITH structure similar to that of the conventional organic template. Physicochemical analysis shows that the aluminosilicate ITH zeolite has very high crystallinity, nanosheet&#8208;like crystal morphology, large surface area, fully four&#8208;coordinated Al species, and abundant acidic sites. More importantly, methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) tests reveal that the Al&#8208;ITH zeolite shows much higher selectivity for propylene and longer lifetime than commercial ZSM&#8208;5. FCC tests show that Al&#8208;ITH zeolite is a good candidate as a shape selective FCC additive for enhancing propylene and butylene selectivity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of versatile materials for fabricating functional heterogeneous catalysts, but the most routine method is through carbonization to form porous carbon materials, which however inevitably losses their inherent MOFs characteristics.

The optimized MOF NSs&#8208;300 exhibits the highest activity for ORR with near&#8208;zero overpotential and excellent H2O2 selectivity (~99%) in 0.1 M KOH solution. High&#8208;yield H2O2 production rate of 6.5 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 has also been achieved by MOF NSs&#8208;300 at 0.1 M KOH and 0.6 V (vs.RHE). In contrast to completely pyrolyzed products, the enhanced catalytic activities of partially pyrolyzed MOF NSs&#8208;300 is mainly originated from the maintained MOF structure and the newly&#8208;generated NiO nanoparticles, forming the coordinatively unsaturated Ni atoms and tuning the performance towards electrochemical H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

Herein, we design ed synthesize a novel holey lamellar high entropy oxide (HEO) Co  0.2  Ni  0.2  Cu  0.2  Mg  0.2  Zn  0.2  O material with mesoporous structure via a simple anchoring and merging process. The prepared holey lamellar HEO as heterogeneous catalyst exhibits ultra&#8208;high catalytic activity for the solvent&#8208;free aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Up to 98% conversion can be achieved in only 2 hours, to our knowledge, it is the highest conversion of benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction so far. By rational regulating the catalytic reaction parameters, benzoic acid or benzaldehyde can be selectively optimized as the main product. Multiple analytical characterizations and theory calculation provide a deeper insight into the catalysis mechanism, revealing the synergistic effect of the unique HEO material, abundant oxygen vacancies and holey lamellar framework leads to the ultra&#8208;high catalytic activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalent Assembly of MoS2 Nanosheets with SnS Nanodots as Linkages for Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Weak Van der Waals&#8217; interactions between interlayers of two&#8208;dimensional layered materials have rendered intrinsic problems of disabled across&#8208;interlayer electron transfer and poor layered structural stability, seriously deteriorating their performance in energy applications. Herein, we propose a novel covalent assembly strategy for MoS  2  nanosheets to realize unique MoS  2  /SnS hollow superassemblies (HSs) by using SnS nanodots as covalent linkages. The covalent assembly based on all&#8208;inorganic and carbon&#8208;free concept enables effective across&#8208;interlayer electron transfer, facilitated ion diffusion kinetics and outstanding mechanical stability, which are evidenced by substantial characterizations, density functional theory calculations and mechanical simulations. Consequently, the MoS  2  /SnS HSs exhibit superb rate performance and long cycling stability in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, representing the best comprehensive performance in carbon&#8208;free MoS  2  &#8208;based anodes to date. Moreover, the MoS  2  /SnS HSs also show excellent sodium storage performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The proposed strategy provides an effective solution to the intrinsic problems of 2D layered materials for energy applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Herein we present a new kind of elastic metal&#8208;organic materials (MOMs) that are capable of multiple stimuli&#8208;responsiveness based on dual stress and thermally responsive triple&#8208;helix coordination polymers. The strong metal&#8208;coordination linkage in combination with the flexibility of organic linkers in these MOMs, &#160;rather than the &#8216;4 &#197;&#8217; stacking interactions observed in organic crystals, renders the helical chain to be act like a molecular spring and thus accounts for their intriguing macroscopic elasticity. Moreover, the thermosalient effect of elastic MOMs is reported for the first time here. Crystal structure analyses at different temperatures reveal that this thermo&#8208;responsiveness is achieved through adaptive regulation of the triple&#8208;helix chains via fine&#8208;tuning of opening angle of flexible 'V'&#8208;shaped organic linkers as well as rotation of its lateral conjugated groups so as to resist the possible expansion, thus demonstrating the vital role of adaptive reorganization of triple&#8208;helix metal&#8208;organic chain as a molecular spring&#8208;like motif in crystal jumping.</dc:description>

      <title>Three&#8208;step Spin State Transition and Hysteretic Proton Transfer in the Crystal of an Iron(II) Hydrazone Complex</title>
      <dc:description>A proton&#8211;electron coupling system, exhibiting unique bistability or multistability of the protonated state, is an attractive target for developing new switchable materials on the basis of proton dynamics. In this paper, we present an iron(II) hydrazone crystalline compound, which displays the stepwise transition and bistability of proton transfer at the crystal level. These phenomena are realized through the coupling with spin transition. Although the multi&#8208;step transition with hysteresis has been observed in various systems (e.g., valence tautomerism), the corresponding behavior of proton transfer has not been reported in crystalline systems; thus, the described iron(II) complex is the first example. Furthermore, because proton transfer occurs only in one of the two ligands and p electrons redistribute in it, the dipole moment of the iron(II) complexes changes with the proton transfer, wherein the total dipole moment in the crystal was canceled out owing to the antiferroelectric&#8208;like arrangement.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A proton&#8211;electron coupling system, exhibiting unique bistability or multistability of the protonated state, is an attractive target for developing new switchable materials on the basis of proton dynamics. In this paper, we present an iron(II) hydrazone crystalline compound, which displays the stepwise transition and bistability of proton transfer at the crystal level. These phenomena are realized through the coupling with spin transition. Although the multi&#8208;step transition with hysteresis has been observed in various systems (e.g., valence tautomerism), the corresponding behavior of proton transfer has not been reported in crystalline systems; thus, the described iron(II) complex is the first example. Furthermore, because proton transfer occurs only in one of the two ligands and p electrons redistribute in it, the dipole moment of the iron(II) complexes changes with the proton transfer, wherein the total dipole moment in the crystal was canceled out owing to the antiferroelectric&#8208;like arrangement.

      <title>Revisiting the Polymerization of Diphenylacetylenes with Tungsten(VI) Chloride and Tetraphenyltin: An Alternative Mechanism by a Metathesis Catalytic System</title>
      <dc:description>An alternative reaction mechanism of the polymerization of diphenylacetylelnes using a catalytic system composed of tungsten(VI) chloride and tetraphenyltin has been proposed through the optimization of reaction conditions and investigation of the effect of the electronic nature of diphenylacetylene monomers on the polymerizability. The detailed structures of the polymers have been suggested by mass spectrometric analysis of the obtained polymers and oligomers, which suggested that a phenyl group of tetraphenyltin has been introduced to an initiating end of the polymer chain. Mass spectrometric analysis also provided information about the termination processes of the polymerization. The experimental results strongly suggested that the polymerization of diphenylacetylenes using tungsten(VI) chloride and tetraphenyltin proceeds through a migratory insertion mechanism rather than the long&#8208;accepted metathesis mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic, Enantioselective Sulfenofunctionalization of Alkenes&#8212; Development and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>The last decade has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for the enantioselective vicinal difunctionalization of alkenes initiated by electrophilic sulfenyl group transfer. The addition of sulfenium ions to alkenes results in the generation of chiral, non&#8208;racemic thiiranium ions. These highly reactive intermediates are susceptible to attack by a myriad of nucleophiles in a stereospecific ring&#8208;opening event to afford anti 1,2&#8208;sulfenofunctionalized products. The practical application of sulfenium ion transfer has been enabled by advances in the field of Lewis base catalysis. This Review will chronicle the initial discovery and characterization of thiiranium ion intermediates followed by the determination of their configurational stability and the challenges of developing enantioselective variants. Once the framework for the reactivity and stability of thiiranium ions has been established, a critical analysis of pioneering studies will be presented. Finally, a comprehensive discussion of modern synthetic applications will be categorized around the type of nucleophile employed for sulfenofunctionalization.</dc:description>
