         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Hydrocarbon Products via Sulfur&#8208;Enhanced Proton Feeding in Atomically Precise Thiolate&#8208;Protected Cu Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiolate&#8208;protected Cu clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species exhibit remarkable potential for the CO2RR and are ideal model catalysts for establishing structure&#8211;electrocatalytic property relationships at the atomic level. However, extant Cu clusters employed in the CO2RR predominantly yield 2e&#8722; products. Herein, two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters (MMI = 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole) are prepared to investigate the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S sites on the CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 can reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a 91.0% Faradaic efficiency (including 53.7% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Conversely, Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a remarkable preference for C2+ products, achieving a maximum FE of 58.5% with a C2+ current density of 152.1 mA&#8729;cm&#8722;2. In situ XAS and ex situ XPS spectra reveal the preservation of Cu+ species in Cu clusters during CO2RR, extensively enhancing the adsorption capacity of *CO intermediates. Moreover, kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations confirm that S sites facilitate H2O dissociation into *H species, which directly participate in the protonation process on adjacent Cu sites for the protonation of *CO to *CHO. This study highlights the important role of Cu&#8211;S dual sites in Cu clusters and provides mechanistic insights into the CO2RR pathway at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly of organic multi&#8208;block nanowires for cascade optical waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic heterostructures (OHs) with multi&#8208;segments exhibit special optoelectronic properties compared with monomeric structures. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures remains challenging due to compatibility issues between segment parts, which restricts their application in optical waveguides and integrated optics. Herein, we demonstrate programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;step spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures optical waveguides and proper output among the multi&#8208;segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi&#8208;block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase reprograms hypoxia signaling in cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms for recognizing and responding to changes in oxygen (O2) concentrations. Here, we have reprogrammed cellular hypoxia (low O2) signaling via gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a non&#8208;heme iron dependent O2 sensor. Using computational modeling and protein engineering techniques, we identify a gas tunnel and critical residues therein that limit the flow of O2 to PHD2&#8217;s catalytic core. We show that systematic modification of these residues can open the constriction topology of PHD2&#8217;s gas tunnel. Using kinetic stopped&#8208;flow measurements with NO as a surrogate diatomic gas, we demonstrate up to 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in its association rate to the iron center of tunnel&#8208;engineered mutants. Our most effectively designed mutant displays 9&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM = 830 &#177; 40 M&#8208;1 s&#8208;1) in hydroxylating a peptide mimic of hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF&#8208;1&#945;, as compared to WT PHD2 (kcat/KM = 90 &#177; 9 M&#8208;1 s&#8208;1). Furthermore, transfection of plasmids that express designed PHD2 mutants in HEK&#8208;293T mammalian cells reveal significant reduction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; and downstream hypoxia response transcripts under hypoxic conditions of 1% O2. Overall, these studies highlight activation of PHD2 as a new pathway to reprogram hypoxia responses and HIF signaling in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonreducing Sugar Scaffold Enables the Development of Immunomodulatory TLR4&#8208;specific LPS Mimetics with Picomolar Potency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system play a central role in host defense and in the modulation of immune responses in infection, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Of the PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptors (TLR) are particularly important targets for the development of immunotherapies in a variety of inflammatory and oncological settings. TLR4&#8208;specific carbohydrate&#8208;based biomolecules capable of potently activating cellular responses or inhibiting TLR4&#8208;mediated inflammation were designed, chemically synthesised and immunobiologically evaluated.







Abstract
Innate immune defense mechanisms against infection and cancer encompass the modulation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)&#8208;mediated inflammation, including upregulation of various transcription factors and the activation of pro&#8208;inflammatory pathways important for immune surveillance. Dysfunction of PRRs&#8208;mediated signaling has been implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases, while the overactivation of PRRs&#8208;driven responses during infection can lead to devastating consequences such as acute lung injury or sepsis. We used crystal structure&#8208;based design to develop immunomodulatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mimetics targeting one of the ubiquitous PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Taking advantage of an exo&#8208;anomeric conformation and specific molecular shape of synthetic nonreducing &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diglucosamine, which was investigated by NMR, we developed two sets of lipid A mimicking glycolipids capable of either potently activating innate immune responses or inhibiting pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling. Stereoselective 1,1&#8242;&#8208;glycosylation towards fully orthogonally protected nonreducing GlcN&#946;(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN followed by stepwise assembly of differently functionalised phosphorylated glycolipids provided biologically active molecules that were evaluated for their ability to trigger or to inhibit cellular innate immune responses. Two LPS mimetics, identified as potent TLR4&#8208;specific inducers of the intracellular signaling pathways, serve as vaccine adjuvant&#8208; and immunotherapy candidates, while anionic glycolipids with TLR4&#8208;inhibitory potential hold therapeutic promise for the management of acute or chronic inflammation.

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single&#8208;atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96&#8201;% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.

         <title>Symmetric Anion Mediated Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Knoevenagel Reaction for N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N Atropisomers Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N atropisomers. The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The mechanism investigation further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral products.







Abstract
A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N atropisomers. The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The key to excellent regio&#8208; and remote enantiocontrol could be owed to the hydrogen bond between the enolate anion and triflamide block of the organocatalyst. This connected the enolate anion and iminium cation by a chiral backbone. The mechanism investigation via control experiments, correlation analysis, and density functional theory calculations further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones. The synthetic applications also demonstrated the reaction's potential.

         <title>A Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer for Combined Pyroptosis and Apoptosis with NIR&#8208;II Imaging/Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z1 was synthesized and it was encapsulated with F127 polymer to obtain Z1 NPs. They could generate ROS effectively under 808&#8197;nm laser, particularly type I ROS. Moreover, they exhibited good mitochondrial targeting, and induced synergistic pyroptosis and apoptosis for potent tumor therapy. Meanwhile, Z1 NPs demonstrated NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy with minimal adverse effects.







Abstract
Overcoming tumor apoptosis resistance is a major challenge in enhancing cancer therapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death (PCD) involving inflammasomes, Gasdermin family proteins, and cysteine proteases, offers potential in cancer treatment. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce pyroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of photosensitizers (PSs), many PSs lack specific subcellular targets and are limited to the first near&#8208;infrared window, potentially reducing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, developing effective, deep&#8208;penetrating, organelle&#8208;targeted pyroptosis&#8208;mediated phototherapy is essential for cancer treatment strategies. Here, we synthesized four molecules with varying benzene ring numbers in thiopyrylium structures to preliminarily explore their photodynamic properties. The near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) PS Z1, with a higher benzene ring count, exhibited superior ROS generation and mitochondria&#8208;targeting abilities, and a large Stokes shift. Through nano&#8208;precipitation method, Z1 nanoparticles (NPs) also demonstrated high ROS generation (especially type&#8208;I ROS) upon 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, leading to efficient mitochondria dysfunction and combined pyroptosis and apoptosis. Moreover, they exhibited exceptional tumor&#8208;targeting ability via NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Furthermore, Z1 NPs&#8208;mediated phototherapy effectively inhibited tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. Our findings offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy, warranting further preclinical investigations in PDT.

         <title>Steric Hindrance Engineering to Modulate the Closed Pores Formation of Polymer&#8208;Derived Hard Carbon for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric hindrance strategy has been proposed to modulate the closed pores formation of polymer&#8208;derived hard carbon (HC). Sterically hindered groups with aromatic ring are crucial to enhance the rigidity and internal free volumes of polymer, which could suppress the polymer rearrangements and induce the formation of close pores. Moreover, the fabricated HC anode exhibit excellent Na+ storage capacity and fast Na+ transport for sodium&#8208;ion battery.







Abstract
The closed pores play a critical role in improving the sodium storage capacity of hard carbon (HC) anode, however, their formation mechanism as well as the efficient modulation strategy at molecular level in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs is still lacking. In this work, the steric hindrance effect has been proposed to create closed pores in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs for the first time through grafting the aromatic rings within and between the main chains in the precursor. The experimental data and theoretical calculation demonstrate that steric&#8208;hindrance effect from the aromatic ring side group can increase backbone rigidity and the internal free volumes in the polymer precursor, which can prevent the over graphitization and facilitate the formation of closed pores during the carbonization process. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared HC anode exhibits a remarkably enhanced discharge capacity of 340.3&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;C, improved rate performance (210.7&#8197;mAh/g at 5&#8197;C) as well as boosted cycling stability (86.4&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C). This work provides a new insight into the formation mechanisms of closed pores via steric hindrance engineering, which can shed light on the development of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;derived HC anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Direct Benzylic C&#8722;H Etherification Enabled by Base&#8208;Promoted Halogen Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;promoted halogen transfer enables direct benzylic C&#8722;H oxidative coupling reactions with alcohols. This new deprotonative C&#8722;H oxidation protocol displays unique synthetic capabilities over alternative mechanistic strategies, including the ability to activate high oxidation potential substrates, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, and precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes.







Abstract
We disclose a benzylic C&#8722;H oxidative coupling reaction with alcohols that proceeds through a synergistic deprotonation, halogenation and substitution sequence. The combination of tert&#8208;butoxide bases with 2&#8208;halothiophene halogen oxidants enables the first general protocol for generating and using benzyl halides through a deprotonative pathway. In contrast to existing radical&#8208;based methods for C&#8722;H functionalization, this process is guided by C&#8722;H acidity trends. This gives rise to new synthetic capabilities, including the ability to functionalize diverse methyl(hetero)arenes, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes and use of a double C&#8722;H etherification process to controllably oxidize methylarenes to benzaldehydes.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Allenylic Amination of Allenols Activated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interaction with Methanol</title>

         <dc:description>
The first nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylic amination of methanol&#8208;activated allenols enables a diverse array of functionalized allenylic amines to be accessed in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The ubiquitous nature of amines in drug compounds, bioactive molecules and natural products has fueled intense interest in their synthesis. Herein, we introduce a nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylic amination of methanol&#8208;activated allenols. This protocol affords a diverse array of functionalized allenylic amines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by employing bioactive amines as nucleophiles and conducting gram&#8208;scale reactions. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations elucidate the role of methanol as an activator in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, facilitating the oxidative addition of the C&#8722;O bond of allenols through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The remarkable outcomes arise from a rapid racemization of allenols enabled by the nickel catalyst and from highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of &#951;3&#8208;alkadienylnickel intermediates.

         <title>N&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridone&#8208;Derived Endoperoxide Suppressing both Lung Cancer and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression by Three&#8208;Pronged Action
</title>

         <dc:description>
An endoperoxide compound (E5) spontaneously deliver three active agents and target multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone. In addition, triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is an important issue in many refractory cancers.







Abstract
We report an endoperoxide compound (E5) which can deliver three therapeutic components by a thermal cycloreversion, namely, singlet oxygen, triplet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (P5), thus targeting multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In aqueous environment, E5 undergoes clean reaction to afford three therapeutic components with a half&#8208;life of 8.3&#8197;hours without the generation of other by&#8208;products, which not only achieves good cytotoxicity toward lung cancer cells and decreases the levels of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) protein, but also inhibits the transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) induced fibrosis in vitro. In vivo experiments also demonstrated the efficacy of E5 in inhibiting tumor growth and relieving idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, while exhibiting good biocompatibility. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone for these two lung diseases, and triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is a critical issue in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Unlike other combination therapies, in which multiple therapeutic agents are given in independent formulations, our work demonstrates single molecule endoperoxide prodrugs could be developed as new platforms for treatment of cancers and related diseases.

         <title>Phosphonium Iodide Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence for Highly Efficient X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of phosphonium iodide featuring blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence was reported. Benefitting from the efficient exciton utilization, near&#8208;unity PLQY, large Stokes shift, and high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability contributed by I&#8722;, the prepared phosphonium iodide delivers outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, providing the application potential in high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Organic scintillators are praised for their abundant element reserves, facile preparation procedures, and rich structures. However, the weak X&#8208;ray attenuation ability and low exciton utilization efficiency result in unsatisfactory scintillation performance. Herein, a new family of highly efficient organic phosphonium halide salts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are designed by innovatively adopting quaternary phosphonium as the electron acceptor, while dimethylamine group and halide anions (I&#8722;) serve as the electron donor. The prepared butyl(2&#8208;[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]phenyl)diphenylphosphonium iodide (C4&#8208;I) exhibits bright blue emission and an ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100&#8201;%. Efficient charge transfer is realized through the unique n&#8208;&#960; and anion&#8208;&#960; stacking in solid&#8208;state C4&#8208;I. Photophysical studies of C4&#8208;I suggest that the incorporation of I accounts for high intersystem crossing rate (kISC) and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), suppressing the intrinsic prompt fluorescence and enabling near&#8208;pure TADF emission at room temperature. Benefitting from the large Stokes shift, high PLQY, efficient exciton utilization, and remarkable X&#8208;ray attenuation ability endowed by I, C4&#8208;I delivers an outstanding light yield of 80721 photons/MeV and a low limit of detection (LoD) of 22.79&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1. This work would provide a rational design concept and open up an appealing road for developing efficient organic scintillators with tunable emission, strong X&#8208;ray attenuation ability, and excellent scintillator performance.

         <title>Exploring Nanozymes for Organic Substrates: Building Nano&#8208;organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper provides a comprehensively review of nanozymes targeting organic substrates, discuss the strategies for efficient identification of new nanozymes, and propose a novel paradigm for constructing nano&#8208;organelles.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the first peroxidase nanozyme (Fe3O4), numerous nanomaterials have been reported to exhibit intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity toward inorganic oxygen species, such as H2O2, oxygen, and O2&#8722;. However, the exploration of nanozymes targeting organic compounds holds transformative potential in the realm of industrial synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of nanozymes that catalyze reactions involving organic substrates and discusses their catalytic mechanisms, structure&#8208;activity relationships, and methodological paradigms for discovering new nanozymes. Additionally, we propose a forward&#8208;looking perspective on designing nanozyme formulations to mimic subcellular organelles, such as chloroplasts, termed &#8220;nano&#8208;organelles&#8221;. Finally, we analyze the challenges encountered in nanozyme synthesis, characterization, nano&#8208;organelle construction and applications while suggesting directions to overcome these obstacles and enhance nanozyme research in the future. Through this review, our goal is to inspire further research efforts and catalyze advancements in the field of nanozymes, fostering new insights and opportunities in chemical synthesis.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the exploration of nanozymes targeting organic compounds holds transformative potential in the realm of industrial synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of nanozymes that catalyze reactions involving organic substrates and discusses their catalytic mechanisms, structure-activity relationships, and methodological paradigms for discovering new nanozymes. Additionally, we propose a forward-looking perspective on designing nanozyme formulations to mimic subcellular organelles, such as chloroplasts, termed &#8220;nano-organelles&#8221;. Finally, we analyze the challenges encountered in nanozyme synthesis, characterization, nano-organelle construction and applications while suggesting directions to overcome these obstacles and enhance nanozyme research in the future. Through this review, our goal is to inspire further research efforts and catalyze advancements in the field of nanozymes, fostering new insights and opportunities in chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Syngas Production from Natural Lignin, Sunlight, and Water over Pt&#8208;Decorated InGaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven green syngas production from natural lignin and water is achieved over Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires supported by a silicon substrate. Photo&#8208;excited charges play a critical role in the generation of &#8901;CH3 from lignin and &#8901;OH from water, followed by the formation of syngas. The study shows a promising route for the carbon&#8208;neutral production of transportation fuels and valuable chemicals beyond fossil fuels.







Abstract
Transformation of lignin to syngas can turn waste into treasure yet remains a tremendous challenge because of its naturally evolved stubborn structure. In this work, light&#8208;driven reforming of natural lignin in water for green syngas production is explored using Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires. The spectroscopic characterizations, isotope, and model compound experiments, as well as density function theory calculation, disclose that among a variety of groups including aromatic ring, &#8722;OH, &#8722;OCH3, &#8722;C3H7 with complex chemical bonds of O&#8722;H, C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, etc., InGaN nanowires are cooperative with Pt for preferably breaking the C&#8722;O bond of the rich O&#8722;CH3 group in lignin to liberating &#8901;CH3 by photogenerated holes with a minimum dissociation energy of 2.33&#8197;eV. Syngas are subsequently yielded from the continuous evolution of &#8901;CH3 and &#8901;OH from photocatalytic reforming of lignin in water. Together with the superior optoelectronic attributes of Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires, the evolution rate of syngas approaches 43.4&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with tunable H2/CO ratios and a remarkable turnover number (TON) of 150, 543&#8197;mol syngas per mol Pt. Notably, the architecture demonstrates a high light efficiency of 12.1&#8201;% for syngas generation under focused light without any extra thermal input. Outdoor test ascertains the viability of producing syngas with the only inputs of natural lignin, water, and sunlight, thus presenting a low&#8208;carbon route for synthesizing transportation fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Photoinduced C(sp3)&#8722;H Bicyclopentylation Enabled by an Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex&#8208;Mediated Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced and electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component C(sp3)&#8722;H bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;arylation of glycine derivatives was developed. This protocol demonstrated efficacy in synthesizing diverse unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporating 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP motifs and enabled the late&#8208;stage integration of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCPs into peptides, applicable to both liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions.







Abstract
The photoredox electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;mediated radical coupling reaction has gained prominence in the field of organic synthesis, finding widespread application in two&#8208;component coupling reactions. However, EDA complex&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component reactions are not well developed with only a limited number of examples have been reported. Herein, we report a photoinduced and EDA complex&#8208;promoted highly chemoselective three&#8208;component radical arylalkylation of [1.1.1]propellane, which allows the direct functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;aryl groups under mild conditions. A variety of unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, featuring structurally diversified 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties, were synthesized in a single&#8208;step process. Notably, leveraging the high tension release of [1.1.1]propellane, the highly unstable transient aryl radical undergoes rapid conversion into a relatively stable tertiary alkyl transient radical, and consequently, the competing side&#8208;reaction of two&#8208;component coupling was entirely suppressed. The strategic use of this transient radical conversion approach would be useful for the design of diverse EDA complex&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;component reactions. It is noteworthy that the highly chemoselective late&#8208;stage incorporation of the 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP pharmacophores into peptides was achieved both in liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions. This advancement is anticipated to have significant application potential in the future development of peptide drugs.

         <title>Blade&#8208;Coating (100)&#8208;Oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite Films via Crystal Surface Energy Regulation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>

Regulating the crystal surface energy and optimizing the crystallization dynamics realized blade&#8208;coating of (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 for 24.16&#8201;% efficient inverted perovskite solar cells with extended lifespan.







Abstract
Photoactive black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite has dominated the prevailing high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), normally for those spin&#8208;coated, conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured devices. Unfortunately, &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 has not been made full use of its advantages in inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured PSCs fabricated via blade&#8208;coating techniques owing to uncontrollable crystallization kinetics and complicated phase evolution of FAPbI3 perovskites during film formation. Herein, a customized crystal surface energy regulation strategy has been innovatively developed by incorporating 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine hydroiodide (NAPI) additive into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystal&#8208;derived perovskite ink, which enabled the formation of highly&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. We deciphered the phase transformation mechanisms and crystallization kinetics of blade&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films via combining a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the strong chemical interactions between the NAPI and inorganic Pb&#8722;I framework help to reduce the surface energy of (100) crystal plane by 42&#8201;%, retard the crystallization rate and lower the formation energy of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Benefited from multifaceted advantages of promoted charge extraction and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, the resultant blade&#8208;coated inverted PSCs based on (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films realized promising efficiencies up to 24.16&#8201;% (~26.5&#8201;% higher than that of the randomly&#8208;oriented counterparts), accompanied by improved operational stability. This result represented one of the best performances reported to date for FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs fabricated via scalable deposition methods.

         <title>Organolanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets with Heterocyclic Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progressive development of single&#8208;molecule magnets has advanced to the realm of heterocyclic organolanthanide chemistry. This minireview aims to highlight this progress and gives perspectives for further development of such single&#8208;molecule magnets.







Abstract
Lanthanide (Ln) based mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) provide probably the finest ligand regulation model for magnetic property. Recently, the development of such SMMs has witnessed a fast transition from coordination to organometallic complexes because the latter provides a fertile, yet not fully excavated soil for the development of SMMs. Especially those SMMs with heterocyclic ligands have shown the potential to reach higher blocking temperature. In this minireview, we give an overview of the design principle of SMMs and highlight those &#8220;shining stars&#8221; of heterocyclic organolanthanide SMMs based on the ring sizes of ligands, analysing how the electronic structures of those ligands and the stiffness of subsequently formed molecules affect the dynamic magnetism of SMMs. Finally, we envisaged the future development of heterocyclic Ln&#8208;SMMs.

In this minireview, we give an overview of the design principle of SMMs and highlight those &#8220;shining stars&#8221; of heterocyclic organolanthanide SMMs based on the ring sizes of ligands, analysing how the electronic structures of those ligands and the stiffness of subsequently formed molecules affect the dynamic magnetism of SMMs. Finally, we envisaged the future development of heterocyclic Ln-SMMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Measuring Kinetics under Vibrational Strong Coupling: Testing for a Change in the Nucleophilicity of Water and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to change the rate of organic reactions. However, a lack of convenient and reliable methods to measure reaction kinetics under VSC makes it challenging to obtain mechanistic insight into its influence, hindering progress in the field. Here, we use recently developed fixed&#8208;width optical cavities to obtain large kinetic datasets under VSC with small errors (&#177; 1&#8208;5%) in an operationally simple manner using UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The setup is used to test whether VSC changes a fundamental kinetic property of polar reactions, nucleophilicity, for water and alcohols, species commonly used in VSC&#8208;modified chemistry. We determined the rate constants for nucleophilic capture with a library of benzhydrilium ions as reference electrophiles with and without strong coupling of the nucleophile&#8217;s key vibrations. For all investigated combinations of electrophiles and nucleophiles, only minor changes in the observed rate constants of the reactions were observed, independently of the coupled bands. These results indicate that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of water and alcohols, suggesting that polar reactions are modified through other, presently unknown mechanisms. Fixed&#8208;width cavities allow for convenient and reproducible UV&#8208;vis kinetics, facilitating mechanistic studies of VSC&#8208;modified chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8209;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight Inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds.&#160;Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8209;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;&#8208;catenin inhibitor with single&#8208;digit micromolar activity in a cell&#8208;based assay. This study sheds a light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Diffusive Nonluminescent Carriers in Hybrid Phase Lead Triiodide Perovskite Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal structural rearrangements unavoidably introduce defects into materials, where even these small changes in local lattice structure could arouse a prominent impact on the overall nature of crystals. Contrary to the traditional notion that defects obstruct carrier transport, herein, we report a promoted transport mechanism of nonluminescent carriers in single&#8208;crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires (1345.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, about a 14&#8208;fold improvement), enabled by the phase transition induced defects (PTIDs). Carriers captured by PTIDs evade both the radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations during the incomplete tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition at low temperatures, forming a specific nonluminescent state that exhibits an efficient long&#8208;distance transport and thereby realize a prominent enhancement of photocurrent responsivity for photodetector applications. The findings provide broader insights into the carrier transport mechanism in perovskite semiconductors and have significant implications for their rational design for photoelectronic applications at varied operating temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Dilute Pd&#8208;Ni Alloy through Low&#8208;temperature Pyrolysis for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing highly active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for advancing anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). While dilute metal alloys have demonstrated substantial potential in enhancing alkaline HOR performance, there has been limited exploration in terms of rational design, controllable synthesis, and mechanism study. Herein, we developed a series of dilute Pd&#8208;Ni alloys, denoted as x% Pd&#8208;Ni, based on a trace&#8208;Pd decorated Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through a facile low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis approach. The x% Pd&#8208;Ni alloys exhibit efficient electrocatalytic activity for HOR in alkaline media. Notably, the optimal 0.5% Pd&#8208;Ni catalyst demonstrates high intrinsic activity with an exchange current density of 0.055 mA cm&#8208;2, surpassing that of many other alkaline HOR catalysts. The mechanism study reveals that the strong synergy between Pd single atoms (SAs)/Pd dimer and Ni substrate can modulate the binding strength of proton (H)/hydroxyl (OH), thereby significantly reducing the activation energy barrier of a decisive reaction step. This work offers new insights into designing advanced dilute metal or single&#8208;atom&#8208;alloys (SAAs) for alkaline HOR and potentially other energy conversion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in&#8208;situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5 &#956;mol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1 &#956;mol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, 91.7%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100% degradation in 120 min at &#8208;0.6 V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Parallel and High Throughput Reaction Monitoring with Computer Vision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development and applications of a computer vision based reaction monitoring method for parallel and high throughput experimentation (HTE). Whereas previous efforts reported methods to extract bulk kinetics of one reaction from one video, this new approach enables one video to capture bulk kinetics of multiple reactions running in parallel. Case studies, in and beyond well&#8208;plate high throughput settings, are described. Analysis of parallel dye&#8208;quenching hydroxylations, DMAP&#8208;catalysed esterification, solid&#8208;liquid sedimentation dynamics, metal catalyst degradation, and biologically&#8208;relevant sugar&#8208;mediated nitro reduction reactions have each provided insight into the scope and limitations of camera&#8208;enabled high throughput kinetics as a means of widening known analytical bottlenecks in HTE for reaction discovery, mechanistic understanding, and optimisation. It is envisaged that the nature of the multi&#8208;reaction time&#8208;resolved datasets made available by this analytical approach will later serve a broad range of downstream efforts in machine learning approaches to exploring chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Mimetic MoCu Dual&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Triggering Oxidative Stress Cascade Amplification for High&#8208;Efficiency Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with ultrahigh atom utilization efficiency have been extensively applied in reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. However, the high energy barriers of reaction intermediates on single&#8208;atom sites and the overexpressed antioxidants in the tumor microenvironment restrict the amplification of tumor oxidative stress, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with various catalytic active sites, which exhibits peroxidase, oxidase, glutathione (GSH) oxidase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase mimicking activities. Compared with Mo SAzyme, the introduction of Cu atoms, formation of dual&#8208;atom sites, and synergetic catalytic effects among various active sites enhance substrate adsorption and reduce the energy barrier, thereby endowing MoCu DAzyme with stronger catalytic activities. Benefiting from the above enzyme&#8208;like activities, MoCu DAzyme can not only generate multiple ROS, but also deplete GSH and block its regeneration to trigger the cascade amplification of oxidative stress. Additionally, the strong optical absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II bio&#8208;window endows MoCu DAzyme with remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Consequently, MoCu DAzyme achieves high&#8208;efficiency synergistic cancer treatment incorporating collaborative catalytic therapy and photothermal therapy. This work will advance the therapeutic applications of DAzymes and provide valuable insights for nanocatalytic cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Induced Phase Control Synthesis of Multi&#8208;dimensional Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 Heteronanostructures via Cation Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase control over cation exchange (CE) reactions has emerged as an important approach for the synthesis of nanomaterials (NMs). Although factors such as crystal structure and morphology have been studied for the phase engineering of CE reactions in NMs, there remains a lack of systematic investigation to reveal the impact factors in heterogeneous materials. Herein, we report a molybdenum disulfide induced phase control method for synthesizing multidimensional Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 heteronanostructures (HNs) via cation exchange. MoS2 in parent Cu1.94S&#8208;MoS2 HNs are proved to affect the thermodynamics and kinetics of CE reactions, and facilitate the formation of Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 HNs with controlled phase. This MoS2 induced phase control method can be extended to other parent HNs with multiple dimensions, which shows its universality. Further, theoretical calculations demonstrate that   Co3S4 (111)/MoS2 (001) exhibits  a higher  adhesion work, providing  further evidence that MoS2 enables phase control in the HNs CE reactions, inducing the generation of novel Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 HNs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, the obtained Co3S4&#8208;MoS2 heteronanoplates (HNPls) show remarkable performance in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) under alkaline media. This synthetic methodology provides a unique way to control the crystal structure and fills the gap in the study of heterogeneous materials on CE reaction over phase engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles via Hydroborative Cleavage of C&#8722;N Bonds &#8211; Scope, Mechanism, and Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal editing of the core structure of heterocycles offers new opportunities for chemical construction and is a promising yet challenging research topic that has recently gained increasing interest. However, several limitations of the reported systems remain to be addressed. For example, the reagents employed are generally in high&#8208;energy, such as chlorocarbene precursors, nitrene species, and metal carbenes, which are also associated with low atomic efficiencies. Thus, the development of simple systems for the skeletal editing of heterocycles is still desired. Herein, a straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of readily available indoles, benzimidazoles, and several other aromatic heterocycles is reported. Structurally diverse products were readily obtained, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed a BH3&#8208;induced C&#8722;N bond cleavage reaction pathway. An exciting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon of &#8208;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position was disclosed. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles were studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation via Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis with FeIII&#8208;Initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contact Electro&#8208;Catalysis (CEC) using commercial dielectric materials in contact&#8208;separation cycles with water triggers interfacial electron transfer, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the hydrophobicity of these materials limits reaction sites, and the generated ROS often combine to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which does not decompose further, leading to suboptimal rates. Addressing H2O2 generation and activation is crucial for advancing CEC. Here, we synthesized a catalyst by loading polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto ZSM&#8208;5 (PZ), achieving uniform dispersion in water. Introducing an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), with synergistic O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2, enhanced ROS generation. This system enabled nearly 99% degradation of azo dyes within 10 minutes, a sixfold improvement over traditional CEC. It represents the fastest ultrasound&#8208;induced degradation rate of methyl orange dye to date. Without extra oxidants, it also achieved stable dissolution of precious metals in weakly acidic solutions at room temperature, with 80% gold dissolution within 2 hours&#8208;2.5 times faster than similar systems. This study corrects the perception of CEC under acidic conditions, offering new insights for dye degradation and precious metal recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Individually Tunable Energy Levels of Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance of organic semiconductors are mainly determined by energy levels of their frontier molecular orbitals, e.g. lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) in the ground state, first singlet state (ES1) and first triplet state (ET1) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted ELUMO and nearly unchanged EHOMO due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing ES1 and nearly unchanged ET1 because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high&#8208;performance organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Celebrating Ten&#160;Years of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Solar Energy Conversion: Past, Present and Future</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accelerated anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases due to increasing energy demands has created a negative impact on our planet. Therefore, replacement of fossil by renewable energy resources has become of paramount interest. It is within this setting that organic photocatalysts have emerged as a new generation of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the conversion of solar radiation into chemical energy. In 2014, the first example of a covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction has been reported by our group, which has not only marked the beginning of COF photocatalysis for solar fuel production, but also helped to accelerate research into &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221;. In the last decade, significant progress has been made towards developing COFs as robust, molecularly precise platforms emulating artificial photosynthesis. This mini&#8208;review commemorates the 10th year anniversary of COF photocatalysis and gives a brief historical overview of the milestones in the field. We review milestones in the development of COFs for solar fuel production and related photocatalytic transformations, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction and alcohol oxidation. We discuss lessons learnt for the design of structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in COF photocatalysts, and future perspectives and challenges for the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition and order of multiple sidechains by metal&#8208;organic framework enhances the separation of hexane isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials perform molecular sorting, separation and transformation by interaction between their framework structures and the substrates. Proteins also interact with molecules to effect chemical transformations, but rely on the precise sequence of the amino acid building units along a common polypeptide backbone to maximise their performance. Design strategies that positionally order sidechains over a defined porous framework to diversify the internal surface chemistry would enhance control of substrate processing. Here we show that different sidechains can be ordered over a metal&#8208;organic framework through recognition of their distinct chemistries during synthesis. The sidechains are recognised because each one forces the common building unit that defines the backbone of the framework into a different conformation in order to form the extended structure. The resulting sidechain ordering affords hexane isomer separation performance superior to that of the same framework decorated only with sidechains of a single kind. The separated molecules adopt distinct arrangements within the resulting modified pore geometry, reflecting their strongly differentiated environments precisely created by the ordered sidechains. The development of frameworks that recognise&#160; and&#160;&#160;order multiple sidechain functionality by conformational control offers tailoring of the internal surfaces within families of porous materials to direct interactions at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Anionic Mixed&#8208;Valence and &#960;&#8208;Dimer Complexes of Ortho&#8208;Pentannulated BisAzaCoroneneDiimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) and &#960;&#8208;dimer species in ortho&#8208;pentannulated BisAzaCoroneneDiimides (BACDs) during their electrochemical reduction in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent. A library of nitrogen&#8208;containing extended PDIs was synthesized via an aza&#8208;benzannulation reaction followed by a Pd&#8208;catalysed ortho&#8208;pentannulation reaction. Ortho&#8208;pentannulated BACDs revealed strong aggregation abilities in solution. Concentration&#8208;dependent UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra, variable temperature 1H NMR experiments, and atomic force microscopy coupled to molecular dynamics support their self&#8208;assembly into columnar aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in dichloromethane reveal prominent splitting of the first reduction wave, attributed to the formation of unprecedented intermolecular anionic MV and &#960;&#8208;dimers in organic solvent. These species were thoroughly characterized by real&#8208;time spectroelectrochemistry, electrochemical simulations and theoretical calculations. Remarkably, this work underscores the tuneable nature of AzaBenzannulatedPerylene Diimides (AzaBPDIs) and BACDs, emphasizing their potential as a promising scaffold for designing supramolecular materials with long&#8208;range radical anion delocalization. The observation of this phenomenon provides insights into the fundamental behaviour of supramolecular organic semiconductors, thereby paving the way for the development of novel electronic devices and electron&#8208;deficient materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyanionic Receptors for Carboxylates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Receptors for carboxylate anions have many possible biomedical applications, including mimicry of the vancomycin group of antibiotics.&#160; However, binding carboxylates in water, the biological solvent, is highly challenging due to the hydrophilicity of these polar anions.&#160; Here we report, for the first time, the recognition of simple carboxylates such as acetate and formate in water by synthetic receptors with charge&#8208;neutral binding sites.&#160; The receptors are solubilised by polyanionic side&#8208;chains which, remarkably, do not preclude anion binding.&#160; The tricyclic structures feature two identical binding sites linked by polyaromatic bridges, capable of folding into closed, twisted conformations.&#160; This folding is hypothesised to preorganise the structures for anion recognition, mimicking the process which generates many protein binding sites.&#160; The architecture is suitable for elaboration into enclosed structures with potential for selective recognition of biologically relevant carboxylates.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dot Synthesis and Purification: Trends, Challenges and Recommendations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) have rapidly emerged as a new family of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials since their initial discovery two decades ago. Numerous appealing properties, such as precursor and synthesis process flexibility, tunable photoluminescence, and good biocompatibility, have enabled their widespread applications in sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedical fields. As the field expands, notable efforts have recently focused on mechanistically elucidating the structural formation and optical behavior of CDs. However, the absence of &#8220;clean&#8221; CDs presents a major obstacle to achieving a solid understanding of these aspects. Often, the claimed CDs are, in fact, a mixture of small molecules, oligomers, nano&#8208;sized aggregates, or even microparticles. Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD&#8208;based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography. The insights provided here will guide the researchers towards obtaining high&#8208;quality CDs, employing proper combinations of available tools, and ultimately paving the way for more demanding applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light Photodetection by Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Indium&#8208;Halide with Minimal Structural Distortion and Reduced Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite&#8208;inspired zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid halides exhibit impressive light emission properties; however, their potential in photovoltaics is hindered by the absence of interconnection between the inorganic polyhedra, leading to acute radiative recombination and insufficient charge separation. We demonstrate that incorporating closely&#8208;spaced dissimilar polyhedral units with minimal structural distortion leads to a remarkable enhancement in visible&#8208;light photodetection capability. We designed 0D C24H72N8In2Br14 (HIB) with a tetragonal crystal system, replacing the Cs+ of Cs2InBr5.H2O (CIB) with 1,6&#8208;hexanediammonium (HDA) cation. HIB comprises [InBr6]3&#8208; octahedra, and [InBr4]&#8208; tetrahedra units spaced 3.9 &#197; apart by the HDA linker. The [InBr4]&#8208; unit is additionally linked to HDA via intercalated bromine through hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions, respectively. This structural arrangement lowers the dielectric confinement, thereby enhancing carrier density and mobility, and increasing the diffusion coefficient compared to CIB. With 3.6% bromine vacancy within the [InBr4]&#8208; block, mid&#8208;gap states are created, reducing the direct band gap to 2.19 eV. HIB demonstrates an unprecedently high responsivity of 9975.9 &#177; 201.6 mA W&#8208;1 under 3 V potential bias at 485 nm wavelength, among low&#8208;dimensional hybrid halides.

We demonstrate that incorporating closely-spaced dissimilar polyhedral units with minimal structural distortion leads to a remarkable enhancement in visible-light photodetection capability. We designed 0D C24H72N8In2Br14 (HIB) with a tetragonal crystal system, replacing the Cs+ of Cs2InBr5.H2O (CIB) with 1,6-hexanediammonium (HDA) cation. HIB comprises [InBr6]3- octahedra, and [InBr4]- tetrahedra units spaced 3.9 &#197; apart by the HDA linker. The [InBr4]- unit is additionally linked to HDA via intercalated bromine through hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions, respectively. This structural arrangement lowers the dielectric confinement, thereby enhancing carrier density and mobility, and increasing the diffusion coefficient compared to CIB. With 3.6% bromine vacancy within the [InBr4]- block, mid-gap states are created, reducing the direct band gap to 2.19 eV. HIB demonstrates an unprecedently high responsivity of 9975.9 &#177; 201.6 mA W-1 under 3 V potential bias at 485 nm wavelength, among low-dimensional hybrid halides. In the absence of potential bias, the self-powered photodetection parameters are 81.2 &#177; 3.0 mA W-1 and (6.98 &#177; 0.21) &#215; 109 Jones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergizing Steric Hindrance and Stacking Interactions To Facilitate the Controlled Assembly of Multiple 41 Metalla&#8208;Knots and Pseudo&#8208;Solomon Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy has been used for controllable assembly. This has afforded a variety of structures ranging from 41 metalla&#8208;knots to a pseudo&#8208;Solomon link and a molecular tweezer&#8208;like assembly, co&#8208;driven by stacking interactions and repulsive interactions.







Abstract
In this work, a noncoplanar terphenyl served as a building block to synthesize a novel 3,3&#8242;&#8208;substituted bipyridyl ligand (L1) which further reacted with binuclear half&#8208;sandwich units A/B, giving rise to two aesthetic 41 metalla&#8208;knots in high yields via a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, given the inherent compactness of the 41 metalla&#8208;knots, it creates favorable conditions for the emergence of steric repulsion. We focused on progressively introducing nitrogen atoms featuring a lone pair of electrons (LPEs) into ligand L1 to manipulate the balance of H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/LPEs&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;LPEs steric repulsion during the assembly process, ultimately achieving controlled assembly from 41 metalla&#8208;knots to the pseudo&#8208;Solomon link and then to molecular tweezer&#8208;like assembly facilitated by stacking interactions. All the assemblies were well characterized by solution&#8208;state NMR techniques, ESI&#8208;TOF/MS, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The evolutionary process of the topological architectures is equivalent to visualizing the synergistic effect of steric hindrance and stacking interactions on structural assembly, providing a new avenue for achieving the controlled synthesis of different topologies.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Partitioned Self&#8208;Assembled Cage for Sequential Separation in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partitioned cavity of cage 1 demonstrates a high degree of molecular&#8208;specific recognition, enabling its application not only in the separation of adamantane derivatives but also in the progressive separation of multi&#8208;component polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, the reversible binding between the redox&#8208;active guest and 1 is achieved through precise regulation of the reduction/oxidation state of the guest via electrochemical stimulation.







Abstract
The concept of pore space partition has emerged as an effective strategy for developing improved coordination&#8208;based supramolecular porous materials with exceptional performance. Herein, we report that a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled tetrahedral cage 1 with a partitioned cavity shown excellent performance as a multifunctional extractant. The results show that this unique partitioned cavity can efficiently separate halogenated adamantanes, adamantane isomers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the influence of cavity&#8208;partitioned cage 1 on the electrochemical properties of redox&#8208;active molecules and electrochemically driven reversible host&#8211;guest process has also been demonstrated. The findings offer valuable insights into the design and development of new type of materials with controlled phase separation and tailored electrochemical properties.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Nanohelixes Driven by Host&#8208;Guest Interactions and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical nanostructures fabricated via the self&#8208;assembly of artificial motifs have been a captivating subject because of their structural aesthetics and multiple functionalities. Herein, we report the facile construction of a self&#8208;assembled nanohelix (NH) by leveraging an achiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen (G) and pillar[5]arene (H), driven by host&#8208;guest interactions and metal coordination. Inspired by the &#8220;sergeants and soldiers&#8221; effect and &#8220;majority rule&#8221; principle, the host&#8208;guest complexation between G and H is employed to fixate the twisted conformation of G for the generation of &#8220;contortion sites&#8221;, which further induced the emergence of helicity as the 1D assemblies are formed via Ag(I) coordination and hexagonally packed into nano&#8208;sized fibers. The strategy has proved feasible in both homogeneous and heterogeneous syntheses. Along with the formation of NH, boosted luminescence and enhanced productivity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are afforded because of the efficient restriction on G, indicating the concurrent regulation of NH's morphology and photophysical properties by supramolecular assembly. In addition, NH also exhibits the capacity for bacteria imaging and photodynamic antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli).</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Bias in Molecular Photogearing Evidenced by LED&#8208;Coupled Chiral Cryo&#8208;HPLC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant directionality bias for the coupled rotations of a light&#8208;powered molecular photogear is evidenced by analysis of its enantiomeric states. Using a custom designed LED&#8208;coupled chiral cryo&#8208;HPLC setup, the sense of directionality of coupled double&#8208; and single bond rotations during photogearing could be elucidated directly. Electronic effects are found to be crucial for directionality bias instead of steric effects.







Abstract
Molecular gearing systems are technomimetic nanoscale analogues to complex geared machinery in the macroscopic world. They are defined as systems incorporating intermeshed movable parts which perform correlated rotational motions by mechanical engagement. Only recently, new methods to actively drive molecular gearing motions instead of relying on passive thermal activation have been developed. Further progress in this endeavor will pave the way for unidirectional molecular gearing devices with a distinct type of molecular machine awaiting its realization. Within this work an essential step towards this goal is achieved by evidencing directional biases for the light&#8208;induced rotations in our molecular photogear system. Using a custom&#8208;designed LED&#8208;coupled chiral cryo&#8208;HPLC setup for the in situ irradiation of enantiomeric analytes, an intrinsic selectivity for clockwise or counterclockwise rotations was elucidated experimentally. Significant directional biases in the photogearing processes and light&#8208;induced single bond rotations (SBRs) are observed for our photogear with directional preferences of up to 4.8&#8201;:&#8201;1. Harnessing these effects will allow to rationally design and construct a fully directional molecular gearing motor in the future.

         <title>Coupled Electron&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Transfer Processes at a Liquid/Liquid Interface Decorated with Photoactive Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer and ion transfer reactions at self&#8208;assembled BiVO4 particles at a liquid&#8208;liquid interface could be disentangled by the combined use of micropipettes and microelectrodes to detect the products. The rates of all processes could be modulated by an external Galvani potential difference across the liquid&#8208;liquid interface.







Abstract
The influence of the ion transfer on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions was studied on the surface of hyperbranched semiconducting BiVO4 particles spontaneously adsorbed at the liquid&#8208;liquid (L/L) interface between an aqueous LiCl solution and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentaflurophenyl)borate (BATB) in 1,2&#8208;dichlorethane. The organic electrolyte was supplemented with [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 to accept photoexcited electrons from BiVO4 under formation of the corresponding Co(II) complex. The L/L interface was stabilized at the orifice of a micropipette (MP) and allowed to record ion transfer cyclic voltammetry (ITCV) by applying a Galvani potential difference

&lt;p&gt;The influence of the ion transfer on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions was studied on the surface of hyperbranched semiconducting BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; particles spontaneously adsorbed at the liquid-liquid (L/L) interface between an aqueous LiCl solution and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentaflurophenyl)borate (BATB) in 1,2-dichlorethane. The organic electrolyte was supplemented with [Co(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to accept photoexcited electrons from BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under formation of the corresponding Co(II) complex. The L/L interface was stabilized at the orifice of a micropipette (MP) and allowed to record ion transfer cyclic voltammetry (ITCV) by applying a Galvani potential difference

         <title>Linearly Arranged Multi&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Stacked Structure for Efficient Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer materials excel in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, with &#960;&#8208;stacked structures being effective frameworks, but the lack of robust construction methods hinders progress. Double C&#8722;H activation has now been used to construct two donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D|A|D) type through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer materials derived from C11&#8208;substituted indenofluorene skeletons, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 28.6&#8201;% and 16.2&#8201;% achieved.







Abstract
Noncovalent spatial interaction has become an intriguing and important tool for constructing optoelectronic molecules. In this study, we linearly attached three conjugated units in a multi &#960;&#8208;stacked manner by using just one trident bridge based on indeno[2,1&#8208;b]fluorene. To achieve this structure, we improved the synthetic approach through double C&#8722;H activation, significantly simplifying the preparation process. Due to the proximity of the C10, C11, and C12 sites in indeno[2,1&#8208;b]fluorene, we derived two novel donor|acceptor|donor (D|A|D) type molecules, 2DMB and 2DMFB, which exhibited closely packed intramolecular stacking, enabling efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer. This molecular construction is particularly suitable for developing high&#8208;performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. With donor(s) and acceptor(s) constrained and separated within this spatially rigid structure, elevated radiative transition rates, and high photoluminescence quantum yields were achieved. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes incorporating 2DMB and 2DMFB demonstrated superior efficiency, achieving maximum external quantum efficiencies of 28.6&#8201;% and 16.2&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom 3d Transition Metals on SnO2 as Model Cell for Conversion Mechanism: Revealing Thermodynamic Catalytic Effects on Enhanced Na Storage of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of model cells has been established for conversion reactions between Na and TMSA&#8722;SnO2, where TMSA&#8722;SnO2 represents eight different 3d transition elements (V to Zn) single atom into SnO2. A thermodynamic catalytic effect has been identified for the first time, significantly promoting conversion reactions and enhancing performance.







Abstract
Since the discovery in 2000, conversion&#8208;type materials have emerged as a promising negative&#8208;electrode candidate for next&#8208;generation batteries with high capacity and tunable voltage, limited by low reversibility and severe voltage hysteresis. Heterogeneous construction stands out as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient approach to reducing reaction barriers and enhancing energy density. However, the second term introduced by conventional heterostructure inevitably complicates the electrochemical analysis and poses great challenges to harvesting systematic insights and theoretical guidance. A model cell is designed and established herein for the conversion reactions between Na and TMSA&#8722;SnO2, where TMSA&#8722;SnO2 represents single atom modification of eight different 3d transition elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn). Such a model unit fundamentally eliminates the interference from the second phase and thus enables independent exploration of activation manifestations of the heterogeneous architecture. For the first time, a thermodynamically dependent catalytic effect is proposed and verified through statistical data analysis. The mechanism behind the unveiled catalytic effect is further elucidated by which the active d orbitals of transition metals weaken the surface covalent bonds and lower the reaction barriers. This research provides both theoretical insights and practical demonstrations of the advanced heterogeneous electrodes.

         <title>Asymmetric Paired Electrolysis: Enantioselective Alkylation of Sulfonylimines via C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric paired electrolysis strategy for alkylation of sulfonylimines is reported. Anodic oxidation for benzylic radical formation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylimine reduction on the cathode are seamlessly cross&#8208;coupled using this protocol, providing enantio&#8208;enriched chiral amines containing a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter with high enantioselectivity under mild conditions.







Abstract
Enantioselective transformation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into three&#8208;dimensional chiral scaffolds is of longstanding interest to synthetic chemists. Herein, an asymmetric paired electrolysis enables a highly efficient and sustainable approach to the enantioselective alkylation of sulfonylimines via C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. In this protocol, anodic oxidation for benzylic radical formation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylimine reduction on the cathode were seamlessly cross&#8208;coupled (up to 88&#8201;% yield). Enantioenriched chiral amines containing a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter are accessed with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies suggest that the amine generated in situ could serve as a base to deprotonate phenols and decrease the oxidation potential of the reaction, allowing phenols with lower potentials to be preferentially oxidized.

         <title>Variation of Chemical Microenvironment of Pores in Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side&#8208;chain engineering approach is proposed to elucidate the impact of pore chemical microenvironment variation on photocatalytic H2O2 production behavior of two hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Comparatively, COF&#8722;O features impeded charge recombination, lowered charge transfer resistance, accelerated interfacial electron transfer and additional reactive sites, leading to an impressive apparent quantum yield of 10.3&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is an advantageous and ecologically sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, achieving high conversion efficiency without sacrificial agents remains a challenge. In this study, two covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;O and COF&#8722;C) were prepared with identical skeletal structures but with their pore walls anchored to different alkyl chains. They were used to investigate the effect of the chemical microenvironment of pores on photocatalytic H2O2 production. Experimental results reveal a change of hydrophilicity in COF&#8722;O, leading to suppressed charge recombination, diminished charge transfer resistance, and accelerated interfacial electron transfer. An apparent quantum yield as high as 10.3&#8201;% (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) can be achieved with H2O and O2 through oxygen reduction reaction. This is among the highest ever reported for polymer photocatalysts. This study may provide a novel avenue for optimizing photocatalytic activity and selectivity in H2O2 generation.

         <title>Functional Group&#8208;Driven Competing Mechanism in Electrochemical Reaction and Adsorption/Desorption Processes toward High&#8208;Capacity Aluminum&#8208;Porphyrin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Porphyrin derivatives introduced by electron&#8208;donating groups (EDG) and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) present the effect of functional groups on varying the electronic structure of porphyrin derivatives, which changes the redox potential and electrochemical energy storage performance. EWG can increase redox potential, while EDG reduces the redox potential. Due to the increasing electron density, EDG can improve Faradaic electrochemical reaction and de/adsorption capacitance contribution of porphyrin macrocycle, which is beneficial to improve the energy storage.







Abstract
Nonaqueous organic aluminum batteries are considered as promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices due to stable ionic liquid electrolytes and Al metals. However, the stability and capacity of organic positive electrodes are limited by their inherent high solubility and low active organic molecules. To address such issues, here porphyrin compounds with rigid molecular structures present stable and reversible capability in electrochemically storing AlCl2+. Comparison between the porphyrin molecules with electron&#8208;donating groups (TPP&#8208;EDG) and with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (TPP&#8208;EWG) suggests that EDG is responsible for increasing both highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, resulting in decreased redox potentials. On the other hand, EWG is associated with decreasing both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, leading to promoted redox potentials. EDG and EWG play critical roles in regulating electron density of porphyrin &#960; bond and electrochemical energy storage kinetics behavior. The competitive mechanism between electrochemical redox reaction and de/adsorption processes suggests that TPP&#8208;OCH3 delivers the highest specific capacity ~171.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, approaching a record in the organic Al batteries.

         <title>Fully Fused Indacenodithiophene&#8208;Centered Small&#8208;Molecule n&#8208;Type Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featured with fully fused structure has been synthesized by a newly developed strategy to generate high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic solar cells. The properties of these new organic semiconductors were systematically investigated and elucidated experimentally.







Abstract
Developing novel n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is an on&#8208;going research endeavour, given their pivotal roles in organic electronics and their relative scarcity compared to p&#8208;type counterparts. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring a fully fused conjugated backbone. By attaching two sets of adjacent amino and formyl groups to the indacenodithiophene&#8208;based central cores and triggering a tandem reaction sequence of a Knoevenagel condensation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization, DFA1 and DFA2 were realized. The solution&#8208;processed organic field effect transistors based on DFA1 exhibited unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a decent electron mobility of ca. 0.10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (ca. 0.038&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for DFA2 based devices). When employing DFA1 as a third component in organic solar cells, a high power conversion efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% can be achieved in ternary devices fabricated with PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8201;:&#8201;DFA1. This work provides a new pathway in the molecular engineering of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, propelling relevant research forward.

         <title>Aluminum Alkyl Induced Isomerization of Group&#8197;IV meso Metallocene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methoxy substituents of group&#8197;IV meso metallocene complexes enable their aluminum&#8208;alkyl (TIBA/TMA) promoted isomerization. The meso isomers were previously considered useless and needed to be separated tediously when the rac analogs were employed for the polymerization of propylene. Upon isomerization, the yield of isotactic polypropylene is increased by 400&#8201;%; a mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
The synthesis of group&#8197;IV metallocene precatalysts for the polymerization of propylene generally yields two different isomers: The racemic isomer that produces isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and the meso isomer that produces atactic polypropylene (aPP). Due to its poor physical properties, aPP has very limited applications. To avoid obtaining blends of both polymers and thus diminish the mechanical and thermal properties of iPP, the meso metallocene complexes need to be separated from the racemic ones tediously&#8212;rendering the metallocene&#8208;based polymerization of propylene industrially far less attractive than the Ziegler/Natta process. To overcome this issue, we established an isomerization protocol to convert meso metallocene complexes into their racemic counterparts. This protocol increased the yield of iPP by 400&#8201;% while maintaining the polymer's excellent physical properties and was applicable to both hafnocene and zirconocene complexes, as well as different precatalyst activation methods. Through targeted variation of the ligand frameworks, methoxy groups at the indenyl moieties were found to be the structural motifs responsible for an isomerization to take place&#8212;this experimental evidence was confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Liquid injection field desorption ionization mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance studies, allowed the proposal of an isomerization mechanism.

         <title>Spatioselective Occlusion of Copolymer Nanoparticles within Calcite Crystals Generates Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials with Controlled Internal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a powerful yet straightforward way to regulate the internal composition and structure of a single calcite crystal, generating a series of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials where the organic additives are preferentially distributed within specific regions of the inorganic host crystals.







Abstract
Efficient occlusion of particulate additives into a single crystal has garnered an ever&#8208;increasing attention in materials science because it offers a counter&#8208;intuitive yet powerful platform to make crystalline nanocomposite materials with emerging properties. However, precisely controlling the spatial distribution of the guest additives within a host crystal remains highly challenging. We herein demonstrate a unique, straightforward method to engineer the spatial distribution of copolymer nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3) single crystals by judiciously adjusting initial [Ca2+] concentration used for the calcite precipitation. More specifically, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is employed to synthesize well&#8208;defined and highly anionic poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium)41&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)500 [PSPMA41&#8208;PBzMA500] diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which are subsequently used as model additives during the growth of calcite crystals. Impressively, such guest nanoparticles are preferentially occluded into specific regions of calcite depending on the initial [Ca2+] concentration. These unprecedented phenomena are most probably caused by dynamic change in electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ ions and PSPMA41 chains based on systematic investigations. This study not only showcases a significant advancement in controlling the spatial distribution of guest nanoparticles within host crystals, enabling the internal structure of composite crystals to be rationally tailored via a spatioselective occlusion strategy, but also provides new insights into biomineralization.

         <title>5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin: a Stable Antiaromatic [20]Pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0) Displaying Remarkable Oxidative Self&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin and its BF2 complex were synthesized as the first example of meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted orangarins by double SNAr reaction of 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;BODIPY with 2&#8208;pyrrolydipyrrin. These orangarins are antiaromatic but stable. Remarkable oxidative self&#8208;coupling reactivities of the orangarin and its oligomers were demonstrated up to triply&#8208;COT&#8208;centered orangarin tetramers. COT&#8208;centered 3H&#8208;orangarin oligomers are oxidized to the corresponding 2H&#8208;orangarin oligomers, which show effective conjugation across the COT bridge. These directly linked orangarin oligomers show many reversible redox potentials owing to the intramolecular electronic interaction.







Abstract
5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin and its BF2 complex were synthesized by double SNAr reaction of 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;BODIPY with 2&#8208;pyrrolydipyrrin as the first examples of meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted orangarin. These orangarins, delineated as [20]pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0), are strongly antiaromatic but rather stable. The free base orangarin was coupled by oxidation with MnO2 to give a 11,11&#8242;&#8208;linked dimer, a cyclooctatetraene(COT)&#8208;centered trimer, and a spiro&#8208;trimer. Fused COT&#8208;centered 3H&#8208;orangarin dimer was oxidized to the corresponding 2H&#8208;orangarin dimer, which was further coupled to give a triply COT&#8208;centered 2H&#8208;orangarin tetramer. 3H&#8208;Orangarin oligomers are all antiaromatic as evinced by extremely low&#8208;field&#8208;shifted 1H&#8197;NMR signals of the inner NH and ill&#8208;defined absorption spectra with broad tails. In contrast, COT&#8208;centered 2H&#8208;orangarin dimer and tetramer show moderately low&#8208;field&#8208;shifted NH signals and intense NIR absorbance over 900&#8197;nm, suggesting effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the COT bridge and almost non&#8208;antiaromatic character. These orangarin oligomers exhibit many reversible redox potentials owing to the intramolecular electronic interactions. Regardless of the different aromatic characters, all the orangarin monomers and oligomers exhibit very rapid excited&#8208;state decays.

&lt;p&gt;5,18-Dimesitylorangarin and its BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex were synthesized as the first example of &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-aryl-substituted orangarins by double S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reaction of 3,5-dibromo-BODIPY with 2-pyrrolydipyrrin. These orangarins are antiaromatic but stable. Remarkable oxidative self-coupling reactivities of the orangarin and its oligomers were demonstrated up to triply-COT-centered orangarin tetramers. COT-centered &lt;i&gt;3H&lt;/i&gt;-orangarin oligomers are oxidized to the corresponding &lt;i&gt;2H&lt;/i&gt;-orangarin oligomers, which show effective conjugation across the COT bridge. These directly linked orangarin oligomers show many reversible redox potentials owing to the intramolecular electronic interaction.

&lt;p&gt;5,18-Dimesitylorangarin and its BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex were synthesized by double S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reaction of 3,5-dibromo-BODIPY with 2-pyrrolydipyrrin as the first examples of &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-aryl-substituted orangarin. These orangarins, delineated as [20]pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0), are strongly antiaromatic but rather stable. The free base orangarin was coupled by oxidation with MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give a 11,11&#8242;-linked dimer, a cyclooctatetraene(COT)-centered trimer, and a spiro-trimer. Fused COT-centered &lt;i&gt;3H&lt;/i&gt;-orangarin dimer was oxidized to the corresponding &lt;i&gt;2H&lt;/i&gt;-orangarin dimer, which was further coupled to give a triply COT-centered &lt;i&gt;2H&lt;/i&gt;-orangarin tetramer. 3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-Orangarin oligomers are all antiaromatic as evinced by extremely low-field-shifted &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR signals of the inner NH and ill-defined absorption spectra with broad tails. In contrast, COT-centered 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-orangarin dimer and tetramer show moderately low-field-shifted NH signals and intense NIR absorbance over 900&#8197;nm, suggesting effective &#960;-conjugation through the COT bridge and almost non-antiaromatic character. These orangarin oligomers exhibit many reversible redox potentials owing to the intramolecular electronic interactions. Regardless of the different aromatic characters, all the orangarin monomers and oligomers exhibit very rapid excited-state decays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantification of Charge Transport and Mass Deprivation in Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Kinetically&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermodynamics descriptor, separation factor of solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) for designing desirable SEI chemistry, is established on the energy of Li+ diffusion (&#916;VLi), electron tunneling (&#934;e), solvent adsorption (Es), and desolvation processes (&#916;Ed), and thus the kinetic stability of charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and mass (solvent) deprivation through SEI layer at low temperatures could be quantitatively evaluated.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries with admirable electrochemical performance below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C are desired but are hindered by sluggish interfacial charge transport and desolvation process. Li salt dissociation via Li+&#8208;solvent interaction enables mobile Li+ liberation and contributes to bulk ion transport, while is contradictory to fast interfacial desolvation. Designing kinetically&#8208;stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) without compromising strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction is expected to compatibly improve interfacial charge transport and desolvation kinetics. However, the relationship between physicochemical features and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics properties of SEI remains vague. Herein, we propose four key thermodynamics parameters of SEI potentially influencing low&#8208;temperature electrochemistry, including electron work function, Li+ transfer barrier, surface energy, and desolvation energy. Based on the above parameters, we further define a novel descriptor, separation factor of SEI (SSEI), to quantitatively depict charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and solvent deprivation processes at Gr/electrolyte interface. A Li3PO4&#8208;based, inorganics&#8208;enriched SEI derived by Li difluorophosphate (LiDFP) additive exhibits the highest SSEI (4.89&#215;103) to enable efficient Li+ conduction, e&#8722; blocking and rapid desolvation, and as a result, much suppressed Li&#8208;metal precipitation, electrolyte decomposition and Gr sheets exfoliation, thus improving low&#8208;temperature battery performances. Overall, our work originally provides visualized guides to improve low&#8208;temperature reaction kinetics/thermodynamics by constructing desirable SEI chemistry.

         <title>Reconstructing Helmholtz Plane Enables Robust F&#8208;Rich Interface for Long&#8208;Life and High&#8208;Safe Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TFEP reconstructs the Helmholtz plane on HC anode and boosts a robust F&#8208;rich SEI film by strongly adsorbing on the surface of HC and dragging the outer PF6&#8722; anions, thus greatly enhances the mechanical stability and the Na+ ion diffusion kinetics of the electrode/electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) is the most commonly used anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface (SEI) layer formed in carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes has an imperceptible dissolution tendency and a sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance of HC anode. Given that electrode/electrolyte interface property is highly dependent on the configuration of Helmholtz plane, we filtrated proper solvents by PFBE (PF6&#8722; anion binding energy) and CAE (carbon absorption energy) and disclosed the function of chosen TFEP to reconstruct the Helmholtz plane and regulate the SEI film on HC anode. Benefiting from the preferential adsorption tendency on HC surface and strong anion&#8208;dragging interaction of TFEP, a robust and thin anion&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich SEI film is established, which greatly enhances the mechanical stability and the Na+ ion diffusion kinetics of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The rationally designed TFEP&#8208;based electrolyte endows Na||HC half&#8208;cell and 2.8&#8197;Ah HC||Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 pouch cell with excellent rate capability, long cycle life, high safety and low&#8208;temperature adaptability. It is believed that this insightful recognition of tuning interface properties will pave a new avenue in the design of compatible electrolyte for low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;life, and high&#8208;safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover Mechanism at the Metal&#8211;Metal Interface in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the metal&#8211;metal interface, the minimized difference in the d&#8208;band center between these metals (&#916;&#1013;d) reduces the free energy difference between hydrogen adsorption on metal(i) and metal(ii) and lower the kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover between them. As a result, it can achieve a record high electrocatalytic nitrate hydrogenation efficiency at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover in metal&#8208;supported catalysts can largely enhance electrocatalytic hydrogenation performance and reduce energy consumption. However, its fundamental mechanism, especially at the metal&#8211;metal interface, remains further explored, impeding relevant catalyst design. Here, we theoretically profile that a large free energy difference in hydrogen adsorption on two different metals (|&#916;GH&#8208;metal(i)&#8722;&#916;GH&#8208;metal(ii)|) induces a high kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover between the metals. Minimizing the difference in their d&#8208;band centers (&#916;&#1013;d) should reduce |&#916;GH&#8208;metal(i)&#8722;&#916;GH&#8208;metal(ii)|, lowering the kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover for improved electrocatalytic hydrogenation. We demonstrated this concept using copper&#8208;supported ruthenium&#8211;platinum alloys with the smallest &#916;&#1013;d, which delivered record high electrocatalytic nitrate hydrogenation performance, with ammonia production rate of 3.45&#177;0.12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Faraday efficiency of 99.8&#177;0.2&#8201;%, at low energy consumption of 21.4&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgamm&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we further achieve continuous ammonia and formic acid production with a record high&#8208;profit space.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosheet Induced Inverse Growth of Negative Valency Au Clusters for Tumor Treatment by Enhanced Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au clusters with negative valence supported by sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm POM&#8208;LDH facilitate the hole&#8208;electron separation in POMs and enhance the ROS generation under US, the sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Au clusters with ultrahigh surface atom ratios exhibit remarkable efficiency for GSH depletion, the reversible redox of Mo in POM is able to deplete GSH and trigger CDT simultaneously. The serious imbalance of redox in the TME leads to death of tumor ultimately.







Abstract
Cluster aggregation states are thermodynamically favored at the subnanoscale, for which an inverse growth from nanoparticles to clusters may be realized on subnanometer supports. Herein, we develop Au&#8208;polyoxometalate&#8208;layered double hydroxide (Au&#8208;POM&#8208;LDH) sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets (Sub&#8208;APL) based on the above strategy, where sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Au clusters with negative valence are generated by the in situ disintegration of Au nanoparticles on POM&#8208;LDH supports. Sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Au clusters with ultrahigh surface atom ratios exhibit remarkable efficiency for glutathione (GSH) depletion. The closely connected sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Au with negative valence and POM hetero&#8208;units can promote the separation of hole&#8208;electrons, resulting in the enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under ultrasound (US). Besides, the reversible redox of Mo in POM is able to deplete GSH and trigger chemodynamic therapy (CDT) simultaneously, further enhancing the oxidative stress. Consequently, the Sub&#8208;APL present 2&#8208;fold ROS generation under US and 7&#8208;fold GSH depletion compared to the discrete Au and POM&#8208;LDH mixture. Therefore, the serious imbalance of redox in the TME caused by the sharp increase of ROS and rapid decrease of GSH leads to death of tumor ultimately.

&lt;p&gt;Cluster aggregation states are thermodynamically favored at the subnanoscale, for which an inverse growth from nanoparticles to clusters may be realized on subnanometer supports. Herein, we develop Au-polyoxometalate-layered double hydroxide (Au-POM-LDH) sub-1&#8197;nm nanosheets (Sub-APL) based on the above strategy, where sub-1&#8197;nm Au clusters with negative valence are generated by the in situ disintegration of Au nanoparticles on POM-LDH supports. Sub-1&#8197;nm Au clusters with ultrahigh surface atom ratios exhibit remarkable efficiency for glutathione (GSH) depletion. The closely connected sub-1&#8197;nm Au with negative valence and POM hetero-units can promote the separation of hole-electrons, resulting in the enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under ultrasound (US). Besides, the reversible redox of Mo in POM is able to deplete GSH and trigger chemodynamic therapy (CDT) simultaneously, further enhancing the oxidative stress. Consequently, the Sub-APL present 2-fold ROS generation under US and 7-fold GSH depletion compared to the discrete Au and POM-LDH mixture. Therefore, the serious imbalance of redox in the TME caused by the sharp increase of ROS and rapid decrease of GSH leads to death of tumor ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering Regulation Achieving Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization in Rare&#8208;Earth Hybrid Double Perovskites for Ferroelectrics and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F&#8208;substitution achieves out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and multipolar axis multiferroicity and enhances the Tc 94&#8197;K in rare&#8208;earth hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric with CPL response. It reveals that F&#8208;substitution is a powerful approach to controlling the performances of ferroic materials and providing new prospects for applications in next&#8208;generation ferroelectric micro&#8208;nano devices.







Abstract
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is a highly desired property of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics for application in vertical sandwich&#8208;type photoferroelectric devices, especially in ultrathin ferroelectronic devices. Nevertheless, despite great advances that have been made in recent years, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization remains unrealized in the 2D hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric family. Here, from our previous work 2D hybrid double perovskite HQERN ((S3HQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3HQ=S&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium), we designed a molecular strategy of F&#8208;substitution on organic component to successfully obtain FQERN ((S3FQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3FQ=S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoroquinuclidinium) showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis ferroelectric HQERN, FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity but also realizes out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization and a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 94&#8197;K. This is mainly due to the introduction of F&#8208;substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy. Our study demonstrates that F&#8208;substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving more possibility of 2D ferroelectric materials for applications in micro&#8208;nano optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Cycloadditions of Diazoalkenes with P4 and tBuCP: Access to Diazaphospholes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of stable diazoalkenes with phosphaalkynes (P1) and white phosphorus (P4) give access to diazamono&#8208; and diazadiphospholes. These new organophosphorus compounds can be utilized as ligands in main group and transition metal chemistry.







Abstract
Diazoalkenes readily react with tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne (tBuCP) and white phosphorus (P4) to afford novel phosphorus heterocycles, 3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;diazamonophospholes and 1,2,3,4&#8208;diazadiphospholes. Both species represent rare examples of neutral heterophospholes. The mechanism of formation and the electronic structures of these formal (3+2) cycloaddition products were analyzed computationally. The new phospholes form structurally diverse coordination compounds with transition metal and main group elements. Given the growing number of stable diazoalkenes, this work offers a straightforward route to neutral aza(di&#8208;)phospholes as a new ligand class.

         <title>BioLindlar Catalyst: Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Promoted Selective Bioreduction of Cyanoalkynes to Give (Z)&#8208;Cyanoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynes are attractive starting materials owing to the wide range of possible chemical transformations of this functional group. The selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;poor alkynes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases to give (Z)&#8208; or (E)&#8208;alkenes is now reported. Preparative biotransformations were performed with total selectivity to give the (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes (isolated in 63&#8211;97&#8201;%&#8201;yield), thus resembling the activity shown by transition&#8208;metal (e.g. Lindlar) catalysts.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of alkenes from alkynes usually requires the use of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Unfortunately, efficient biocatalytic alternatives for this transformation have yet to be discovered. Herein, the selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes to alkenes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs) is described. Alkynes bearing ketone, aldehyde, ester, and nitrile moieties have been effectively reduced with excellent conversions and stereoselectivities, observing clear trends for the E/Z ratios depending on the nature of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group. In the case of cyanoalkynes, (Z)&#8208;alkenes were obtained as the major product, and the reaction scope was expanded to a wide variety of aromatic substrates (up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion, and Z/E stereoselectivities of up to &gt;99/1). Other alkynes containing aldehyde, ketone, or ester functionalities also proved to be excellent substrates, and interestingly gave the corresponding (E)&#8208;alkenes. Preparative biotransformations were performed on a 0.4&#8197;mmol scale, producing the desired (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes with good to excellent isolated yields (63&#8211;97&#8201;%). This novel reactivity has been rationalised through molecular docking by predicting the binding poses of key molecules in the ERED&#8208;pu&#8208;0006 active site.

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Interfacial Morphological and Chemical Evolution in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using complementary in situ characterizations including atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we directly detected morphological/chemical evolution, Li plating/stripping processes and SEI dynamics in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Furthermore, Li&#8208;ion field distribution at the interface between different solid&#8208;state electrolytes was successfully visualized by Kelvin probe force microscopy.







Abstract
In situ analysis of Li plating/stripping processes and evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are critical for optimizing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMB). However, the buried solid&#8208;solid interfaces present a challenge for detection which preclude the employment of multiple analysis techniques. Herein, by employing complementary in situ characterizations, morphological/chemical evolution, Li plating/stripping dynamics and SEI dynamics were directly detected. As a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting interface, Li|Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) performed distinct interfacial morphological/chemical evolution and dynamics from ionic&#8208;conducting/electronic&#8208;isolating interface like Li|Li3PS4 (LPS), which were revealed by combination of in situ atomic force microscopy and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Though Li plating speed in LGPS was higher than LPS, speed of SSE decomposition was similar and ~85&#8201;% interfacial SSE turned into SEI during plating and remained unchanged in stripping. To leverage strengths of different SSEs, an LPS&#8208;LGPS&#8208;LPS sandwich electrolyte was developed, demonstrating enhanced ionic conductivity and improved interfacial stability with less SSE decomposition (25&#8201;%). Using in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, Li&#8208;ion behavior at interface between different SSEs was effectively visualized, uncovering distribution of Li ions at LGPS|LPS interface under different potentials.

To leverage strengths of different SSEs, an LPS-LGPS-LPS sandwich electrolyte was developed, demonstrating enhanced ionic conductivity and improved interfacial stability with less SSE decomposition (25&#8201;%). Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; Kelvin probe force microscopy, Li-ion behavior at interface between different SSEs was effectively visualized, uncovering distribution of Li ions at LGPS|LPS interface under different potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rechargeable &#8220;Rocking Chair&#8221; Type Zn&#8722;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; type aqueous Zn&#8722;CO2 battery was designed with Zn2+ cations shuttling between the cathode and anode in a single compartment. A weak&#8208;acidic zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (ZnOTf)2 aqueous electrolyte was introduced to inhibit interfacial side reactions on the Zn anode and facilitate uniform Zn plating. Experimental results confirm a novel reaction pathway of the reversible formation and decomposition for ZnCO3 and carbon discharge products.







Abstract
Rising global temperatures and critical energy shortages have spurred researches into CO2 fixation and conversion within the realm of energy storage such as Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. However, traditional Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries employ double&#8208;compartment electrolytic cells with separate carriers for catholytes and anolytes, diverging from the &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; battery mechanism. The specific energy of these conventional batteries is constrained by the solubility of discharge reactants/products in the electrolyte. Additionally, H2O molecules tend to trigger parasitic reactions at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces, undermining the long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes. In this report, we introduce an innovative &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; type Zn&#8722;CO2 battery that utilizes a weak&#8208;acidic zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate aqueous electrolyte compatible with both cathode and anode. This design minimizes side reactions on the Zn surface and leverages the high catalytic activity of the cathode material, allowing the battery to achieve a substantial discharge capacity of 6734&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintain performance over 65&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the successful production of pouch cells demonstrates the practical applicability of Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. Electrode characterizations confirm superior electrochemical reversibility, facilitated by solid discharge products of ZnCO3 and C. This work advances a &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with an enhanced specific energy and a reversible pathway, providing a foundation for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Pd2Lab2Lcc2 and Pd2Lab2Lcd2 Type Cages by Heteromeric Completive Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structurally complex biological systems, two highly anisotropic Pd(II)&#8208;based mixed ligated binuclear cages were self&#8208;assembled separately by integrative self&#8208;sorting of a binuclear cage with two different tetranuclear cages. Heteromeric completive self&#8208;sorting of the three homoleptic assemblies resulted exclusively in the simultaneous formation of the highly anisotropic cages.







Abstract
Pd(II)&#8208;based low&#8208;symmetry coordination cages possessing anisotropic cavities are of great interest. The common strategies employed to achieve such cages utilize either more than one type of symmetrical ligands (e.g., Laa, Lbb etc.) or only one type of unsymmetrical ligand (e.g., Lab). To significantly enhance the anisotropy, we have designed two unsymmetrical bidentate ligands i.e., Lab and Lcd, aiming at a low&#8208;symmetry Pd2Lab2Lcd2&#8208;type cage. It was accomplished by high&#8208;fidelity integrative self&#8208;sorting of two different low&#8208;symmetry cages having Pd2Lab4 and Pd4Lcd8&#8208;type architectures (homoleptic complexes of the designed ligands). Structural constraints and geometry complementarity in the ligand design drive the non&#8208;statistical exclusive self&#8208;assembly of the Pd2Lab2Lcd2&#8208;type cage. By taking advantage of the complemental geometries between ligands, a low&#8208;symmetry Pd2Lab2Lcc2&#8208;type cage was also obtained. Heteromeric completive self&#8208;sorting of three homoleptic assemblies (Pd2Lab4, Pd4Lcc8 and Pd4Lcd8&#8208;type cages) into an exclusive mixture of Pd2Lab2Lcd2 and Pd2Lab2Lcc2&#8208;type mixed ligated assemblies was demonstrated through cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regional functionalization molecular design strategy that enables independent control of distinct pivotal parameters through distinct segments of the molecule. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule A&#8208;DBN has not only attained a minimal FWHM of 14&#8197;nm but has also realized nearly 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
Herein, we propose a regional functionalization molecular design strategy that enables independent control of distinct pivotal parameters through different molecule segments. Three novel multiple resonances thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters A&#8208;BN, DA&#8208;BN, and A&#8208;DBN, have been successfully synthesized by integrating highly rigid and three&#8208;dimensional adamantane&#8208;containing spirofluorene units into the MR framework. These molecules form two distinctive functional parts: part&#8197;1 comprises a boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN)&#8208;MR framework with adjacent benzene and fluorene units forming a central luminescent core characterized by an exceptionally rigid planar geometry, allowing for narrow FWHM values; part&#8197;2 includes peripheral mesitylene, benzene, and adamantyl groups, creating a unique three&#8208;dimensional &#8220;umbrella&#8208;like&#8221; conformation to mitigate intermolecular interactions and suppress exciton annihilation. The resulting A&#8208;BN, DA&#8208;BN, and A&#8208;DBN exhibit remarkably narrow FWHM values ranging from 18 to 14&#8197;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. Particularly, OLEDs based on DA&#8208;BN and A&#8208;DBN demonstrate outstanding efficiencies of 35.0&#8201;% and 34.3&#8201;%, with FWHM values as low as 22&#8197;nm and 25&#8197;nm, respectively, effectively accomplishing the integration of high color purity and high device performance.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Catalyzed Amide Synthesis Directly from Alcohol Under Red Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of amides from alcohols typically involves homogeneous transition metal catalysts at high temperatures (130&#8211;140&#8201;&#176;C). We report a COF&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative synthesis of amides under extremely low COF loading and red light irradiation to overcome these challenges. This method successfully produces a wide range of amides, including challenging secondary amides, with good to excellent yields and notable recyclability.







Abstract
The dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines to form amide bonds is typically catalysed by homogeneous transition metal catalysts at high temperatures ranging from 130&#8211;140&#8201;&#176;C. In our pursuit of an efficient and recyclable photocatalyst capable of conducting this transformation at room temperature, we report herein a COF&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative synthesis. The TTT&#8208;DHTD COF was strategically designed to incorporate a high density of functional units, specifically dithiophenedione, to trap photogenerated electrons and effectively facilitate hydrogen atom abstraction reactions. The photoactive TTT&#8208;DHTD COF, synthesized using solvothermal methods showed high crystallinity and moderate surface area, providing an ideal platform for heterogeneous amide synthesis. Light absorption by the COF across the entire visible range, narrow band gap, and valence band position make it well&#8208;suited for the efficient generation of excitons necessary for targeted dehydrogenation. Utilizing red light irradiation and employing extremely low loading of the COF, we have successfully prepared a wide range of amides, including challenging secondary amides, in good to excellent yields.

     alt="Covalent Organic Framework Catalyzed Amide Synthesis Directly from Alcohol Under Red Light Excitation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct synthesis of amides from alcohols typically involves homogeneous transition metal catalysts at high temperatures (130&#8211;140&#8201;&#176;C). We report a COF-mediated dehydrogenative synthesis of amides under extremely low COF loading and red light irradiation to overcome these challenges. This method successfully produces a wide range of amides, including challenging secondary amides, with good to excellent yields and notable recyclability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines to form amide bonds is typically catalysed by homogeneous transition metal catalysts at high temperatures ranging from 130&#8211;140&#8201;&#176;C. In our pursuit of an efficient and recyclable photocatalyst capable of conducting this transformation at room temperature, we report herein a COF-mediated dehydrogenative synthesis. The TTT-DHTD COF was strategically designed to incorporate a high density of functional units, specifically dithiophenedione, to trap photogenerated electrons and effectively facilitate hydrogen atom abstraction reactions. The photoactive TTT-DHTD COF, synthesized using solvothermal methods showed high crystallinity and moderate surface area, providing an ideal platform for heterogeneous amide synthesis. Light absorption by the COF across the entire visible range, narrow band gap, and valence band position make it well-suited for the efficient generation of excitons necessary for targeted dehydrogenation. Utilizing red light irradiation and employing extremely low loading of the COF, we have successfully prepared a wide range of amides, including challenging secondary amides, in good to excellent yields. The substrates&#8217; functional group tolerance, very mild reaction conditions, and the catalyst's significant recyclability represent substantial advancements over prior methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Small Molecule RNA Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA is a central molecule in life, involved in a plethora of biological processes and playing a key role in many diseases. Targeting RNA emerges as a significant endeavor in drug discovery, diverging from conventional protein&#8208;centric approaches to tackle various pathologies. Whilst identifying small molecules that bind to specific RNA regions is the first step, the abundance of non&#8208;functional RNA segments renders many interactions biologically inert. Consequently, small molecule binding does not necessarily meet stringent criteria for clinical translation, calling for solutions to push the field forward. Converting RNA&#8208;binders into RNA&#8208;degraders presents a promising avenue to enhance RNA&#8208;targeting. This mini&#8208;review outlines strategies and exemplars wherein simple small molecule RNA binders are reprogrammed into active degraders through the linkage of functional groups. These approaches encompass mechanisms that induce degradation via endogenous enzymes, termed RIBOTACs, as well as those with functional moieties acting autonomously to degrade RNA. Through this exploration, we aim to offer insights into advancing RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behavior of Nanoconfined Water in Hydrophilic MXene Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid water under nanoscale confinement has attracted intensive attention due to its pivotal role in understanding various phenomena across many scientific fields. MXenes serve an ideal paradigm for investigating the dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water in a hydrophilic environment. Combining deep neural networks and an active learning scheme, here we elucidate the proton&#8208;driven dynamics of water molecules confined between V2CTx sheets using molecular dynamics simulation. Firstly, we have found that the Eigen and Zundel cations can inhibit water&#8208;induced oxidation by adjusting the orientation of water molecules, thus proposing a general antioxidant strategy. Besides, we also identified a hexagonal ice phase with abnormal bonding rules at room temperature, rather than only at ultralow temperatures as other studies reported, and further captured the proton&#8208;induced water phase transition. This highlighted the importance of protons in the maintaining stable crystal phase and phase transition of water. Furthermore, we discussed the conversions of different water structures and water diffusivity with changing proton concentrations in detail. The results provide useful guidance in practical applications of MXenes including developing antioxidant strategies, identifying novel 2D water phases and optimizing energy storage and conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Single&#8208;Atom Coordination Environments in Carbon Nanofibers via Flash Heating for Highly Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of carbon&#8208;supported transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts necessitates precise atomic positioning within the precursor. However, structural collapse during pyrolysis can occlude single atoms, posing significant challenges in controlling both their utilization and coordination environment. Herein, we present a surface atom adsorption&#8208;flash heating (FH) strategy, which ensures that the pre&#8208;designed carbon nanofiber structure remains intact during heating, preventing unforeseen collapse effects and enabling the formation of metal atoms in nano&#8208;environments with either tetra&#8208;nitrogen or penta&#8208;nitrogen coordination at different flash heating temperatures. Theoretical calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that penta&#8208;nitrogen coordinated cobalt atoms (Co&#8208;N5) promote a lower energy pathway for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions compared to the commonly formed Co&#8208;N4 sites. This strategy ensures that Co&#8208;N5 sites are fully exposed on the surface, achieving exceptionally high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33 s&#8208;1) is 47.4 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C under alkaline conditions. The porous, flexible carbon nanofibers significantly enhance zinc&#8208;air battery performance, with a high peak power density (273.8 mW cm&#8208;2), large specific capacity (784.2 mA h g&#8208;1), and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600 h. Additionally, the flexible fiber&#8208;shaped zinc&#8208;air battery can power wearable devices, demonstrating significant potential in flexible electronics applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Enabled Process with Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sustainable Plastic Waste Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present a novel plasma&#8208;enabled strategy for the rapid breakdown of various types of plastic wastes, including mixtures, into high&#8208;value carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. The H2 yield and selectivity achieved through the catalyst&#8208;free plasma&#8208;enabled strategy are 14.2 and 5.9 times higher, respectively, compared to those obtained with conventional thermal pyrolysis. It is noteworthy that this catalyst&#8208;free plasma alone approach yields a significantly higher energy yield of H2 (gH2/kWh) compared to other pyrolysis processes. By coupling plasma pyrolysis with thermal catalytic process, employing of 1 wt.% M/CeO2 atomically dispersed catalysts can further enhance hydrogen production. Specifically, the 1 wt.% Co/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performance throughout the 10 cycles of plastic waste decomposition, achieving the highest H2 yield of 46.7 mmol/gplastic (equivalent to 64.4% of theoretical H2 production) and nearly 100% hydrogen atom recovery efficiency at the 7th cycle. Notably, the H2 yield achieved over the atomically dispersed Fe on CeO2 surface in the integrated plasma&#8208;thermal catalytic process is comparable to that obtained with Fe particles on CeO2 surface (10 wt.%). This innovative and straightforward approach provides a promising and expedient strategy for continuously converting diverse plastic waste streams into high&#8208;value products conducive to a circular plastic economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Brush&#8208;Like Polymeric Gels Enabled Photonic Crystals toward Ultrasensitive Cosolvent Chromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) exhibit dynamic chromism upon trigger by various solvents, showing potential applications in qualitative identification and quantitative analysis of multicomponent solvents. However, distinguishing similar solvents, especially traces of cosolvents, remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of RPCs. To address this, we herein introduce brush&#8208;like&#160;polymeric gels inside photonic crystals, forming a brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) that can trace tiny component changes. In this BPPG system, the acrylate backbones and PEG side&#8208;chains stretch incrementally due to the cosolvency of ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, resulting in highly sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations. With water content varying slightly from 0 to 1 vol%, the reflection wavelength of BPPG can sharply redshift over 30 nm, leading to very noticeable changes in structural color. This enhanced sensitivity makes BPPG suitable for real&#8208;time, in&#8208;situ purity monitoring of absolute ethanol during storage, transportation, and other applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Mediated Structural Interchange Between Pd6 and Pd12 Architectures: Selective Recognition of E&#8208;Stilbene by the Pd6 Architecture and its Photoprotection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic behaviour of metal&#8208;ligand bonding cultivates stimuli&#8208;mediated structural transformations in self&#8208;assembled molecular architectures. The propensity of synthetically designed self&#8208;assembled systems to interchange between higher&#8208;order architectures is increased multi&#8208;fold when the building blocks have higher conformational degrees of freedom. Herein, we report a new ligand, (2,7&#8208;bis(di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one) (L), which, upon self&#8208;assembly with a cis&#8208;[(ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine)Pd(NO3)2] acceptor (M), resulted in the formation of a M6L3 trifacial barrel (C1) in water. Interestingly, during crystallization, a rare M12L6 triangular orthobicupola architecture (C2) was generated along with C1. C2 could also be generated in solution via the application of several stimuli. C1 in aqueous medium could stabilize one trans&#8208;stilbene (tS) or cis&#8208;stilbene (cS) molecule in its cavity, with a selectivity for the former from their mixture. Moreover, C1 acted as an effective host to prevent the otherwise facile photoisomerization of tS to cS inside its hydrophobic cavity under UV irradiation. Conversely, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reverse isomerization of encapsulated cS to encapsulated tS could be achieved readily due to the better stabilization of tS within the cavity of C1 and its transparency to visible light. A multi&#8208;functional system was therefore designed, which at the same time is stimuli&#8208;responsive, shows isomer selectivity, and photo&#8208;protects trans&#8208;stilbene.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dynamic behaviour of metal-ligand bonding cultivates stimuli-mediated structural transformations in self-assembled molecular architectures. The propensity of synthetically designed self-assembled systems to interchange between higher-order architectures is increased multi-fold when the building blocks have higher conformational degrees of freedom. Herein, we report a new ligand, (2,7-bis(di(pyridin-4-yl)amino)-9H-fluoren-9-one) (L), which, upon self-assembly with a cis-[(ethylene-1,2-diamine)Pd(NO3)2] acceptor (M), resulted in the formation of a M6L3 trifacial barrel (C1) in water. Interestingly, during crystallization, a rare M12L6 triangular orthobicupola architecture (C2) was generated along with C1. C2 could also be generated in solution via the application of several stimuli. C1 in aqueous medium could stabilize one trans-stilbene (tS) or cis-stilbene (cS) molecule in its cavity, with a selectivity for the former from their mixture. Moreover, C1 acted as an effective host to prevent the otherwise facile photoisomerization of tS to cS inside its hydrophobic cavity under UV irradiation. Conversely, the visible-light-induced reverse isomerization of encapsulated cS to encapsulated tS could be achieved readily due to the better stabilization of tS within the cavity of C1 and its transparency to visible light. A multi-functional system was therefore designed, which at the same time is stimuli-responsive, shows isomer selectivity, and photo-protects trans-stilbene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclic Multi&#8208;Site Chelation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and moisture&#8208;induced degradation significantly impede the development of highly efficient and stable inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which require high&#8208;quality perovskite bulk. In this research, we mitigate these challenges by integrating thermally stable perovskite layers with Lewis base covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The ordered pore structure and surface binding groups of COFs facilitate cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions, enhancing the perovskite quality across both its bulk and grain boundaries. This process not only reduces defects but also promotes improved energy alignment through n&#8208;type doping at the surface. The inclusion of COF dopants in p&#8208;i&#8208;n devices achieves power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.64% (certified 24.94%) for a 0.0748&#8208;cm2 device and 23.49% for a 1&#8208;cm2 device. Remarkably, these devices retain 81% of their initial PCE after 978 hours of accelerated aging at 85&#730;C, demonstrating remarkable durability. Additionally, COF&#8208;doped devices demonstrate excellent stability under illumination and in moist conditions, even without encapsulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimerized M&#8208;series Acceptors with Low Diffusion Coefficients for Efficient and Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the simplest oligomeric acceptors, dimerized acceptors (DAs) are easier to synthesize, and more importantly, they can retain good intermolecular interaction and photovoltaic properties of their parent small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs). Nevertheless, currently most efficient DAs are derived from banana&#8208;shaped acceptors and they might suffer from inferior device stability with high diffusion coefficients. Herein, we design and synthesize two planar DAs (DMT&#8208;FH and DMT&#8208;HF) by bridging two linear&#8208;shaped M&#8208;series SMAs with a thiophene unit. The effects of fluorination position on the diffusion coefficients, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and stability of the DAs are systematically studied. Our results suggest that DMT&#8208;HF with fluorination on the ending indanone groups shows enhanced intermolecular interactions, improved PCE and stability compared with the counterpart (DMT&#8208;FH) with fluorination on the central indanone groups. Further optimization on the DMT&#8208;HF&#8208;based devices yields an outstanding PCE of 17.17%, which is the highest among all linear&#8208;shaped SMA&#8208;based DAs. Notably, with the low diffusion coefficient (3.36&#215;10&#8208;24 cm2 s&#8208;1) of DMT&#8208;HF, the resulting device retains over 93% of the initial PCE after 5000 h of continuous heating at 85 oC, suggesting its excellent thermal stability. The results highlight the importance of intermolecular interaction and fluorination for achieving efficient and stable polymer solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Six&#8208;Membered Ring Directed Assembly of a Zirconium Zeolitic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of zirconium MOFs with zeolite net is quite challenging due to the high connectivity of Zr6 clusters, which is far from tetrahedral connection, a requisite for zeolite net. In this work, we demonstrate a six&#8208;membered ring (6MR) strategy through mimicking of mineral zeolites with mixed ditopic and tritopic carboxylate linkers. With this strategy, the ditopic linker cross&#8208;links Zr6 clusters to form 4&#8208;connected zeolite&#8208;like nets, while the tritopic one is used to direct the formation of 6MR and simultaneously consumes extra coordination sites on the cluster. The feasibility of this strategy is shown by one zeolitic metal&#8208;organic framework (NNM&#8208;5) and this strategy has also led to the synthesis of the other dia&#8208;type zirconium MOF (NNM&#8208;6). Interestingly, as the tritopic linker not only directs the formation of 6&#8208;MR but also partitions 6&#8208;MR into small segments, NNM&#8208;5 with SOD topology shows a structural feature of small aperture and big cage, which has led to efficient separation of hexane isomers. With both exceptionally high n&#8208;hexane uptake (65.9 cm3&#183;g&#8208;1) and size&#8208;exclusion selectivity, an exceptional separation capability is verified by breakthrough experiments. Calculation results demonstrate that the large difference of diffusion energy barrier due to the small aperture accounts for the underlying separation mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Group 14/16 adamantane&#8208;type hybrid clusters of the type [(RT)4E6] (T&#160;=&#160;group 14 element, E&#160;=&#160;group 16 element, R&#160;=&#160;organic group) have been reported to emit white&#8208;light when irradiated in an amorphous state with a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) infrared laser diode.

         <title>Polaritonic Chemistry Enabled by Non&#8208;Local Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational strong coupling can modify chemical reaction pathways in unconventional ways. Thus far, Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities formed by pairs of facing mirrors have been mostly utilized to achieve vibrational strong coupling. In this study, we demonstrate the application of non&#8208;local metasurfaces that can sustain surface lattice resonances, enabling chemical reactions under vibrational strong coupling. We show that the solvolysis kinetics of para&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate can be accelerated by a factor of 2.7 by strong coupling to the&#160;carbonyl bond of the solvent and the solute with a surface lattice resonance. Our work introduces a new platform to investigate polaritonic chemical reactions. In contrast to Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities, metasurfaces define open optical cavities with single surfaces, which removes alignment hurdles, facilitating polaritonic chemistry across large areas.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thiele&#8217;s Hydrocarbons (THs) featuring a 9,10&#8208;anthrylene core with switchable geometric and electronic configurations offer exciting possibilities in advanced functional materials. Despite significant advances in main group&#8208;based diradicaloids in contemporary chemistry, main group THs containing an anthrylene cores have remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of straightforward synthetic strategies and the inherent high reactivity of these species. In this study, we utilize an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine synthon to demonstrate, for the first time, a facile and high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy for robust P&#8208;functionalized overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) within the TH family. These OCEs feature a non&#8208;symmetric environment, incorporating (thio)xanthyl and phosphaalkene termini. We systematically probe the electronic structures of these derivatives to illustrate the impact of the isolobal phosphaalkene motif on the quinoidal/diradicaloid character. Notably, the compounds exhibit dynamic redox behavior, leading to orthogonally twisted conformational changes upon oxidation, with a kinetically locked redox&#8208;couple.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide&#8208;Ring Gel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention are slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gel networks (dt&#8208;SRGs). In this study, a photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal&#8208;templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to MIPs that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt&#8208;SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt&#8208;SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics. In addition, the macroscopic properties of dt&#8208;SRGs could be altered by "locking" ring mobility in the structure through remetalation, highlighting the impact of the mobility of the crosslinks.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylic boronates. Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&gt;150&#8197;examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol&#8197;A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Realization of Long&#8208;Life Proton Battery by Layer Intercalatable Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new layer intercalatable electrolyte with effective water molecules bound was designed for proton batteries, achieving the low hydrogen production reaction potential and the promoted transfer kinetics of protons. An ultra&#8208;long stability for 2&#8197;months at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C of full proton batteries was therefore delivered.







Abstract
Proton batteries have attracted increasing interests because of their potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage with high safety and great low&#8208;temperature performances. However, their development is significantly retarded by electrolyte design due to free water corrosion. Herein, we report a layer intercalatable electrolyte (LIE) by introducing trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into traditional acidic electrolyte. Different from conventional role in batteries, the presence of TMP intriguingly achieves co&#8208;intercalation of solvent molecules into the interlayer of anode materials, enabling a new working mechanism for proton reactions. The electrode corrosion was also strongly retarded with expanded electrochemical stability window. The half&#8208;cell therefore showed an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability with 91.0&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 5000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the assembled full batteries can even deliver an ultra&#8208;long lifetime with a capacity retention of 74.9&#8201;% for 2&#8197;months running at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides new opportunities for electrolyte design of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Lattice Strain Engineering Boosts CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for preparing Cu catalyst with varying lattice tensile strain but without introducing additional components was proposed and confirmed to be effectively for inhibiting the dipole&#8211;dipole repulsion between *CO species and enhancing the adsorption of the *OH species, simultaneously. The CuTPA catalyst with large tensile strain achieves a high FEC2+ of 90.9&#8201;% and a partial current density of 486.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in CO2RR with excellent stability.







Abstract
Regulating the binding effect between the surface of an electrode material and reaction intermediates is essential in highly efficient CO2 electro&#8208;reduction to produce high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) compounds. Theoretical study reveals that lattice tensile strain in single&#8208;component Cu catalysts can reduce the dipole&#8211;dipole repulsion between *CO intermediates and promotes *OH adsorption, and the high *CO and *OH coverage decreases the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling. In this work, Cu catalysts with varying lattice tensile strain were fabricated by electro&#8208;reducing CuO precursors with different crystallinity, without adding any extra components. The as&#8208;prepared single&#8208;component Cu catalysts were used for CO2 electro&#8208;reduction, and it is discovered that the lattice tensile strain in Cu could enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products effectively. Especially, the as&#8208;prepared CuTPA catalyst with high lattice tensile strain achieves a FEC2+ of 90.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.25&#8197;V vs. RHE with a partial current density of 486.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Tandem Proton Transfer in Carboxylated Supramolecular Polymer for Highly Efficient Overall Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxyl&#8208;enriched supramolecular polymer (perylene tetracarboxylic acid&#8212;PTCA) has been elaborately prepared. The efficient tandem proton transfer process remarkably facilitates 2e&#8722; ORR to synthesize H2O2 and in the meanwhile promotes 4e&#8722; WOR to evolve O2. As expected, the catalyst realizes outstanding H2O2 yield in air and even argon atmospheres without any sacrificial reagents.







Abstract
Proton supply is as critical as O2 activation for artificial photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR). However, proton release via water dissociation is frequently hindered because of the sluggish water oxidation reaction (WOR), extremely limiting the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production. To tackle this challenge, carboxyl&#8208;enriched supramolecular polymer (perylene tetracarboxylic acid&#8212;PTCA) is elaborately prepared by molecular self&#8208;assembly for overall photosynthesis of H2O2. Interestingly, the interconversion between carboxyl as Br&#248;nsted acid and its conjugated base realizes rapid proton circulation. Through this efficient tandem proton transfer process, the spatial effect of photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reaction is greatly enhanced with reduced reaction barrier. This significantly facilitates 2e&#8722; photocatalytic ORR to synthesize H2O2 and in the meanwhile promotes 4e&#8722; photocatalytic WOR to evolve O2. Consequently, the as&#8208;developed PTCA exhibits a remarkable H2O2 yield of 185.6&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water and air atmosphere under visible light illumination. More impressively, an appreciable H2O2 yield of 78.6&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1 can be well maintained in an anaerobic system owing to in situ O2 generation by 4e&#8722; photocatalytic WOR. Our study presents a novel concept for artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 via constructing efficient proton transfer pathway to enable rapid proton circulation.

     alt="Tandem Proton Transfer in Carboxylated Supramolecular Polymer for Highly Efficient Overall Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carboxyl-enriched supramolecular polymer (perylene tetracarboxylic acid&#8212;PTCA) has been elaborately prepared. The efficient tandem proton transfer process remarkably facilitates 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR to synthesize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and in the meanwhile promotes 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; WOR to evolve O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As expected, the catalyst realizes outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield in air and even argon atmospheres without any sacrificial reagents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton supply is as critical as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation for artificial photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) via two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR). However, proton release via water dissociation is frequently hindered because of the sluggish water oxidation reaction (WOR), extremely limiting the efficiency of photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. To tackle this challenge, carboxyl-enriched supramolecular polymer (perylene tetracarboxylic acid&#8212;PTCA) is elaborately prepared by molecular self-assembly for overall photosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Interestingly, the interconversion between carboxyl as Br&#248;nsted acid and its conjugated base realizes rapid proton circulation. Through this efficient tandem proton transfer process, the spatial effect of photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reaction is greatly enhanced with reduced reaction barrier. This significantly facilitates 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; photocatalytic ORR to synthesize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and in the meanwhile promotes 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; photocatalytic WOR to evolve O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Consequently, the as-developed PTCA exhibits a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 185.6&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in pure water and air atmosphere under visible light illumination.

         <title>Tailoring Catalysis of Encapsulated Platinum Nanoparticles by Pore Wall Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pt nanoparticles are incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with engineered thioether groups on the pore walls, enabling tailored Pt electronic states and accessible Pt sites. Significantly, the optimized Pt@COF&#8208;S0.5 with electron&#8208;deficient Pt NPs in ~1&#8197;nm sizes and high accessible Pt sites exhibit excellent activity and almost absolute selectivity to targeted p&#8208;chloroaniline in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene.







Abstract
While supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) have shown significant promise in heterogeneous catalysis, precise control over their interaction with the support, which profoundly impacts their catalytic performance, remains a significant challenge. In this study, Pt NPs are incorporated into thioether&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (denoted COF&#8208;Sx), enabling precise control over the size and electronic state of Pt NPs by adjusting the thioether density dangling on the COF pore walls. Notably, the resulting Pt@COF&#8208;Sx demonstrate exceptional selectivity (&gt; 99&#8201;%) in catalytic hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene to p&#8208;chloroaniline, in sharp contrast to the poor selectivity of Pt NPs embedded in thioether&#8208;free COFs. Furthermore, the conversion over Pt@COF&#8208;Sx exhibits a volcano&#8208;type curve as the thioether density increases, due to the corresponding change of accessible Pt sites. This work provides an effective approach to regulating the catalysis of metal NPs via their microenvironment modulation, with the aid of rational design and precise tailoring of support structure.

         <title>Structural Fine&#8208;Tuning to Achieve Highly Fluorescent Organic and Water&#8208;Soluble Thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical donor&#8208;thiazolothiazole&#8208;acceptor systems exhibit high solution state fluorescence quantum yield in polar organic solvents and water via intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT). Computational studies reveal that; i) thiazolothiazole bridge is non&#8208;innocent and can act as a donor or acceptor, and ii) the ICT is best captured by a fragment&#8208;based approach in which the change in charges between the excited and ground state is examined.







Abstract
Fluorescent molecular systems are important for various applications such as sensing of analytes, probes for biologically relevant processes and as optoelectronic materials. Achieving high fluorescence quantum yield across the spectrum of solvent polarity and in solid&#8208;state is challenging in molecular materials. Herein, we present a strategy to achieve strongly fluorescent molecular materials based on weak intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) in a family of unsymmetrical donor&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole&#8208;acceptor systems (both neutral and cationic). Detailed photophysical studies reveal that the delicate balance between the donor and acceptor result in high solution&#8208;state fluorescence quantum yield (&gt;80&#8201;%) in both polar protic and apolar solvents. Quantum chemical computations uncover a hitherto unappreciated insight that the extent of ICT is aptly represented by the change in Mulliken charges between the ground and excited state for different fragments rather than the classical approach of monitoring the change in dipole moment for the entire molecule. This insight rationalizes the observed photophysical properties and can have implications in the design of tuneable donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor systems.

         <title>Aggregation of One&#8208;Dimensional Wires: The Case of Long Oligoynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible aggregation of an oligoyne with 16 triple bonds is described. The association phenomenon occurs in spite of the flexibility and the minimal &#960; surface of the oligoyne.







Abstract
We show an unexpected aggregation phenomenon of a long oligoyne (Py[16]) with 16 contiguous triple bonds and endcapped with bulky 3,5&#8208;bi(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)pyridine groups. Aggregation of 1D &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligoyne chains is rare given the minimal &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular interactions as well as its flexibility that works against self&#8208;assembly. In dilute solutions, the reversible aggregation of Py[16] initiates at low temperature in the range of 140&#8211;180&#8197;K, and is not observed for shorter oligoynes in this series. Cryogenic UV/Vis electronic absorption spectra and vibrational Raman spectra with different laser wavelength lines tuning from in&#8208;resonance to off&#8208;resonance conditions have been used to extract the vibrational features characterizing the monomer and aggregate species. Theoretical calculations complement the spectroscopic findings.

         <title>Formal High&#8208;Order Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Cycloheptatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, enabling the efficient generation of gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates.







Abstract
The design of various cycloaddition/annulation processes is one of the most intriguing challenges in the development of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropane chemistry. In this work, a new class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed and reported, to fill a significant gap in the chemistry of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, which makes it possible to efficiently generate gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic complexes or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates starting from D&#8211;A cyclopropanes, while other Lewis acids are ineffective and non&#8208;selective. New examples of formal [6+2]&#8208;, [6+3]&#8208;, [6+4]&#8208;, [6+1]&#8208;, and [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation reactions with cycloheptatrienes along with more complex processes were discovered. Cycloheptatriene itself can also successfully act as a hydride anion donor, which allows the ionic hydrogenation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes to be performed under mild conditions. As a result, a number of efficient and highly diastereoselective protocols for the synthesis of seven&#8208;membered carbocycles has been developed.

         <title>Anionic Chemistry Modulation Enabled Environmental Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc Batteries: The Case of Carbonate Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes is presented, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property.







Abstract
Anionic chemistry modulation represents a promising avenue to enhance the electrochemical performance and unlock versatile applications in cutting&#8208;edge energy storage devices. Herein, we propose a methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property. The elaborately designed batteries with an air&#8208;switch demonstrate rapid self&#8208;recharging capabilities, recovering over 80&#8201;% of the electrochemical full charging capacity within a remarkably short timeframe of 1&#8197;hour and achieving a cumulative self&#8208;charging capacity of 5&#8197;Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1. The aqueous self&#8208;charging battery strategy induced by carbonate anion, as proposed in this study, holds the potential for extending to various anionic systems, including seawater&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion batteries. This work offers a universal framework for advancing next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;functional power sources.

         <title>Front Cover: Mutualistic Synthesis from Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mutualistic synthesis concept via orthogonal chemical reactions (disulfide and hydrazone exchange) is reported by Jianwei Li et&#8197;al. in this Communication (e202412020). The cover picture describes a &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenane that is formed by a tetrameric disulfide macrocycle and a linear hydrazone. Both species were formed as minor products when the reactions occurred independently, while the mutualistic co&#8208;amplification led to their formation in higher amounts.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Piperidines Enabled by Boronyl Radical&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular (4+2) cycloaddition reaction of azetidines with alkenes has been developed for efficient synthesis of 3,4,5&#8208;polysubstituted piperidines, which contain the medicinally relevant key heterocyclic motif and are not readily accessible by other methods. The reaction features high modularity, atom economy, simple operation, inexpensive non&#8208;metallic catalysts and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Piperidines are widely present in small molecule drugs and natural products. Despite many methods have been developed for their synthesis, new approaches to polysubstituted piperidines are highly desirable. This work presents a radical (4+2) cycloaddition reaction for synthesis of piperidines featuring dense substituents at 3,4,5&#8208;positions that are not readily accessible by known methods. Using commercially available diboron(4) compounds and 4&#8208;phenylpyridine as the catalyst precursors, the boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition between 3&#8208;aroyl azetidines and various alkenes, including previously unreactive 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted alkenes, has delivered the polysubstituted piperidines in generally high yield and diastereoselectivity. The reaction also features high modularity, atom economy, broad substrate scope, metal&#8208;free conditions, simple catalysts and operation. The utilization of the products has been demonstrated by selective transformations. A plausible mechanism, with the ring&#8208;opening of azetidine as the rate&#8208;limiting step, has been proposed based on the experimental and computational results.

         <title>Deuteration as a General Strategy to Enhance Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotope effects have been explored for decades and now find entrance into photopharmacology. Simple deuteration of azobenzene photoswitches improves photoswitching quantum yield and macroscopic switching kinetics. This finding is translated to the faster optical control of big potassium ion channels and G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, important players for synaptic transmission and neural communication.







Abstract
Chemical photoswitches have become a widely used approach for the remote control of biological functions with spatiotemporal precision. Several molecular scaffolds have been implemented to improve photoswitch characteristics, ranging from the nature of the photoswitch itself (e.g. azobenzenes, dithienylethenes, hemithioindigo) to fine&#8208;tuning of aromatic units and substituents. Herein, we present deuterated azobenzene photoswitches as a general means of enhancing the performance of photopharmacological molecules. Deuteration can improve azobenzene performance in terms of light sensitivity (higher molar extinction coefficient), photoswitch efficiency (higher photoisomerization quantum yield), and photoswitch kinetics (faster macroscopic rate of photoisomerization) with minimal alteration to the underlying structure of the photopharmacological ligand. We report synthesized deuterated azobenzene&#8208;based ligands for the optimized optical control of ion channel and G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) function in live cells, setting the stage for the straightforward, widespread adoption of this approach.

         <title>Fully Optical Control of Polarization Current Direction in a Cyanide&#8208;Bridged Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarization switching of the [Fe2Co] with photocurrent output was realized via reversible light&#8208;induced ETCST. Routing the photocurrent through an integrator yields a stable square wave signal, effectively mimicking the switching of a ferroelectric memory from &#8220;0&#8221; to &#8220;1&#8221;. Specific crystal cells are exposed to 532&#8197;nm light for writing process, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
As a remote and non&#8208;contact stimulus, light offers the potential for manipulating the polarization of ferroelectric materials without physical contact. However, in current research, the non&#8208;contact write&#8208;read (erase) process lacks direct observation through the stable current as output signal. To address this limitation, we investigated the photoinduced polarization switching capabilities of the cyanide&#8208;bridged compound [Fe2Co] using visible light, leading to the achievement of rewritable polarization. By subjecting [Fe2Co] crystals to alternating irradiation with 785&#8197;nm and 532&#8197;nm light, the polarization changes exhibited a distinct square wave pattern, confirming the reliability of the writing and erasing processes. Initialization involved exposing specific crystal units to 532&#8197;nm light for storing &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;0&#8221; information, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785&#8197;nm light, resulting in brief current pulses for &#8220;1&#8221; states and no current signal for &#8220;0&#8221; states. This research unveils new possibilities for optical storage systems, paving the way for efficient and rewritable data storage and retrieval technologies, such as the next&#8208;generation memories.

Specific crystal cells are exposed to 532&#8197;nm light for writing process, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785&#8197;nm light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a remote and non-contact stimulus, light offers the potential for manipulating the polarization of ferroelectric materials without physical contact. However, in current research, the non-contact write-read (erase) process lacks direct observation through the stable current as output signal. To address this limitation, we investigated the photoinduced polarization switching capabilities of the cyanide-bridged compound [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co] using visible light, leading to the achievement of rewritable polarization. By subjecting [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co] crystals to alternating irradiation with 785&#8197;nm and 532&#8197;nm light, the polarization changes exhibited a distinct square wave pattern, confirming the reliability of the writing and erasing processes. Initialization involved exposing specific crystal units to 532&#8197;nm light for storing &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;0&#8221; information, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785&#8197;nm light, resulting in brief current pulses for &#8220;1&#8221; states and no current signal for &#8220;0&#8221; states. This research unveils new possibilities for optical storage systems, paving the way for efficient and rewritable data storage and retrieval technologies, such as the next-generation memories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Modular Synthesis of Sulfondiimidoyl Fluorides and their Application to Sulfondiimidamide and Sulfondiimine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining organometallic reagents with sulfurdiimide reagents, simple electrophiles, and then an electrophilic fluorine reagent provides a modular and scalable synthesis of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides. For the first time it is possible to prepare these unique functional groups with broad flexibility at the carbon and both imidic nitrogen atoms. SuFEx reactivity using amines and organolithium reagents is demonstrated, leading to sulfondiimidamide and sulfondiimine products.







Abstract
A modular synthesis of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides&#8212;the double aza&#8208;analogues of sulfonyl fluorides&#8212;allowing variation of the carbon and both nitrogen&#8208;substituents is reported. The chemistry uses readily available organometallic reagents, commercial sulfinylamines, simple electrophiles, and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI), as the starting materials. The reactions are broad in scope, efficient, and scalable. We show that the sulfondiimidoyl fluoride products can be combined with amines to provide sulfondiimidamides, and with organolithium reagents to provide sulfondiimines, and that reactivity in these transformations can be modulated by variation of the N&#8208;substituents.

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of isolated states and J&#8208;aggregate states in a single&#8208;phosphor&#8208;doped polymeric system has enabled hierarchical dual&#8208;mode organic persistent luminescence to be achieved. The doped polymeric system generates a two&#8208;step temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color with excitation&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsiveness.







Abstract
The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays, and data&#8208;storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single&#8208;phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, by doping 9H&#8208;pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, a hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission system is developed, which exhibits color&#8208;tunable afterglow due to excitation&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and humidity&#8208;dependence. Notably, the coexistence of the isolated state and J&#8208;aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides an excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color, but also leads to a hierarchical temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink&#8208;writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.

         <title>Enhancing Effect of Fullerene Guest and Counterion on the Structural Stability and Electrical Conductivity of Octahedral Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of octahedral metallo&#8208;cages and cage&#8208;fullerene (C60 and C70) complexes have been constructed to explore electrical conductivity at both the single&#8208;molecule level and aggregated bulk state. Both the counterions and fullerenes effectively tune the electronic structures and packing density of the metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, and facilitate efficient charge transfer between the cage hosts and fullerenes, resulting in a notable one order of magnitude increase in the electrical conductivity of the aggregated state.







Abstract
Metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages have garnered tremendous attention for their diverse yet molecular&#8208;level precision structures. However, the physical properties of these supramolecular ensembles, which are of potential significance in molecular electronics, remain largely unexplored. We herein constructed a series of octahedral metallo&#8208;cages and cage&#8208;fullerene complexes with notably enhanced structural stability. As such, we could systematically evaluate the electrical conductivity of these ensembles at both the single&#8208;molecule level and aggregated bulk state (as well&#8208;defined films). Our findings reveal that counteranions and fullerene guests play a pivotal role in determining the electrical conductivity of the aggregated state, while such effects are less significant for single&#8208;molecule conductance. Both the counteranions and fullerenes effectively tune the electronic structures and packing density of metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, and facilitate efficient charge transfer between the cage hosts and fullerenes, resulting in a notable one order of magnitude increase in the electrical conductivity of the aggregated state.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of CORR from Acetate to Ethanol via Tailoring the Thermodynamic Activity of Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two&#8208;step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5% and 55.1%, respectively, at a current density of 700 mA cm&#8208;2. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942 mA cm&#8208;2 at 2000 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Hydrazide&#8208;Based Nanochannels: Efficient Water Translocation and Salt Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature has ingeniously developed specialized water transporters that effectively reject ions, including protons, while transporting water across membranes. These natural water channels, known as aquaporins (AQPs), have inspired the creation of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). However, replicating superfast water transport with synthetic molecular structures that exclude salts and protons is a challenging task. This endeavor demands the coexistence of a suitable water&#8208;binding site and a selective filter for precise water transportation. Here, we present small&#8208;molecule hydrazides 1b&#8722;1d that self&#8208;assemble into a rosette&#8208;type nanochannel assembly through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, and selectively transport water molecules across lipid bilayer membranes. The experimental analysis demonstrates notable permeability rates for the 1c derivative, enabling approximately 3.18 &#215; 108 water molecules to traverse the channel per second. This permeability rate is about one order of magnitude lower than that of AQPs. Of particular significance, the 1c ensures exclusive passage of water molecules while effectively blocking salts and protons. MD simulation studies confirmed the stability and water transport properties of the water channel assembly inside the bilayer membranes at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Careful analysis of the crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8 = C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with sodium on sodium chloride showed them to contain the long sought&#8208;after dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 (1) that forms alongside the previously characterized alanediyl:AlAriPr8. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 1 revealed a nearly planar, trans&#8208;bent C(ipso)AlAlC(ipso) core with an Al&#8211;Al distance of 2.648(2) &#197;. The molecular and electronic structure of 1 are consistent with a Al&#8211;Al double dative interaction augmented with diradical character and stabilized by dispersion interactions. Density functional theory calculations showed that the reactivity of:AlAriPr8 with dihydrogen involves 1, not:AlAriPr8, as the reactive species. In contrast, the reaction of:AlAriPr8 with ethylene gave two products, the 1,4&#8208;dialuminacyclohexane AriPr8Al(C2H4)2AlAriPr8 (2) and the aluminacyclopentane AriPr8Al(C4H8) (3), that can both form from the aluminacyclopropane intermediate AriPr8Al(C2H4). Although the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1 with two equivalents of ethylene was also calculated to be exergonic, it is likely to be kinetically blocked by the numerous isopropyl substituents surrounding the Al&#8211;Al bond. Attempts to fine&#8208;tune the steric bulk of the terphenyl ligand to allow stronger Al&#8211;Al bonding were unsuccessful, leading to the isolation of the sodium salt of a cyclotrialuminene, Na2[AlAriPr6]3 (4), instead of AriPr6AlAlAriPr6.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Spectroelectrochemistry Unravels the Mechanism of CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction by an Fe Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron porphyrins are molecular catalysts recognized for their ability to electrochemically and photochemically reduce carbon dioxide (CO2). The main reduction product is carbon monoxide (CO). CO holds significant industrial importance as it serves as a precursor for various valuable chemical products containing either a single carbon atom (C1), like methanol or methane, or multiple carbon atoms (Cn), such as ethanol or ethylene. Despite the long&#8208;established efficiency of these catalysts, optimizing their catalytic activity and stability and comprehending the intricate reaction mechanisms remain a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO using an iron porphyrin substituted with four trimethylammonium groups in the para position [(pTMA)FeIII&#8208;Cl]4+. By employing infrared and UV&#8208;Visible spectroelectrochemistry, changes in the electronic structure and coordination environment of the iron center can be observed in real&#8208;time as the electrochemical potential is adjusted, offering new insights into the reaction mechanisms. Catalytic species were identified, and evidence of a secondary reaction pathway was uncovered, potentially prompting a re&#8208;evaluation of the nature of the catalytically active species.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Synthesis of Thiosilvatins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiosilvatins are a family of biologically active sulfenylated diketopiperazine natural products. The first members were reported over 40 years ago, but total synthesis of a thiosilvatin has remained elusive. Here, we describe the first, collective, synthesis of the parent epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8211;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin and ten related thiosilvatins. Several of the targets are structurally revised. A catalytic asymmetric sulfenylation of triketopiperazines efficiently controls absolute configuration at the thioaminal units. Further synthetic highlights include a diastereoconvergent installation of the requisite&#160;cis&#8208;orientation of the sulfur atoms and a tandem epidisulfide formation/O&#8208;prenylation under mild Mitsunobu conditions. The described methods for late&#8208;stage diversification of sensitive bis(methylthio)diketopiperazines offer a blueprint for systematically exploring this interesting 3D&#8208;pharmacophore in stereochemically pure form.</dc:description>

         <title>Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Motional properties of proteins govern recognition, catalysis, and regulation. The dynamics of tightly interacting residues can form intramolecular dynamic networks, dependencies fine&#8208;tuned by evolution to optimize a plethora of functional aspects. The constructive interaction of residues from different proteins to assemble intermolecular dynamic networks is a similarly likely case but has escaped thorough experimental assessment due to interfering association/dissociation dynamics. Here, we use fast&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state 15N R1&#961; NMR relaxation dispersion aided by molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations to mechanistically assess the hierarchy of individual &#181;s timescale motions arising from a crystal&#8208;crystal contact, in the absence of translational motion. In contrast to the monomer, where particular mutations entail isolated perturbations, specific intermolecular interactions couple the motional properties between distant residues in the same protein. The mechanistic insights obtained from this conceptual work may improve our understanding on how intramolecular allostery can be tuned by intermolecular interactions via assembly of dynamic networks from previously isolated elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Leverage Relationship in Nitrogen Fixation Through Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), a leverage relationship exists between NH3&#8208;producing activity and selectivity because of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which means that high activity with strong protons adsorption causes low product selectivity. Herein, we design a novel metal&#8208;organic hydrogen bonding framework (MOHBF) material to modulate this leverage relationship by a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated proton transfer pathway. The MOHBF material was composited with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form a Ni&#8208;N2O2 molecular catalyst (Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO). The unique structure of O atoms in Ni&#8208;O&#8208;C and N&#8208;O&#8208;H could form hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules to interfere with protons being directly adsorbed onto Ni active sites, thus regulating the proton transfer mechanism and slowing the HER kinetics, thereby modulating the leverage relationship. Moreover, this catalyst has abundant Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom sites enriched with Ni&#8208;N/O coordination, conducive to the adsorption and activation of N2. The Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO exhibits simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity of NH3 production with a maximum NH3 yield rate of 209.7 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 45.7%, outperforming other reported single&#8208;atom NRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8211;O Allyl Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with great regiocontrol in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8211;O bond activation is observed at room temperature. The synthetic value of these densely functionalized silicon&#8208;containing building blocks is demonstrated in a series of chemoselective transformations, including a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement for the construction of an &#945;&#8208;chiral silane.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Multiple Sites Boosts Anti&#8208;Poisoning Hydrogen Electrooxidation Reaction with Ultrasmall (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V Ternary Intermetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;contracted Pt&#8722;Rh sites in sub&#8208;3&#8197;nm intermetallics are highly active in the oxidation of hydrogen and have a good poisoning tolerance thanks to the presence of compressive strained Pt and dual&#8208;functional effects.







Abstract
Promoting the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity and poisoning tolerance of electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cell. However, it is severely hindered by the scaling relations among different intermediates. Herein, lattice&#8208;contracted Pt&#8722;Rh in ultrasmall ternary L12&#8208;(Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V intermetallic nanoparticles (~2.2&#8197;nm) were fabricated to promote the HOR performances through an oxides self&#8208;confined growth strategy. The prepared (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V displayed 5.5/3.7&#8197;times promotion in HOR mass/specific activity than Pt/C in pure H2 and dramatically limited activity attenuation in 1000&#8197;ppm CO/H2 mixture. In situ Raman spectra tracked the superior anti&#8208;CO* capability as a result of compressive strained Pt, and the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing species was promoted due to the dual&#8208;functional effect. Further assisted by density functional theory calculations, both the adsorption of H* and CO* on (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V were reduced compared with that of Pt due to lattice contraction, while the adsorption of OH* was enhanced by introducing oxyphilic Rh sites. This work provides an effective tactic to stimulate the electrocatalytic performances by optimizing the adsorption of different intermediates severally.

         <title>Improving Miscibility of Polymer Donor and Polymer Acceptor by Reducing Chain Entanglement for Realizing 18.64&#8201;% Efficiency All Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer acceptors with BDD units have been developed with large internal space and pronounced steric hindrance, mitigating the entanglements between adjacent polymer chains and increasing the miscibility of polymer donor and polymer acceptor, thus achieving high efficiencies of 17.50&#8201;% and 18.64&#8201;% in binary and ternary blend all&#8208;polymer solar cells.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells have experienced rapid development in recent years by the emergence of polymerized small molecular acceptors (PSMAs). However, the strong chain entanglements of polymer donors (PDs) and polymer acceptors (PAs) decrease the miscibility of the resulting polymer mixtures, making it challenging to optimize the blend morphology. Herein, we designed three PAs, namely PBTPICm&#8208;BDD, PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD, by smartly using a BDD unit as the polymerized unit to copolymerize with different Y&#8208;typed non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs), thus achieving a certain degree of distortion and giving the polymer system enough internal space to reduce the entanglements of the polymer chains. Such effects increase the chances of the PD being interspersed into the acceptor material, which improve the solubility between the PD and PA. The PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD displayed better miscibility with PBQx&#8208;TCl, leading to a well optimized morphology. As a result, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.50&#8201;% and 17.17&#8201;% were achieved for PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPICF&#8208;BDD devices, respectively. With the addition of PYFT&#8208;o as the third component into PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD blend to further extend the absorption spectral coverage and finely tune microstructures of the blend morphology, a remarkable PCE of 18.64&#8201;% was realized finally.

         <title>High Photoinitiating Efficiency of Benzothioxanthene&#8208;Based Oxime Esters in Photopolymerization via Photocleavage and/or Single Electron Transfer under Visible Light and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Good light absorption property facilitates an efficient photopolymerization reaction. In this work, six different benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters (BTXIOXEs) demonstrate their efficient photoinitiating performances under visible light and sunlight, following photocleavage and/or single electron transfer processes, which offers a strategy for developing novel oxime ester&#8208;based photoinitiators under visible light and sunlight.







Abstract
In this work, six benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were employed as photoinitiators for photopolymerization under visible light (LED) and sunlight. Their abilities to behave as Type&#8197;I photoinitiators by mean of a photocleavage mechanism of oxime esters but also in multicomponent photoinitiating systems with an iodonium salt (through an electron transfer mechanism) were both explored with the different structures. Due to their broad absorption spectra tailing up 600&#8197;nm, photoinitiating properties of the benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were systematically tested under excitation with low&#8208;intensity LED light at wavelengths of 405&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm. Additionally, parallel to the polymerization tests done under artificial light, the different benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were also investigated as solar photoinitiators and displayed a high reactivity in France (Western Europe) even in winter conditions. For the best candidates i.e. the most reactive structures, direct laser write experiments were carried out, evidencing the interest of these structures.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structures of Anchor Sites to Achieve Zero&#8208;Valence Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Advanced Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>

Doping boron atoms with lower electronegativity into g&#8208;C3N4 can substantially change the local electronic structures at metal anchor sites to achieve zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high hydrogenation activity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have recently become highly attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions owing to their remarkably high selectivity. However, compared to their nanoparticle counterparts, atomically dispersed metal atoms in SACs often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. Here, by theoretical calculations, we show that tuning the local electronic structures of metal anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping B atoms (BCN) with relatively lower electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high activity in H2 activation. The precise synthesis of Pd SACs on BCN supports with varied B contents substantiated the theoretical prediction. A zero&#8208;valence Pd1/BCN SAC was achieved on a BCN support with a relatively low B content. It exhibited much higher stability in a H2 reducing environment, and more strikingly, a hydrogenation activity, approximately 10 and 34&#8197;times greater than those high&#8208;valence Pd1/g&#8208;C3N4 and Pd1/BCN with a high B content, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently become highly attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions owing to their remarkably high selectivity. However, compared to their nanoparticle counterparts, atomically dispersed metal atoms in SACs often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. Here, by theoretical calculations, we show that tuning the local electronic structures of metal anchor sites on g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by doping B atoms (BCN) with relatively lower electronegativity allows achieving zero-valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal-support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals for high activity in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. The precise synthesis of Pd SACs on BCN supports with varied B contents substantiated the theoretical prediction. A zero-valence Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/BCN SAC was achieved on a BCN support with a relatively low B content. It exhibited much higher stability in a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reducing environment, and more strikingly, a hydrogenation activity, approximately 10 and 34&#8197;times greater than those high-valence Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/BCN with a high B content, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Ir&#8208;V Direct Metal Bonding Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Activity in Vanadium Oxides Supported Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different interfacial bonds are ingeniously constructed to explore the regulating mechanism of the interfacial environment on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where V2O3 supported Ir catalyst (Ir&#8208;V2O3) with Ir&#8208;V bonding achieves the superior activity due to the accelerated RDS by the electrons injection from V to Ir.







Abstract
Tuning the interfacial structure of metal oxide substrates is an essential strategy to induce electronic structure reconstruction of supported catalysts, which is of great importance in optimizing their catalytic activities. Herein, vanadium oxides&#8208;supported Ir catalysts (Ir&#8208;V2O3, Ir&#8208;VO2, and Ir&#8208;V2O5) with different interfacial bonding environments (Ir&#8208;V, Ir&#8208;Obri, and Ir&#8208;O, respectively) were investigated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The regulating mechanism of the influence of different interfacial bonding environments on HER activity was investigated by both experimental results and computational evidence. Benefiting from the unique advantages of interfacial Ir&#8208;V direct metal bonds in Ir&#8208;V2O3, including enhanced electron transfer and electron donation ability, an optimized HER performance can be obtained with lowest overpotentials of 16 and 26&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high mass activities of 11.24 and 6.66&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1, and turnover frequency values of 11.20 and 6.63&#8197;s&#8722;1, in acidic and alkaline conditions respectively. Furthermore, the assembled Ir&#8208;V2O3||RuO2 anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer requires only 1.92&#8197;V to achieve a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and realizes long&#8208;term stability. This study provides essential insights into the regulating mechanism of interfacial chemical bonding in electrocatalysts and offers a new pathway to design noble metal catalysts for different applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This essay tackles challenges in polymer electrolytes for RMBs, introducing a novel strategy: anion modification and &#8220;thiol&#8208;ene&#8221; click chemistry. The resulting polymer electrolyte exhibits enhanced mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, tMg2+, compatibility with Mg anode and stable performance under wide temperature range. Comprehensive analysis deepens understanding of inner interactions in electrolyte, paving the way for future advancements.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes play a crucial role in advancing rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) owing to their exceptional characteristics, including high flexibility, superior interface compatibility, broad electrochemical stability window, and enhanced safety features. Despite these advantages, research in this domain remains nascent, plagued by single preparation approaches and challenges associated with the compatibility between polymer electrolytes and Mg metal anode. In this study, we present a novel synthesis strategy to fabricate a glycerol &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diallyl ether&#8208;3,6&#8208;dioxa&#8208;1,8&#8208;octanedithiol&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte supported by glass fiber substrate (GDT@GF CGPE) through anion modification and thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry polymerization. The developed route exhibits novelty and high efficiency, leading to the production of GDT@GF CGPEs featuring exceptional mechanical properties, heightened ionic conductivity, elevated Mg2+ transference number, and commendable compatibility with Mg anode. The assembled modified Mo6S8||GDT@GF||Mg cells exhibit outstanding performance across a wide temperature range and address critical safety concerns, showcasing the potential for applications under extreme conditions. Our innovative preparation strategy offers a promising avenue for the advancement of polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;performance rechargeable magnesium batteries, while also opens up possibilities for future large&#8208;scale applications and the development of flexible electronic devices.

         <title>A Double Twisted Nanographene with a Contorted Pyrene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of four [6]helical edges around a pyrene core gave a double twisted nanographene with red emission. Despite containing four helical motifs, the actual chiral origin was found to be the contorted pyrene core, achieving absorption/emission dissymmetry factors of up to an order of 10&#8722;3. The corresponding radical cation exhibits intense near&#8208;infrared absorption and circular dichroism tailing to 1600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The mature synthetic methodologies enable us to rationally design and produce chiral nanographenes (NGs), most of which consist of multiple helical motifs. However, inherent chirality originating from twisted geometry has just emerged to be employed in chiral NGs. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive chiral NG constituted of orthogonally arranged two&#8208;fold twisted &#960;&#8208;skeletons at a contorted pyrene core which contributes to optical transitions of S0&#8594;S1 and vice versa. The thus&#8208;obtained NG exhibited a robustness on its redox properties through 2e&#8722; uptake/release. The chemical oxidation generated stable radical cation whose absorption covers near&#8208;infrared I and II regions. Overall, the contorted pyrene core governs electronic nature of the chiral NG. The twist operation on NGs would be, therefore, a design strategy to alter conventional chirality induction on NGs.

         <title>Molecule Engineering of Sugar Derivatives as Electrolyte Additives for Deep&#8208;Reversible Zn Metal Anode</title>

Molecule additives with &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane, which effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes (002) facets&#8208;oriented deposition, enhancing reversibility at a high 92&#8201;% depth of discharge and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;%, resulting in low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.3 in full aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The cycling performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is greatly affected by dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anode, particularly in scenarios involving high depth of discharge (DOD) and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratios in full cells. Herein, drawing upon principles of host&#8211;guest interaction chemistry, we investigate the impact of molecular structure of electrolyte additives, specifically the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups, on the zinc negative electrode through molecular design. Our findings reveal that molecules containing these groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane. This effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition of exposed (002) facets, enhancing stability and reversibility of an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;% with the introduction of Lactobionic acid (LA) additive. Under harsh conditions of 92&#8201;% DOD, Zn//Zn cells exhibit stable cycling at challenging current densities of 15&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Even at a low N/P ratio of 1.3, Zn//NH4V4O10 full cells with LA electrolyte exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 73&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, significantly surpassing that of the blank electrolyte. Moreover, in a conversion type Zn//Br static battery with a high areal capacity (~5&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2), LA electrolyte sustains an improved cycling stability of 700&#8197;cycles.

This effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes dendrite-free zinc deposition of exposed (002) facets, enhancing stability and reversibility of an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;% with the introduction of Lactobionic acid (LA) additive. Under harsh conditions of 92&#8201;% DOD, Zn//Zn cells exhibit stable cycling at challenging current densities of 15&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at a low N/P ratio of 1.3, Zn//NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; full cells with LA electrolyte exhibit high-capacity retention of 73&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, significantly surpassing that of the blank electrolyte. Moreover, in a conversion type Zn//Br static battery with a high areal capacity (~5&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), LA electrolyte sustains an improved cycling stability of 700&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Modulation of Plasmonic Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles Confined within Swellable Polymer Colloidal Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling is achieved using gold nanoparticles embedded in crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres. The swelling and deswelling of these polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes enable the assembly and disassembly of the gold nanoparticles, altering their plasmonic coupling and allowing reversible color switching.







Abstract
Dynamic optical modulation in response to stimuli provides exciting opportunities for designing novel sensing, actuating, and authentication devices. Here, we demonstrate that the reversible swelling and deswelling of crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres in response to pH and temperature changes can be utilized to drive the assembly and disassembly of the embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), inducing their plasmonic coupling and decoupling and, correspondingly, color changes. The multi&#8208;responsive colloids are created by depositing a monolayer of AuNPs on the surface of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) nanospheres, then overcoating them with an additional RF layer, followed by a seeded growth process to enlarge the AuNPs and reduce their interparticle separation to induce significant plasmonic coupling. This configuration facilitates dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling through the reversible swelling/deswelling of the polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes. The rapid and repeatable transitions between coupled and decoupled plasmonic states of AuNPs enable reversible color switching when the polymer spheres are in colloidal form or embedded in hydrogel substrates. Furthermore, leveraging the photothermal effect and stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic coupling of the embedded AuNPs enables the construction of hybrid hydrogel films featuring switchable anticounterfeiting patterns, showcasing the versatility and potential of this multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic system.

         <title>Multifunctional TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs Networks as Sulfur/Lithium Host for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs conductive network has been designed to serve as a sulfur/Li host of LSBs, whose multicomponent heterostructure facilitated maximum exposure of active sites, thereby enhancing adsorption and catalytic activity. These superior features of TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs effectively suppressed the shuttling of soluble LiPSs and accelerated their conversions, as well as expedited the nucleation/decomposition of solid Li2S and reduced uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The inevitable shuttling and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) as well as the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrites have strongly limited the practical applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). To address these issues, we have innovatively constructed the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulated Co nanoparticles in situ grown on TiN&#8208;MXene nanosheets, denoted as TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs, which could serve simultaneously as both sulfur/Li host to kill &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; to (1) efficiently capture soluble LiPSs and expedite their redox conversion, (2) accelerate nucleation/decomposition of solid Li2S, and (3) induce homogeneous Li deposition. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs/S cathode with a sulfur loading of 2.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could show a high reversible specific capacity of 1129.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1&#8197;C, and ultralong cycle life over 1000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C. More importantly, it even achieves a high areal capacity of 6.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 50 cycles under a sulfur loading as high as 8.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low E/S ratio of 5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Besides, TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs as Li host could deliver a stable Li plating/striping behavior over 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Structural Mapping of Protein Aggregates in Live Cells Modeling Huntington's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of live Mid&#8208;infrared Photothermal (MIP) Imaging to study protein aggregates in a S. cerevisiae model of Huntington's Disease. MIP enables to distinguish structurally different partitions of aggregates of the protein huntingtin, by scanning across the aggregate and analyzing their MIP amide I band. We revealed that huntingtin aggregates are organized in a &#946;&#8208;sheet rich amyloid core and a shell composed of &#945;&#8208;helical proteins.







Abstract
While protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, acquiring structural information on protein aggregates inside live cells remains challenging. Traditional microscopy does not provide structural information on protein systems. Routinely used fluorescent protein tags, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), might perturb native structures. Here, we report a counter&#8208;propagating mid&#8208;infrared photothermal imaging approach enabling mapping of secondary structure of protein aggregates in live cells modeling Huntington's disease. By comparing mid&#8208;infrared photothermal spectra of label&#8208;free and GFP&#8208;tagged huntingtin inclusions, we demonstrate that GFP fusions indeed perturb the secondary structure of aggregates. By implementing spectra with small spatial step for dissecting spectral features within sub&#8208;micrometer distances, we reveal that huntingtin inclusions partition into a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich core and a &#593;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich shell. We further demonstrate that this structural partition exists only in cells with the [RNQ+] prion state, while [rnq&#8722;] cells only carry smaller &#946;&#8208;rich non&#8208;toxic aggregates. Collectively, our methodology has the potential to unveil detailed structural information on protein assemblies in live cells, enabling high&#8208;throughput structural screenings of macromolecular assemblies.

         <title>Interfacial Stabilization by Prelithiated Trithiocyanuric Acid as an Organic Additive in Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile bulk functionalization of Li6PS5Cl with prelithiated trithiocyanuric acid is introduced as an organic additive strategy to stabilize the interfaces in sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. This approach improves electrochemical performance markedly due to the formation of a highly stable Li2S deficient and Li3P&#8208;rich interface with Li metal anode.







Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) with a lithium metal anode (LMA) is a promising candidate to surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their inherent safety against fire hazards and potential to achieve a higher energy density. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window and chemical reactivity of the sulfide solid electrolyte towards the LMA results in interfacial degradation and poor electrochemical performance. In this direction, we introduce an organic additive approach, that is the mixing of prelithiated trithiocyanuric acid, Li3TCA, with Li6PS5Cl, to establish a stable interface while preserving high ionic conductivity. Including 2.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% Li3TCA alleviates the decomposition of the electrolyte on the lithium metal interface, decreasing the Li2S content in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) thus forming a more stable interface. In Li|Li symmetric cells, this strategy enables a rise in the critical current density from 1.0 to 1.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling for over 750&#8197;hours at a high current density of 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This approach also enables Li|NbO&#8208;NCM811 full cell to operate more than 500&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C.

In Li|Li symmetric cells, this strategy enables a rise in the critical current density from 1.0 to 1.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and stable cycling for over 750&#8197;hours at a high current density of 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This approach also enables Li|NbO-NCM811 full cell to operate more than 500&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast&#8208;Healing Glassy Hyperbranched Plastics Capable of Restoring 26.4&#8197;MPa Tensile Strength within One Minute at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>

An ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) consists of hyperbranched acyclic heterochains and multiple hydrogen bond arrays is demonstrated. It exhibits high modulus up to 2.5&#8197;GPa, but can restore 26.4&#8197;MPa of tensile strength within 1&#8197;min at room temperature. This ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing is attribute to the high mobility of branched terminal moieties and &#8220;water bridge&#8221; effect.







Abstract
The growing concern regarding widespread plastic pollution has propelled the development of sustainable self&#8208;healing plastics. Although considerable efforts have been dedicated to fabricating self&#8208;healing plastics, achieving rapid healing at room temperature is extremely challenging. Herein, we have developed an ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) by designing a hyperbranched molecular structure with a high density of multiple hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) on compliant acyclic heterochains and introducing trace water to form water bridge across the fractured surfaces. The compliant acyclic heterochains allow the dense multiple hydrogen bonds to form a frozen network, enabling tensile strength of up to 70&#8197;MPa and storage modulus of 2.5&#8197;GPa. The hyperbranched structure can drive the reorganization of the H&#8208;bonding network through the high mobility of the branched chains and terminals, thereby leading to self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Intriguingly, the presence of trace water vapor facilitates the formation of activated layers and the rearrangement of networks across the fractured UGPU sections, thereby enabling ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;healing at room temperature. Consequently, the restored tensile strength after healing for 1 minute achieves a historic&#8208;record of 26.4&#8197;MPa. Furthermore, the high transparency (&gt;90&#8201;%) and ultra&#8208;fast healing property of UGPU make it an excellent candidate for advanced optical and structural materials.

         <title>Enhancing Ionic Selectivity and Osmotic Energy by Using an Ultrathin Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Membrane with Trilayered Continuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a significantly promoted selectivity and blue energy harvesting performance by a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with a trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which is composed of an ultrathin zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 MOF and a highly aligned branched alumina nanochannel membrane.







Abstract
Designing a nanofluidic membrane with high selectivity and fast ion transport property is the key towards high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. However, most of reported membranes can produce power density less than commercial benchmark (5&#8197;W/m2), due to the imbalance between ion selectivity and permeability. Here, we report a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with an ultrathin and dense zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer and a highly aligned and interconnected branched alumina nanochannel membrane. The design leads to a continuous trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient in the sequence from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which enables the enhanced directional ion transport, and the angstrom&#8208;sized (~6.6&#8211;7&#8197;&#197;) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 windows render the membrane with high ion selectivity. Consequently, the novel heterogeneous membrane can achieve a high&#8208;performance power of ~8&#8197;W/m2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water. The power density can be largely upgraded to an ultrahigh ~17.1&#8197;W/m2 along with ~48.5&#8201;% conversion efficiency at a 50&#8208;fold KCl gradient. This work not only presents a new membrane design approach but also showcases the great potential of employing the zirconium&#8208;based MOF channels as ion&#8208;channel&#8208;mimetic membranes for highly efficient blue energy harvesting.

         <title>Spin Symmetry Breaking&#8208;Induced Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure in N&#8208;Coordinated MnO2 for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have achieved a functionality breakthrough of &#8220;Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure&#8221; on N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO) with asymmetric spin states, which is marked by the formation of uniform Hubbard bands. This character can play a crucial role in fostering coherent electronic spin transport and enhancing the rapid kinetics of the system.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), however, their performance is hindered by a substantial Hubbard gap, which limits electron transfer and battery cyclability. Addressing this, we introduce a heteroatom coordination approach, using triethanolamine to induce axial N coordination on Mn centers in MnO2, yielding N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO). This approach leverages the change of electronegativity disparity between Mn and ligands (O and N) to disrupt spin symmetry and augment spin polarization. This enhancement leads to the closure of the Hubbard gap, primarily driven by the intensified occupancy of the Mn eg orbitals. The resultant TEAMO exhibit a significant increase in storage capacity, reaching 351&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our findings suggest a viable strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of TMO cathodes, enhancing the potential of ZIBs in energy storage technology.

         <dc:description>
Stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks have been constructed based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]+ halogen bonds. The frameworks XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities and maintained their stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents as well as in aqueous environments across a wide pH range (3&#8211;12).







Abstract
Organic frameworks face a trade&#8208;off between the framework stability and the bond dynamics, which necessitates the development of innovative linkages that can generate stable frameworks without hindering efficient synthesis. Although iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) have been developed, constructing XOFs based on bromine(I) is desirable yet challenging due to the high sensitivity of bromine(I) species. In this work, we present the inaugural construction of stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf, based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]+ halogen bonds. The formation of XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf was monitored by 1H NMR, XPS, IR, SEM, TEM, HR&#8208;TEM, SEAD. Their framework structures were established by the results from PXRD, theoretical simulations and SAXS. More importantly, XOF(Br) displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities. They exhibited stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents and aqueous media, even over a wide pH range (pH 3&#8211;12), while the corresponding model compounds BrPy2BF4/OTf decomposed quickly even in the presence of minimal water. Furthermore, the influence of the counterions were investigated by replacing BF4 with OTf, which improved the stability of XOF(Br). This characteristic enabled XOF(Br) to serve as an efficient oxidizing reagent in aqueous environments, in contrast with the sensitivity of BrPy2BF4/OTf, which performed well only in organic media. This study not only deepens our fundamental understanding of organic frameworks but also opens new avenues for the development and application of multifunctional XOFs.

&lt;p&gt;Organic frameworks face a trade-off between the framework stability and the bond dynamics, which necessitates the development of innovative linkages that can generate stable frameworks without hindering efficient synthesis. Although iodine(I)-based halogen-bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) have been developed, constructing XOFs based on bromine(I) is desirable yet challenging due to the high sensitivity of bromine(I) species. In this work, we present the inaugural construction of stable bromine(I)-bridged two-dimensional (2D) halogen-bonded organic frameworks, &lt;b&gt;XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/OTf&lt;/b&gt;, based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; halogen bonds. The formation of &lt;b&gt;XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/OTf&lt;/b&gt; was monitored by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, XPS, IR, SEM, TEM, HR-TEM, SEAD. Their framework structures were established by the results from PXRD, theoretical simulations and SAXS. More importantly, XOF(Br) displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities. They exhibited stable two-dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents and aqueous media, even over a wide pH range (pH 3&#8211;12), while the corresponding model compounds &lt;b&gt;BrPy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/OTf&lt;/b&gt; decomposed quickly even in the presence of minimal water. Furthermore, the influence of the counterions were investigated by replacing BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with OTf, which improved the stability of XOF(Br). This characteristic enabled XOF(Br) to serve as an efficient oxidizing reagent in aqueous environments, in contrast with the sensitivity of &lt;b&gt;BrPy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/OTf&lt;/b&gt;, which performed well only in organic media. This study not only deepens our fundamental understanding of organic frameworks but also opens new avenues for the development and application of multifunctional XOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Short&#8208;Range Charge Transfer Excited States and Efficient Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of heterocyclic&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter is developed using the nitrogen&#8208;embedding strategy. The reported MR&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit deep&#8208;blue emission with narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of 13&#8197;nm. High external quantum efficiency of 27.7&#8201;% and nearly BT.2020 blue chromaticity coordinates were achieved.







Abstract
The development of deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring high efficiency and narrowband emission is of great importance for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays with wide color gamut. Herein, based on the nitrogen&#8208;embedding strategy for modifying the short range charge transfer excited state energies of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, we introduce one or two nitrogen atoms into the central benzene ring of a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton. This approach resulted in the stabilization of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and thus systematic hypsochromic shifts and narrowing spectra. In toluene solution, two heterocyclic&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF molecules, Py&#8208;BN and Pm&#8208;BN, exhibit deep&#8208;blue emissions with high photoluminescence quantum yields of 93&#8201;% and 94&#8201;%, and narrow full width at half maximum of 14 and 13&#8197;nm, respectively. A deep&#8208;blue hyperfluorescent OLED based on Py&#8208;BN exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.7&#8201;% and desired color purity with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.150, 0.052). These results demonstrate the significant potential for the development of deep blue narrowband MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Superionic Conduction in K3SbS4 Enabled by Cl&#8208;Modified Anion Lattice</title>

The Cl&#8208;modified anion lattice in K3SbS4 enhances K+ transport. The anion&#8208;diversified K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm at room temperature, with a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This achievement represents the highest reported conductivity among non&#8208;oxide&#8208;based potassium&#8208;ion conductors to date.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries emerge as promising alternatives to lithium batteries, leveraging their high natural abundance and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Developing potassium solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity is critical for realizing efficient potassium batteries. In this study, we present the synthesis of K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47, showcasing a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm and a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This represents an increase of over two orders of magnitude compared to the parent compound K3SbS4, marking the highest reported ionic conductivity for non&#8208;oxide potassium SEs. Solid&#8208;state 39K magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance on K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 reveals an increased population of mobile K+ ions with fast dynamics. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations further confirm a delocalized K+ density and significantly enhanced K+ diffusion. This work demonstrates diversification of the anion sublattice as an effective approach to enhance ion transport and highlights K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 as a promising SE for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries.

         <title>Aggregative Luminescence from CsPbBr3 Perovskite Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsPbBr3 precursors show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character, which originates from the polybromide plumbous that is formed through the coordination of Lewis bases (solvent molecules) to the lead metal center. The aggregative luminescence from perovskite precursors can be regulated by changing the solvent and precursor ratio.







Abstract
Understanding the properties of the precursor can provide deeper insight into the crystallization and nucleation mechanisms of perovskites, which is vital for the solution&#8208;process device performance. Herein, we conducted a detailed investigation into the photophysics properties of CsPbBr3 precursors in a broad concentration and various solvents. The precursor transformed from the solution state into the colloidal state and exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission character as the concentration increased. The aggregative luminescence from the precursors originates from the polybromide plumbous that is formed through the coordination of solvent molecules to the lead metal center. Two adducts with monodentate (PbBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;solvent) and bidentate (PbBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2solvent) ligands can be obtained, accompanied by emission with photoluminescence at 610 and 565&#8197;nm, respectively. Furthermore, the aggregative luminescence intensity and color could be regulated by changing the solvent and precursor ratio. Besides, we discussed the difference between the molecular aggregate in the organic system and the ionic aggregate in the inorganic system: the ionic aggregate is composed of solvated ions rather than individual molecules as in organic systems, which could possess properties that ions do not have. The fluorescence that is sensitive to Pb2+ coordination reported here could be applied to screen perovskite additives and judge the precursor aging.

         <title>Using MXene as a Chemically Induced Initiator to Construct High&#8208;Performance Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>

Taking inspiration from polymer electrolyte engineering, we have developed a new in situ induced growth strategy and elaborated on its corresponding principles of induced chemistry. In the in situ growth strategy, MXene provides the heterogeneous nucleation site and can be regarded as an initiator for the induced crystal growth. 







Abstract
MXene usually exhibits weak pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, which cannot provide sufficient reversible capacity, resulting in the decline of overall capacity when used as the cathode materials. Taking inspiration from polymer electrolyte engineering, we have conceptualized an in situ induced growth strategy based on MXene materials. Herein, 5.25&#8201;% MXene was introduced into the nucleation and growth process of vanadium oxide (HVO), providing the heterogeneous nucleation site and serving as an initiator to regulate the morphology and structural of vanadium oxide (T&#8208;HVO). The resulted materials can significantly improve the capacity and rate performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The growth mechanism of T&#8208;HVO was demonstrated by both characterizations and DFT simulations, and the improved performance was systematically investigated through a series of in situ experiments related to dynamic analysis steps. Finally, the evaluation and comparison of various defect introduction strategies revealed the efficient, safety, and high production output characteristics of the in situ induced growth strategy. This work proposes the concept of in situ induced growth strategy and discloses the induced chemical mechanism of MXene materials, which will aid the understanding, development, and application of cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MXene usually exhibits weak pseudo-capacitance behavior in aqueous zinc-ion batteries, which cannot provide sufficient reversible capacity, resulting in the decline of overall capacity when used as the cathode materials. Taking inspiration from polymer electrolyte engineering, we have conceptualized an in situ induced growth strategy based on MXene materials. Herein, 5.25&#8201;% MXene was introduced into the nucleation and growth process of vanadium oxide (HVO), providing the heterogeneous nucleation site and serving as an initiator to regulate the morphology and structural of vanadium oxide (T-HVO). The resulted materials can significantly improve the capacity and rate performance of zinc-ion batteries. The growth mechanism of T-HVO was demonstrated by both characterizations and DFT simulations, and the improved performance was systematically investigated through a series of in situ experiments related to dynamic analysis steps. Finally, the evaluation and comparison of various defect introduction strategies revealed the efficient, safety, and high production output characteristics of the in situ induced growth strategy. This work proposes the concept of in situ induced growth strategy and discloses the induced chemical mechanism of MXene materials, which will aid the understanding, development, and application of cathode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pattern&#8208;Matched Polymer Ligands Toward Near&#8208;Perfect Synergistic Passivation for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Br/Cl Mixed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
The inter&#8208;functional group spacing of polymer ligands is crucial for enhancing their interaction and passivation effects with perovskite nanocrystals. In this study, we demonstrate that alternating copolymers with a inter&#8208;functional group spacing of four carbon atoms exhibit nearly perfect matching with the ion distribution on the surface of CsPbBrxCl3&#8208;x, resulting in excellent performance and prolonged lifetime of pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emmiting diodes.







Abstract
Mixed Br/Cl perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) exhibit bright pure&#8208;blue emission benefiting for fulfilling the Rec. 2100 standard. However, phase segregation remains a significant challenge that severely affects the stability and emission spectrum of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we demonstrate the optimization of the spacing between polydentate functional groups of polymer ligands to match the surface pattern of CsPbBr1.8Cl1.2 PeNCs, resulting in effective synergistic passivation effect and significant improvements in PeLED performances. The block and alternating copolymers with different inter&#8208;functional group spacing are facilely synthesized as ligands for PeNCs. Surprisingly, block copolymers with a higher functional group density do not match PeNCs, while alternating copolymers enable efficient PeNCs with the high photoluminescence intensity, low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and high exciton binding energy. Density functional theory calculations clearly confirm the almost perfect match between alternating copolymers and PeNCs. Finally, pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are achieved with the emission at 467&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.131, 0.071), high external quantum efficiency (9.1&#8201;%) and record spectral and operational stabilities (~80&#8197;mins) in mixed&#8208;halide PeLEDs. Overall, this study contributes to designing the polymer ligands and promoting the development of high&#8208;performance and stable pure&#8208;color PeLEDs towards display applications.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluorescence and SERS Dynamic&#8208;Reversible Probes for Long&#8208;Term Assessment of Osteoarthritis In Vivo</title>

A temperature&#8208;activated ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and SERS bimodal imaging nanoprobe based on thermosensitive pNIPAm&#8208;co&#8208;AAm&#8208;co&#8208;PAA&#8208;IR&#8208;1061 and nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures (DCNP@Si@AuNSP) was developed to realize long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in vivo. The FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature, enabling long&#8208;term and accurate monitoring of dynamic temperature variations during the onset and treatment of arthritis in rats.







Abstract
The abnormal fluctuation of temperature in vivo usually reflects the progression of inflammatory diseases. Noninvasive, real&#8208;time, and accurate monitoring and imaging of temperature variation in vivo is advantageous for guiding the early diagnosis and treatment of disease, but it remains difficult to achieve. Herein, we developed a temperature&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe for long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in rat arthritis and timely assessment of the status of osteoarthritis. The thermosensitive polymer bearing NIR&#8208;II FL dye was grafted onto the surface of nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures to form the nanoprobe, wherein the nanoprobe contains NIR&#8208;II FL and Raman reference signals that are independent of temperature change. The ratiometric FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature changes. The nanoprobe accurately distinguishes the temperature variations in the inflamed joint versus the normal joint in vivo by ratiometric FL and SERS imaging, allowing for an accurate diagnosis of inflammation. Meanwhile, it can continuously monitor fluctuations in temperature over an extended period during the onset and treatment of inflammation. The tested temperature change trend could be used as an indicator for early diagnosis of inflammation and real&#8208;time evaluation of therapeutic effects.

Au&#8208;oxygen vacancy&#8208;Zr3+ complex sites proved to be efficient and selective catalytic sites for ethanol dehydrogenation by facilitating ethanol dissociation/adsorption, ethoxy activation, and product desorption.







Abstract
Developing a desirable ethanol dehydrogenation process necessitates a highly efficient and selective catalyst with low cost. Herein, we show that the &#8220;complex active site&#8221; consisting of atomically dispersed Au atoms with the neighboring oxygen vacancies (Vo) and undercoordinated cation on oxide supports can be prepared and display unique catalytic properties for ethanol dehydrogenation. The &#8220;complex active site&#8221; Au&#8722;Vo&#8722;Zr3+ on Au1/ZrO2 exhibits the highest H2 production rate, with above 37,964&#8197;mol H2 per mol Au per hour (385&#8197;g&#8201;H2&#8201;

Combining experimental and theoretical studies, we demonstrate the structural sensitivity of these complex sites by assessing their selectivity and activity in ethanol dehydrogenation. Our study sheds new light on the design and development of cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient catalysts for ethanol dehydrogenation. Fundamentally, atomic&#8208;level catalyst design by colocalizing catalytically active metal atoms forming a structure&#8208;sensitive &#8220;complex site&#8221;, is a crucial way to advance from heterogeneous catalysis to molecular catalysis. Our study advanced the understanding of the structure sensitivity of the active site in atomically dispersed catalysts.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Desulfurization in Air through Improved Photogenerated Carriers Separation in MOF MIL101/Carbon Dots&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4 composites were designed by a thermal polymerization&#8208;hydrothermal strategy with efficient carrier migration pathways. The Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction played a significant role in facilitating photogenerated charge transfer, enhancing substrate adsorption capability, and decreasing the activation energies of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which were crucial factors in the photocatalytic desulfurization reaction of the catalyst system. Moreover, the high concentration of photogenerated electrons and holes facilitated the production of more ROS (&#8901;O2, &#8901;OH, h+), thereby enhancing photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization.







Abstract
The extensive industrial applications of fuel oil, a critical strategic resource, are accompanied by significant environmental and health concerns due to the presence of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in its composition, which result in hazardous combustion waste. Extensive research has been conducted to develop technologies for low&#8208;vulcanization fuel production to address this issue. Consequently, the investigation of catalysts for environmentally friendly and safe photocatalytic desulfurization becomes imperative. To that end, we have designed efficient MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/CQDs@g&#8208;C3N4 (MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts with high carrier separation and mobility through a thermal polymerization&#8208;hydrothermal strategy. The high concentration of photogenerated carriers facilitates the activation of oxygen and H2O2, leading to increased production of ROS (&#8901;O2&#8722;, &#8901;OH, h+), thereby enhancing the photocatalytic desulfurization (PODS). Additionally, DFT (Density functional theory) calculations were utilized to determine the electron migration pathways of the catalysts and adsorption energies of DBT (dibenzothiophene). Moreover, Gibbs free energy calculations indicated that MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4 exhibited the lowest activation energy for oxygen and H2O2.

&lt;p&gt;The MIL101/CDs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; composites were designed by a thermal polymerization-hydrothermal strategy with efficient carrier migration pathways. The Z-Scheme heterojunction played a significant role in facilitating photogenerated charge transfer, enhancing substrate adsorption capability, and decreasing the activation energies of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which were crucial factors in the photocatalytic desulfurization reaction of the catalyst system. Moreover, the high concentration of photogenerated electrons and holes facilitated the production of more ROS (&#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &#8901;OH, h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), thereby enhancing photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extensive industrial applications of fuel oil, a critical strategic resource, are accompanied by significant environmental and health concerns due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds in its composition, which result in hazardous combustion waste. Extensive research has been conducted to develop technologies for low-vulcanization fuel production to address this issue. Consequently, the investigation of catalysts for environmentally friendly and safe photocatalytic desulfurization becomes imperative. To that end, we have designed efficient MIL-101(Fe)/CQDs@g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (MIL101/CDs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts with high carrier separation and mobility through a thermal polymerization-hydrothermal strategy. The high concentration of photogenerated carriers facilitates the activation of oxygen and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to increased production of ROS (&#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8901;OH, h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), thereby enhancing the photocatalytic desulfurization (PODS). Additionally, DFT (Density functional theory) calculations were utilized to determine the electron migration pathways of the catalysts and adsorption energies of DBT (dibenzothiophene). Moreover, Gibbs free energy calculations indicated that MIL101/CDs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited the lowest activation energy for oxygen and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The mechanism of photocatalytic desulfurization was proposed through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This study provides guidance for the development of MOF-based Z-scheme systems and their practical application in desulfurization processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Mobility n&#8208;Type Noncovalently&#8208;Fused&#8208;Ring Polymer for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer pDFSe with noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring acceptor triad and axisymmetric donor is synthesized to show increased rigidity and reduced lamellar ordering, which can simultaneously achieve excellent electron transport (6.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and doping efficiency. Upon n&#8208;doping, pDFSe shows excellent thermoelectric performance with electrical conductivity of 62.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 133.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers are emerging as competitive candidates for organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, to make the device truly pervasive, both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are essential. Despite great efforts, no n&#8208;type equivalents to the p&#8208;type benchmark PEDOT:PSS exist to date mainly due to the low electrical conductivity (&#963;). Herein, a near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer, namely pDFSe, is reported with high &#963; by achieving the synergy between charge transport and doping efficiency. The polymer pDFSe is synthesized based on an acceptor&#8208;triad moiety of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;difluorobenzoselenadiazole&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole (DFSe), which has the noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure to reinforce the backbone rigidity. Furthermore, an axisymmetric thiophene&#8208;selenophene&#8208;thiophene donor is introduced, which enables the formation of near&#8208;amorphous microstructures. The above merits ensure good doping efficiency without scarifying efficient intrachain charge&#8208;carrier transport. Thus, pDFSe&#8208;based n&#8208;type transistors exhibit high electron mobility up to 6.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, much higher than its reference polymer pDSe without the noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure (0.77&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Further upon n&#8208;doping, pDFSe demonstrates excellent &#963; of 62.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and maximum power factor of 133.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, which are among the highest values reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type polymers. The results demonstrate the great potential of near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure for the next&#8208;generation OTEs.

         <title>Elucidating the Discrepancy between the Intrinsic Structural Instability and the Apparent Catalytic Steadiness of M&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability under OER potential would experience unconventional structure reconstruction. The initial stable Ni&#8722;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8722;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8722;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the internal conflict between structural and catalytic stability.







Abstract
Despite the widespread investigations on the M&#8208;N&#8208;C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure&#8208;property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well&#8208;designed pH&#8208;dependent metal leaching experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni&#8722;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8722;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8722;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.

(100) plane&#8208;oriented K2Mg[Fe(CN)6] nanoplates with low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and high crystallinity achieve thermostability up to 550&#8201;&#176;C, surface carbon coating, and crystal water eliminating. The obtained K2Mg[Fe(CN)6]/C nanoplates manifest high working voltage, superior rate capability and ultralong cyclic life over 15000&#8197;cycles as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of their low cost and high energy density. However, the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;remove [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and crystal water lead to structural instability and capacity deterioration as well as the stereotype of poor thermostability of conventional HCFs. Herein, we report (100) face&#8208;oriented potassium magnesium hexacyanoferrate (KMgHCF) nanoplates with low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and high crystallinity, enabling thermostability up to 550&#8201;&#176;C, high&#8208;temperature carbon coating and crystal water elimination. The as&#8208;obtained KMgHCF/C nanoplates exhibit superior potassium storage properties, including a large reversible capacity of 84.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high voltage plateau of 3.87&#8197;V, excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance over 15000&#8197;cycles and high rate capability at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The unprecedented cycling stability of KMgHCF/C is attributed to the synergistic effect of a highly reversible two&#8208;phase reaction, low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and no crystal water, a specially exposed steady (100) surface, and a protective carbon coating. This work provides a new material selection and modification strategy for the practical application of HCFs in PIBs.

         <title>Metastable Supramolecular Assembly of Simple Monomers Enabled by Confinement: Towards Aqueous Phase Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable supramolecular assembly (SA) with aqueous phase room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is achieved by the confinement space of layered double hydroxide (LDH). The LDH energy trap can overcome the energy barrier of monomer ordered assembly and strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP.







Abstract
The application of supramolecular assembly (SA) with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous phase has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields. However, using simple molecules with crystalline RTP to construct SA with aqueous phase RTP is hardly possible from the standpoint of forces. The reason lies in that the transition from crystal to SA involves a structure transformation from highly stable to more dynamic state, leading to increased non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathways and silent RTP signal. Here, with the benefit of the confinement from the layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple molecules (benzene derivatives) can successfully form metastable SA with aqueous phase RTP. The maximum of RTP lifetime and efficiency can reach 654.87&#8197;ms and 5.02&#8201;%, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal the LDH energy trap can strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP. The universality of this strategy will usher exploration into other multifunctional monomer, facilitating the development of SAs with aqueous phase RTP.

         <title>Enantioselective Relay Coupling of Perfluoroalkyl and Vinylogous Ketyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe an enantioselective radical relay coupling catalyzed by a chiral bifuncational NHC. This approach gives easy access to chiral carboxylate derivatives with sterically hindered sp3 carbon branches. An unconventional syn&#8208;syn conformation of the squaramide motif was found critical in the stereocontrol through hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Chiral carboxylic acids and their derivatives are highly valuable structural motifs in the fields of asymmetric synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, the introduction of a sterically demanding sidechain to the &#946;&#8208;carbon, such as an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, remains a significant challenge in classical polar processes. Recently, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) mediated coupling reactions involving persistent ketyl radicals have emerged as a promising strategy to assemble highly crowded carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Nevertheless, achieving enantioselectivity in these reactions remains highly challenging. In this work, we report our recent progress in controlling enantioselectivity for relay coupling of perfluoroalkyl and persistent vinylogous ketyl radicals. We developed a chiral bifunctional NHC&#8208;squaramide catalyst that achieves high facial selectivity in a critical bond&#8208;forming event involving the coupling of a congested tertiary carbon radical and vinylogous ketyl radical. Chiral carboxylates bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at the &#946;&#8208;position can be prepared in good yield and excellent enantiomeric excess. Results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments indicate that the N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl squaramide motif adopts an unusual syn&#8208;syn conformation, enabling hydrogen bonding interactions with the enolate oxygen, thereby rigidifying the overall conformation of the transition state.

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation on Perovskite Quantum Dots Based on Ce&#8208;Oxygen Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ce ion doping increases the density of the lowest exciton state (X1 in CBM) of perovskite quantum dots, and Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity induces the formation of midgap states (MSs) involving oxygen. Under light excitation, the relaxation process of excitons to oxygen molecules is accelerated, resulting in the formation of a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thus drives the generation of high value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have shown attractive prospects in the field of visible photocatalysis, especially in the synthesis of high value&#8208;added chemicals. However, under aerobic conditions, the stable operation of QD catalysts has been limited by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoexcitation, especially superoxide species O2&#8901;&#8722;. Here, we propose a strategy of Ce3+ doping in perovskite QDs to guide superoxide species for photocatalytic oxidation reactions. In C(sp3)&#8722;H bond oxidation of hydrocarbons, superoxide species were rapidly generated and efficiently utilized on the surface of perovskite QDs, which achieves the stable operation of the catalytic system and obtains a high product conversion rate (15.3&#8197;mmol/g/h for benzaldehydes). The mechanism studies show that the strong Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity accelerates the relaxation process of photoinduced exciton transfer to superoxide species and inhibits the radiative recombination pathway. This work provides a new idea of utilizing oxygen species on perovskite surface and broadens the design strategy of high&#8208;performance QD photocatalysts.

         <title>Introducing a &#960;&#8208;Skeleton Perpendicular to the Central Methylene Carbon in Alkanediamides: Design of Supramolecular Polymers with an Offset &#960;&#8208;Stacking Arrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymers with an offset &#960;&#8208;stacked arrangement were formed by introducing a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton perpendicularly onto the central methylene carbon atom of heptanediamide derivatives. The introduction of chiral alkyl chains at both termini of the heptanediamide further enables supramolecular polymerization of a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton with offset &#960;&#8208;stacking and effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly behavior of a heptanediamide derivative that contains a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton on its central methylene carbon atom has been examined. This molecule, which also contains two octyl chains, gelated the nonpolar solvent methylcyclohexane through the formation of fibrous nanostructures with hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation process. The supramolecular polymerization is accompanied by bathochromic shifts of both the absorption and fluorescence bands while maintaining a fluorescence quantum yield comparable to that of the monomeric state. Theoretical calculations provided an energetically stable structure, in which the &#960;&#8208;skeletons are stacked with an offset of more than 8.0&#8197;&#197;, replicating the experimentally observed absorption change due to exciton coupling. Moreover, a slow transition with an inversion of the chiral arrangement of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moieties was induced by replacing the octyl chains with chiral alkyl chains. Our molecular&#8208;design strategy was further applied to a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which also forms an offset &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangement and exhibits more effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.

         <title>A Unique Wide&#8208;Spacing Fence&#8208;Type Superstructure for Robust High&#8208;Voltage O3&#8208;Type Sodium Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fence&#8208;type superstructure with wide d&#8208;spacing in O3&#8208;type layered material was proposed. The fence&#8208;type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of vacancy clusters and mitigates the irreversible oxygen loss at a high voltage of 4.4&#8197;V. This material with fence&#8208;type superstructure displays outstanding cycling performance with a capacity retention of 85.8&#8201;% and a voltage retention of 98.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles.







Abstract
Enhancing the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries and promoting their commercial application. Lattice oxygen redox at high voltage usually enables a high capacity and energy density. But the structural degradation, severe voltage decay, and the resultant poor cycling performance caused by irreversible oxygen release seriously restrict the practical application. Herein we introduce a novel fence&#8208;type superstructure (2a&#215;3a type supercell) into O3&#8208;type layered cathode material Na0.9Li0.1Ni0.3Mn0.3Ti0.3O2 and achieve a stable cycling performance at a high voltage of 4.4&#8197;V. The fence&#8208;type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of the vacancy clusters resulting from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Li migration and in&#8208;plane transition metal migration at high voltage due to the wide d&#8208;spacing, thereby significantly reducing the irreversible release of lattice oxygen and greatly stabilizing the crystal structure. The cathode exhibits a high energy density of 545&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, a high rate capability (112.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C) and a high cycling stability (85.8&#8201;%@200 cycles with a high initial capacity of 148.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C) accompanied by negligible voltage attenuation (98.5&#8201;%@200 cycles).

     alt="A Unique Wide-Spacing Fence-Type Superstructure for Robust High-Voltage O3-Type Sodium Layered Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel fence-type superstructure with wide d-spacing in O3-type layered material was proposed. The fence-type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of vacancy clusters and mitigates the irreversible oxygen loss at a high voltage of 4.4&#8197;V. This material with fence-type superstructure displays outstanding cycling performance with a capacity retention of 85.8&#8201;% and a voltage retention of 98.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials is of great significance for realizing high-performance sodium-ion batteries and promoting their commercial application. Lattice oxygen redox at high voltage usually enables a high capacity and energy density. But the structural degradation, severe voltage decay, and the resultant poor cycling performance caused by irreversible oxygen release seriously restrict the practical application. Herein we introduce a novel fence-type superstructure (2&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&#215;3&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; type supercell) into O3-type layered cathode material Na&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and achieve a stable cycling performance at a high voltage of 4.4&#8197;V. The fence-type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of the vacancy clusters resulting from out-of-plane Li migration and in-plane transition metal migration at high voltage due to the wide d-spacing, thereby significantly reducing the irreversible release of lattice oxygen and greatly stabilizing the crystal structure. The cathode exhibits a high energy density of 545&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high rate capability (112.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;C) and a high cycling stability (85.8&#8201;%@200 cycles with a high initial capacity of 148.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;C) accompanied by negligible voltage attenuation (98.5&#8201;%@200 cycles). This strategy provides a distinct spacing effect of superstructure to design stable high-voltage layered cathode materials for Na-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Active Oxidation Catalysts through Confining Pd Clusters on CeO2 Nano&#8208;Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>

Synthesis approach towards rational tailoring the threshold of cluster formation in noble metal&#8208;ceria catalysts using CeO2 islands finely distributed on Al2O3 support. The spatial separation of CeO2 entities prevents highly active Pd clusters from redispersion and strong sintering during CO oxidation reaction.







Abstract
CeO2&#8208;supported noble metal clusters are attractive catalytic materials for several applications. However, their atomic dispersion under oxidizing reaction conditions often leads to catalyst deactivation. In this study, the noble metal cluster formation threshold is rationally adjusted by using a mixed CeO2&#8208;Al2O3 support. The preferential location of Pd on CeO2 islands leads to a high local surface noble metal concentration and promotes the in situ formation of small Pd clusters at a rather low noble metal loading (0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%), which are shown to be the active species for CO conversion at low temperatures. As elucidated by complementary in situ/operando techniques, the spatial separation of CeO2 islands on Al2O3 confines the mobility of Pd, preventing the full redispersion or the formation of larger noble metal particles and maintaining a high CO oxidation activity at low temperatures. In a broader perspective, this approach to more efficiently use the noble metal can be transferred to further systems and reactions in heterogeneous catalysis.

Twist operation on nanographenes induces inherent chirality which differs from the conventional axial or helical chirality. Yoshifumi Hashikawa, Fenghua Bai, Chaolumen et&#8197;al. studied a chiral nanographene with a two&#8208;fold twisted geometry in their Research Article (e202406927). The contorted pyrene as a central core of the nanographene significantly governs overall electronic nature leading to facile chemical oxidation, red emissivity, high quantum yield, and even chiroptical properties.

Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions for their high selectivity, yet they often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. In their Research Article (e202406262), Junling Lu et&#8197;al. report that the tuning of the local electronic structures of anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping of boron atoms with low electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with remarkably improved hydrogenation activity and stability.

Pd on ceria , an important catalytic system for various oxidation reactions, is studied for CO oxidation in a Research Article (e202408511) by Jan&#8208;Dierk Grunwaldt et&#8197;al. The image depicts the new concept of bringing the noble metal in contact with a strongly interacting nano&#8208;island (i.e. ceria) on alumina to 1) facilitate the formation of the active clusters, 2) hinder their redispersion into single atoms, while 3) preventing strong sintering of Pd due to the spatial separation of the CeO2 islands.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cracking of non&#8208;Biodegradable Plastics to Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>

In a Chinese legend, Yu successfully tamed the flood for agricultural irrigation by regulating the riverway rather than blocking the flow of water. From flood to treasure, this philosophy inspires excellent strategies for the valorization of non&#8208;degradable plastics. Photocatalytic cracking as an emerging approach to abstract the carbon atom resource recently reported is discussed and summarized in this review.







Abstract
Plastic pollution is worsening the living conditions on Earth, primarily due to the toxicity and stability of non&#8208;biodegradable plastics (NBPs). Photocatalytic cracking of NBPs is emerging as a promising way to cleave inert C&#8722;C bonds and abstract the carbon atoms from these wastes into valuable chemicals and fuels. However, controlling these processes is a huge challenge, ascribed to the complicated reactions of various NBPs. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the CO2 and carbon&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated photocatalytic cracking of NBPs, with an emphasis on the pivotal intermediates. The CO2&#8208;mediated cracking proceeded with indiscriminate C&#8722;H/C&#8722;C bond cleavage of NBPs and tandem photoreduction of CO2, while carbon&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated cracking was realized by the prior activation of C&#8722;H bonds for selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage of NBPs. Catalytic generation and conversion of different intermediates greatly depend on the kinds of active species and the structure of photocatalysts under irradiation. Meanwhile, the fate of a specific intermediate is compared with small molecule activation to reveal the key problems in the cracking of NBPs. Finally, the challenges and potential directions are discussed to improve the overall efficiency in the photocatalytic cracking of NBPs.

         <title>One&#8208;Handed Covalent Helical Ladder Polymers: The Dawn of a Tailorable Class of Chiral Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers can be programmably obtained through chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) using synergically non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry.







Abstract
In the last decades, chemists have developed methods to synthesize helical molecular architectures using a combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. Very recently, the new class of completely covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers has vigorously emerged. Such polymers can be rationally and programmably obtained through an approach guided by the principles of chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) and making use synergically of two disciplines that have so far rarely interacted: non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry. The precise programmability of the 3D structure and new mechanical and chiroptical properties will lead to potential applications in areas such as enantiorecognition, catalysis, spintronics and chiral&#8208;related optoelectronics. This minireview examines the emerging field of one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers, analyzing their synthesis, applications, and limitations.

         <title>A Coppoborylene Stabilized by Multicenter Covalent Bonding and Its Amphoteric Reactivity to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene that was mass&#8208;isolated and spectroscopically characterized in the gas phase has a pseudo T&#8208;shaped structure and features classical borylene reactivity to CO. It evidences the potential feasibility of stabilizing amphoteric borylenes by an unprecedented multicenter covalent bond rather than the well&#8208;documented coordination tactics.







Abstract
A cationic copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene was prepared and structurally characterized via infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This structure exemplifies a new class of borylenes stabilized by three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron metal&#8208;boron&#8208;metal covalent bonding interaction, displaying exceptional &#963;&#8208;acidity and unparalleled &#960;&#8208;donor capability for CO activation that outperforms all of the known transition metal cations and is comparable or even superior to the documented base&#8208;trapped borylenes. Its neutral form represents a monovalent boron compound with a strongly reactive amphoteric boron center built on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;boron bonds, which inspires the design and synthesis of new members of the borylene family.

         <title>Confined Growth of Highly Ordered Metal Atomic Arrays for Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the selective and efficient growth of highly ordered cobalt&#8208;iridium atoms on sp&#8208;hybridized graphdiyne by step&#8208;by&#8208;step anchoring of the metal atoms under ambient conditions. Such a well&#8208;designed system of the bimetallic atoms with high&#8208;density shows much better oxygen evolution reaction activity and stability than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IrO2 catalysts in alkaline simulated seawater.







Abstract
Metal atom catalysts have been among the most important research objects due to their specific physical and chemical properties. However, precise control of the anchoring of metal atoms is still challenging to achieve. Cobalt and iridium atomic arrays formed sequentially ordered stable arrays in graphdiyne (GDY) triangular cavities depending on their intrinsic chemical properties and interactions. The success of this method was attributed to multifunctional integration of GDY, enabling selective growth from one to several atoms and various atomic densities. The bimetallic atom arrays show several advantages resulting from reducibility of acetylene bonds, space limiting effect, incomplete charge transfer between GDY and metal atoms, and sp&#8208;C hybridized triple bond skeleton. This well&#8208;designed system exhibits unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a mass activity of 2.6&#8197;A&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 at a low overpotential of 300&#8197;mV, which is 216.6&#8197;times higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IrO2 catalyst, and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>A Strong Supramolecular Mechanophore with Controlled Mechanical Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong yet controlled supramolecular mechanophore based on cucurbit[7]uril is developed through the use of charge&#8211;dipole repulsion. It exhibits a high mechanical strength of ~700&#8197;pN in the &#8722;COO&#8722; state, comparable with weak covalent bonds. This mechanical locking can be gradually tuned off by transitioning to the &#8722;COOH state, reaching a minimum value of ~150&#8197;pN.







Abstract
Supramolecular mechanophores typically exhibit much lower mechanical strengths than covalent counterparts, with strengths usually around 100&#8197;pN, which is significantly lower than the nN&#8208;scale strength of covalent bonds. Inspired by the slow dissociation kinetics of the cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8211;hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline (HIQ) complex, we discovered that charge&#8211;dipole repulsion can be utilized to create strong supramolecular mechanophores. When activated at its &#8722;COO&#8722; state, the CB[7]&#8722;HIQ complex exhibits a high mechanical strength of ~700&#8197;pN, comparable to weak covalent bonds such as Au&#8722;S bonds or thiol&#8211;maleimide adducts. The strength of the CB[7]&#8722;HIQ complex can also be tuned with pH in a gradual manner, with a minimum value of ~150&#8197;pN at its &#8722;COOH state, similar to an ordinary supramolecular conjugate. This research may pave the way for the development of supramolecular architectures that combine the advantages of covalent and supramolecular systems.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomatization of Pyridinium Salts by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;Selective Addition of Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C4&#8208;selective addition of soft copper&#8208;based silicon nucleophiles to pyridinium triflates allows for their enantioselective deraromatization in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (see scheme; (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE=1,2&#8208;bis[(2R,5R)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane). The thus&#8208;formed &#945;&#8208;chiral silyl unit can be further used to control the stereoselectivity in subsequent transformations.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective addition of silicon nucleophiles released from an Si&#8722;B reagent to prochiral pyridinium triflates is reported. The dearomatization proceeds with excellent enantioselectivity using Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 as the precatalyst and (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE (1,2&#8208;bis[(2R,5R)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane) as the chiral ligand. A carbonyl group at C3 is required for this, likely acting a weak donor group to preorganize and direct the nucleophilic attack towards C4. The resulting 4&#8208;silylated 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines can be further converted into functionalized piperidine derivatives.

         <title>Microtiter Plate Immobilization Screening for Prototyping Heterogeneous Enzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microliter plate screening method has been developed to determine the consensus immobilization protocol for the heterogenization of multi&#8208;enzymatic reaction cascades. The optimal immobilization strategy leading to the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts was determined through an activity and stability assay, as demonstrated for an immobilized four&#8208;enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid.







Abstract
Immobilization is a key enabling technology in applied biocatalysis that facilitates the separation, recovery, and reuse of heterogeneous biocatalysts. However, finding a consensus immobilization protocol for several enzymes forming a multi&#8208;enzyme system is extremely difficult and relies on a combinatorial trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, we describe a protocol in which 17 different carriers functionalized with different reactive groups are tested in a 96&#8208;well microtiter plate to screen up to 21 immobilization protocols for up to 18 enzymes. This screening includes an activity and stability assay to select the optimal immobilization chemistry to achieve the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts. The information retrieved from the screening can be rationalized using a Python&#8208;based application CapiPy. Finally, through scoring the screening results, we find the consensus immobilization protocol to assemble an immobilized four&#8208;enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid. This methodology opens a path to speed up the prototyping of immobilized multi&#8208;enzyme pathways for chemical manufacturing.

&lt;p&gt;A microliter plate screening method has been developed to determine the consensus immobilization protocol for the heterogenization of multi-enzymatic reaction cascades. The optimal immobilization strategy leading to the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts was determined through an activity and stability assay, as demonstrated for an immobilized four-enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immobilization is a key enabling technology in applied biocatalysis that facilitates the separation, recovery, and reuse of heterogeneous biocatalysts. However, finding a consensus immobilization protocol for several enzymes forming a multi-enzyme system is extremely difficult and relies on a combinatorial trial-and-error approach. Herein, we describe a protocol in which 17 different carriers functionalized with different reactive groups are tested in a 96-well microtiter plate to screen up to 21 immobilization protocols for up to 18 enzymes. This screening includes an activity and stability assay to select the optimal immobilization chemistry to achieve the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts. The information retrieved from the screening can be rationalized using a Python-based application CapiPy. Finally, through scoring the screening results, we find the consensus immobilization protocol to assemble an immobilized four-enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. This methodology opens a path to speed up the prototyping of immobilized multi-enzyme pathways for chemical manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;Nonadjacent Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Enabled by Pd/Cu&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Heck Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereodivergent construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters enabled by a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric Heck cascade reaction has been developed. An array of highly functionalized chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids, were smoothly prepared. Notably, all four stereoisomers of the desired products were obtained through orthogonal permutations of two chiral metal catalysts.







Abstract
The construction of chiral motifs containing nonadjacent stereocenters in an enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner has long been a challenging task in synthetic chemistry, especially with respect to their stereodivergent synthesis. Herein, we describe a protocol that enables the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters through a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed Heck cascade reaction. Notably, a C=C bond relay strategy involving the shift of the &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate was successfully applied in the asymmetric construction of 1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. The current method allows for the efficient preparation of chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, with good functional group tolerance. The full complement of the four stereoisomers of products bearing 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters could be readily accessed by a simple combination of two chiral metal catalysts with different enantiomers.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Induced Interstitial Effects Drive Water Oxidation on Ordered Ir&#8722;B Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>

The B&#8208;induced interstitial effects in intermetallic IrB1.1 balance the acidic water oxidation activity and stability and leads to a good operation in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high&#8208;temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir&#8722;B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir&#8722;B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B&#8208;induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

         <title>Phase Engineering of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeCuNiAlTi high entropy alloy with uniform intermetallic nanoparticles shows enhanced electrochemical performance of nitrate reduction to ammonia in terms of NH3 yield (0.52&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE (95.23&#8201;%) due to increased electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer efficiency. Density functional theory calculations confirm the multi&#8208;site including Fe, Co and Ni catalysis with the lowest energy barrier on Co sites for nitrate reduction.







Abstract
Directly electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an efficient and environmentally friendly technology for ammonia (NH3) production but is challenged by highly selective electrocatalysts. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with unique properties are attractive materials in catalysis, particularly for multi&#8208;step reactions. Herein, we first reported the application of HEA (FeCoNiAlTi) for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 (NRA). The bulk HEA is active for NRA but limited by the unsatisfied NH3 yield of 0.36&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.66&#8201;%. Through an effective phase engineering strategy, uniform intermetallic nanoparticles are introduced on the bulk HEA to increase electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer efficiency. The resulting nanostructured HEA (n&#8208;HEA) delivers enhanced electrochemical NRA performance in terms of NH3 yield (0.52&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE (95.23&#8201;%). Further experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the multi&#8208;active sites (Fe, Co, and Ni) dominated electrocatalysis for NRA over the n&#8208;HEA. Notably, the typical Co sites exhibit the lowest energy barrier for NRA with *NH2 to *NH3as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Unveiling Dynamic Structure and Bond Evolutions in BiOIO3 Photocatalysts during CO2 Reduction</title>

The combination of operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic structure and bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity on BiOIO3 photocatalysts.







Abstract
We have established a correlation between photocatalytic activity and dynamic structure/bond evolutions of BiOIO3&#8208;based photocatalysts during CO2 reduction by combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy. More specifically, the selective photo&#8208;deposition of PtOx species on BiOIO3 (010) facets could effectively promote the electron enrichment on Bi active sites of (100) facets for facilitating the adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of Bi sites with high oxidation state and the shrink of crystalline structures. With introducing light irradiation to drive CO2 reduction, the Bi active sites with high oxidation states transformed into normal Bi3+ state, accompanying with the expansion of crystalline structures. Owing to the dynamic structure, bond, and chemical&#8208;state evolutions, a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity for CO evolution has been achieved on PtOx&#8208;BiOIO3 (195.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), much higher than the pristine (61.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) as well as metal&#8208;Pt decorated BiOIO3 (70.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) samples. This work provides new insights to correlate the intrinsically dynamic structure/bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity, which may help to guide future photocatalyst design.

Owing to the dynamic structure, bond, and chemical-state evolutions, a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity for CO evolution has been achieved on PtO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (195.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), much higher than the pristine (61.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as well as metal-Pt decorated BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (70.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) samples. This work provides new insights to correlate the intrinsically dynamic structure/bond evolutions with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity, which may help to guide future photocatalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular meta&#8208;Thermocycloadditions of Benzene Rings via Wheland Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
meta&#8208;Thermocycloadditions of benzene rings was realized for the first time. Distinct to the meta&#8208;photocycloadditions, this reaction was proposed to proceed via [4&#960;+2&#960;] cycloadditions of Wheland intermediates from the electrophilic dearomatization of benzene rings. A broad spectrum of readily available C(sp2)&#8208;rich aniline&#8208;tethered enynes were transformed into C(sp3)&#8208;rich 3D complex polycyclic architectures simply by stirring in TFA.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloadditions are powerful synthetic transformations utilizing aromatic compounds for cycloaddition reactions. They have been extensively applied to the synthesis of biologically relevant compounds not only because of the complexity generated from simplicity but also the atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. For the most studied yet challenging benzene ring systems, ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;cycloadditions have been realized both photochemically and thermally, while the meta&#8208;cycloadditions are still limited to the photochemical processes tracing back to the 1960s. Herein, we for the first time realized the thermal cycloadditions of benzene rings with alkenes in a meta fashion via Wheland intermediates. A broad spectrum of readily available C(sp2)&#8208;rich aniline&#8208;tethered enynes were transformed into C(sp3)&#8208;rich 3D complex polycyclic architectures simply by stirring in TFA. Moreover, the reaction could be performed in gram&#8208;scales and the products could be diversely elaborated.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of a Mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer Carbodicarbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand was synthesized through reaction of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. Subsequent transmetallations allow ligand transfer to different metal complexes, including RhCl(CO)2 (see graphic).







Abstract
Carbodicarbenes are strong C&#8208;donor ligands, which have found numerous applications in organometallic and main group element chemistry. Herein, we report a structurally distinct carbodicarbene ligand, which is formed by dinitrogenative coupling of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. The resulting carbonyl complex serves as a stable source for the mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand. Facile ligand transfer reactions were demonstrated to occur with gold(I), copper(I), palladium(II), and rhodium(I) complexes.

         <title>XAT&#8208;Catalysis for Intramolecular Biaryl Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic, XAT mediated Smiles&#8208;Truce biaryl synthesis is described. The reaction uses mild methods to generate and chemoselectively harness capricious aryl radicals, efficiently furnishing valuable biaryl products. The reaction utilises a simple yet underexplored amide linker, which enables a challenging formal C&#8722;N arylation of anilines.







Abstract
Radical ipso&#8208;substitution offers an alternative to organometallic approaches for biaryl synthesis, but usually requires stoichiometric reagents such as tributyltin hydride. Here, we demonstrate that visible light photoredox catalysis can be used for ipso&#8208;biaryl synthesis, via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) regime. Using amide substrates that promote ipso&#8208; over unwanted ortho&#8208;addition, we demonstrate smooth biaryl formation with no constraint on the electronic character of the migrating arene ring. The photoreaction can be combined in one operation to achieve a formal arylation of the inert aniline C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Accelerated Screening of Alternative DNA Base&#8208;Organic Molecule&#8208;Base Architectures via Integrated Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collaborative protocol of fast theoretical simulation and convenient experimental validation was developed for large&#8208;scale screening of alternative DNA base&#8208;organic molecule&#8208;base architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs, thereby expanding molecule&#8208;mediated non&#8208;classical DNA self&#8208;assembly structures.







Abstract
Organic molecule&#8208;mediated noncanonical DNA self&#8208;assembly expands the standard DNA base&#8208;pairing alphabets. However, only a very limited number of small molecules have been recognized as mediators because of the tedious and complicated experiments like crystallization and microscopy imaging. Here we present an integrative screening protocol incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) for fast theoretical simulation and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for convenient experimental validation. Melamine, the molecule that was confirmed mediating noncanonical DNA base&#8208;pairing, and 38 other candidate molecules were applied to demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol. We successfully identified seven stable noncanonical DNA duplex structures, and another eight novel structures with sub&#8208;stability. In addition, we discovered that hairpins at both ends can significantly stabilize the noncanonical DNA structures, providing a guideline to design small organic molecule&#8208;incorporated DNA structures. Such an efficient screening protocol will accelerate the design of alternative DNA&#8208;molecule architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. Considering the wide range of potential mediators, it will also facilitate applications such as noncovalent, highly dense loading of drug molecules in DNA&#8208;based delivery system and probe design for sensitive detection of certain molecules.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Pure Covalent Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized four chiral molecular tubes by condensing enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine with luminescent tetraformyl precursors. Within the framework of these tubes, the stereochirality of the bisamino building blocks was transferred and amplified, leading to planar chirality of the tubes. These tubes thus demonstrate a promising approach to CPL&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
Here, we successfully synthesized four structurally analogous, self&#8208;assembled chiral molecular tubes with relatively high yields. This achievement involved the condensation of six equivalents of enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (trans&#8208;CHDA) and three equivalents of the corresponding tetraformyl precursor. Each precursor was equipped with a luminescent linker terminated by two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Even though these tetraformyl precursors are barely soluble in almost all organic solvents, the molecular tubes are highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, allowing us to fully characterize them in solution. The stereo&#8208;chirality of the chiral bisamino building blocks endows the frameworks of molecular tubes with planar chirality.

&lt;p&gt;We synthesized four chiral molecular tubes by condensing enantiomerically pure &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine with luminescent tetraformyl precursors. Within the framework of these tubes, the stereochirality of the bisamino building blocks was transferred and amplified, leading to planar chirality of the tubes. These tubes thus demonstrate a promising approach to CPL-active materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we successfully synthesized four structurally analogous, self-assembled chiral molecular tubes with relatively high yields. This achievement involved the condensation of six equivalents of enantiomerically pure &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-CHDA) and three equivalents of the corresponding tetraformyl precursor. Each precursor was equipped with a luminescent linker terminated by two &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-phthalaldehyde units. Even though these tetraformyl precursors are barely soluble in almost all organic solvents, the molecular tubes are highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, allowing us to fully characterize them in solution. The stereo-chirality of the chiral bisamino building blocks endows the frameworks of molecular tubes with planar chirality. As a consequence, all of these molecular tubes exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with relatively large dissymmetry values |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, providing an efficient method for synthesizing CPL-active materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox Synergy: Enhancing Gas Sensing Stability in 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Balancing Metal Node and Ligand Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox innocent zinc metal center&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF, Zn3(HHTQ)2, with ligand&#8208;centered sensing active sites has been developed for NO2 sensing, which demonstrates excellent cycling stability and high selectivity without compromising the coordination bonds.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates in gas sensing, owing to their tunable porous structure and conductivity. Nevertheless, the reported gas sensing mechanisms heavily relied on electron transfer between metal nodes and gas molecules. Normally, the strong interaction between the metal sites and target gas molecule would result poor recovery and thus bad recycling property. Herein, we propose a redox synergy strategy to overcome this issue by balancing the reactivity of metal sites and ligands. A 2D c&#8208;MOF, Zn3(HHTQ)2, was prepared for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensing, which was constructed from active ligands (hexahydroxyltricycloquinazoline, HHTQ) and inactive transition&#8208;metal ions (Zn2+). Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that by utilizing only the redox interactions between ligands and NO2, not only high sensitivity and selectivity, but also excellent cycling stability in NO2 sensing could be achieved. In contrast, control experiments employing isostructural 2D c&#8208;MOFs with Cu/Ni metal nodes exhibited irreversible NO2 sensing. Our current work provides a new design strategy for gas sensing materials, emphasizing harnessing the redox activity of only ligands to enhance the stability of MOF sensing materials.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,n&#8208;remote aminoacetoxylation of cis&#8208;alkenes has been developed using PhI(OAc)2 as an oxidant, providing the acetoxylated lactams with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The sterically hindered pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) L3 with a tert&#8208;butyl group in oxazoline ring and propyl group in C6 position of pyridinyl is vital for the reaction, where the former is good for asymmetric aminopalladation step and the latter for the chain walking process. The enantioenriched lactam products were proven to be good building blocks for the synthesis of azabicycles.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfinamidines via Asymmetric Nitrogen Transfer from N&#8722;H Oxaziridines to Sulfenamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines by electrophilic amination of sulfenamides with enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridines. The enantioenriched sulfinamidines show remarkable chemical and configurational stability against high temperature, acids, and bases in non&#8208;aqueous solution. One&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides is further demonstrated by employing enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridine reagents.







Abstract
Sulfinamidines are promising aza&#8208;SIV chiral building blocks in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery. However, no report has documented their enantioselective synthesis. Here we present an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines via electrophilic amination of sulfenamides using an enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridine. The resulting enantiomerically enriched primary sulfinamidines are configurationally stable at 90&#8201;&#176;C in solution and show remarkable stability against organic acids and bases under non&#8208;aqueous conditions. We also demonstrate a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides using N&#8722;H oxaziridine reagents.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes by (3+2) Annulation via a 2&#8208;Carbon Phosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylphosphonium intermediates, commonly accessed from ynoates, undergo normal and reverse polarity couplings. Herein we exploit &#946;&#8208;iodoenoates as alternatives to ynoates. As a consequence, we have been able to develop an enantioselective approach to cyclopentenes via &#945; (3+2) annulation. In addition to delivering a new approach to cyclopentenes this is the first general enantioselective annulation exploiting this intermediate.







Abstract
Herein we report a catalytic enantioselective (3+2) annulation, in which a vinyl phosphonium intermediate serves as the 2&#8208;carbon component. The reaction involves an &#945;&#8208;umpolung &#946;&#8208;umpolung coupling sequence, enabled by &#946;&#8208;haloacrylates and chiral enantioenriched phosphepine catalysts. The reaction shows good generality, providing access to an array of cyclopentenes, with mechanistic studies supporting stereospecific formation of the vinyl phosphonium intermediate which, then undergoes annulation with turn over limiting catalyst elimination. Beyond defining a new approach to cyclopentenes, these studies demonstrate that &#946;&#8208;haloacrylates can replace ynoates in reaction designs that require exclusive umpolung coupling at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions.

Formally a MgII&#8722;Be0 complex, the bond is significantly polarized Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722;. Despite this polarity, the complex is thermally stable and only reacts with polar unsaturated C=O, C=S or N=N bonds.







Abstract
Attempts to create a novel Mg&#8722;Be bond by reaction of [(DIPePBDI*)MgNa]2 with Be[N(SiMe3)2]2 failed; DIPePBDI*=HC[(tBu)C=N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl. Even at elevated temperatures, no conversion was observed. This is likely caused by strong steric shielding of the Be center. A similar reaction with the more open Cp*BeCl gave in quantitative yield (DIPePBDI*)MgBeCp* (1). The crystal structure shows a Mg&#8722;Be bond of 2.469(4)&#8197;&#197;. Homolytic cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Be bond requires &#916;H=69.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (cf. CpBe&#8722;BeCp 69.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and (DIPPBDI)Mg&#8722;Mg(DIPPBDI) 55.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Natural&#8208;Population&#8208;Analysis (NPA) shows fragment charges: (DIPePBDI*)Mg +0.27/BeCp* &#8722;0.27. The very low NPA charge on Be (+0.62) compared to Mg (+1.21) and the strongly upfield 9Be NMR signal at &#8722;23.7&#8197;ppm are in line with considerable electron density on Be and the formal oxidation state assignment of MgII&#8722;Be0. Despite this Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722; polarity, 1 is extremely thermally stable and unreactive towards H2, CO, N2, cyclohexene and carbodiimide. It reacted with benzophenone, azobenzene, phenyl acetylene, CO2 and CS2. Reaction with 1&#8208;adamantyl azide led to reductive coupling and formation of an N6&#8208;chain. The azide reagent also inserted in the Cp*&#8722;Be bond. The inertness of 1 is likely due to bulky ligands protecting the Mg&#8722;Be unit.

         <title>Artificial Channels Based on Bottlebrush Polymers: Enhanced Ion Transport Through Polymer Topology Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush polymers can be used to mimic natural ion channels when functionalized with ion&#8208;binding urea groups. The unique topology of these polymer channels enables efficient and selective ion transport across lipid bilayers, highlighting the importance of topology control in designing polymer&#8208;based ion transport systems.







Abstract
Synthetic structures mimicking the transport function of natural ion channel proteins have a wide range of applications, including therapeutic treatments, separation membranes, sensing, and biotechnologies. However, the development of polymer&#8208;based artificial channels has been hampered due to the limitation on available models. In this study, we demonstrate the great potential of bottlebrush polymers as accessible and versatile molecular scaffolds for developing efficient artificial ion channels. Adopting the bottlebrush configuration enhanced ion transport activity of the channels compared to their linear analogs. Matching the structure of lipid bilayers, the bottlebrush channel with a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic triblock architecture exhibited the highest activity among the series. Functionalized with urea groups, these channels displayed high anion selectivity. Additionally, we illustrated that the transport properties could be fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the chemistry of ion binding sites. This work not only highlights the importance of polymer topology control in channel design, but also reveals the great potential for further developing bottlebrush channels with customized features and diverse functionalities.

Structural degradation of M&#8208;N&#8208;C (M=Co, Ni, and Fe) single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) used as cathode materials at industrial&#8208;grade current density during long&#8208;term reduction is demonstrated. Both M&#8208;N and N&#8208;C are broken, resulting in the dissolution of N and the formation of M&#8208;containing core&#8211;shell nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting the electrocatalytic performances.







Abstract
M&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrode materials for many electro&#8208;reduction reactions. However, their stability is far from practical applications, and their deactivation mechanism has been rarely investigated. Herein, we demonstrate the structural degradation of M&#8208;N&#8208;C (M=Co, Ni, and Fe) at industrial&#8208;grade current density for long&#8208;term electro&#8208;reduction. Both M&#8208;N and N&#8208;C bonds are broken, resulting in the gradual hydrogenation and dissolution of N in the form of ammonia. The residual M is finally converted to M&#8208;containing core&#8211;shell nanoparticles after sequential dissolution, redeposition, and electro&#8208;reduction. The destruction of the M&#8208;N&#8208;C structure and the formation of nanoparticles greatly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Our work highlights the structural degradation and deactivation mechanism of M&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;type SACs under strong reductive conditions and provides useful information for inspiring researchers to develop new strategies to improve the electrocatalytic stability of similar types of materials.

         <title>Development of an Organic Emitter Exhibiting Reverse Intersystem Crossing Faster than Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inverted singlet&#8208;triplet excited states (iST) molecule, A6AP&#8208;Cz, based on asymmetric hexa&#8208;azaphenalene was designed. A6AP&#8208;Cz showed the extremely short lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) of 54&#8197;ns. Moreover, the reverse intersystem crossing (rate constant of RISC: kRISC=1.9&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) was faster than ISC (rate constant of ISC: kISC=1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) due to the negative energy gap between lowest excited singlet and triplet states (&#916;EST).







Abstract
In thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and suppression of intersystem crossing (ISC) are demanded to shorten a lifetime of triplet excitons. As a system realizing RISC faster than ISC, inverted singlet&#8208;triplet excited states (iST) with a negative energy difference (&#916;EST) between the lowest excited singlet and the lowest triplet states have been gathering much attention recently. Here, we have focused on an asymmetric hexa&#8208;azaphenalene (A6AP) core to obtain a new insight into iST. Based on A6AP, we have newly designed A6AP&#8208;Cz with the calculated &#916;EST of &#8722;44&#8197;meV. The experimental studies of a synthesized A6AP&#8208;Cz revealed that the lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) was only 54&#8197;ns, which was the shortest among all organic materials. The rate constant of RISC (kRISC=1.9&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) was greater than that of ISC (kISC=1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1). The negative &#916;EST of A6AP&#8208;Cz was experimentally confirmed from 1) the kRISC and kISC (&#8722;45&#8197;meV) and 2) the temperature&#8208;dependent &#964;DF. 3) The onsets of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at 77&#8197;K also supported the evidence of negative &#916;EST (&#8722;73&#8197;meV). This study demonstrated the potential of A6AP as an iST core for the first time.

&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8722;45&#8197;meV) and 2) the temperature-dependent &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DF&lt;/sub&gt;. 3) The onsets of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at 77&#8197;K also supported the evidence of negative &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8722;73&#8197;meV). This study demonstrated the potential of A6AP as an iST core for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency to 12.0&#8201;% of an Ultraviolet OLED by Engineering the Horizontal Dipole Orientation of a Hot Exciton Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear D&#8211;A&#8211;D triad UV emitter, namely CDFDB, which possesses high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) property. Thanks to its integrated narrowband UV emission, good hot exciton conversion capability and large horizontal dipole ratio, the CDFDB&#8208;based UV OLED can emit highly efficient near UV EL at 398&#8197;nm (CIEx,y: 0.161, 0.040) with a maximum EQE of 12.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Currently, much research effort has been devoted to improving the exciton utilization efficiency and narrowing the emission spectra of ultraviolet (UV) fluorophores for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) applications, while almost no attention has been paid to optimizing their light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we developed a linear donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) triad, namely CDFDB, which possesses high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) property. Thanks to its integrated narrowband UV photoluminescence (PL) (&#955;PL: 397&#8197;nm; FWHM: 48&#8197;nm), moderate PL quantum yield (&#981;PL: 72&#8201;%, Tol), good triplet hot exciton (HE) conversion capability, and large horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;//: 92&#8201;%), the OLEDs based on CDFDB not only can emit UV electroluminescence with relatively good color purity (&#955;EL: 398&#8197;nm; CIEx,y: 0.161, 0.040), but also show a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 12.0&#8201;%. This study highlights the important role of horizontal dipole orientation engineering in the molecular design of HE UV&#8208;OLED fluorophores.

A photo&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement of unactivated allylic alcohols is reported. Aliphatic as well as aromatic groups participate as migrating groups, yielding a variety of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones. The operationally simple conditions prescribe 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% Co&#8208;salen, and 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% lutidinium triflate and, importantly, display reactivity complementary to procedures that employ Br&#248;nsted acid.







Abstract
We report a photochemical method for the semipinacol rearrangement of unactivated allylic alcohols. Aliphatic as well as aromatic groups participate as migrating groups, yielding a variety of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with ethers, esters, halides, nitriles, carbamates, and substituted arenes. The operationally simple and fully catalytic conditions prescribe 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% Co&#8208;salen, and 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% lutidinium triflate and, importantly, display reactivity complementary to procedures employing Br&#248;nsted acid. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversifications.

         <title>A Merger of Relay Catalysis with Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enables Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective arylation of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bond of primary alcohols was achieved under mild conditions by constructing a cooperative system merging relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution of transient aryl aldehyde intermediates, demonstrating new opportunities in multicatalysis to execute otherwise challenging transformations.







Abstract
The conceptual merger of relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is reported to enable regio&#8208; and enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H bond arylation of aliphatic alcohols, forming enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols typically with &gt;90&#8201;:&#8201;10 enantiomeric ratios (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er) and 36&#8211;74&#8201;% yields. The starting materials bearing neighbouring stereogenic centres can be converted to either diastereomer of the &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohol products, with &gt;85&#8201;:&#8201;15 diastereomeric ratios determined by the catalysts. The reactions occur under mild conditions, ensuring broad compatibility, and involve readily available aryl bromides, an inorganic base, and commercial Ru&#8208; and Pd&#8208;complexes. Mechanistic experiments support the envisioned mechanism of the transformation occurring through a network of regio&#8208; and stereoselective processes operated by a coherent Ru/Pd&#8208;dual catalytic system.

         <title>Organometallic Polymer Constructed by Active Fe&#8208;C12N8 Centers for Boosting Sodium&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;metal coordination materials with rich structural diversity are considered as promising electrode materials for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance can be constrained by the limited number of active sites and structural instability under the discharge/charge process. Herein, organometallic polymer microspheres (Fe&#8208;PDA&#8208;220) with a unique d&#8208;&#960; conjugated structure was designed and successfully constructed through a simple synchronous polymerization and coordination reactions. Polymerization of phenylenediamine was initiated by Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions generated synchronously during the polymerization integrated with poly&#8208;aminoquinone chains to form Fe&#8208;C12N8 active centers. Used as electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the distinctive Fe&#8208;C bond significantly boosts the structural stability, and the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation system could facilitate electron transfer. A high reversible capacity of 345 mAh g&#8208;1 was delivered at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and a capacity of 106 mAh g&#8208;1 was maintained even after discharged/charged at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 for 5000 cycles, outperforming most reported coordination materials. Spectroscopic and electronic analyses revealed that a two&#8208;electron reaction occurred per active unit, accompanied by the reversible redox evolution of the C=N groups and Fe ions during&#160; sodiation/desodiation. This work provides a promising and efficient strategy for boosting the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials by the design of organometallic polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Durable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (P/O TSCs) suffer from poor long&#8208;term device stability due to halide segregation in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, which hinders their practical deployment. Therefore, developing all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites for incorporation into P/O TSCs is a promising strategy because of their superior stability under continuous illumination. However, these inorganic WBG perovskites also face some critical issues, including rapid crystallization, phase instability, and large energy loss, etc. To tackle these issues, two multifunctional additives based on 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (AQS) are developed to regulate the perovskite crystallization by mediating the intermediate phases and suppress the halide segregation through the redox&#8208;shuttle effect. By coupling with organic cations having the desirable functional groups and dipole moments, these additives can effectively passivate the defects and adjust the alignment of interface energy levels. Consequently, a record Voc approaching 1.3 V with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59% could be achieved in a 1.78 eV bandgap single&#8208;junction inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSC. More importantly, the P/O TSC derived from this cell demonstrates a T90 lifetime of 1000 h under continuous operation, presenting the most stable P/O TSCs reported so far.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Memristors Based on Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Obtained by Using a Protonation Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are garnering substantial interest in resistive random&#8208;access memory, attributed to their superior crystallinity, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and modifiable molecular structures. However, the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based memristors impeded by challenges such as low conjugation degree of imine bonds and poor electron delocalization ability. Herein, we report a protonation strategy to modify the imine bonds of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs. This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance. The protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;BPy and COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT thin films&#8208;based memristors show remarkable device performance with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 105, a low driving voltage, and outstanding endurance exceeding 600 and 1300 cycles, respectively, which is nearly twice the durability of analogous non&#8208;protonated COFs&#8208;based memristors. Notably, the protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT&#8208;based memristor exhibit the highest number of cycles reported at present. This work not only unprecedentedly enhances the performance of COF&#8208;based memristors, but also provides a universal and promising approach for the molecular design and potential application of D&#8208;A type imine&#8208;linked COFs.</dc:description>

This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance.

         <title>Hofmann Clathrates: A &#8220;Blue Box&#8221; Approach to Modulate Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing p&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox&#8208;active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150 K and an approximate 23% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor&#8208;acceptor p&#8208;p stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature&#8208;dependent single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Thienyltriazine Triamides: Thickness Insensitive Interlayer Materials Featuring Fine&#8208;tuned Optoelectronic and Aggregation Characters for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) was facile synthesized and firstly used as cathode interlayers (CILs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). By utilizing different aromatic arms and pendant polar groups, their optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors were effectively modulated. The combination of thienyltriazine (TT) core, naphthylamide arm and imidazole pendant group endows TT&#8208;N&#8208;M with suitable energy levels, intensified work function tunability, higher conductivity, and well&#8208;balanced crystallinity and film&#8208;forming ability, boosting both the performance and stability of OSCs significantly. Remarkably, the solar cell efficiency remains stable at around 90% of the optimal efficiency even as the interlayer thickness varied from 5 to 95 nm, demonstrating its insensitivity to thickness. Moreover, TT&#8208;N&#8208;M exhibits compatibility with various active layer systems, achieving a maximum efficiency of 19.60% for single&#8208;junction solar cell. Its exceptional tolerance to thickness fluctuations and performance establishes a new benchmark for multi&#8208;armed CIL&#8208;based OSCs, also positioning them among the most high&#8208;performing CIL materials documented thus far. This work not only broadens the scope of CIL materials for OSCs but also offers deep insights into design strategies and structure&#8208;properties relationships, being beneficial for the future development of more efficient CIL materials for organic optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronously Improved Multiple Afterglow and Phosphorescence Efficiencies in 0D Hybrid Zinc Halides with Ultrahigh Anti&#8208;Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides have been emerged as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, but synchronous optimization of multiple phosphorescence performance in one structural platform remains less resolved, and stable RTP activity in aqueous medium is also unrealized due to serious instability toward water and oxygen. Herein, we demonstrated a photophysical tuning strategy in a new 0D hybrid zinc halide family of (BTPP)2ZnX4 (BTPP = benzyltriphenylphosphonium, X = Cl and Br). Infrequently, the delicate combination of organic and inorganic species enables this family to display multiple ultralong green afterglow and efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) associated cyan phosphorescence. Compared with inert luminescence of [BTPP]+ cation, incorporation of anionic [ZnX4]2&#8208; effectively enhance the spin&#8211;orbit coupling effect, which significantly boosts the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 30.66% and 54.62% for afterglow and phosphorescence, respectively. Synchronously, the corresponding luminescence lifetime extend to 143.94 ms and 0.308 &#956;s surpassing the indiscernible phosphorescence of [BTPP]X salt. More importantly, this halide family presents robust RTP emission with nearly unattenuated PLQY in water and harsh condition (acid and basic aqueous solution) over half a year. The highly efficient integrated afterglow and STE phosphorescence as well as ultrahigh aqueous state RTP realize multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications in wide chemical environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Single&#8208;Cycle Autonomous Molecular Machines: Light&#8208;Powered Shuttling in a Multi&#8208;Cycle Reaction Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular machines autonomously convert energy into functions, driving systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium. This energy conversion is achieved by leveraging complex, kinetically asymmetric chemical reaction networks that are challenging to characterize precisely. In contrast, all known synthetic molecular systems in which kinetic asymmetry has been quantified are well described by simple single&#8208;cycle networks. Here, we report on a unique light&#8208;driven [2]rotaxane that enables the autonomous operation of a synthetic molecular machine with a multi&#8208;cycle chemical reaction network. Unlike all prior systems, the present one exploits a photoactive macrocycle, which features a different photoreactivity depending on the binding sites at which it resides. Furthermore, E to Z isomerization reverses the relative affinity of the macrocycle for two binding sites on the axle, resulting in a multi&#8208;cycle network. Building on the most recent theoretical advancements, this work quantifies kinetic asymmetry in a multi&#8208;cycle network for the first time. Our findings represent the simplest rotaxane capable of autonomous shuttling developed so far and offer a general strategy to generate and quantify kinetic asymmetry beyond single&#8208;cycle systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Catalytic SEAr H/D Exchange of Arenes with D2O: Metal&#8208;Free Deuteration of Natural Complexes and Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic metal&#8208;free approach for the H/D exchange in aromatic compounds using D2O as the terminal deuterating reagent has been developed. This metal&#8208;free protocol employs a triaryl carbenium as the mediator and showcases a wide applicability in the late&#8208;stage deuteration of various natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs. Gram&#8208;scale deuteration was successfully demonstrated with &#946;&#8208;Estradiol, highlighting the method's practicability. Detailed mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, unveiled the essential role of in&#8208;situ generated acidic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution process. This newly developed method offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange techniques, addressing challenges such as the use of expensive metals, impurity formation, and the necessity for residual metal removal from the final products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nitroreductase&#8208;activatable Metabolic Reporter for Covalent Labeling of Pathological Hypoxic Cells in Tumorigenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aberrant hypoxic stress will initiate a cascade of pathological consequence observed prominently in tumorigenesis. Understanding of hypoxia&#8217;s role in tumorigenesis is &#160;highly essential for developing effective therapeutics, which necessitates reliable tools to specifically distinguish hypoxic tumor cells (or tissues) and correlate their dynamics with the status of disease in complex living settings for precise theranostics. So far, disparate hypoxia&#8208;responsive probe molecules and prodrugs were designed via chemical or enzymatic reactions, yet their capability in real&#8208;time reporting pathogenesis&#160;development is often compromised due to unrestricted diffusion and less selectivity towards the environmental responsiveness. Herein we&#160;present an oxygen&#8208;insensitive nitroreductase (NTR)&#8208;activatable glycan metabolic reporter (pNB&#8208;ManNAz) capable of covalently labeling hypoxic tumor cells and tissues. Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited unique responsiveness to cellular NTR,&#160;culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could incorporate onto cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for multicellular&#160;hypoxia labeling, particularly in the dynamic&#160;monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in vivo. We anticipate that this approach holds promise for investigating hypoxia&#8208;related pathological progression,&#160;offering valuable insights for accurate diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent and Site&#8208;Selective Etherification of Carbohydrate Polyols through Chiral Copper Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site&#8208;selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site&#8208;selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single&#8208;electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site&#8208;selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent and Protease Resistant Azapeptide Agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 and GIP Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The gut&#8208;derived peptide hormones glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 (GLP&#8208;1) and glucose&#8208;dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) play important physiological roles. Stabilized agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R) and the GIP receptor (GIPR) for the management of diabetes and obesity have generated widespread enthusiasm and have become blockbuster drugs. These therapeutics are refractory to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase&#8208;4 (DPP4), that catalyzes rapid removal of the two N&#8208;terminal residues of the native peptides, in turn severely diminishing their activity profiles.&#160; Here we report that a single atom change from carbon to nitrogen in the backbone of the entire peptide make them refractory to DPP4 action while still retaining full potency and efficacy at their respective receptors.&#160; This was accomplished by use of aza&#8208;amino acids, that are bioisosteric replacements for a&#8208;amino acids that perturb the structural backbone and local side chain conformations.&#160; Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that aza&#8208;amino acid can populate the same conformational space that GLP&#8208;1 adopts when bound to the GLP&#8208;1R. The insertion of an aza&#8208;amino acid at the second position from the N&#8208;terminus in semaglutide and in a dual agonist of GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR further demonstrates its capability as a viable alternative to current DPP4 resistance strategies while offering additional structural variety.</dc:description>

Fluorescence probes can distinguish ONOO&#8208; species from other ROS; however, their selectivity toward ONOO&#8208; species depends on the ONOO&#8208; recognition group. Aryl&#8208;boronic acids and esters, which are common ONOO&#8208; recognition groups, are not selective for ONOO&#8208; over H2O2. In this study, we developed a diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid as a new ONOO&#8208; recognition group that selectively reacts with ONOO&#8208; over H2O2 and other ROS. Three DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA)&#8208;based fluorophores that emit fluorescence over visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, Cou&#8208;BN, BVP&#8208;BN, and HDM&#8208;BN, and their aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based counterparts (Cou&#8208;BO, BVP&#8208;BO, and HDM&#8208;BO), were developed. The DANBA&#8208;based probes exhibited enhanced selectivity toward ONOO&#8208; over that of their control group, as well as universality in MTT assays and in vitro experiments with PC12 cells. The NIR&#8208;emissive HDM&#8208;BN was optimized to delineate in vivo ONOO&#8208; levels in mouse brains with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. This DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid belongs to a new generation of recognition groups for developing ONOO&#8208; probes, and this strategy could be extended to other common hydroxyl&#8208;containing dyes to detect ONOO&#8208; levels in complex biological systems and processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by a Fullerene&#8208;Based Hole Transport Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing an efficient modification molecule to mitigate non&#8208;radiative recombination at the NiOx/perovskite interface and improve perovskite quality represents a challenging yet crucial endeavor for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we synthesized a novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport molecule, designated as FHTM, by integrating C60 with 12 carbazole&#8208;based moieties, and applied it as a modification molecule at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The in&#8208;situ self&#8208;doping effect, triggered by electron transfer between carbazole&#8208;based moiety and C60 within the FHTM molecule, along with the extended &#960; conjugated moiety of carbazole groups, significantly enhances FHTM&#8217;s hole mobility. Coupled with optimized energy level alignment and enhanced interface interactions, the FHTM significantly enhances hole extraction and transport in corresponding devices. Additionally, the introduced FHTM efficiently promotes homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. These combined improvements led to the FHTM&#8208;based PSCs yielding a champion efficiency of 25.58% (Certified: 25.04%), notably surpassing that of the control device (20.91%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained 93% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This study highlights the potential of functionalized fullerenes as hole transport materials, opening up new avenues for their application in the field of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The First&#8208;in&#8208;class Deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting Chimera Stabilizes and Activates cGAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimera (DUBTAC) is a promising technology for inducing targeted protein stabilization (TPS). Despite its therapeutic potential, very few proteins have been stabilized by DUBTACs to date. The limited applicability of this technology is likely due to the modest DUBTAC&#8208;induced protein stabilization effect, and the scarcity of effective deubiquitinase ligands that can be harnessed for DUBTAC development. Here, we report the discovery of MS7829 and MS8588, the first&#8208;in&#8208;class DUBTACs of cGAS, a key component of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. While these DUBTACs are based on a cGAS inhibitor, they effectively stabilized cGAS and activated the cGAS/STING/IRF3 signaling. To develop these cGAS DUBTACs, we optimized EN523, an OTUB1 covalent ligand, into an improved ligand, MS5105. We validated MS5105 by generating a MS5105&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC, which was approximately 10&#8208;fold more effective in stabilizing the &#916;F508&#8208;CFTR mutant protein than the previously reported EN523&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC. Overall, this work advances the DUBTAC technology for TPS.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Degradable Bottlebrush Polymers Using &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottlebrush polymers have a variety of useful properties including a high entanglement molecular weight, low Young&#8217;s modulus, and rapid kinetics for self&#8208;assembly. However, the translation of bottlebrushes to real&#8208;world applications is limited by complex, multi&#8208;step synthetic pathways and polymerization reactions that rely on air&#8208;sensitive catalysts. Additionally, most bottlebrushes are non&#8208;degradable. Herein, we report an inexpensive, versatile, and simple approach to synthesize degradable bottlebrush polymers under mild reaction conditions. Our approach relies on the &#8220;grafting&#8208;through&#8221; polymerization of &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;functionalized macromonomers. These macromonomers can be polymerized under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and due to reversibility of the disulfide bond in LA, the resulting bottlebrush polymers can be depolymerized by cleaving disulfide backbone bonds. Bottlebrushes with various side&#8208;chain chemistries can be prepared through the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers, and the backbone length is governed by the macromonomer molecular weight and solvent polarity. We also demonstrate that LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers can be copolymerized with acrylates to form degradable bottlebrush networks. This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side&#8208;chain chemistries and provides insight into the light&#8208;mediated grafting&#8208;through polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;functionalized macromonomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;swelling Microporous Membrane for High&#8208;capacity and Long&#8208;life Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are gaining popularity due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and ease of manufacturing. However, challenges like polyiodide shuttle effect and Zn dendrite growth hinder their practical application. Here, we report a cation exchange membrane to simultaneously prevent the polyiodide shuttle effect and regulate Zn2+ deposition. Comprised of rigid polymers, this membrane shows superior swelling resistance and ion selectivity compared to commercial Nafion. The resulting Zn&#8211;I2 battery exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% and low self&#8208;discharge rate of 4.47% after 48 h rest. By directing a uniform Zn2+ flux, the membrane promotes a homogeneous electric field, resulting in a dendrite&#8208;free Zn surface. Moreover, its microporous structure enables pre&#8208;adsorption of additional active materials prior to battery assembly, boosting battery capacity to 287 mA h g&#8211;1 at 0.1 A g&#8211;1. At 2 A g&#8211;1, the battery exhibits a steady running for 10,000 cycles with capacity retention up to 96.1%, demonstrating high durability of the membrane. The practicality of the membrane is validated via a high loading (35 mg cm&#8211;2) pouch cell with impressive cycling stability, paving a way for membrane design towards advanced Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Stone&#8208;For&#8208;Three&#8208;Birds Strategy Using a Fullerene Modifier for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron extraction from perovskite/C60 interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one&#8208;stone&#8208;for&#8208;three&#8208;birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface. It is found that the C60&#8208;TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb2+ cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C60. Moreover, it effectively induces the secondary grain growth of the perovskite film through strong bonding effect, and this phenomenon has never been observed in prior art reports on fullerene related studies. The combination of the above three upgrades enables improved perovskite film quality with increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity. With these advantages, C60&#8208;TMA treated PSC devices exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.89% than the control devices (23.66%). Besides, C60&#8208;TMA benefits improved thermal stability of PSC devices, retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85 &#176;C for 1200 h, primarily due to the reinforced interfacial interactions and improved perovskite film quality.</dc:description>
