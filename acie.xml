         <title>Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents Allow Boosted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence in J&#8208;Type Aggregates for Bioimaging and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing molecular fluorophores with enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state for the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to the lack of reliable design guidelines. Herein, we report an aromatic substituent strategy to construct highly bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates. Introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at 3,5&#8208;aryl and meso positions of classic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type arrangement and further boost NIR&#8208;II fluorescence of J&#8208;aggregates via increased electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. Notably, NOBDP&#8208;NO2 with three nitro groups (&#8208;NO2) shows intense NIR&#8208;II fluorescence at 1065 nm and high absolute quantum yield of 3.21% in solid state, which can be successfully applied in bioimaging, high&#8208;level encoding encryption, and information storage. Moreover, guided by this electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent strategy, other skeletons (thieno&#8208;fused BODIPY, aza&#8208;BODIPY, and heptamethine cyanine) modified with &#8208;NO2 are converted into J&#8208;type aggregates with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, showing great potential to convert aggregation caused emission quenching (ACQ) dyes into brilliant J&#8208;aggregates. This study provides a universal method for construction of strong NIR&#8208;II emissive J&#8208;aggregates by rationally manipulating molecular packing and establishing relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and fluorescence properties.</dc:description>

Herein, we report an aromatic substituent strategy to construct highly bright NIR-II J-aggregates. Introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents at 3,5-aryl and meso positions of classic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton can promote slip-stacked J-type arrangement and further boost NIR-II fluorescence of J-aggregates via increased electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. Notably, NOBDP-NO2 with three nitro groups (-NO2) shows intense NIR-II fluorescence at 1065 nm and high absolute quantum yield of 3.21% in solid state, which can be successfully applied in bioimaging, high-level encoding encryption, and information storage. Moreover, guided by this electron-withdrawing substituent strategy, other skeletons (thieno-fused BODIPY, aza-BODIPY, and heptamethine cyanine) modified with -NO2 are converted into J-type aggregates with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence, showing great potential to convert aggregation caused emission quenching (ACQ) dyes into brilliant J-aggregates.

         <title>A Lantern&#8208;Shaped Pd(II) Cage Constructed from Four Different Low Symmetry Ligands with Positional and Orientational Control: an Ancillary Pairings Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the key challenges of metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry is to maintain the ease of self&#8208;assembly but, at the same time, create structures of increasingly high levels of complexity. In palladium(II) quadruply&#8208;stranded lantern&#8208;shaped cages, this has been achieved through either 1) the formation of heteroleptic (multi&#8208;ligand) assemblies, or 2) homoleptic assemblies from low&#8208;symmetry ligands. Heteroleptic cages formed from low symmetry ligands. A hybid of these two approaches would add an additional rich level of complexity but no examples of these have been reported. Here we use a system of ancillary complementary ligand pairings at the termini of cage ligands to target heteroleptic assemblies: these complementary pairs can only interact (through coordination to a single Pd(II) metal ion) between ligands in a cis position on the cage. Complementarity between each pair (and orthogonality to other pairs) is controlled by denticity (tridentate to monodentate or bidentate to bidentate) and/or hydrogen bonding capability (AA to DD or AD to DA). This allows positional and orientational control over ligands with different ancillary sites. Using this approach, we have successfully used low&#8208;symmetry ligands to synthesise complex heteroleptic cages, including an example with four different low symmetry ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)&#8208;Ladder&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fast Proton Storage
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) has been developed for a fast proton storage in both a mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. The largely reduced electron density on the C&#8722;O&#8722; groups after discharge results in the unique proton affinity of the COF electrode and an excellent rate capability of up to 200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical proton storage plays an essential role in designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;rate energy storage devices, e.g., aqueous batteries. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs) are promising electrode materials, but their competitive proton and metal&#8208;ion insertion mechanisms remain elusive, and proton storage in COFs is rarely explored. Here, we report a perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;COF for fast proton storage in both a mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. We unveil that the discharged C&#8722;O&#8722; groups exhibit largely reduced basicity due to the considerable &#960;&#8208;delocalization in perinone, thus affording the 2D c&#8208;COF a unique affinity for protons with fast kinetics. As a consequence, the 2D c&#8208;COF electrode presents an outstanding rate capability of up to 200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (over 2500&#8197;C), surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated polymers, COFs, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Our work reports the first example of pure proton storage among COFs and highlights the great potential of BBL&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D conjugated polymers in future energy devices.

         <title>Photoredox Cascade Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Production with Biomass Photoreforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoredox cascade photocatalyst consisting of dual&#8208;dye sensitized Pt&#8208;TiO2 nanoparticle photocatalyst and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) molecular catalyst was constructed. The system produced H2 efficiently under blue&#8208;light to simultaneously generate one&#8208;electron oxidized TEMPO+ that oxidized various biomass substrates ranging from water&#8208;soluble glycerol to insoluble cellulose.







Abstract
Biomass photoreforming is a promising method to provide both a clean energy resource in the form of hydrogen (H2) and valuable chemicals as the results of water reduction and biomass oxidation. To overcome the poor contact between heterogeneous photocatalysts and biomass substrates, we fabricated a new photoredox cascade catalyst by combining a homogeneous catalyst, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;dye sensitized photocatalyst (DDSP) composed of two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridine photosensitizers (RuP6 and RuCP6) and Pt&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanoparticles. During blue&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;=460&#177;15&#8197;nm; 80&#8197;mW), the DDSP photocatalytically reduced aqueous protons to form H2 and simultaneously oxidized TEMPO&#8226; radicals to generate catalytically active TEMPO+. It oxidized biomass substrates (water&#8208;soluble glycerol and insoluble cellulose) to regenerate TEMPO&#8226;. In the presence of N&#8208;methyl imidazole as a proton transfer mediator, the photocatalytic H2 production activities for glycerol and cellulose reforming reached 2670 and 1590&#8197;&#956;mol H2 (gTiO2)&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which were comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Studies of Soluble Inorganic Nanostructures with X&#8208;rays and Neutrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced X&#8208;ray scattering and absorption as well as neutron scattering can extract structural information describing assembly and supramolecular assembly of soluble inorganic nanostructures (SoINs). Here we review the use of X&#8208;rays and neutrons for SoIN characterization, covering basic principles, practices, data analysis, and recent relevant studies that probe the solution state of materials/inorganic chemistry.







Abstract
This Review addresses the use of X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering as well as X&#8208;ray absorption to describe how inorganic nanostructured materials assemble, evolve, and function in solution. We first provide an overview of techniques and instrumentation (both large user facilities and benchtop).

&lt;p&gt;Advanced X-ray scattering and absorption as well as neutron scattering can extract structural information describing assembly and supramolecular assembly of soluble inorganic nanostructures (SoINs). Here we review the use of X-rays and neutrons for SoIN characterization, covering basic principles, practices, data analysis, and recent relevant studies that probe the solution state of materials/inorganic chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Review addresses the use of X-ray and neutron scattering as well as X-ray absorption to describe how inorganic nanostructured materials assemble, evolve, and function in solution. We first provide an overview of techniques and instrumentation (both large user facilities and benchtop). We review recent studies of soluble inorganic nanostructure assembly, covering the disciplines of materials synthesis, processes in nature, nuclear materials, and the widely applicable fundamental processes of hydrophobic interactions and ion pairing. Reviewed studies cover size regimes and length scales ranging from sub-&#197;ngstr&#246;m (coordination chemistry and ion pairing) to several nanometers (molecular clusters, i.e. polyoxometalates, polyoxocations, and metal-organic polyhedra), to the mesoscale (supramolecular assembly processes). Reviewed studies predominantly exploit 1)&#8197;SAXS/WAXS/SANS (small- and wide-angle X-ray or neutron scattering), 2)&#8197;PDF (pair-distribution function analysis of X-ray total scattering), and 3)&#8197;XANES and EXAFS (X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure, respectively). While the scattering techniques provide structural information, X-ray absorption yields the oxidation state in addition to the local coordination. Our goal for this Review is to provide information and inspiration for the inorganic/materials science communities that may benefit from elucidating the role of solution speciation in natural and synthetic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Role of Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Tethered Benzimidazolium Cation in Promoting CO2/Pure Water Co&#8208;Electrolysis to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through investigating the organic cation effect on CO2 electroreduction, benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) was found to synergistically enhance CO2 to C2+ product (mainly C2H4) conversion over Cu electrode. As a result, the use of Beim+&#8208;containing alkaline ionomer yielded a high C2H4 partial current density of 331&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), as a promising route to realize negative carbon emissions, is known to be strongly affected by electrolyte cations (i.e., cation effect). In contrast to the widely&#8208;studied alkali cations in liquid electrolytes, the effect of organic cations grafted on alkaline polyelectrolytes (APE) remains unexplored, although APE has already become an essential component of CO2 electrolyzers. Herein, by studying the organic cation effect on CO2RR, we find that benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) significantly outperforms other commonly&#8208;used nitrogenous cations (R4N+) in promoting C2+ (mainly C2H4) production over copper electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that the Beim+ can synergistically boost the CO2 to *CO conversion and reduce the proton supply at the electrocatalytic interface, thus facilitating the *CO dimerization toward C2+ formation. By utilizing the homemade APE ionomer, we further realize efficient C2H4 production at an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 331&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis, thanks to the dual&#8208;role of Beim+ in synergistic catalysis and ionic conduction. This study provides a new avenue to boost CO2RR through the structural design of polyelectrolytes.

         <title>A Porphyrin Iron(III) &#960;&#8208;Dication Species and its Relevance in Catalyst Design for the Umpolung of Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key intermediate in bioinspired umpolung of nucleophiles is an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication. We identify that the meso&#8208;substituent of the porphyrin controls its accessibility and report the detailed study of an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication with the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin ligand. We investigate the dynamics of the system and extensively characterize the species, providing crucial information for future catalyst design. Finally, we correlate the meso&#8208;substituent nature to catalytic chlorination reactivity.







Abstract
Isoporphyrins have recently been identified as remarkable species capable of turning the nucleophile attached to the porphyrin ring into an electrophile, thereby providing umpolung of reactivity (Inorg. Chem. 2022, 61, 8105&#8211;8111). They are generated by nucleophilic attack on an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication, a class of species that has received scant attention. Here, we explore the effect of the porphyrin meso&#8208;substituent and report a iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication bearing the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) ligand. We provide an extensive study of the species by UV/Vis absorption, 2H&#8197;NMR, EPR, applied field M&#246;ssbauer, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. We further explore the system's highly dynamic and tunable properties and address the nature of the axial ligands as well as the conformation of the porphyrin ring. The insights presented are essential for the rational design of catalysts for the umpolung of nucleophiles. Such catalytic avenues could for example provide a novel method for electrophilic chlorinations. We further examine the importance of electronic tuning of the porphyrin by nature of the meso&#8208;substituent as a factor in catalyst design.

         <title>Green Solvent Processable, Asymmetric Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Layer Material for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hole transport layer material (BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O) for perovskite solar cells is designed, introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. It capable of achieving high crystallinity even when processed from green solvents. The n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O without dopant delivered world&#8208;recorded power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The corresponding scaled modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) also deliver high PCEs over 20&#8201;%.







Abstract
The use of dopant&#8208;free hole transport layers (HTLs) is critical in stabilizing n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). However, these HTL materials are often processed with toxic solvents, which is not ideal for industrial production. Upon substituting them with green solvents, a trade&#8208;off emerges between maintaining the high crystallinity of the HTL materials and ensuring high solubility in the new solvents. In this paper, we designed a novel, linear, organic small molecule, BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O, by introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. This method not only overcomes the solubility limitations in green solvents but also enables stacking the conjugated main chains in two patterns, which further enhances crystallinity and hole mobility. As a result, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p pero&#8208;SCs based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or green (natural compound) solvent 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL that without any dopant delivered world&#8208;recorded power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The devices also demonstrated remarkable operational and high&#8208;temperature stabilities, maintaining over 84&#8201;% and 79.5&#8201;% of their initial efficiency for 2000&#8197;h, respectively. Encouragingly, dopant&#8208;free BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL exhibits significant advantages in large&#8208;area fabrication, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCEs exceeding 20&#8201;% for 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2 modules (active area: 15.64&#8197;cm2), even when processed using green solvents.

Their strong ECL emission is attributed to the following three factors: (i) the free rotation of the benzene ring is restricted, (ii) intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, and (iii) electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ and the electrode surface.







Abstract
The precisely modulated synthesis of programmable light&#8208;emitting materials remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we construct four tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures (SA, SB, SC, and SD), revealing that they exhibit higher electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensities and efficiencies than the tetraphenylethylene monomer and can be classified as highly efficient and precisely modulated intramolecular aggregation&#8211;induced electrochemiluminescence (PI&#8208;AIECL) systems. The best&#8208;performing system (SD) shows a high ECL cathodic efficiency exceeding that of the benchmark tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride in aqueous solution by nearly six&#8208;fold. The electrochemical characterization of these architectures in an organic solvent provides deeper mechanistic insights, revealing that SD features the lowest electrochemical band gap. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the band gap of the guest ligand in the SD structure is the smallest and most closely matched to that of the host scaffold. Finally, the SD system is used to realize ECL&#8208;based cysteine detection (detection limit=14.4&#8197;nM) in real samples. Thus, this study not only provides a precisely modulated supramolecular strategy allowing chromophores to be controllably regulated on a molecular scale, but also inspires the programmable synthesis of high&#8208;performance aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence emitters.

         <title>Rational Design of Porous Ionic Liquids for Coupling Natural Gas Purification with Waste Gas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Removal of trace impurities for natural gas purification coupled with waste gas conversion is highly desired in industry. We for the first time report a type of porous ionic liquids that can realize the continuous flow separation of CH4/CO2/H2S and the conversion of the captured H2S to useful products.







Abstract
Removal of trace impurities for natural gas purification coupled with waste gas conversion is highly desired in industry. We here report a type of porous ionic liquids (PILs) that can realize the continuous flow separation of CH4/CO2/H2S and the conversion of the captured H2S to useful products. The PILs are synthesized through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step surface modification of ionic liquids (ILs) onto UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH nanocrystals. The introduction of free tertiary amine groups on the nanocrystal surface endows these PILs with an exceptional ability to enrich H2S from CO2 and CH4 with impressive selectivity, while the permanent pores of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH act as containers to store an exceptionally higher amount of the selectively captured H2S than the corresponding nonporous ILs. Simultaneously, the tertiary amines as dual functional moieties offer effective catalytic sites for the conversion of the H2S stored in PILs into 3&#8208;mercaptoisobutyric acid, a key intermediate required for the synthesis of Captopril (an antihypertensive drug). Molecular dynamics, density functional theory calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations help understand both the mechanisms of separation and catalysis performance, confirming that the tertiary amines as well as the permanent pores in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH play vital roles in the whole procedure.

         <title>Aldol Condensation for the Construction of Organic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldol&#8208;condensation&#8208;derived organic functional materials have exerted a profound influence on n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), and NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. This all&#8208;encompassing Review highlights the recent decade's developments, charting the course for progress in this growing and multidisciplinary domain.







Abstract
Aldol condensation is a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable synthetic method, offering the advantages of low complexity, substrate universality, and high efficiency. Over the past decade, it has become popular for creating next&#8208;generation organic functional materials, particularly rigid&#8208;rod conjugated (semi)conductors. This review focuses on conjugated small molecules, oligomers, and polymeric (semi)conductors synthesized through aldol condensation, with emphasis on their remarkable features in advancing n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs) as well as NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. Coherence character, optical properties, microstructure, and chain conformation are investigated to understand material&#8208;property relationships. Future applications and challenges in this area are also discussed.

Fabrication of Pillar&#8208;Cage Fluorinated Anion Pillared Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via a Pillar Embedding Strategy and Efficient Separation of SO2 through Multi&#8208;Site Trapping







Abstract
Flue gas desulfurization is crucial for both human health and ecological environments. However, developing efficient SO2 adsorbents that can break the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity is still challenging. In this work, a new type of fluorinated anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8211;organic frameworks (APMOFs) with a pillar&#8208;cage structure is fabricated through pillar&#8208;embedding into a highly porous and robust framework. This type of APMOFs comprises smaller tetrahedral cages and larger icosahedral cages interconnected by embedded [NbOF5]2&#8722; and [TaOF5]2&#8722; anions acting as pillars. The APMOFs exhibits high porosity and density of fluorinated anions, ensuring exceptional SO2 adsorption capacity and ultrahigh selectivity for SO2/CO2 and SO2/N2 gas mixtures. Furthermore, these two structures demonstrate excellent stability towards water, acid/alkali, and SO2 adsorption. Cycle dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm the excellent separation performance of SO2/CO2 gas mixtures and their cyclic stability. SO2&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferred adsorption domains for SO2 molecules. The multiple&#8208;site host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions facilitate selective recognition and dense packing of SO2 in this hybrid porous material. This work will be instructive for designing porous materials for flue gas desulfurization and other gas&#8208;purification processes.

         <title>N=8 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons: Solution Synthesis and High Charge Carrier Mobility
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N=8 armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) were successfully synthesized in solution utilizing a custom arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibits a noteworthy near&#8208;infrared absorption profile which signifies an exceptionally low optical band gap of 0.52&#8197;eV and demonstrates a record high dc charge&#8208;carrier mobility of up to 270&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have emerged as promising candidates for nanoelectronic devices. Low band gap (&lt;1&#8197;eV) GNRs are particularly important when considering the Schottky barrier in device performance. Here, we demonstrate the first solution synthesis of 8&#8208;AGNRs through a carefully designed arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The efficiency of the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of the tailor&#8208;made polymer precursor into 8&#8208;AGNRs was validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy, and further supported by the synthesis of naphtho[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene derivatives (1 and 2) as subunits of 8&#8208;AGNR, with a width of 0.86&#8197;nm as suggested by the X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and solid&#8208;state NMR analyses provided further structural support for 8&#8208;AGNR. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibited a remarkable NIR absorption extending up to &#8764;2400&#8197;nm, corresponding to an optical band gap as low as &#8764;0.52&#8197;eV. Moreover, optical&#8208;pump TeraHertz&#8208;probe spectroscopy revealed charge&#8208;carrier mobility in the dc limit of &#8764;270&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the 8&#8208;AGNR.

The efficiency of the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of the tailor-made polymer precursor into 8-AGNRs was validated by FT-IR, Raman, and UV/Vis-near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy, and further supported by the synthesis of naphtho[1,2,3,4-&lt;i&gt;ghi&lt;/i&gt;]perylene derivatives (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) as subunits of &lt;b&gt;8-AGNR&lt;/b&gt;, with a width of 0.86&#8197;nm as suggested by the X-ray single crystal analysis. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and solid-state NMR analyses provided further structural support for &lt;b&gt;8-AGNR&lt;/b&gt;. The resulting &lt;b&gt;8-AGNR&lt;/b&gt; exhibited a remarkable NIR absorption extending up to &#8764;2400&#8197;nm, corresponding to an optical band gap as low as &#8764;0.52&#8197;eV. Moreover, optical-pump TeraHertz-probe spectroscopy revealed charge-carrier mobility in the &lt;i&gt;dc&lt;/i&gt; limit of &#8764;270&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the &lt;b&gt;8-AGNR&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Reversible Six&#8208;Electron Transfer Cathode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite with facilitated electrochemical kinetics and feasible thermodynamics is proposed as a promising six&#8208;electron transfer cathode for aqueous Zn batteries. The reversible three&#8208;phase conversion (TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe) and proton&#8208;dependent reaction mechanism of the nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite is newly revealed and unambiguously verified.







Abstract
The electrochemical reactions for the storage of Zn2+ while embracing more electron transfer is a foundation of the future high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we report a six&#8208;electron transfer electrochemistry of nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C (n&#8208;TeO2/C) cathode by facilitating the reversible conversion of TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe. Benefitting from the integrated conductive nanostructure and the proton&#8208;rich environment in providing optimized electrochemical kinetics (facilitated Zn2+ uptake and high electronic conductivity) and feasible thermodynamic process (low Gibbs free energy change), the as&#8208;prepared n&#8208;TeO2/C with stable cycling performance exhibits a superior reversible capacity of over 800&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. A precise understanding of the reaction mechanism via ex situ and in situ characterizations presents that the reversible six&#8208;electron transfer reaction is proton&#8208;dependent, and a proton generating and consuming mechanism of three&#8208;phase conversion n&#8208;TeO2/C in the weakly acidic electrolyte is thoroughly revealed.

         <title>Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents Enable Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Achiral Luminophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation of an achiral fluorescent dye in a chiral deep eutectic solvent enables the generation of full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Herein, chiral deep eutectic solvents (DES) are prepared by lauric acid as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and chiral menthol as hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). When achiral fluorescent molecules are dopedin the menthol&#8208;based chiral DES, they emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with handedness controlled by the molecular chirality (l or d) of menthol. Remarkably, the strategy is universal and a series of achiral fluorescent molecules can be endowed with CPL activity, showing a full&#8208;color and white CPL upon appropriate mixing, which paves the way to prepare white CPL materials. Interestingly, CPL appears only in a certain temperature range in the DES. Variable&#8208;temperature spectra and other characterization methods reveal that the H&#8208;bond network in the chiral DES plays an important role in inducing CPL. This work unveils how the interior structure as well as the hydrogen&#8208;bond network of a chiral DES can transfer its chirality to achiral luminophores for the first time and realizes a full&#8208;color and white CPL in a DES.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electron Buffer Layer on ZnOx&#8722;Fe5C2&#8722;Fe3O4 Boosts Ethanol Synthesis from CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;based electron buffer layer was employed to neutralize the excessive electrons transferred from ZnOx to Fe species. A suitable CO adsorption strength and C&#8722;C coupling barrier was achieved as a consequence of the Fe&#8208;based active sites, yielding a high ethanol yield of 366.6&#8197;gEtOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 from CO2+H2. The result differs from the common ZnFe bimetallic catalyst for which hydrocarbons dominate.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into ethanol with renewable H2 has attracted tremendous attention due to its integrated functions of carbon elimination and chemical synthesis, but remains challenging. The electronic properties of a catalyst are essential to determine the adsorption strength and configuration of the key intermediates, therefore altering the reaction network for targeted synthesis. Herein, we describe a catalytic system in which a carbon buffer layer is employed to tailor the electronic properties of the ternary ZnOx&#8722;Fe5C2&#8722;Fe3O4, in which the electron&#8208;transfer pathway (ZnOx&#8594;Fe species or carbon layer) ensures the appropriate adsorption strength of &#8722;CO* on the catalytic interface, facilitating C&#8722;C coupling between &#8722;CHx* and &#8722;CO* for ethanol synthesis. Benefiting from this unique electron&#8208;transfer buffering effect, an extremely high ethanol yield of 366.6&#8197;gEtOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (with CO of 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% co&#8208;feeding) is achieved from CO2 hydrogenation. This work provides a powerful electronic modulation strategy for catalyst design in terms of highly oriented synthesis.

         <title>Azopolyesters with Intrinsic Crystallinity and Photoswitchable Reversible Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Liquid Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides possess remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and novel photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities, owing to photoinduced trans&#8208;cis isomerizations of azobenzenes being inlaid with soft alkyl side&#8208;chain. This represents a new design strategy for the synthesis of reversible adhesives.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce a variety of azopolyesters (azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters) with remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. The length of the soft alkyl side&#8208;chain inlaid with azobenzenes and stereoregularity of main&#8208;chain of azopolymers have tremendous effects on crystallization properties of the resulting polyesters with melting temperature (Tm) in the range of 51&#8211;251&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, some of azopolyesters possess excellently photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition performance thanks to trans&#8208;cis photoisomerization of azobenzenes. Trans&#8208;azopolyesters are yellow solids with Tms or glass transition temperatures (Tgs) above room temperature, whereas cis&#8208;polymers are red liquids with Tgs below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. These azopolyesters could be applied as novel light&#8208;switchable adhesives for quartz/quartz, wood/wood and quartz/wood adhesion, with the strength in the range of 0.73&#8211;0.89&#8197;MPa for trans&#8208;polymers. Conversely, the adhesion strength of liquefied cis&#8208;azopolyesters generated from the irradiation of trans&#8208;polymers by UV light was about 0.1&#8197;MPa, which shows light enable to control the adhesion process with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Locking the Conformation of a Paddlewheel Rhodium Complex: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Catalytic Nitrene Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design principle for the modification of Rh2(esp)2 is presented. The introduction of a subtle substituent can freeze the conformational dynamics of the parent catalyst, allowing for the isolation of two conformationally distinct complexes. The utility of the conformational fixation in the development of stereoselective catalysts has been demonstrated in three model cases.







Abstract
The exponential proliferation of conformers makes it impossible to examine the entire population in most systems. Controlling conformational ensembles is thus pivotal in many areas of chemistry. Rh2(esp)2, a dicarboxylate&#8208;derived paddlewheel rhodium complex, is one of the most effective catalysts for nitrene chemistry. Its enormous success has led to preparing many analogous complexes. However, there has been little consideration for the conformational dynamics of the parent catalyst. Herein, we report a new ligand modification principle that prevents conformer interconversion. The resulting complex comprises two isolable conformers, whose structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Combined experimental and computational data has revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the conformationally confined and parent complexes. Three model cases have demonstrated the utility of conformational fixation in the development of stereoselective catalysts for nitrene transfer reactions. The design principle described in this study can be combined with other established modification strategies, serving as a springboard for further advancement of the chemistry of paddlewheel metal complexes.

         <title>Biogenetic Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents that Produce Self&#8208;Assembled Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfer of chirality from chiral deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to achiral solutes has been used to control self&#8208;assembly. The DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, with chirality amplification in the presence of minimal amounts of entrapped chiral acids occurring through the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the solutes during aggregation.







Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) show particular properties compared to ionic liquids and other traditional organic solvents. Controlled synthesis of chiral materials in DESs is unprecedented due to the complex interplays between DESs and solutes. In this work, all bio&#8208;derived chiral DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, which performed as chiral matrices for the rational synthesis of chiroptical materials by taking advantage of the efficient chirality transfer between the DESs and solutes. In a very selective manner, building units with molecular pockets could facilitate strong binding affinity towards chiral acid components of DESs disregarding the presence of competitive hydrogen bonding acceptors. Chirality transfer from DESs to nanoassemblies leads to chirality amplification in the presence of minimal amounts of entrapped chiral acids, thanks to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of solutes during aggregation. This work utilizes chiral DESs to control supramolecular chirality, and illustrates the structural basis for the fabrication of DES&#8208;based chiral materials.

         <title>Alignment of Heptagonal Diimide and Triazine Enables Narrowband Pure&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The endeavor to develop high&#8208;performance narrowband blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with low efficiency roll&#8208;off represents an attractive challenge. Herein, we introduce a hetero&#8208;acceptor design strategy centered around the heptagonal diimide (BPI) building block to create an efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer. The alignment of a twisted BPI unit and a planar diphenyltriazine (TRZ) fragment imparts remarkable exciton dynamic properties to 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI, including a fast radiative decay rate (kR) of 1.0 &#215; 107 s&#8208;1 and a swift reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.8 &#215; 106 s&#8208;1, complemented by a slow non&#8208;radiative decay rate (kNR) of 6.0 &#215; 103 s&#8208;1. Consequently, 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI facilitates the fabrication of high&#8208;performance narrowband pure&#8208;blue TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.3% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off even at a high brightness level of 10000 cd m&#8208;2 (EQE10000: 16.8%). This showcases a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency at a high luminance level of 10000 cd m&#8208;2 for narrowband blue TSF&#8208;OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol Catalysed by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large scale production of green methanol obtained from CO2 and green hydrogen is a highly wanted process due to the role of methanol as hydrogen/energy carrier and for the production of chemicals. Starting with a short summary of the advantages of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts in liquid&#8208;phase reactions, the present article highlights the opportunities that MOFs may offer also for some gas&#8208;phase reactions, in particular for the selective CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. It is commented that there is a temperature compatibility window that combines the thermal stability of some MOFs with the temperature required in the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol that frequently ranges from 250 to 300 oC. The existing literature in this area is briefly summarized organized according to the role of MOF as providing the active sites or as support of active metal nanoparticles. Emphasis is made to show how the flexibility in design and synthesis of MOFs can be used to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes and the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity, as well as the role that should play theoretical calculations in models have been also highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Co doped 1T&#8208;MoS2 Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst will determine the mass distributions of hydrogen&#8208;powered clean technologies, while still faces grand challenges. In this work, a synergistic ligand modulation plus Co doping strategy is applied to 1T&#8208;MoS2 catalyst via CoMo&#8208;metal&#8208;organic frameworks precursors, boosting the HER catalytic activity and durability of 1T&#8208;MoS2. Confirmed by Cs corrected transmission electron microscope and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the polydentate 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane ligand can stably link with two&#8208;dimensional 1T&#8208;MoS2 layers through cobalt sites to expand interlayer spacing of MoS2 (Co&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;bpe), which promotes active site exposure, accelerates water dissociation, and optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H in alkaline HER processes. Theoretical calculations indicate the promotions in the electronic structure of 1T&#8208;MoS2 originate in the formation of three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic constructs by linking &#960;&#8208;conjugated ligand, which weakens the hybridization between Mo&#8208;3d and S&#8208;2p orbitals, and in turn makes S&#8208;2p orbital more suitable for hybridization with H&#8208;1s orbital. Therefore, Co&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;bpe exhibits excellent stability and exceedingly low overpotential for alkaline HER (118 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2). In addition, integrated into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Co&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;bpe is much superior to the Pt/C catalyst at the large current densities.

In this work, a synergistic ligand modulation plus Co doping strategy is applied to 1T-MoS2 catalyst via CoMo-metal-organic frameworks precursors, boosting the HER catalytic activity and durability of 1T-MoS2. Confirmed by Cs corrected transmission electron microscope and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the polydentate 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane ligand can stably link with two-dimensional 1T-MoS2 layers through cobalt sites to expand interlayer spacing of MoS2 (Co-1T-MoS2-bpe), which promotes active site exposure, accelerates water dissociation, and optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H in alkaline HER processes. Theoretical calculations indicate the promotions in the electronic structure of 1T-MoS2 originate in the formation of three-dimensional metal-organic constructs by linking &#960;-conjugated ligand, which weakens the hybridization between Mo-3d and S-2p orbitals, and in turn makes S-2p orbital more suitable for hybridization with H-1s orbital. Therefore, Co-1T-MoS2-bpe exhibits excellent stability and exceedingly low overpotential for alkaline HER (118 mV at 10 mA cm-2). In addition, integrated into an anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Co-1T-MoS2-bpe is much superior to the Pt/C catalyst at the large current densities. This study provides a feasible ligand modulation strategy for designs of two-dimensional catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Desymmetrization of Geminal Difluoromethylenes using a Palladium/Copper/Lithium Ternary System for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Fluorinated Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated amino acids and related peptides/proteins have been found widespread applications in pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds. However, strategies for introducing a C&#8208;F bond into amino acids in an enantioselective manner are still limited and no such asymmetric catalysis strategy has been reported. Herein, we have successfully developed a Pd/Cu/Li ternary system for stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This method involves a sequential desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes and allylic substitution with amino acid Schiff bases via Pd/Li and Pd/Cu dual activation, respectively. A series of non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a chiral allylic/benzylic fluorine motif are easily synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and &gt;99% ee). A density functional theory (DFT) study revealed the F&#8208;Cu interaction of the allylic substrate and the Cu catalyst significantly influence the stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereodivergent ring&#8208;closing reaction of aminoenynes with aldehydes and boronic acids or hydrosilane is developed. This three&#8208;component reaction allows for the modular synthesis of a series of exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5&#8208; to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. The reactions utilize a simple Pd&#8208;catalyst and work with broad range of aminoenynes, aldehydes and organometallic reagents under mild reaction conditions. The products represent useful intermediates for chemical synthesis due to the versatility of the conjugated diene. Preliminary mechanistic details of the method are also revealed.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and convenient approach that combines high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) with machine learning (ML) technologies to achieve the first selective cross&#8208;dimerization of sulfoxonium ylides via iridium catalysis is presented.

This mild method avoids the use of diazo compounds and is characterized by simple operation, high step&#8208;economy, and excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility.&#160;The combined experimental and computational studies identify an amide&#8208;sulfoxonium ylide as a carbene precursor. Furthermore, a comprehensive exploration of the reaction space is also performed (600 reactions) and a machine learning model for reaction yield prediction has been constructed.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Recognition in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity: Tuning the Complementarity of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise binding towards structurally similar substrates is a common feature of biomolecular recognition. However, achieving such selectivity especially in distinguishing subtle differences in substrates with synthetic hosts can be quite challenging. Herein, we report a novel design strategy of combining different rigid skeletons to adjust the distance of recognition sites within the cavity, which allows for highly selective recognition of hydrogen bonding complementary substrates, such as 4&#8208;chromanone. X&#8208;ray single crystal structures and Density Functional Theory calculations confirmed that the distance of endo&#8208;functionalized groups within the rigid cavity is crucial for achieving high binding selectivity via hydrogen bonding. The thermodynamic data and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a significant influence of the hydrophobic cavity on binding affinity. The new receptor possesses both high selectivity and high affinity, which provide valuable insights for the design of customized receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C&#8208;H Amination Assisted by an Isolated Iron&#8208;Imido Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the use of a base metal complex [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe(OEt2)] (1&#8208;OEt2) (pyrpyrr22&#8722; = 3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine) as a catalyst for intermolecular amination of Csp3&#8722;H bonds of 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene (2a) using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl phenyl azide (3a) as the nitrene source. The reaction is complete within one hour at 80 &#176;C using as low as 2 mol% 1&#8208;OEt2 with control in selectivity for single C&#8722;H amination versus double C&#8722;H amination. Catalytic C&#8722;H amination reactions can be extended to other substrates such as cyclohexadiene and xanthene derivatives and can tolerate a variety of aryl azides having methyl groups in both ortho positions. Under stoichiometric conditions the imido radical species [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{=N(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)] (1&#8208;imido) can be isolated in 56% yield, and spectroscopic, magnetometric, and computational studies confirmed it to be an S = 1 FeIV complex. Complex 1&#8208;imido reacts with 2a to produce the ferrous aniline adduct [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{NH(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)(C14H11)}] (1&#8208;aniline) in 45% yield.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Lewis Pairs in the Assembly of Supramolecular Macrocycles, Molecular Cages, Polymers, and 3D&#8208;Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covering an exceptionally wide range of bond strengths, the dynamic nature and facile tunability of dative B&#8208;N bonds is highly attractive when it comes to the assembly of supramolecular polymers and materials. This review offers an overview of advances in the development of functional materials where Lewis pairs (LPs) play a key role in their assembly and critically influence their properties. Specifically, we describe the reversible assembly of linear polymers with interesting optical, electronic and catalytic properties, discrete macrocycles and molecular cages that take up diverse guest molecules and undergo structural changes triggered by external stimuli, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with intriguing interlocked structures that can embed and separate gases such as CO2 and acetylene, and soft polymer networks that serve as recyclable, self&#8208;healing, and responsive thermosets, gels and elastomeric materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) well&#8208;ordered and highly integrated graphene hybrid architectures are considered to be next&#8208;generation multifunctional graphene materials but still remain elusive.

         <title>Absolute CO2/Xenon Separation in Ultramicropore MOF for Anesthetic Gases Regeneration</title>

A portable closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery device is highly needed to guarantee sufficient supply for clinical anesthetic purposes. Herein, an innovative way to recover Xe in exhaled anesthetic gases by using hydrolytically stable NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni MOF is reported. The unprecedented CO2/Xe selectivity (825) of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve 99.16&#8201;% Xe recovery in exhaled gases, making it an ideal adsorbent for actual Xe anesthesia gas regeneration.







Abstract
Xe is an ideal anesthetic gas, but it has not been widely used in practice due to its high cost and low output. Closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling is an economically viable method to ensure adequate supply in medical use. Herein, we design an innovative way to recover Xe by using a stable fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni to eliminate CO2 from moist exhaled anesthetic gases. Unlike other Xe recovery MOFs with low Xe/CO2 selectivity (less than 10), NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve absolute molecular sieve separation of CO2/Xe with excellent CO2 selectivity (825). Mixed&#8208;gas breakthrough experiments assert the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni as a molecular sieve adsorbent for the effective and energy&#8208;efficient removal of carbon dioxide with 99.16&#8201;% Xe recovery. Absolute CO2/Xe separation in NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni makes closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling can be easily realized, demonstrating the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni for important anesthetic gas regeneration under ambient conditions.

         <title>Mesoporous Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Catalytic RNA Deprotection and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the pore size of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystal into the mesopore regime (2 to 50&#8197;nm) not only allows RNA molecules to enter but also their chemical conversion within the pores. The orderly aligned metal sites in the pores efficiently catalyse the removal of propargyl carbonate protecting groups from the RNA, restoring their original bioactivity.







Abstract
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with mespores (2 to 50&#8197;nm) allows the inclusion of large biomolecules, such as nucleic acids. However, chemical reaction on the nucleic acids, to further regulate their bioactivity, is yet to be demonstrated within MOF pores. Here, we report the deprotection of carbonate protected RNA molecules (21 to 102&#8197;nt) to restore their original activity using a MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst. Two MOFs, MOF&#8208;626 and MOF&#8208;636 are designed and synthesized, with mesopores of 2.2 and 2.8&#8197;nm, respectively, carrying isolated metal sites (Ni, Co, Cu, Pd, Rh and Ru). The pores favor the entrance of RNA, while the metal sites catalyze C&#8722;O bond cleavage at the carbonate group. Complete conversion of RNA is achieved by Pd&#8208;MOF&#8208;626, 90&#8197;times more efficiently than Pd(NO3)2. MOF crystals are also removable from the aqueous reaction media, leaving a negligible metal footprint, 3.9&#8197;ppb, only 1/55 of that using homogeneous Pd catalysts. These features make MOF potentially suited for bioorthogonal chemistry.

         <title>Naphth[4]arene: Synthesis, Conformations, and Application in Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Crystalline Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphth[4]arene (NA[4]A), a new kind of macrocyclic arene, is synthesized by a macrocycle conversion approach. Benefiting from the flexible conformation of NA[4]A, two conformation&#8208;dependent supramolecular crystalline assemblies between NA[4]A and TCNB are selectively fabricated, and show color&#8208;tunable fluorescence and two&#8208;photon excited upconversion emission regulated by the macrocyclic conformations.







Abstract
Although the chemistry of macrocyclic arenes has seen rapid development in recent years, the synthesis of new macrocyclic arenes from aromatic rings with no directing groups remains a challenge. In this work, a new macrocyclic arene, naphth[4]arene (NA[4]A), composed of four naphthalene rings bridged by methylene groups, was synthesized using macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;macrocycle conversion. NA[4]A shows 1,3&#8208;alternate and 1,2&#8208;alternate conformations in the solid state, which can be selectively obtained. By supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of NA[4]A and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) in different concentrations and temperatures, two conformation&#8208;dependent crystalline luminescent co&#8208;assemblies 1,2&#8208;NTC and 1,3&#8208;NTC can be selectively prepared. Interestingly, the two charge&#8208;transfer crystalline assemblies containing NA[4]A with different conformations show bright yellow and green fluorescence, and also display high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 45&#8201;% and 43&#8201;%. Furthermore, they exhibit color&#8208;tunable two&#8208;photon excited upconversion emission.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Metal Oxide Interactions in Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 Catalysts Drive Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation evolve into a unique nanostructure under CO2 hydrogenation conditions, leading to selective and stable methanol production. Space and time&#8208;resolved operando characterization and simulations reveal that the rapid restructuring process leads to InPdx alloy particles decorated by InOx layers, whose proximity is crucial to avoiding performance losses typically observed when palladium agglomerates.







Abstract
Ternary Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit technological potential for CO2&#8208;based methanol synthesis, but developing scalable systems and comprehending complex dynamic behaviors of the active phase, promoter, and carrier are key for achieving high productivity. Here, we show that the structure of Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 systems prepared by wet impregnation evolves under CO2 hydrogenation conditions into a selective and stable architecture, independent of the order of addition of Pd and In phases on the zirconia carrier. Detailed operando characterization and simulations reveal a rapid restructuring driven by the metal&#8208;metal oxide interaction energetics. The proximity of InPdx alloy particles decorated by InOx layers in the resulting architecture prevents performance losses associated with Pd sintering. The findings highlight the crucial role of reaction&#8208;induced restructuring in complex CO2 hydrogenation catalysts and offer insights into the optimal integration of acid&#8208;base and redox functions for practical implementation.

         <title>Reforming the Uniformity of Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Nanoscale Structure Regulation for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is proposed and constructed to improve the uniformity of SEI, in which LiNxOy generated by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives occupies the top layer and LiF formed by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) dominates the bottom layer next to lithium metal anodes. A lithium metal pouch cell with a specific energy of 430&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the cell level undergoes 173&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries depends on the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes. Rationally improving SEI uniformity is hindered by poorly understanding the effect of structure and components of SEI on its uniformity. Herein, a bilayer structure of SEI formed by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes was demonstrated to improve SEI uniformity. In the bilayer SEI, LiNxOy generated by ISDN occupies top layer and LiF dominates bottom layer next to anode. The uniformity of lithium deposition is remarkably improved with the bilayer SEI, mitigating the consumption rate of active lithium and electrolytes. The cycle life of lithium metal batteries with bilayer SEI is three times as that with common anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions. A prototype lithium metal pouch cell of 430&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 undergoes 173&#8197;cycles. This work demonstrates the effect of a reasonable structure of SEI on reforming SEI uniformity.

         <title>Accelerated Multi&#8208;step Sulfur Redox Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by Dual Defects in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;based Catalysts</title>

A novel dual&#8208;defect MOF, which incorporates both linker defects and cluster defects, is reported as a new type of sulfur catalyst to achieve targeted and synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of polysulfides.







Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Accelerated conversion by catalysis can mitigate these issues, leading to enhanced Li&#8722;S performance. However, a catalyst with single active site cannot simultaneously accelerate multiple LiPSs conversion. Herein, we developed a novel dual&#8208;defect (missing linker and missing cluster defects) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a new type of catalyst to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of LiPSs. Electrochemical tests and first&#8208;principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that different defects can realize targeted acceleration of stepwise reaction kinetics for LiPSs. Specifically, the missing linker defects can selectively accelerate the conversion of S8&#8594;Li2S4, while the missing cluster defects can catalyze the reaction of Li2S4&#8594;Li2S, so as to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect. Hence, the Li&#8722;S battery with an electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio of 8.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivers a capacity of 1087&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after 100&#8197;cycles. Even at high sulfur loading of 12.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and E/S=3.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1, an areal capacity of 10.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 45&#8197;cycles can still be obtained.

         <title>Fast and Non&#8208;equilibrium Uptake of Hydrogen by Pd Icosahedral Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon absorbing hydrogen, the PdHx in icosahedral nanocrystals exists in one single phase and the single&#8208;phase pathway can bypass the formation of high&#8208;energy phase boundaries involved in the conventional two&#8208;phase pathway. The single&#8208;phase pathway is instrumental to the facile and fast synthesis of PdHx nanocrystals with controllable compositions for different catalytic applications.







Abstract
We report for the first time that Pd nanocrystals can absorb H via a &#8220;single&#8208;phase pathway&#8221; when particles with a proper combination of shape and size are used. Specifically, when Pd icosahedral nanocrystals of 7&#8208; and 12&#8208;nm in size are exposed to H atoms, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide each particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of phase boundaries is no longer favored. As such, absorption of H atoms is dominated by the single&#8208;phase pathway and one can readily obtain PdHx with anyx in the range of 0&#8211;0.7. When switched to Pd octahedral nanocrystals, the single&#8208;phase pathway is only observed for particles of 7&#8197;nm in size. We also establish that the H&#8208;absorption kinetics will be accelerated if there is a tensile strain in the nanocrystals due to the increase in lattice spacing. Besides the unique H&#8208;absorption behaviors, the PdHx (x=0&#8211;0.7) icosahedral nanocrystals show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward the formic acid oxidation due tothe decrease in chemical potential for H atoms in a Pd lattice under tensile strain.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Phase&#8208;Separating Fluorescent Molecules for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we designed a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compound that forms molecular coacervates based on liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the aqueous solution. The molecular coacervates deliver proteins into mammalian cells and disperse the payload within the cytosol upon photoillumination. This work showcases a small&#8208;molecule coacervation system and photoresponsive cytosolic protein delivery.







Abstract
Cellular membranes, including the plasma and endosome membranes, are barriers to outside proteins. Various vehicles have been devised to deliver proteins across the plasma membrane, but in many cases, the payload gets trapped in the endosome. Here we designed a photo&#8208;responsive phase&#8208;separating fluorescent molecule (PPFM) with a molecular weight of 666.8 daltons. The PPFM compound condensates as fluorescent droplets in the aqueous solution by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), which disintegrate upon photoirradiation with a 405&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) lamp within 20&#8197;min or a 405&#8197;nm laser within 3&#8197;min. The PPFM coacervates recruit a wide range of peptides and proteins and deliver them into mammalian cells. Photolysis disperses the payload from condensates into the cytosolic space. Altogether, a type of small molecules that are photo&#8208;responsive and phase separating are discovered; their coacervates can serve as transmembrane vehicles for intracellular delivery of proteins, whereas photo illumination triggers the cytosolic distribution of the payload.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Mediated Interbacterial Communication Activates Silent Secondary Metabolite Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial MVs induced silent secondary metabolite production in a wide range of bacteria by imitating interbacterial interactions. X.&#8197;innexi activated the production of xeinamides, xeidopeptides and xenoamicins through quorum sensing suppression by B.&#8197;multivorans MVs treatment. Xenoamicins carried in X.&#8197;innexi MVs suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, indicating interbacterial hostile interaction by MVs and secondary metabolites.







Abstract
Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed Burkholderia multivorans MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. A mechanistic analysis of MV&#8208;induced metabolite production in Xenorhabdus innexi suggested that the B.&#8197;multivorans MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in X.&#8197;innexi. In turn, the X.&#8197;innexi MVs carrying some MV&#8208;induced peptides suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, highlighting the interspecies communication between B.&#8197;multivorans and X.&#8197;innexi through MV exchange.

         <title>Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Isomerization of Novel Octamolybdate Anions within a Microporous Hybrid Framework with Robust Water Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sequential thermally&#8208;triggered single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal isomerizations of novel octamolybdate anions occur within a hybrid coordination network formed by the assembly of polyoxometalate clusters and copper(II)&#8208;complexes of a macrocyclic tetraaza ligand. Up to three different microporous phases with accessible voids can be isolated, which exhibit robust water sorption properties.







Abstract
The 3D hybrid framework [{Cu(cyclam)}3(&#954;&#8208;Mo8O27)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (1) (cyclam=1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) undergoes sequential single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations upon heating to afford two different anhydrous phases (2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a). These transitions modify the framework dimensionality and enable the isomerization of &#954;&#8208;octamolybdate (&#954;&#8208;Mo8) anions into &#955; (2&#8201;a) and &#956; (3&#8201;a) forms through metal migration. Hydration of 3&#8201;a involves condensation of one water molecule to the cluster to afford the &#947;&#8208;Mo8 isomer in 4, which dehydrates back into 3&#8201;a through the 6&#8201;a intermediate. In contrast, 2&#8201;a reversibly hydrates to form 5, exhibiting the same Mo8 cluster as that of 1. It is remarkable that three of the Mo8 clusters (&#954;, &#955; and &#956;) are new and that up to three different microporous phases can be isolated from 1 (2&#8201;a, 3&#8201;a, and 6&#8201;a). Water vapor sorption analyses show high recyclability and the highest uptake values for POM&#8208;based systems. The isotherms display an abrupt step at low humidity level desirable for humidity control devices or water harvesting in drylands.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of Heptacoordinated FeIII Bifunctional Complexes for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, [Fe2L2(H2O)2(SO4)].2(CH4O)] (C2), has been designed to optimize H2O splitting activity via strategically altering the ligand substitution. The favourable structural conformation with bridging &#8722;SO42&#8722; and engineered electronic environment facilitate the intramolecular oxo&#8208;oxo coupling leading to O&#8722;O bond formation during electrolysis, which effectively enhanced the catalytic functionalities of C2.







Abstract
In this research, highly efficient heterogeneous bifunctional (BF) electrocatalysts (ECs) have been strategically designed by Fe coordination (CR) complexes, [Fe2L2(H2O)2Cl2] (C1) and [Fe2L2(H2O)2(SO4)].2(CH4O) (C2) where the high seven CR number synergistically modifies the electronic environment of the Fe centre for facilitation of H2O electrolysis. The electronic status of Fe and its adjacent atomic sites have been further modified by the replacement of &#8722;Cl&#8722; in C1 by &#8722;SO42&#8722; in C2. Interestingly, compared to C1, the O&#8722;S&#8722;O bridged C2 reveals superior BF activity with extremely low overpotential (&#951;) at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (140&#8197;mVOER, 62&#8197;mVHER) and small Tafel slope (120.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1OER, 45.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1HER). Additionally, C2 also facilitates a high&#8208;performance alkaline H2O electrolyzer with cell voltage of 1.54&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits remarkable long&#8208;term stability. Thus, exploration of the intrinsic properties of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based ECs opens up a new approach to the rational design of a wide range of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Reversible Reforming between Ethylamine and Acetonitrile on Heterostructured Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets</title>

In this work, a successful development of an ethylenediamine&#8208;acetonitrile electrochemical reversible reformation system was achieved, utilizing a Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 heterostructured catalyst synthesized through an in situ construction strategy as the multifunctional catalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of electrocatalysts is essential to achieve desirable performance of electrochemical synthesis process. Heterostructured catalysts have thus attracted widespread attention due to their multifunctional intrinsic properties, and diverse catalytic applications with corresponding outstanding activities. Here, we report an in situ restoration strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Such Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets exhibit excellent activity and selectivity towards reversible electrochemical reforming of ethylamine and acetonitrile. In the acetonitrile reduction process, Pd acts as reaction center, while Ni(OH)2 provide proton hydrogen through promoting the dissociation of water. Also ethylamine oxidation process can be achieved on the surface of the heterostructured nanosheets with abundant Ni(II) defects. More importantly, an electrolytic cell driven by solar cells was successfully constructed to realize ethylamine&#8208;acetonitrile reversible reforming. This work demonstrates the importance of heterostructure engineering in the rational synthesis of multifunctional catalysts towards electrochemical synthesis of fine chemicals.

&lt;p&gt;Rational design of electrocatalysts is essential to achieve desirable performance of electrochemical synthesis process. Heterostructured catalysts have thus attracted widespread attention due to their multifunctional intrinsic properties, and diverse catalytic applications with corresponding outstanding activities. Here, we report an in situ restoration strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin Pd-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. Such Pd-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets exhibit excellent activity and selectivity towards reversible electrochemical reforming of ethylamine and acetonitrile. In the acetonitrile reduction process, Pd acts as reaction center, while Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provide proton hydrogen through promoting the dissociation of water. Also ethylamine oxidation process can be achieved on the surface of the heterostructured nanosheets with abundant Ni(II) defects. More importantly, an electrolytic cell driven by solar cells was successfully constructed to realize ethylamine-acetonitrile reversible reforming. This work demonstrates the importance of heterostructure engineering in the rational synthesis of multifunctional catalysts towards electrochemical synthesis of fine chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dibenzothiophene Sulfone&#8208;Based Ambipolar&#8208;Transporting Blue&#8208;Emissive Organic Semiconductors Towards Simple&#8208;Structured Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>

Two new dibenzothiophene sulfone&#8208;based organic semiconductors were designed and synthesized. They demonstrate a high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield of 46&#8211;67&#8201;% and typical ambipolar transport character in simple&#8208;structured organic light&#8208;emitting transistors. High quality blue electroluminescence CIE (0.179, 0.119) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm is achieved.







Abstract
The development of blue&#8208;emissive ambipolar organic semiconductor is an arduous target due to the large energy gap, but is an indispensable part for electroluminescent device, especially for the transformative display technology of simple&#8208;structured organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (SS&#8208;OLET). Herein, we designed and synthesized two new dibenzothiophene sulfone&#8208;based high mobility blue&#8208;emissive organic semiconductors (DNaDBSOs), which demonstrate superior optical property with solid&#8208;state photoluminescent quantum yield of 46&#8211;67&#8201;% and typical ambipolar&#8208;transporting properties in SS&#8208;OLETs with symmetric gold electrodes. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal the natural of ambipolar property for such blue&#8208;emissive DNaDBSOs&#8208;based materials is ascribed to a synergistic effect on lowering LUMO level and reduced electron injection barrier induced by the interfacial dipoles effect on gold electrodes due to the incorporation of appropriate DBSO unit. Finally, efficient electroluminescence properties with high&#8208;quality blue emission (CIE (0.179, 0.119)) and a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm are achieved for DNaDBSO&#8208;based SS&#8208;OLET, showing good spatial control of the recombination zone in conducting channel. This work provides a new avenue for designing ambipolar emissive organic semiconductors by incorporating the synergistic effect of energy level regulation and molecular&#8208;metal interaction, which would advance the development of superior optoelectronic materials and their high&#8208;density integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Analysis of Rhizonin Biosynthesis Reveals Origin of Pharmacophoric Furylalanine Moieties in Diverse Cyclopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic origin of rhizonins, hepatotoxic cyclopeptides with unusual 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, has been elucidated. Functional analysis of the biosynthesis gene cluster, labeling experiments, and heterologous reconstitution revealed the biosynthetic precursors and a novel dioxygenase (RhzB) that catalyzes Fua formation and allowed the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster by genome mining.







Abstract
Rhizonin A and B are hepatotoxic cyclopeptides produced by bacterial endosymbionts (Mycetohabitans endofungorum) of the fungus Rhizopus microsporus. Their toxicity critically depends on the presence of 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, which also occur in pharmaceutically relevant cyclopeptides of the endolide and bingchamide families. The biosynthesis and incorporation of Fua by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), however, has remained elusive. By genome sequencing and gene inactivation we elucidated the gene cluster responsible for rhizonin biosynthesis. A suite of isotope labeling experiments identified tyrosine and l&#8208;DOPA as Fua precursors and provided the first mechanistic insight. Bioinformatics, mutational analysis and heterologous reconstitution identified dioxygenase RhzB as necessary and sufficient for Fua formation. RhzB is a novel type of heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenases (HDAO) that enabled the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster through genome mining.

         <title>Co&#8208;encapsulating Cofactor and Enzymes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Multienzyme Cascade Reactions with Cofactor Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach that confines a cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is presented. The system features excellent cargo loading, cascade activity recovery, and cofactor recycling capabilities. The success of the approach depends on the polyelectrolyte interacting with the HOF monomers in place of enzymes and anchoring cofactors and enzymes within the HOFs.







Abstract
Use of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for enzyme immobilization faces challenges in the improvement of enzyme activity recovery and the assembly of cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme systems. Herein, we report a polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach (PAEA) that enables two cascades with four oxidoreductases and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) cofactors co&#8208;encapsulated in BioHOF&#8208;1 with excellent cargo loading and over 100&#8201;% cascade activity. The key role of the polyelectrolyte is to coat enzymes and tether NAD(P)H, thus interacting with HOF monomers in place of enzymes, avoiding the destruction of enzymes by HOF monomers. The versatility and efficiency of PAEA are further illustrated by an HOF&#8208;101&#8208;based bio&#8208;nanoreactor. Moreover, the immobilization by PAEA makes enzymes and NAD(P)H display excellent stability and recyclability. This study has demonstrated a facile and versatile PAEA for fabricating cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade nanoreactors with HOFs.

         <title>Electronic Configuration Tuning of Centrally Extended Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Approaching 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of acceptors featuring conjugation&#8208;extended electron&#8208;deficient cores were synthesized via a newly developed strategy for organic solar cells, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to &#8776;19&#8201;% were achieved. The properties of new acceptors were systematically investigated and elucidated experimentally and computationally.







Abstract
In the molecular optimizations of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), extending the central core can tune the energy levels, reduce nonradiative energy loss, enhance the intramolecular (donor&#8208;acceptor and acceptor&#8208;acceptor) packing, facilitate the charge transport, and improve device performance. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize acceptors featuring conjugation&#8208;extended electron&#8208;deficient cores. Among these, the acceptor CH&#8208;BBQ, embedded with benzobisthiadiazole, exhibited an optimal fibrillar network morphology, enhanced crystallinity, and improved charge generation/transport in blend films, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 18.94&#8201;% for CH&#8208;BBQ&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs; 18.19&#8201;% for binary OSCs) owing to its delicate structure design and electronic configuration tuning. Both experimental and theoretical approaches were used to systematically investigate the influence of the central electron&#8208;deficient core on the properties of the acceptor and device performance. The electron&#8208;deficient core modulation paves a new pathway in the molecular engineering of NFAs, propelling relevant research forward.

         <title>Nucleophilic Carbenes Derived from Dichloromethane</title>

Nickel catalysts promote cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane as a methylene source. An asymmetric variant using a chiral pyridine&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand provides access to pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aryl cyclopropyl carboxylates in highly enantioenriched form. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of a nucleophilic nickel carbene that reacts by a [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;C reductive elimination pathway.







Abstract
Nickel PyBox catalysts promote nucleophilic cyclopropanation reactions using CH2Cl2 as a methylene source and Mn as a stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope includes a broad range of alkenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, including esters, amides, ketones, nitriles, sulfones, phosphonate esters, trifluoromethyl groups, and electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Enantioselective cyclopropanations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters have been developed using chiral PyBox ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a (PyBox)Ni=CH2 species, which adds to the alkene by a stepwise [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;C reductive elimination mechanism. DFT models provide a rationale for the nucleophilic character of the nickel carbene and the sense of enantioinduction.

         <title>Overcoming Cancer Resistance to Platinum Drugs by Inhibiting Cholesterol Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtIV complexes of fenofibric acid relieve the drug resistance of cancer cells via regulating cholesterol metabolism besides damaging DNA. By inhibiting the expression of cholesterol&#8208;related proteins, the complexes impede the accumulation and promote the removal of cholesterol, leading to both apoptosis and pyroptosis. Cholesterol metabolism provides a new target for potentiating antitumor activity and overcoming the drug resistance of Pt drugs.







Abstract
Drug resistance is a serious challenge for platinum anticancer drugs. Platinum complexes may get over the drug resistance via a distinct mechanism of action. Cholesterol is a key factor contributing to the drug resistance. Inhibiting cellular cholesterol synthesis and uptake provides an alternative strategy for cancer treatment. Platinum(IV) complexes FP and DFP with fenofibric acid as axial ligand(s) were designed to combat the drug resistance through regulating cholesterol metabolism besides damaging DNA. In addition to producing reactive oxygen species and active platinum(II) species to damage DNA, FP and DFP inhibited cellular cholesterol accumulation, promoted cholesterol efflux, upregulated peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#945;), induced caspase&#8208;1 activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, thus leading to both apoptosis and pyroptosis in cancer cells. The reduction of cholesterol significantly relieved the drug resistance of cancer cells. The double&#8208;acting mechanism gave the complexes strong anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, particularly against cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells.

         <title>Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Along the Nonpolar Axis in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
So far, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has been discussed based on the classical explanation that photocurrent originates from macroscopic polarization. Herein, we report the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs. The light polarization dependence is consistent with the shift current mechanism, which possesses effective features, such as ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature.







Abstract
The origin of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was considered as a built&#8208;in electric field formed by the macroscopic polarization of materials. Alternatively, the &#8220;shift current mechanism&#8221; has been gradually accepted as the more appropriate description of the BPVE. This mechanism implies that the photocurrent generated by the BPVE is a topological current featuring an ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature, which is very attractive for photodetector applications. Meanwhile, the origin of the BPVE in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has not been discussed and is still widely accepted as the classical mechanism without any experimental evidence. Herein, we observed the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs, which is inconsistent with the classical explanation. Furthermore, based on the nonlinear optical tensor correlation, we substantiated that the BPVE in OIHPs is originated in the shift current mechanism.

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Pore Engineering of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Weak Interaction&#8208;Triggered Multiple Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs with narrow pore sizes of less than 1&#8197;nm were constructed by the condensation of tetramethylpyrazine as the smallest tetratopic monomer with linear aromatic dialdehyde monomers. Their aggregates in water feature negative charges and can be tuned through protonation/deprotonation, to give pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent colorimetric responses to various anions with different pKa values with high selectivity.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as promising crystalline materials, but their narrow pore engineering is severely impeded by the weak reversibility of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction, which has led to less exploration of their ultramicroporous structures and properties. Herein, we developed a single aromatic ring&#8208;based tetratopic monomer, tetramethylpyrazine, which undergoes a smooth Knoevenegal condensation at its four arylmethly carbon atoms with linear aromatic dialdehyde monomers upon the self&#8208;catalyzed activation of pyridine nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers in the presence of an organic anhydride. This has resulted in the formation of two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs, which both crystallized in orthorhombic lattices, and layered in AA stacking fashions along the vertical directions. They exhibit high surface areas and well&#8208;tailored ultramicropore sizes up to 0.5&#8197;nm. The unique cross&#8208;linking mode at two pairs of para&#8208;positions of each pyrazine unit through carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds afford them with &#960;&#8208;extended conjugation over the in&#8208;plane backbones and substantial semiconducting characters. The resultant COFs can be well&#8208;dispersed in water to form stable sub&#8208;microparticles with negative charges (zeta potentials: ca. &#8722;30&#8197;mV), and exhibiting tunable aggregation behaviors through protonation/deprotonation. As a consequence, they exhibit pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent colorimetric responses to various anions with different pKa values in high selectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical Nanoreactor Provides a Comprehensive View of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Cancer&#8208;drug Kinetics</title>

         <dc:description>
Transducing the tightly&#8208;channeled catalytic activity of &#8220;nanoconfined&#8221; enzyme cascades into electrical current affords a powerful and novel way to observe specific enzyme reactions, directly and in real time. Here, the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221; is used to extract detailed kinetic and mechanistic information on the inhibitory action of a high&#8208;profile cancer drug that inhibits a common cancer&#8208;associated variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1).







Abstract
The ability to control enzyme cascades entrapped in a nanoporous electrode material (the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221;, e&#8208;Leaf) has been exploited to gain detailed kinetic insight into the mechanism of an anti&#8208;cancer drug. Ivosidenib, used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, acts on a common cancer&#8208;linked variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1 R132H) inhibiting its &#8220;gain&#8208;of&#8208;function&#8221; activity&#8212;the undesired reduction of 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) to the oncometabolite 2&#8208;hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The e&#8208;Leaf quantifies the kinetics of IDH1 R132H inhibition across a wide and continuous range of conditions, efficiently revealing factors underlying the inhibitor residence time. Selective inhibition of IDH1 R132H by Ivosidenib and another inhibitor, Novartis 224, is readily resolved as a two&#8208;stage process whereby initial rapid non&#8208;inhibitory binding is followed by a slower step to give the inhibitory complex. These kinetic features are likely present in other allosteric inhibitors of IDH1/2. Such details, essential for understanding inhibition mechanisms, are not readily resolved in conventional steady&#8208;state kinetics or by techniques that rely only on measuring binding. Extending the new method and analytical framework presented here to other enzyme systems will be straightforward and should rapidly reveal insight that is difficult or often impossible to obtain using other methods.

The e-Leaf quantifies the kinetics of IDH1 R132H inhibition across a wide and continuous range of conditions, efficiently revealing factors underlying the inhibitor residence time. Selective inhibition of IDH1 R132H by Ivosidenib and another inhibitor, Novartis 224, is readily resolved as a two-stage process whereby initial rapid non-inhibitory binding is followed by a slower step to give the inhibitory complex. These kinetic features are likely present in other allosteric inhibitors of IDH1/2. Such details, essential for understanding inhibition mechanisms, are not readily resolved in conventional steady-state kinetics or by techniques that rely only on measuring binding. Extending the new method and analytical framework presented here to other enzyme systems will be straightforward and should rapidly reveal insight that is difficult or often impossible to obtain using other methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H Amidation for the Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A camphorsulfonic acid&#8208;based directing group was designed for the Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation of &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, allowing the synthesis of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic studies provided insights into the matched/mismatched effect observed in the C&#8722;H amidation of &#945;&#8208;secondary amines.







Abstract
Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are privileged scaffolds among bioactive natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ligands for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis and organocatalysts. Despite this interest, the construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine motifs still remains a challenge. To address this, an iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation reaction was developed. This method relies on the design of a new, cheap and cleavable exo&#8208;protecting/directing group derived from camphorsulfonic acid, which is directly installed from easily accessible precursors, and furnishes scalemic free 1,2&#8208;diamines upon cleavage of both nitrogen substituents. It was found applicable to both &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, for which a two&#8208;step protocol involving intermolecular olefin hydroamination and C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation was developed. Kinetic and computational studies provided insights into the observed reactivity difference between pairs of diastereoisomeric substrates.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Generation of Cyanocarbenes from Alkynyl Triazenes for the Synthesis of Nitrile Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes using different light sources induced an unusual cleavage of the triazene moiety leading to a methylene nitrile. By varying the reaction conditions, a cyanocarbene and a variety of substitution patterns bearing a nitrile group become selectively available under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions without the use of a toxic cyanating agent or the need for unstable substrates.







Abstract
The chemistry of alkynyl triazenes is an emerging field for organic chemists and especially acid&#8208;induced nucleophilic functionalizations, either directly, or after a prior reaction towards aromatic triazenes under extrusion of nitrogen, paved the way for fruitful strategies. In contrast, the chemical behavior of alkynyl triazenes upon irradiation with light is still unknown. Herein we present the first photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes that triggers an uncommon reactivity pattern involving the cleavage of the N1&#8722;N2 bond of the triazene moiety resulting in a unique approach to cyanocarbenes from a readily available, stable, and insensitive precursor. This allows to access various nitrile compounds without the use of a toxic cyanating agent by exploiting the reactivity pattern of carbenes. By variation of the reaction conditions and light sources, different substitution patterns can be obtained selectively in good yields under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions, thus introducing the alkynyl triazene unit as a photo accessible methylene nitrile synthon. Using this synthon, subclasses like &#945;&#8208;alkoxynitriles, &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;cyanohydrazones become easily available. These exhibit synthetically valuable substitution patterns for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, intermediates for total synthesis and amino acid synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis of C60/[10]CPP&#8208;Catenanes by Regioselective, Nanocapsule&#8208;Templated Bingel Bis&#8208;Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of three approaches (tether, nanohoop template &amp; supramolecular shadow mask) enabled the itero&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of [2]catenanes via bis&#8208;addition of bis&#8208;bromomalonates to the complex C60&#11814;[10]CPP. The use of a &#8220;traceless&#8221; nanocapsule shadow mask was key for obtaining 87&#8201;% selectivity for the &#8220;in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242; product, where the formation of a total of 22 isomers is theoretically possible.







Abstract
The addition of two unsymmetric malonate esters to the Buckminster fullerene C60 can lead to 22 spectroscopically distinguishable isomeric products and therefore represents a formidable synthesis challenge. In this work, we achieve 87&#8201;% selectivity for the formation of a single (in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3) isomer by combining three approaches: (i) we use a starting material, in which the two malonates are covalently connected (tether approach); (ii) we form the strong supramolecular complex of C60 with the shape&#8208;persistent [10]CPP macrocycle (template approach) and (iii) we embed this complex further within a self&#8208;assembled nanocapsule (shadow mask approach). Variation of the spacer chain shed light on the limitations of the approach and the ring dynamics in the unusual [2]catenanes were studied in silico with atomistic resolution. This work significantly widens the scope of mechanically interlocked architectures comprising cycloparaphenylenes (CPP).

         <title>Biaxially&#8208;Strained Phthalocyanine at Polyoxometalate@Carbon Nanotube Heterostructure Boosts Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is a promising non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based molecular catalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To enhance its catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability, a host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to fabricate FePc&#8208;polyoxometalate@carbon nanotubes with a one&#8208;dimensional ternary heterostructure. The polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated nanotubes are able to tune the structure and ORR performances of FeN4 centers.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) with unique FeN4 site has attracted increasing interests as a promising non&#8208;precious catalyst. However, the plane symmetric structure endows FePc with undesired catalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel one&#8208;dimensional heterostructured ORR catalyst by coupling FePc at polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanotubes (FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NTs) using host&#8208;guest chemistry. The encapsulation of polyoxometalates can induce a local tensile strain of single&#8208;walled NTs to strengthen the interactions with FePc. Both the strain and curvature effects of {PW12}@NT scaffold tune the geometric structure and electronic localization of FeN4 centers to enhance the ORR catalytic performance. As expected, such a heterostructured FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NT electrocatalyst exhibits prominent durability, methanol tolerance, and ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#8197;V and a low Tafel slope of 30.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline medium. Besides, the assembled zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrates an ultrahigh power density of 280&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, excellent charge/discharge ability and long&#8208;term stability over 500&#8197;h, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 cathode. This study offers a new strategy to design novel heterostructured catalysts and opens a new avenue to regulate the electrocatalytic performance of phthalocyanine molecules.

         <title>Supramolecular Memristor Based on Bistable [2]Catenanes: Toward High&#8208;Density and Non&#8208;Volatile Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular memristors have been successfully fabricated through the introduction of a bistable [2]catenane, which can stablize charge injection effciently. The AuTS&#8208;S&#8208;C3&#8208;SO3&#8722;Na+//[2]catenane//Ga2O3/EGaIn junctions serve as both resistive switches and diodes. The non&#8208;volatile memristors undergo repeated switching cycles of over 1000&#8197;times and a retention time exceeding 500&#8197;seconds under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for data storage and neuromorphic computing calls for innovative, high&#8208;density solutions, such as resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM). However, the integration of resistive switching and rectification at the nanoscale remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we introduce a bistable [2]catenane&#8208;based supramolecular junction that simultaneously functions as a resistive switch and a diode. All supramolecular junctions are highly stable and reproducible over thousands of resistive switching cycles, because the nano&#8208;confinement of two mechanically interlocked rings can stabilize the radical states of pyridinium moieties under ambient conditions. The successful realization of supramolecular junctions in functionality with a thickness of approximately 2&#8197;nm presents a promising avenue for the development of molecule&#8208;scale based RRAM for a better solution to high density and energy efficiency.

         <title>Photoinduced Metallonitrene Formation by N2 Elimination from Azide Diradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond ultraviolet&#8208;pump/mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveals that singlet and triplet azide&#8208;anion diradical ligands facilitate the efficient formation of a metallonitrene from a diamagnetic azido precursor.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal nitrides/nitrenes are highly promising reagents for catalytic nitrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reactivity. They are typically prepared in situ upon optically induced N2 elimination from azido precursors. A full exploitation of their catalytic potential, however, requires in&#8208;depth knowledge of the primary photo&#8208;induced processes and the structural/electronic factors mediating the N2 loss with birth of the terminal metal&#8208;nitrogen core. Using femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, we elucidate here the primary molecular&#8208;level mechanisms responsible for the formation of a unique platinum(II) nitrene with a triplet ground state from a closed&#8208;shell platinum(II) azide precursor. The spectroscopic data in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide compelling evidence that product formation requires the initial occupation of a singlet excited state with an anionic azide diradical ligand that is bound to a low&#8208;spin d8&#8208;configured PtII ion. Subsequent intersystem crossing generates the Pt&#8208;bound triplet azide diradical, which smoothly evolves into the triplet nitrene via N2 loss in a near barrierless adiabatic dissociation. Our data highlight the importance of the productive, N2&#8208;releasing state possessing azide &#960;&#960;* character as a design principle for accessing efficient N&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysts.

         <title>Functionalization of Pentacene: A Facile and Versatile Approach to Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple two&#8208;step synthesis procedure involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes has proven to be the key step in the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Despite their highly nonplanar conformations, these contorted PAHs also exhibited emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
In this work, a facile and versatile strategy for the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) starting from the functionalized pentacene was established. A series of novel PAHs 1&#8211;4 and their derivatives were synthesized through a simple two&#8208;step synthesis procedure involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes 5&#8211;8 as a key step. All the molecules were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied in detail. Interestingly, the most striking feature of 1&#8211;4 is their highly contorted carbon structures and the accompanying helical chirality. In particular, the optical resolution of 2 was successfully achieved by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC, and the enantiomers were characterized by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence spectroscopy. Despite the highly nonplanar conformations, these contorted PAHs exhibited emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields, implying the potential utility of this series PAHs as high&#8208;quality organic laser dyes. By using a self&#8208;assembly method with the help of epoxy resin, a bottle microlaser based on 3&#8201;a was successfully illustrated with a lasing wavelength of 567.8&#8197;nm at a threshold of 0.3&#8197;mJ/cm2. We believe that this work will shed light on the chemical versatility of pentacene and its derivatives in the construction of novel functionalized PAHs.

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Type Sodium&#8208;ion Conducting Solid Electrolytes for All Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) show promise as solid electrolytes due to their low cost and rapid Na+ conductivity. Lattice parameters and Na+ channel sizes are influenced by transition metals, which in turn affect Na+ conductivity by modifying its interaction with PBA frameworks. Leveraging these insights, all solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries using PBAs as solid electrolytes have been developed for the first time.







Abstract
Conventional solid electrolyte frameworks typically consist of anions such as sulphur, oxygen, chlorine, and others, leading to inherent limitations in their properties. Despite the emergence of sulphide, oxide, and halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, their utilization is hampered by issues, including the evolution of H2S gas, the need for expensive elements, and poor contact. Here, we first introduce Prussian Blue analogue (PBA) open&#8208;framework structures as a solid electrolyte that demonstrates appreciable Na+ conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). We delve into the relationship between Na+ conductivity and the lattice parameter of N&#8208;coordinated transition metal, which is attributed to the reduced interaction between Na+ and the framework, corroborated by the distribution of relaxation times and density functional theory calculations. Among the five PBAs studied, Mn&#8208;PBA have exhibited the highest Na+ conductivity of 9.1&#215;10&#8722;2mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Feasibility tests have revealed that Mn&#8208;PBA have maintained a cycle retention of 95.1&#8201;% after 80cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C and a C&#8208;rate of 0.2C. Our investigation into the underlying mechanisms that play a significant role in governing the conductivity and kinetics of these materials contributes valuable insights for the development of alternative strategies to realize all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Controllable One&#8208;Step Assembly of Uniform Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer Cylindrical Micelles by a Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Process and Their Application as Tougheners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step strategy has been used to assemble cylindrical micelles with highly controllable lengths from a single liquid crystalline block copolymer by an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. This strategy was used to produce uniform cylindrical micelles at decent scales for practical applications, and their dramatic toughening effect for glassy thermoplastics was demonstrated.







Abstract
The fabrication of uniform cylindrical nanoobjects from soft materials has attracted tremendous research attention from both fundamental research and practical application points of view but has also posed outstanding challenges in terms of their preparation. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step method to assemble cylindrical micelles (CMs) with highly controllable lengths from a single liquid crystalline block copolymer by an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. By adjusting the assembly conditions, the lengths of the CMs are controlled from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. Several influencing factors are systematically investigated to comprehensively understand the process. Particularly, the solvent quality is found determinative in either enhancing or suppressing the nucleation process to produce shorter and longer CMs, respectively. Taking advantage of this strategy, the lengths of CMs can be nicely controlled over a wide concentration range of four orders of magnitude. Lastly, CMs are produced on decent scales and applied as additives to dramatically toughen glassy plastic matrix, revealing an unprecedented length&#8208;dependent toughening effect.

         <title>Bimetallic Anionic Organic Frameworks with Solid&#8208;State Cation Conduction for Charge Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>

The Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP metal&#8211;organic frameworks, comprising a cation&#8208;rich phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, exhibit a high cation content, possess two distinct binding sites (&#8722;O[Li/Na]A and &#8722;O[Li/Na]B) and reversible redox chemistry. These MOFs demonstrate solid&#8208;state conduction of Li+ and Na+ ions, making them the first reported MOFs with such properties.







Abstract
A new phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, with the general formula of A4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP (wherein A is Li+ or Na+, and DOBDP6&#8722; is the 2,5&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediphosphate ligand) is prepared and characterized for energy storage applications. With four alkali cations per formula unit, the A4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP MOF is found to be the first example of non&#8208;solvated cation conducting MOF with measured conductivities of 5.4&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8208; phases, indicating phase and composition effects of Li+ and Na+ shuttling through the channels. Three orders of magnitude increase in ionic conductivity is further attained upon solvation with propylene carbonate, placing this system among the best MOF ionic conductors at room temperature. As positive electrode material, Li4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP delivers a specific capacity of 140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high average discharge potential of 3.2&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) with 90&#8201;% of capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles. The significance of this research extends from the development of a new family of electroactive phosphonate&#8208;based MOFs with inherent ionic conductivity and reversible cation storage, to providing elementary insights into the development of highly sought yet still evasive MOFs with mixed&#8208;ion and electron conduction for energy storage applications.

         <title>Histone Deacetylase 3&#8208;Directed PROTACs Have Anti&#8208;inflammatory Potential by Blocking Polarization of M0&#8208;like into M1&#8208;like Macrophages</title>

We employed the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology to target the non&#8208;enzymatic histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) function. A newly developed potent and selective HDAC3 PROTAC provided an anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine expression profile in cultured cells and inhibited the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 phenotype in primary macrophages.







Abstract
Macrophage polarization plays a crucial role in inflammatory processes. The histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has a deacetylase&#8208;independent function that can activate pro&#8208;inflammatory gene expression in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;stimulated M1&#8208;like macrophages and cannot be blocked by traditional small&#8208;molecule HDAC3 inhibitors. Here we employed the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology to target the deacetylase&#8208;independent function of HDAC3. We developed a potent and selective HDAC3&#8208;directed PROTAC, P7, which induces nearly complete HDAC3 degradation at low micromolar concentrations in both THP&#8208;1 cells and human primary macrophages. P7 increases the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion in THP&#8208;1&#8208;derived M1&#8208;like macrophages. Importantly, P7 decreases the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in M1&#8208;like macrophages derived from human primary macrophages. This can be explained by the observed inhibition of macrophage polarization from M0&#8208;like into M1&#8208;like macrophage. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the HDAC3&#8208;directed PROTAC P7 has anti&#8208;inflammatory activity and blocks macrophage polarization, demonstrating that this molecular mechanism can be targeted with small molecule therapeutics.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Transfer&#8208;Based High&#8208;Capacity Organic Lithium&#8208;Iodine (Chlorine) Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The static organic lithium&#8208;iodine (chlorine) batteries fueled by brand&#8208;new three&#8208;electron redox chemistry (redox couples: I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0) with electrochemically active tetrabutylammonium triiodide cathode exhibit excellent specific energy density, representing a significant advancement in the field of halogen batteries.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type batteries apply the principle that more charge transfer is preferable. The underutilized electron transfer mode within two undermines the electrochemical performance of halogen batteries. Here, we realised a three&#8208;electron transfer lithium&#8208;halogen battery based on I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0 couples by using a common commercial electrolyte saturated with Cl&#8722; anions. The resulting Li||tetrabutylammonium triiodide (TBAI3) cell exhibits three distinct discharging plateaus at 2.97, 3.40, and 3.85&#8197;V. Moreover, it has a high capacity of 631&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1I (265&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1electrode, based on entire mass loading) and record&#8208;high energy density of up to 2013&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1I (845&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1electrode). To support these findings, experimental characterisations and density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the redox chemistry involved in this novel interhalogen strategy. We believe our paradigm presented here has a foreseeable inspiring effect on other halogen batteries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pursuit.

         <title>NADH Photosynthesis System with Affordable Electron Supply and Inhibited NADH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative NADH photosynthesis system is developed, in which the oxidation of biomass derivatives is used as an electron supply module (ESM) to supply electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is used as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Benefiting from the inhibition of REM, the NADH photosynthesis system exhibits a two&#8208;fold enhancement in the NADH yield compared with the system without REM.







Abstract
Photosynthesis offers a green approach for the recycling of nicotinamide cofactors primarily NADH in bio&#8208;redox reactions. Herein, we report an NADH photosynthesis system where the oxidation of biomass derivatives is designed as an electron supply module (ESM) to afford electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is designed as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Glucose as the electron donor guarantees the reaction sustainability accompanied with oxidative products of gluconic acid and formic acid. Meanwhile, enzyme cascades of SOD/CAT greatly eliminate ROS, leading to a &#8776;2.00&#8208;fold elevation of NADH yield (61.1&#8201;% vs. 30.7&#8201;%). The initial reaction rate and turnover frequency (TOF) increased by 2.50&#8197;times and 2.54&#8197;times, respectively, compared with those systems without REM. Our study establishes a novel and efficient platform for NADH photosynthesis coupled to biomass&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

         <title>Flexible, Miniaturized Sensing Probes Inspired by Biofuel Cells for Monitoring Synaptically Released Glutamate in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by the structure and working principle of biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting devices have the potential to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of structural and functional maladaptive changes in neural circuits after a variety of CNS trauma and diseases.







Abstract
Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50&#8197;&#956;m, can detect real&#8208;time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range. Experiments exploiting the hippocampal circuit in mice models demonstrate the capability of the sensors in monitoring glutamate release via electrical stimulation using acute brain slices. These advances could aid in basic neuroscience studies and translational engineering, as the sensors provide a diagnostic tool for neurological disorders. Additionally, adapting the biofuel cell design to other neurotransmitters can potentially enable the detailed study of the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on neuronal cell signaling pathways and revolutionize neuroscience.

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Optical Probes for Imaging Quadruplex DNA Structures via Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New platinum(II)&#8208;based optical probes for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA are reported, which switch&#8208;on their emission intensity and, more importantly, they display a selective and distinct lengthening of their emission lifetime when bound to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. We show that this effect can be used to selectively visualise these structures in cells using Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex DNA is a non&#8208;canonical structure that forms in guanine&#8208;rich regions of the genome. There is increasing evidence showing that G&#8208;quadruplexes have important biological functions, and therefore molecular tools to visualise these structures are important. Herein we report on a series of new cyclometallated platinum(II) complexes which, upon binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA, display an increase in their phosphorescence, acting as switch&#8208;on probes. More importantly, upon binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes they display a selective and distinct lengthening of their emission lifetime. We show that this effect can be used to selectively visualise these structures in cells using Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (PLIM).

         <title>Asymmetric Allenylation of Alkynes mediated by Chiral Organoselenated Reagents under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium&#8208;mediated methodology for the asymmetric synthesis of allenyl amides is described. This was achieved in two steps from simple alkynes, and features highly stereocontrolled &#946;&#8208;H&#8208;syn&#8208;eliminations of vinyl selenoxides performed with good yields and ee up to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
The reactivity of novel chiral lactamide&#8208;substituted diselenide&#8208;based reagents under oxidative conditions was exploited to develop a metal&#8208;free method for the preparation of enantioenriched allenylamides from simple alkynes in good yields, and with enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The key of the success in this method is attributed to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded lactamide appendages that ensure configurational stability of chiral vinyl selenoxide intermediates for an optimal enantiotopic &#946;&#8208;syn&#8208;elimination step.

         <title>Achiral Au(I) Cyclic Trinuclear Complexes with High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Near&#8208;Infrared TADF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two achiral Au(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes with circularly polarized near&#8208;infrared thermally activated delay fluorescence (NIR&#8208;TADF) have been synthesized and characterized, whose photoluminescence quantum yields are very high in the solid state. Utilizing the circularly polarized light (CPL) function and 3D printing technology, the CPL&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting logo was successfully fabricated with achiral material.







Abstract
Realizing high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region is challenging and valuable for luminescent material, especially for thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) material. In this work, we report two achiral cyclic trinuclear Au(I) complexes, Au3(4&#8208;Clpyrazolate)3 and Au3(4&#8208;Brpyrazolate)3 (denoted as Cl&#8722;Au and Br&#8722;Au), obtained through the reaction of 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole and 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole with Au(I) salts, respectively. Both Cl&#8722;Au and Br&#8722;Au exhibit TADF with high PLQY (&gt;70&#8201;%) in the NIR I (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm) (&#955;max = 720&#8197;nm) region, exceeding other NIR&#8722;TADF emitters in the solid state. Photophysical experiments and theoretical calculations confirmed the efficient NIR&#8722;TADF properties of Cl&#8722;Au and Br&#8722;Au were attributed to the small energy gap
&#916;E(S1&#8208;T2) (S = singlet, T = triplet) and the large spin&#8208;orbital coupling induced by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer of molecular aggregations. In addition, both complexes crystallize in the achiral Pna21 space group (mm2 point group) and are circularly polarized light (CPL) active with maxima luminescent dissymmetry factor |glum| of 3.4 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (Cl&#8722;Au) and 2.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (Br&#8722;Au) for their crystalline powder samples, respectively. By using Cl&#8722;Au as the emitting ink, 3D&#8208;printed luminescent logos are fabricated, which own anti&#8208;counterfeiting functions due to its CPL behavior dependent on the crystallinity.

Both &lt;b&gt;Cl&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Br&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; exhibit TADF with high PLQY (&amp;gt;70&#8201;%) in the NIR I (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm) (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 720&#8197;nm) region, exceeding other NIR&#8722;TADF emitters in the solid state. Photophysical experiments and theoretical calculations confirmed the efficient NIR&#8722;TADF properties of &lt;b&gt;Cl&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Br&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; were attributed to the small energy gap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;(S1-T2)&lt;/sub&gt; (S = singlet, T = triplet) and the large spin-orbital coupling induced by ligand-to-metal-metal charge transfer of molecular aggregations. In addition, both complexes crystallize in the achiral &lt;i&gt;Pna&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space group (mm2 point group) and are circularly polarized light (CPL) active with maxima luminescent dissymmetry factor |g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| of 3.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Cl&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt;) and 2.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Br&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt;) for their crystalline powder samples, respectively. By using &lt;b&gt;Cl&#8722;Au&lt;/b&gt; as the emitting ink, 3D-printed luminescent logos are fabricated, which own anti-counterfeiting functions due to its CPL behavior dependent on the crystallinity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane over Au1Ag Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Modified ZnO with Oxygen and Water Vapor: Synergy of Gold and Silver</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Au1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticles&#8208;modified ZnO catalyst exhibits excellent C2H6 yield via photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane with O2 and H2O. Au single atoms in Au1Ag alloy effectively activate O2 and H2O into *OOH, promoting C&#8722;H activation of CH4 to form *CH3 on ZnO. Electron deficient Au single atoms effectively transfer electron donor *CH3 from ZnO to the Ag of the Au1Ag alloy, promoting subsequent *CH3 coupling to form C2H6.







Abstract
C&#8722;H dissociation and C&#8722;C coupling are two key steps in converting CH4 into multi&#8208;carbon compounds. Here we report a synergy of Au and Ag to greatly promote C2H6 formation over Au1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticles (Au1Ag NPs)&#8208;modified ZnO catalyst via photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (POCM) with O2 and H2O. Atomically dispersed Au in Au1Ag NPs effectively promotes the dissociation of O2 and H2O into *OOH, promoting C&#8722;H activation of CH4 on the photogenerated O&#8722; to form *CH3. Electron&#8208;deficient Au single atoms, as hopping ladders, also facilitate the migration of electron donor *CH3 from ZnO to Au1Ag NPs. Finally, *CH3 coupling can readily occur on Ag atoms of Au1Ag NPs. An excellent C2H6 yield of 14.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 79&#8201;% and an apparent quantum yield of 14.6&#8201;% at 350&#8197;nm is obtained via POCM with O2 and H2O, which is at least two times that of the photocatalytic system. The bimetallic synergistic strategy offers guidance for future catalyst design for POCM with O2 and H2O.

         <title>Hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Anisotropic Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)&#8208;dioxin linked covalent organic framework, denoted as HD&#8208;COF, was designed, and synthesized. The unique &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages in the HD&#8208;COF structure led to efficient anisotropic charge transport. In situ formed HD&#8208;COF film demonstrated enhanced electric conductivity as high as 1.25&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after doping with magic blue.







Abstract
The development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with efficient charge transport is of immense interest for applications in optoelectronic devices. To enhance COF charge transport properties, electroactive building blocks and dopants can be used to induce extended conduction channels. However, understanding their intricate interplay remains challenging. We designed and synthesized a tailor&#8208;made COF structure with electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) core units and planar dioxin (D) linkages, denoted as HD&#8208;COF. With the support of theoretical calculations, we found that the HAT units in the HD&#8208;COF induce strong, eclipsed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The unique stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages leads to efficient anisotropic charge transport. We fabricated HD&#8208;COF films to minimize the grain boundary effect of bulk COFs, which resulted in enhanced conductivity. As a result, the HD&#8208;COF films showed an electrical conductivity as high as 1.25&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after doping with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate.

         <title>Flux&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Y2Ti2O5S2 for Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) were synthesized in a flux environment. Significantly reduced particle sizes and enhanced photocatalytic performance were observed, indicating the utility of flux&#8208;assisted methods in the preparation of oxysulfide photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is an ideal means of producing hydrogen in a sustainable manner, and developing highly efficient photocatalysts is a vital aspect of realizing this process. The photocatalyst Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) is capable of absorbing at wavelengths up to 650&#8197;nm and exhibits outstanding thermal and chemical durability compared with other oxysulfides. However, the photocatalytic performance of YTOS synthesized using the conventional solid&#8208;state reaction (SSR) process is limited owing to the large particle sizes and structural defects associated with this synthetic method. Herein, we report the synthesis of YTOS particles by a flux&#8208;assisted technique. The enhanced mass transfer efficiency in the flux significantly reduced the preparation time compared with the SSR method. In addition, the resulting YTOS showed improved photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution activity when loaded with Rh and Co3O4 co&#8208;catalysts, respectively. These improvements are attributed to the reduced particle size and enhanced crystallinity of the material as well as the slower decay of photogenerated carriers on a nanosecond to sub&#8208;microsecond time range. Further optimization of this flux&#8208;assisted method together with suitable surface modification is expected to produce high&#8208;quality YTOS crystals with superior photocatalytic activity.

Photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 is considered as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the environmental and energy issues. However, the weak CO2 adsorption and tough CO2 activation process seriously compromise the CO production, due to the chemical inertness of CO2 molecule and the formed fragile metal&#8208;C/O bond. Herein, we designed and fabricated oxygen vacancy contained Co3O4 hollow nanoparticles on ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon framework (Vo&#8722;HCo3O4/OMNC) towards photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2. In situ spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the constructed oxygen vacancy is able to break the local structural symmetry of Co&#8722;O&#8722;Co sites. The formation of asymmetric active site switches the CO2 configuration from a single&#8208;site linear model to a multiple&#8208;sites bending one with a highly stable configuration, enhancing the binding and structural polarization of CO2 molecules. As a result, Vo&#8722;HCo3O4/OMNC shows unprecedent activity in the photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (10&#8201;% CO2/Ar) under laboratory light source or even natural sunlight, affording a syngas yield of 337.8 or 95.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with an apparent quantum yield up to 4.2&#8201;%.

         <title>Creating an Amyloid &#8216;Kaleidoscope&#8217; Using Short Iodinated Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide fibrils are widely used as functional biomaterials, but the understanding at atomic level remains limited. In this study, we determined the fibril atomic structures of GFGGNDNFG and three iodinated derivatives to understand how the introduction of iodine affects the fibril structure and properties. Additionally, we designed a novel iodinated peptide, and its fibril properties and structures align well with our design expectations.







Abstract
Amyloid fibrils formed by peptides with different sequences exhibit diversified morphologies, material properties and activities, making them valuable for developing functional bionanomaterials. However, the molecular understanding underlying the structural diversity of peptide fibrillar assembly at atomic level is still lacking. In this study, by using cryogenic electron microscopy, we first revealed the structural basis underlying the highly reversible assembly of 1GFGGNDNFG9 (referred to as hnRAC1) peptide fibril. Furthermore, by installing iodine at different sites of hnRAC1, we generated a collection of peptide fibrils with distinct thermostability. By determining the atomic structures of the iodinated fibrils, we discovered that iodination at different sites of the peptide facilitates the formation of diverse halogen bonds and triggers the assembly of entirely different structures of iodinated fibrils. Finally, based on this structural knowledge, we designed an iodinated peptide that assembles into new atomic structures of fibrils, exhibiting superior thermostability, that aligned with our design. Our work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the atomic&#8208;level processes underlying the formation of diverse peptide fibril structures, and paves the way for creating an amyloid &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221; by employing various modifications and peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune the atomic structure and properties of fibrillar nanostructures.

         <title>Smart Emulsions Stabilized by a Multi&#8208;headgroup Surfactant Tolerant to High Concentrations of Acids and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;headgroup surfactant was synthesized that can be transformed among cationic (di&#8208;UAPAc), zwitterionic and bola structures by pH trigger. In strong acidity, di&#8208;UAPAc co&#8208;stabilizes OID emulsions in combination with silica particles which convert to Pickering emulsions upon addition of high concentration of salts.







Abstract
Retaining emulsions stable at high acidity and salinity is still a great challenge. Here, we report a novel multi&#8208;headgroup surfactant (C3H7&#8722;NH+(C10COOH)2, di&#8208;UAPAc) which can be reversibly transformed among cationic, anionic and zwitterionic forms upon pH variation. Stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion (OID) emulsions in strong acidity (pH=2) can be co&#8208;stabilized by low concentrations of di&#8208;UAPAc and silica nanoparticles. High salinity at pH=2 improves the adsorption of di&#8208;UAPAc on silica particles through hydrogen bonding, resulting in the transformation of OID emulsions into Pickering emulsions. Moreover, emulsification/demulsification and interconversion between OID and Pickering emulsions together with control of the viscosity and droplet size can be triggered by pH. The present work provides a new protocol for designing surfactants for various applications in harsh aqueous media, such as strong acidity and high salinity, involved in oil recovery and sewerage treatments.

         <title>Manganese/Cobalt Bimetallic Relay Catalysis for Divergent Dehydrogenative Difluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for the divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products were concisely constructed.







Abstract
The involvement of manganese radical for halogen atom transfer (XAT) reactions has been esteemed as one reliable method but encountered with limited catalytic models. In this paper, a novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse terminal, cyclic and internal alkenes as well as tetrasubstituted alkenes are found to be good coupling partners to deliver difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products, accompanied with the production of H2 as the by&#8208;product. This bimetallic relay strategy features broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions and excellent functional group compatibility. Its success represents an important step&#8208;forward to expedite the construction of a rich library of difluoroalkylated products.

         <title>Multitargeting Prodrugs that Release Oxaliplatin, Doxorubicin and Gemcitabine are Potent Inhibitors of Tumor Growth and Effective Inducers of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>

PtIV prodrug (2) can release Gem, Oxal, and Dox in their active form upon cellular reduction. It effectively induces release of ICD markers, DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells and exhibited superior in vivo tumor growth inhibition in two murine models (LLC and CT26) with significantly lower body weight loss. An ICD re&#8208;challenge study showed better tumor free survival compared to the FDA drugs.







Abstract
A multitargeting prodrug (2) that releases gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin in their active form in cancer cells is a potent cytotoxic agent with nM IC50s; it is highly selective to cancer cells with mean selectivity indices to human (136) and murine (320) cancer cells. It effectively induces release of DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells facilitating more efficient phagocytosis by J774 macrophages than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration. The viability of CT26 cells co&#8208;cultured with J774 macrophages and treated with 2 was reduced by 32&#8201;% compared to the non&#8208;treated cells, suggesting a synergistic antiproliferative effect between the chemical and immune reactions. 2 inhibited in vivo tumor growth in two murine models (LLC and CT26) better than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration with significantly lower body weight loss. Mice inoculated with CT26 cells treated with 2 showed slightly better tumor free survival than doxorubicin.

The viability of CT26 cells co-cultured with J774 macrophages and treated with &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was reduced by 32&#8201;% compared to the non-treated cells, suggesting a synergistic antiproliferative effect between the chemical and immune reactions. &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; inhibited in vivo tumor growth in two murine models (LLC and CT26) better than the FDA drugs or their co-administration with significantly lower body weight loss. Mice inoculated with CT26 cells treated with &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; showed slightly better tumor free survival than doxorubicin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyzed Defluorination of Aromatic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional calculations establish a novel mechanism of aromatic defluorination by P450 Compound I. This is achieved via either an initial epoxide intermediate or through a 1,2&#8208;fluorine shift in an electrophilic intermediate, which highlights that the P450s can defluorinate fluoroarenes. However, in the absence of a proton donor a strong Fe&#8722;F bond can be obtained as shown from the calculations.

         <title>Linkages Make a Difference in the Photoluminescence of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different linkages endow COFs with huge differences in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield for imine&#8208;linked and vinylene&#8208;linked pyrene&#8208;based COFs. Different charge&#8208;transfer pathways in imine&#8208;linked and vinylene&#8208;linked COFs influence the exciton relaxation way and quenching of fluorescence.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural designability and tunability of photophysical properties enable them to be a promising class of organic luminescent materials by incorporating well&#8208;designed fluorescent units directly into the periodic skeletons. The photophysical properties of COFs are mainly affected by the structural features, which determine the conjugation degree, charge delocalization ability, and exciton dynamics of COFs. To understand the relationship between COF structures and their photophysical properties, two COFs with the same pyrene chromophore units but different linkages (imine or vinylene) were designed and synthesized. Interestingly, different linkages endow COFs with huge differences in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for imine&#8208; and vinylene&#8208;linked pyrene&#8208;based COFs, which possess PLQY values of 0.34&#8201;% and 15.43&#8201;%, respectively. The femtosecond&#8208;transient absorption spectra and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveal the different charge&#8208;transfer pathways in imine&#8208; and vinylene&#8208;linked COFs, which influence the exciton relaxation way and fluorescence intensity. In addition, an effective white&#8208;light device was obtained by coating the vinylene&#8208;linked COF on a light&#8208;emitting diode strip.

         <title>Strong and Ultra&#8208;tough Ionic Hydrogel Based on Hyperbranched Macro&#8208;Cross&#8208;linker: Influence of Topological Structure on Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyperbranched PCL was used as a macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker to fabricate a novel family of strong and ultra&#8208;tough ionic hydrogels. By tailoring the hyperbranched topological structure, the optimal balance of covalent/non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking could be obtained. As a result, the well&#8208;designed hydrogel possesses high strength, superior toughness, and good ionic conductivity, with potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.







Abstract
The application of hydrogels often suffers from their inherent limitation of poor mechanical properties. Here, a carboxyl&#8208;functionalized and acryloyl&#8208;terminated hyperbranched polycaprolactone (PCL) was synthesized and used as a macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker to fabricate a super strong and ultra&#8208;tough ionic hydrogel. The terminal acryloyl groups of hyperbranched PCL are chemically incorporated into the network to form covalent cross&#8208;links, which contribute to robust networks. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic domains formed by the spontaneous aggregation of PCL chains and coordination bonds between Fe3+ and COO&#8722; groups serve as dynamic non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links, which enhance the energy dissipation ability. Especially, the influence of the hyperbranched topological structure of PCL on hydrogel properties has been well investigated, exhibiting superior strengthening and toughening effects compared to the linear one. Moreover, the hyperbranched PCL cross&#8208;linker also endowed the ionic hydrogel with higher sensitivity than the linear one when used as a strain sensor. As a result, this well&#8208;designed ionic hydrogel possesses high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and well ionic conductivity, exhibiting potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Absorbing Monodispersed Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) light absorption were developed based on resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). Interesting properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance are demonstrated with the monodisperse oligomers.







Abstract
Organic molecules with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR II) light absorption are essential for many biological and opto&#8208;electronic applications. Herein, we report monodispersed oligomers as NIR II light absorber using a new molecular design strategy of resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). We synthesize a series of monodispersed oligomers with thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TB), which contains resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, as the repeating unit. The TB pentamer exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength of 1169&#8197;nm, which is the longest for oligomers reported so far. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with the TB tetramer as the electron acceptor shows the specific detectivity of 2.98&#215;1011 Jones at 1180&#8197;nm under zero bias. This performance is among the best for NIR II OPDs. These results indicate a new kind of NIR II absorbing molecules as excellent opto&#8208;electronic materials.

         <title>An RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzyme That Requires an Organic Solvent to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme was derived from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool by forcing the sequences to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent in aqueous solution. The DNAzyme was isolated via a counter&#8208;selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by a positive selection in the same buffered solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO, and its activity was shown to be dependent on the presence of the cosolvent.







Abstract
Engineering functional nucleic acids that are active under unusual conditions will not only reveal their hidden abilities but also lay the groundwork for pursuing them for unique applications. Although many DNAzymes have been derived to catalyze diverse chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, no prior study has been set up to purposely derive DNAzymes that require an organic solvent to function. Herein, we utilized in vitro selection to isolate RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool that were &#8220;compelled&#8221; to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent, via counter selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by positive selection in the same solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO.

     alt="An RNA-Cleaving DNAzyme That Requires an Organic Solvent to Function"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An RNA-cleaving DNAzyme was derived from a random-sequence DNA pool by forcing the sequences to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent in aqueous solution. The DNAzyme was isolated via a counter-selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by a positive selection in the same buffered solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO, and its activity was shown to be dependent on the presence of the cosolvent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering functional nucleic acids that are active under unusual conditions will not only reveal their hidden abilities but also lay the groundwork for pursuing them for unique applications. Although many DNAzymes have been derived to catalyze diverse chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, no prior study has been set up to purposely derive DNAzymes that require an organic solvent to function. Herein, we utilized in vitro selection to isolate RNA-cleaving DNAzymes from a random-sequence DNA pool that were &#8220;compelled&#8221; to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent, via counter selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by positive selection in the same solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO. This experiment led to the discovery of a new DNAzyme that requires 35&#8201;% DMSO for its catalytic activity and exhibits drastically reduced activity without DMSO. This DNAzyme also requires divalent metal ions for catalysis, and its activity is enhanced by monovalent ions. A minimized, more efficient DNAzyme was also derived.

         <title>Improved Interfacial Ion Migration and Deposition through the Chain&#8208;Liquid Synergistic Effect by a Carboxylated Hydrogel Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative double&#8208;network carboxylated hydrogel electrolyte was designed to stabilize zinc anode. The charged functional groups on polymer chains synergize with liquid phase components to reconstruct the solvent sheath and guide the directional migration of Zn2+ ions. The robust chemical bonding of hydrogel layer to Zn slab induces a dendrite&#8208;free plating behavior, ultimately ensuring the long&#8208;term operation of zinc ion hybrid capacitors.







Abstract
The large&#8208;scale applicability of Zn&#8208;metal anodes is severely impeded by the issues such as the dendrite growth, complicated hydrogen evolution, and uncontrollable passivation reaction. Herein, a negatively charged carboxylated double&#8208;network hydrogel electrolyte (Gelatin/Sodium alginate&#8208;acetate, denoted as Gel/SA&#8208;acetate) has been developed to stabilize the interfacial electrochemistry, which restructures a type of Zn2+ ion solvent sheath optimized via a chain&#8208;liquid synergistic effect. New hydrogen bonds are reconstructed with water molecules by the zincophilic functional groups, and directional migration of hydrated Zn2+ ions is therefore induced. Concomitantly, the robust chemical bonding of such hydrogel layers to the Zn slab exhibits a desirable anti&#8208;catalytic effect, thereby greatly diminishing the water activity and eliminating side reactions. Subsequently, a symmetric cell using the Gel/SA&#8208;acetate electrolyte demonstrates a reversible plating/stripping performance for 1580&#8197;h, and an asymmetric cell reaches a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art runtime of 5600&#8197;h with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. The resultant zinc ion hybrid capacitors deliver exceptional properties including the capacity retention of 98.5&#8201;% over 15000&#8197;cycles, energy density of 236.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and high mechanical adaptability. This work is expected to pave a new avenue for the development of novel hydrogel electrolytes towards safe and stable Zn anodes.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Potassium&#8208;Modified Nickel&#8208;Zinc Carbide Boosts Production of Higher Alcohols beyond CH4 in CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8722;Zn bimetal catalyst breaks the limits of methanation over metallic Ni0 for CO2 hydrogenation. K promotion of the Ni&#8722;Zn catalyst facilitates the in situ formation of Ni3Zn1C0.7 IMC, enhances CO2 adsorption, and accelerates C&#8722;C coupling, thereby promoting C2+OH production.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied in the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4, but selective and efficient synthesis of higher alcohols (C2+OH) from CO2 hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based catalyst is still challenging due to successive hydrogenation of C1 intermediates leading to methanation. Herein, we report an unprecedented synthesis of C2+OH from CO2 hydrogenation over K&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Zn bimetal catalyst with promising activity and selectivity. Systematic experiments (including XRD, in situ spectroscopic characterization) and computational studies reveal the in situ generation of an active K&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Zn carbide (K&#8208;Ni3Zn1C0.7) by carburization of Zn&#8208;incorporated Ni0, which can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption and the surface coverage of alkyl intermediates, and boost the C&#8722;C coupling to C2+OH rather than conventional CH4. This work opens a new catalytic avenue toward CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH, and also provides an insightful example for the rational design of selective and efficient Ni&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to multiple carbon products.

         <title>77&#8201;% Photothermal Conversion in Blatter&#8208;Type Diradicals: Photophysics and Photodynamic Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
A conical intersection between the lowest energy excited state and the ground state of the Blatter&#8208;type diradical is responsible for highly efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion of the absorbed radiation. Also, it is first applied to photothermal therapy of tumor cells, demonstrating good stability and the highest photo&#8208;thermal conversion in the diradicaloid field.







Abstract
Diradicals based on the Blatter units and connected by acetylene and alkene spacers have been prepared. All the molecules show sizably large diradical character and low energy singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Their photo&#8208;physical properties concerning their lowest energy excited state have been studied in detail by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy. We have fully identified the main optical absorption band and full absence of emission from the lowest energy excited state. A computational study has been also carried out that has helped to identify the presence of a conical intersection between the lowest energy excited state and the ground state which produces a highly efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion of the absorbed radiation. Furthermore, an outstanding photo&#8208;thermal conversion 77.23&#8201;% has been confirmed, close to the highest in the diradicaloid field. For the first time, stable diradicals are applied to photo&#8208;thermal therapy of tumor cells with good stability and satisfactory performance at near&#8208;infrared region.

         <title>Dual Nickel(II)/Mechanoredox Catalysis: Mechanical&#8208;Force&#8208;Driven Aryl&#8208;Amination Reactions Using Ball Milling and Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a new class of synergistic catalytic system that uses a nickel(II) catalyst and a mechanoredox catalyst to promote mechanochemical&#8208;force&#8208;driven C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. This reaction shows a broad substrate scope, an inexpensive catalyst, short reaction time, and an almost negligible quantity of solvents. The present approach accordingly complements existing nickel(II)/photoredox cocatalysis.







Abstract
The combination of a nickel(II) catalyst and a mechanoredox catalyst under ball&#8208;milling conditions promotes mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;driven C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this nickel(II)/mechanoredox cocatalyst system, the modulation of the oxidation state of the nickel center, induced by piezoelectricity, is used to facilitate a highly efficient aryl&#8208;amination reaction, which is characterized by a broad substrate scope, an inexpensive combination of catalysts (NiBr2 and BaTiO3), short reaction times, and an almost negligible quantity of solvents. Moreover, this reaction can be readily up&#8208;scaled to the multi&#8208;gram scale, and all synthetic operations can be carried out under atmospheric conditions without the need for complicated reaction setups. Furthermore, this force&#8208;induced system is suitable for excitation&#8208;energy&#8208;accepting molecules and poorly soluble polyaromatic substrates that are incompatible with solution&#8208;based nickel(II)/photoredox cocatalysts.

Furthermore, this force-induced system is suitable for excitation-energy-accepting molecules and poorly soluble polyaromatic substrates that are incompatible with solution-based nickel(II)/photoredox cocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Li+ Diffusion and Lattice oxygen Stability by the High Entropy Effect in Disordered&#8208;Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy strategy improves the Li+ diffusion and oxygen lattice stability of the Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalts cathode during charging, and enables multiple 3d TM to participate in charge compensation cooperatively, resulting in better cycling retention and higher reversible capacity.







Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalt oxides (DRXs) are a promising new class of cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their natural abundance, low cost and great electrochemical performance. High entropy strategy in Mn&#8208;based DRXs appears to be an effective strategy for improving the rate capability, but it suffers from challenges including capacity degradation. The present paper reports a new group of high entropy DRXs (HE DRX) based on Ni2+&#8208;Nb5+ pair; the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of DRXs with an increasing transition metal (TM) species are systematically investigated. An explanation is proposed for how the crystal field stability energy determines that HE DRX could exist in single Rocksalt solid solution structures. We further reveal that the charge compensation mechanism in HE DRX is the result of various TM synergistic effect. More importantly, through various in situ and ex situ techniques and theoretical calculation, the effective integration of more TM cation species within the HE DRX framework promotes better Li+ diffusion and improves lattice oxygen stability, consequently increasing capacity upon cycling.

         <title>Stabilizing Low&#8208;Valence Single Atoms by Constructing Metalloid Tungsten Carbide Supports for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence single&#8208;atom sites are induced and stabilized by constructing a metalloid tungsten carbide support (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd), leading to the realization of superior mass activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Designing novel single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supports to modulate the electronic structure is crucial to optimize the catalytic activity, but rather challenging. Herein, a general strategy is proposed to utilize the metalloid properties of supports to trap and stabilize single&#8208;atoms with low&#8208;valence states. A series of single&#8208;atoms supported on the surface of tungsten carbide (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a facile pyrolysis method. Benefiting from the metalloid properties of WCx, the single&#8208;atoms exhibit weak coordination with surface W and C atoms, resulting in the formation of low&#8208;valence active centers similar to metals. The unique metal&#8208;metal interaction effectively stabilizes the low&#8208;valence single atoms on the WCx surface and improves the electronic orbital energy level distribution of the active sites. As expected, the representative Ru&#8208;WCx exhibits superior mass activities of 7.84 and 62.52&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER), respectively. In&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis demonstrates that an ideal dual&#8208;sites cooperative mechanism achieves a suitable adsorption balance of Had and OHad, resulting in an energetically favorable Volmer step. This work offers new guidance for the precise construction of highly active SACs.

Developing scalable systems and understanding dynamic behaviors are crucial for advancing the technological potential of multicomponent catalysts for CO2&#8208;based methanol synthesis. In their Research Article (e202306563), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers show that the reaction&#8208;induced restructuring of Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 systems, prepared via impregnation, leads to a unique architecture that integrates the necessary acid&#8208;base functionality of In2O3 with the H2 splitting ability of an InPd2 alloy, while also ensuring high stability.

The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In their Research Article (e202306901), Dan Luo, Zhongwei Chen et&#8197;al. report a novel dual&#8208;defect metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a new catalyst type to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of lithium polysulfides. The missing linker defect and missing cluster defect significantly catalyze the sulfur reduction reaction. As a result, dual&#8208;defect MOF&#8208;based separators lead to a strongly improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Cover Picture: Fast and Non&#8208;equilibrium Uptake of Hydrogen by Pd Icosahedral Nanocrystals (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42/2023)</title>

Palladium icosahedral nanocrystals , a type of multiply&#8208;twinned nanocrystals, are found to enable facile and fast hydrogen absorption. In their Research Article (e202306906), Manos Mavrikakis, Younan Xia et&#8197;al. demonstrate that, upon absorbing hydrogen, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide the particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of high&#8208;energy phase boundaries is no longer favored. Meanwhile, the presence of tensile strain accelerates the kinetics of hydrogen absorption due to the increase in lattice spacing. Notably, the as&#8208;obtained PdHx nanocrystals with controllable compositions also show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward formic acid oxidation, which can also be attributed to the tensile strain.

         <dc:description>
Bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs), which transport small molecules, proteins, and nucleotides within a lipid bilayer, serve as communication facilitators. Toshiyuki Wakimoto et&#8197;al. revealed in their Research Article (e202307304) that MVs&#8208;mediated interbacterial communication triggers silent secondary metabolite production in various bacteria. Particularly striking is the competitive interaction between Burkholderia multivorans and Xenorhabdus innexi, involving the exchange of their respective MVs and the MVs&#8208;induced secondary metabolites.

         <title>Azoheteroarene and Diazocine Molecular Photoswitches: Self&#8208;Assembly, Responsive Materials and Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as versatile molecular photoswitches beyond azobenzenes. In this minireview, we highlight some of the most promising azo&#8208;based molecular photoswitches (arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines and diazocines) and discuss their application in supramolecular assembly, responsive materials and photopharmacology.







Abstract
Aromatic units tethered with an azo (&#8722;N=N&#8722;) functionality comprise a unique class of compounds, known as molecular photoswitches, exhibiting a reversible transformation between their E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers in response to photo&#8208;irradiation. Photoswitches have been explored extensively in the recent past to prepare dynamic self&#8208;assembled materials, optoelectronic devices, responsive biomaterials, and more. Most of such materials involve azobenzenes as the molecular photoswitch and to date, SciFinder lists more than 7000&#8197;articles and 1000&#8197;patents. Subsequently, a great deal of effort has been invested to improve the photo&#8208;isomerization efficiency and related mesoscopic properties of azobenzenes. Recently, azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes, such as arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines, and diazocines, have emerged as second generation molecular photoswitches beyond conventional azobenzenes. These photoswitches offer distinct photoswitching behavior and responsive properties which make them highly promising candidates for multifaceted applications ranging from photoresponsive materials to photopharmacophores. In this minireview, we introduce the structural refinement and photoresponsive properties of azoheteroarenes and diazocines and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art on utilizing these photoswitches as responsive building blocks in supramolecular assembly, material science and photopharmacology, highlighting their versatile photochemical behavior, enhanced functionality, and latest applications.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights the inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with different configurations and summarizes their latest progress for heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions. These enable to design efficient DACs with well&#8208;defined structures for boosting catalysis.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique intrinsic properties. The synergy between dual atoms provides flexible active sites, promising to enhance performance and even catalyze more complex reactions. However, precisely regulating active site structure and uncovering dual&#8208;atom metal interaction remain grand challenges. In this review, we clarify the significance of the inter&#8208;metal interaction of DACs based on the understanding of active center structures. Three diatomic configurations are elaborated, including isolated dual single&#8208;atom, N/O&#8208;bridged dual&#8208;atom, and direct dual&#8208;metal bonding interaction. Subsequently, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress in heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions are summarized. The structure&#8208;activity relationship between DACs and catalytic performance is then discussed at an atomic level. Finally, the challenges and future directions to engineer the structure of DACs are discussed. This review will offer new prospects for the rational design of efficient DACs toward heterogeneous catalysis.

However, precisely regulating active site structure and uncovering dual-atom metal interaction remain grand challenges. In this review, we clarify the significance of the inter-metal interaction of DACs based on the understanding of active center structures. Three diatomic configurations are elaborated, including isolated dual single-atom, N/O-bridged dual-atom, and direct dual-metal bonding interaction. Subsequently, the up-to-date progress in heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions are summarized. The structure-activity relationship between DACs and catalytic performance is then discussed at an atomic level. Finally, the challenges and future directions to engineer the structure of DACs are discussed. This review will offer new prospects for the rational design of efficient DACs toward heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA) Syntheses in Non&#8208;Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a versatile technique for the rational synthesis of block copolymer nanoparticles in non&#8208;polar media. In principle, such formulations offer commercial applications but only one review article has been published in this field. The current review summarizes the advances reported since 2016, including thermally induced morphological transitions, gel rheology behaviour and in situ monitoring techniques.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a powerful and highly versatile technique for the rational synthesis of colloidal dispersions of diblock copolymer nanoparticles, including spheres, worms or vesicles. PISA can be conducted in water, polar solvents or non&#8208;polar media. In principle, the latter formulations offer a wide range of potential commercial applications. However, there has been just one review focused on PISA syntheses in non&#8208;polar media and this prior article was published in 2016. The purpose of the current review article is to summarize the various advances that have been reported since then. In particular, PISA syntheses conducted using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various n&#8208;alkanes, poly(&#945;&#8208;olefins), mineral oil, low&#8208;viscosity silicone oils or supercritical CO2 are discussed in detail. Selected formulations exhibit thermally induced worm&#8208;to&#8208;sphere or vesicle&#8208;to&#8208;worm morphological transitions and the rheological properties of various examples of worm gels in non&#8208;polar media are summarized. Finally, visible absorption spectroscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) enable in situ monitoring of nanoparticle formation, while small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) can be used to examine micelle fusion/fission and chain exchange mechanisms.

         <title>meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized pyridines have broad applications in chemical science. However, direct functionalization of pyridine C&#8722;H bonds at the meta&#8208;position is difficult. Significant advances have been achieved in recent years through directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation or temporary dearomatization strategies. Herein, we describe the advances and challenges in the development of meta&#8208;selective functionalization of pyridines.







Abstract
The pyridine moiety is an important core structure for a variety of drugs, agrochemicals, catalysts, and functional materials. Direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in pyridines is a straightforward approach to access valuable substituted pyridines. Compared to the direct ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization, meta&#8208;selective pyridine C&#8722;H functionalization is far more challenging due to the inherent electronic properties of the pyridine entity. This review summarizes currently available methods for pyridine meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization using a directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation, and temporary dearomatization strategies. Recent advances in ligand control and temporary dearomatization are highlighted. We analyze the advantages as well as limitations of current techniques and hope to inspire further developments in this important area.

         <title>Photochemical Desaturation and Epoxidation with Oxygen by Sequential Flavin Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, flavoenzymes mediate mechanistically unrelated transformations such as desaturations and epoxidations with oxygen from air. We disclose the combination of both activities in a sequential fashion using molecular flavin catalysts in the organic laboratory. Our protocol consists of initial photochemical desaturation of silyl enol ethers and subsequent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketone formation with molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Catalytic desaturations are important strategies for the functionalization of organic molecules. In nature, flavoenzymes mediate the formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds by concomitant cofactor reduction. Contrary to many laboratory methods for these reactions, such as the Saegusa&#8208;Ito oxidation, no transition metal reagents or catalysts are required. However, a molecular flavin&#8208;mediated variant has not been reported so far. We disclose a photochemical approach for silyl enol ether oxidation, which leads to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (13 examples) in very good yields. The flavin catalysts are stable throughout the desaturation reaction, and we successfully applied them in a subsequent aerobic epoxidation by simply changing the reaction conditions. This protocol allowed us to directly convert silyl enol ethers into &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketones in a one&#8208;pot fashion (12 examples). Sequential flavin catalysis is not limited to one specific reactivity combination and can, inter alia, couple the photochemical oxidation with radical additions. We anticipate that flavin&#8208;catalyzed desaturation will be applicable to other substrate classes and that its sequential catalytic activity will enable rapid substrate diversification.

The first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;methanobactin OB3b, a unique carcerand&#8208;like chalkophore, is reported. Key features were a cyclodehydratation&#8208;thioacylation sequence for accessing two unprecedented azlactone building blocks and metal ion&#8208;templation for enabling cyclization of the methanobactin peptide backbone.







Abstract
Methanobactin OB3b (Mbn&#8208;OB3b) is a unique natural product with stunning affinity for copper ions (Ka&#8776;Cu(I) 1034). Here, we report the first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;bound methanobactin OB3b featuring as key transformations a cyclodehydration&#8208;thioacylation sequence, to generate the conjugated heterocyclic systems, and a copper&#8208;templated cyclization, to complete the caged structure of the very sensitive target compound.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Effect in a Covalent&#8211;Organic Framework with Imidazole Groups Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generally, the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic media is irrepressible. Here, we report an imidazole&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst, which exhibits a better performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction in an acidic electrolyte than in a neutral electrolyte.







Abstract
Solvent effect plays an important role in catalytic reaction, but there is little research and attention on it in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, we report a stable covalent&#8208;organic framework (denoted as PcNi&#8208;im) with imidazole groups as a new electrocatalyst for eCO2RR to CO. Interestingly, compared with neutral conditions, PcNi&#8208;im not only showed high Faraday efficiency of CO product (&#8776;100&#8201;%) under acidic conditions (pH &#8776; 1), but also the partial current density was increased from 258 to 320&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. No obvious degradation was observed over 10&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The mechanism study shows that the imidazole group on the framework can be protonated to form an imidazole cation in acidic media, hence reducing the surface work function and charge density of the active metal center. As a result, CO poisoning effect is weakened and the key intermediate *COOH is also stabilized, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction rate.

     alt="Self-Accelerating Effect in a Covalent&#8211;Organic Framework with Imidazole Groups Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 to CO"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic media is irrepressible. Here, we report an imidazole-linked covalent-organic framework electrocatalyst, which exhibits a better performance of electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction in an acidic electrolyte than in a neutral electrolyte.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solvent effect plays an important role in catalytic reaction, but there is little research and attention on it in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). Herein, we report a stable covalent-organic framework (denoted as &lt;b&gt;PcNi-im&lt;/b&gt;) with imidazole groups as a new electrocatalyst for eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to CO. Interestingly, compared with neutral conditions, &lt;b&gt;PcNi-im&lt;/b&gt; not only showed high Faraday efficiency of CO product (&#8776;100&#8201;%) under acidic conditions (pH &#8776; 1), but also the partial current density was increased from 258 to 320&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. No obvious degradation was observed over 10&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The mechanism study shows that the imidazole group on the framework can be protonated to form an imidazole cation in acidic media, hence reducing the surface work function and charge density of the active metal center. As a result, CO poisoning effect is weakened and the key intermediate *COOH is also stabilized, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Decarboxylative Olefination Driven by Alternating Polarity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical conversion of unactivated carboxylic acids to olefins under alternating polarity is reported. By modulating electrode surface quality and local acidity, chemoselective Hofer&#8208;Moest reactivity is realized on conventionally difficult substrates, including primary and secondary unactivated carboxylic acids. This simple protocol is exceptionally scalable (1&#8197;kg) and cost&#8208;effective.







Abstract
A mild, scalable (kg) metal&#8208;free electrochemical decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids to olefins is disclosed. Numerous applications are presented wherein this transformation can simplify alkene synthesis and provide alternative synthetic access to valuable olefins from simple carboxylic acid feedstocks. This robust method relies on alternating polarity to maintain the quality of the electrode surface and local pH, providing a deeper understanding of the Hofer&#8208;Moest process with unprecedented chemoselectivity.

         <title>Breaking K+ Concentration Limit on Cu Nanoneedles for Acidic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K+ concentration (4.22&#8197;M), breaking the K+ solubility limit (3.5&#8197;M). This enables a highly efficient CO2RR in 3&#8197;M KCl at pH=1, with a FEC2+ of 90.69&#177;2.15&#8201;% at 1400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a single pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) of 25.49&#177;0.82&#8201;% at a CO2 flow rate of 7&#8197;sccm.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) in acidic electrolyte is one of the most advanced routes for tackling our current climate and energy crisis. However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the poor selectivity towards the valuable C2+ products are the major obstacles for the upscaling of these technologies. High local potassium ions (K+) concentration at the cathode's surface can inhibit proton&#8208;diffusion and accelerate the desirable carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling process. However, the solubility limit of potassium salts in bulk solution constrains the maximum achievable K+ concentration at the reaction sites and thus the overall acidic CO2RR performance of most electrocatalysts. In this work, we demonstrate that Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K+ concentrations (4.22&#8197;M) &#8211; thus breaking the K+ solubility limit (3.5&#8197;M) &#8211; which enables a highly efficient CO2RR in 3&#8197;M KCl at pH=1. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 90.69&#177;2.15&#8201;% for C2+ (FEC2+) can be achieved at 1400&#8197;mA.cm&#8722;2, simultaneous with a single pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) of 25.49&#177;0.82&#8201;% at a CO2 flow rate of 7&#8197;sccm.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Unstrained Heterocycles Using Cobalt Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt catalysts promote enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of unstrained heterocycles by the reductive addition of 1,1&#8208;dichloroalkenes. The products are acyclic homoallylic alcohols containing a vinylzinc motif, which can be further functionalized with an electrophile. Mechanistic studies suggest that ring&#8208;opening occurs by an outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by a Zn(II) Lewis acid.







Abstract
Cobalt catalysts promote highly enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans using vinylidenes. The products are acyclic organozinc compounds that can be functionalized with an electrophile. The proposed mechanism involves the generation of a cobalt vinylidene species that adds to the alkene by a [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition pathway. Ring&#8208;opening then occurs via outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by coordination of a ZnX2 Lewis acid to the alkoxide leaving group. DFT models reveal that competing inner&#8208;sphere syn &#946;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;O elimination pathways are suppressed by the geometric constraints of the metallacycle intermediate. These models rationalize the observed stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

Fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids was reported.

Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities.







Abstract
Here we report a simple and general method to achieve fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids, employing bench&#8208;stable allyl glycosyl sulfones as donors. Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities. Both the donor activation stage and the glycosidic bond forming stage of the process are compatible with free hydroxyl groups, thereby allowing for the use of fully unprotected glycosyl donors. This transformation is stereoconvergent, occurs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions at ambient temperature with visible light (455&#8197;nm) irradiation, and displays remarkable scope with respect to both reaction partners. Many natural products and commercial drugs, including an acid derived from the complex anticancer agent taxol, were efficiently glycosylated. Experimental studies provide insights into the origin of the stereochemical outcome.

A novel self&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition of vinyldiazo compounds is described, providing cyclopentene derivatives with conservation of one diazo functional group. The reaction involves an unprecedented single electron oxidation of vinyldiazo compounds using iridium photocatalysis.







Abstract
A photocatalytic self&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition of vinyldiazo compounds is described, which provides cyclopentene derivatives with conservation of one diazo functional group. Experimental insights and density functional theory indicate that the reaction is triggered by an unusual single electron oxidation of vinyldiazo compounds, while the photolysis for the generation of free carbene species is not involved. The synthetic applications of the resulting cyclopentenyl &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds were demonstrated based on the rich chemistry of the diazo functional group.

         <title>Ultrafast Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A in Live Cells and Clinical Glioma Tissues Using an Affinity Binding&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By studying the interaction between small molecules and enzymes, we have successfully developed an affinity binding&#8208;based two&#8208;photon small&#8208;molecule fluorogenic probe (CD1) for the ultrafast detection of endogenous monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8722;A) content in complex biological systems.







Abstract
Abnormal expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8722;A) has been implicated in the development of human glioma, making MAO&#8722;A a promising target for therapy. Therefore, a rapid determination of MAO&#8722;A is critical for diagnosis. Through in silico screening of two&#8208;photon fluorophores, we discovered that a derivative of N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;naphthalenamine (pre&#8208;mito) can effectively fit into the entrance of the MAO&#8722;A cavity. Substitutions on the N&#8208;pyridine not only further explore the MAO&#8722;A cavity, but also enable mitochondrial targeting ability. The aminopropyl substituted molecule, CD1, showed the fastest MAO&#8722;A detection (within 20&#8197;s), high MAO&#8722;A affinity and selectivity. It was also used for in situ imaging of MAO&#8722;A in living cells, enabling a comparison of the MAO&#8722;A content in human glioma and paracancerous tissues. Our results demonstrate that optimizing the affinity binding&#8208;based fluorogenic probes significantly improves their detection rate, providing a general approach for rapid detection probe design and optimization.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorinative Bifunctionalization of Aziridines and Azetidines with gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>

An unprecedented fluorinative bifunctionalization of aziridines and azetidines with gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is disclosed via Pd catalysis for the first time, which reveals a novel ring&#8208;opening mode of cyclic amines.







Abstract
An unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorinative bifunctionalization of aziridines and azetidines was successfully developed via regioselective C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond cleavage of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, leading to various &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;bisfluorinated amines and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;bisfluorinated amines. This reaction was achieved by incorporating a 2&#8208;fluorinated allyl group and a fluorine atom scissored from gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane in 100&#8201;% atom economy for the first time. The mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction underwent amine attacking 2&#8208;fluorinated allyl palladium complex to generate &#951;2&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;allyl aziridine followed by fluoride ligand transfer affording the final &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;fluorinated amines.

We report a rare polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction displays broad scope with mechanistic investigations supporting a unique synergistic activation pathway that displays chemoselectivity for styrene boronic acids in the presence of other SOMOphiles. SOMO=singly occupied molecular orbital.







Abstract
We report the development of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through an unusual polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition mechanism that is orthogonal to established processes. Synergistic activation of the radical precursor and organoboron are critical mechanistic events. Activation of an N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester by coordination to boron enables electron transfer, with decomposition leading to a nucleofuge rebound, activating the organoboron to radical addition. The unique mechanism enables chemoselective coupling of styrene boronic acids in the presence of other alkene radical acceptors. The scope and limitations of the reaction, and a detailed mechanistic investigation are presented.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbofunctionalization of Alkynes with Organohalides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first report of 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes using organohalides as coupling partners in the field of gold catalysis has been presented. Mechanistic investigations, including NMR, tandem mass spectrometry and DFT studies, reveal that an oxidative addition/carbophilic activation pathway is preferred over the migratory insertion/cis&#8208;trans isomerization pathway.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first gold&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes using organohalides as non&#8208;prefunctionalized coupling partners. The mechanism of the reaction involves an oxidative addition/&#960;&#8208;activation mechanism in contrast to the migratory insertion/cis&#8208;trans isomerization pathway that is predominantly observed with other transition metals yielding products with anti&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic insights include several control experiments, NMR studies, HR&#8208;MSMS analyses, and DFT calculations that strongly support the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Bifunctional Carbanionic Synthesis of Fully Bio&#8208;Based Triblock Structures Derived from &#946;&#8208;Farnesene and ll&#8208;Dilactide: Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>

         <dc:description>
Relying on the bifunctional carbanionic polymerization of &#946;&#8208;farnesene and subsequent end&#8208;functionalization with ethoxy ethyl glycidyl ether, telechelic multihydroxy functional polyfarnesene is accessible. Via organobase&#8208;catalyzed ROP of ll&#8208;dilactide a fully bio&#8208;based A2BA2&#8208;type block copolymer structure was generated. The material was investigated in terms of its morphology, mechanical and thermoplastic elastomer properties.







Abstract
Current environmental challenges and the shrinking fossil&#8208;fuel feedstock are important criteria for the next generation of polymer materials. In this context, we present a fully bio&#8208;based material, which shows promise as a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Due to the use of &#946;&#8208;farnesene and L&#8208;lactide as monomers, bio&#8208;based feedstocks, namely sugar cane and corn, can be used. A bifunctional initiator for the carbanionic polymerization was employed, to permit an efficient synthesis of ABA&#8208;type block structures. In addition, the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent MTBE (methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether) was used for the anionic polymerisation, enabling excellent solubility of the bifunctional anionic initiator. This afforded low dispersity (&#272;=1.07 to 1.10) and telechelic polyfarnesene macroinitiators. These were employed for lactide polymerization to obtain H&#8208;shaped triblock copolymers. TEM and SAXS revealed clearly phase&#8208;separated morphologies, and tensile tests demonstrated elastic mechanical properties. The materials featured two glass transition temperatures, at &#8208; 66&#8201;&#176;C and 51&#8201;&#176;C as well as gyroid or cylindrical morphologies, resulting in soft elastic materials at room temperature.

         <title>Combinatorial Screening of Water/Proton Permeation of Self&#8208;Assembled Pillar[5]arene Artificial Water Channel Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary combinations of pillararene libraries have been used to construct selective artificial water channels that present increased water transport activities across lipid bilayers compared to their components A&#8211;D. These channels are capable of transporting water at a rate that is one order of magnitude below that of the natural aquaporins.







Abstract
Artificial water channels (AWCs) that selectively transport water and reject ions through bilayer membranes have potential to act as synthetic Aquaporins (AQPs). AWCs can have a similar osmotic permeability, better stability, with simpler manufacture on a larger&#8208;scale and have higher functional density and surface permeability when inserted into the membrane. Here, we report the screening of combinatorial libraries of symmetrical and unsymmetrical rim&#8208;functionalized PAs A&#8211;D that are able to transport ca. 107&#8211;108 water molecules/s/channel, which is within 1 order of magnitude of AQPs&#8217; and show total ion and proton rejection. Among the four channels, C and D are 3&#8211;4&#8197;times more water permeable than A and B when inserted in bilayer membranes. The binary combinations of A&#8211;D with different molar ratios could be expressed as an independent (linear ABA), a recessive (inhibition AB, AC, DB, ACA), or a dominant (amplification, DBD) behavior of the water net permeation events.

         <title>Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response in a Densely&#8208;Stacked Van Der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Oxychloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;sole functional module&#8221; strategy that assembles dense structures comprising well&#8208;aligned nonlinear optical&#8208;efficient modules is proposed. This has led to the discovery of a densely&#8208;stacked van der Waals transition&#8208;metal oxychloride with a giant mid&#8208;infrared second&#8208;harmonic generation response.







Abstract
Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental optical property of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. Thus far, it has proved difficult to engineer large SHG responses, particularly in the mid&#8208;infrared region, owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the arrangement and density of functional NLO&#8208;active units. Herein, a new assembly strategy employing functional modules only, and aimed at maximizing the density and optimizing the spatial arrangement of highly efficient functional modules, has been applied to the preparation of NLO crystals, affording the van der Waals crystal MoO2Cl2. This exhibits the strongest powder SHG response (2.1&#215;KTiOPO4 (KTP) @ 2100&#8197;nm) for a transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide, a wide optical transparency window, and a sufficient birefringence. MoO2Cl2 is the first SHG&#8208;active transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide effective in the infrared region. Theoretical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest that the densely packed, optimally&#8208;aligned [MoO4Cl2] modules within the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals layers are responsible for the giant SHG response.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation&#8208;Induced Glycolate Aldol Additions of Silyl Glyoxylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral (diene)Rh(I) complex catalyzes the enantioselective three&#8208;component coupling reaction of silyl glyoxylates, boronic acids, and aldehydes to yield complex fully substituted mandelates. Notable features include the mild generation of chiral Rh&#8208;enolates by 1,2&#8208;Brook rearrangement and, from that point, modular preparation of glycolate aldol adducts.







Abstract
(Diene)Rh(I) complexes catalyze the stereoselective three&#8208;component coupling of silyl glyoxylates, arylboronic acids, and aldehydes to give glycolate aldol products. The participation of Rh&#8208;alkoxides in the requisite Brook rearrangement was established through two component Rh&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silyl glyoxylates with ArB(OH)2 to give silyl&#8208;protected mandelate derivatives. The intermediacy of a chiral Rh&#8208;enolate was inferred through enantioselective protonation using a chiral Rh&#8208;catalyst. Diastereoselective three&#8208;component couplings with aldehydes as terminating electrophiles to give racemic products were best achieved with a bulky aryl ester on the silyl glyoxylate reagent. Optimal enantioselective couplings were carried out with the tert&#8208;butyl ester variant using an anisole&#8208;derived enantiopure tricyclo[3.2.2.02,4]nonadiene ligand.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Formal [1,3]&#8208;Aryl Shift within Molecular Bows</title>

Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach was proposed to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows with integrated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties.







Abstract
Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, we present a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows (MBs) that integrate 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties. By introducing ring strain into MBs through tethering the bow limb, we can harness the intrinsic mechanical forces to drive multistep aryl shifts from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208; to the ortho&#8208;position. Through the use of precise intramolecular strain, the seemingly impractical [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift was realized, resulting in the formation of ortho&#8208;disubstituted products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, we present a molecular-strain engineering approach to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]-aryl shift (formal [1,3]-aryl shift) in molecular bows (MBs) that integrate 1,4-dimethoxy-2,5-cyclohexadiene moieties. By introducing ring strain into MBs through tethering the bow limb, we can harness the intrinsic mechanical forces to drive multistep aryl shifts from the &lt;i&gt;para-&lt;/i&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;ortho-&lt;/i&gt;position. Through the use of precise intramolecular strain, the seemingly impractical [1,3]-aryl shift was realized, resulting in the formation of &lt;i&gt;ortho-&lt;/i&gt;disubstituted products. The solvent and temperature play a crucial role in the occurrence of the [1,3]-aryl shift. The free energy calculations with inclusion of solvation support a feasible mechanism, which entails multistep carbocation rearrangements, for the formal [1,3]-aryl shift. By exploring the application of molecular strain in synthetic chemistry, this research offers a promising direction for developing new tools and strategies towards precision organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Biltz synthesis establishes straightforward access to 5,5&#8208;disubstituted (thio)hydantoins by combining a 1,2&#8208;diketone and a (thio)urea. Its appealing features include inherent atom and step economy together with the potential to generate structurally diverse products. However, control of the stereochemistry of this reaction has proven to be a daunting challenge. Herein, we describe the first example of enantioselective catalytic Biltz synthesis which affords more than 40 thiohydantoins with high stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208; control, irrespective of the symmetry of thiourea structure. A one pot synthesis of corresponding hydantoins is also documented. Remarkably, experimental studies and DFT calculations establish the reaction pathway and origin of stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coformer Approach for Supramolecular Polymerization at High Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound is poorly soluble in nonpolar solvent because of its organization through its hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs into a crystalline polymorph prior to supramolecular polymerization. Mixing a &#8220;supramolecular coformer&#8221; compound with the parent compound provide highly soluble co&#8208;aggregates, enabling supramolecular polymerization at high concentrations.







Abstract
Insolubility of functional molecules caused by polymorphism sometimes poses limitations for their solution&#8208;based processing. Such a situation can also occur in the preparation processes of supramolecular polymers formed in a solution. An effective strategy to address this issue is to prepare amorphous solid states by introducing a &#8220;coformer&#8221; molecule capable of inhibiting the formation of an insoluble polymorph through co&#8208;aggregation. Herein, inspired by the coformer approach, we demonstrated a solubility enhancement of a barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound that can supramolecularly polymerize through six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosettes. Our newly synthesized supramolecular coformer molecule features a sterically demanding methyl group in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated unit of the parent molecule. Although the parent molecule exhibits low solubility in nonpolar solvents due to the formation of a crystalline polymorph comprising a tape&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded array prior to the supramolecular polymerization, mixing with the coformer compound enhanced the solubility by inhibiting mesoscopic organization of the tapes. The two monomers were then co&#8208;polymerized into desired helicoidal supramolecular polymers through the formation of heteromeric rosettes.

Mixing a &#8220;supramolecular coformer&#8221; compound with the parent compound provide highly soluble co-aggregates, enabling supramolecular polymerization at high concentrations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insolubility of functional molecules caused by polymorphism sometimes poses limitations for their solution-based processing. Such a situation can also occur in the preparation processes of supramolecular polymers formed in a solution. An effective strategy to address this issue is to prepare amorphous solid states by introducing a &#8220;coformer&#8221; molecule capable of inhibiting the formation of an insoluble polymorph through co-aggregation. Herein, inspired by the coformer approach, we demonstrated a solubility enhancement of a barbiturate &#960;-conjugated compound that can supramolecularly polymerize through six-membered hydrogen-bonded rosettes. Our newly synthesized supramolecular coformer molecule features a sterically demanding methyl group in the &#960;-conjugated unit of the parent molecule. Although the parent molecule exhibits low solubility in nonpolar solvents due to the formation of a crystalline polymorph comprising a tape-like hydrogen-bonded array prior to the supramolecular polymerization, mixing with the coformer compound enhanced the solubility by inhibiting mesoscopic organization of the tapes. The two monomers were then co-polymerized into desired helicoidal supramolecular polymers through the formation of heteromeric rosettes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Responsive Dinuclear Zinc Complex Consisting of Proximally Arranged Two d10&#8208;Zinc Centers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear Zn complex showing anomalous visible&#8208;light absorption using Zn orbitals is developed. Key to the success of the low&#8208;energy absorption is the short distance between coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers, which enables the Zn&#8722;Zn orbital interactions to dramatically decrease the energy gap of the complex. Such Zn&#8722;Zn interactions facilitate untapped photo&#8208;functions of a group&#8197;12 Zn metal.







Abstract
So far, Zn(II)&#8208;based d10 complexes have been known to be colorless unless they are accompanied by chromophoric groups, and therefore both fundamental and advanced photophysical performance of Zn centers of complexes, especially in visible&#8208;light regions has been unexplored. Here, we first demonstrate a dinuclear Zn(II) complex that shows visible light absorption using an orbital distributed over closely contacted two Zn centers experimentally determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A contrastive study demonstrated that intermetallic orbital interaction in dinuclear Zn(II) complex is responsible for capturing visible light to exhibit orangish yellow color, whereas an analogous one without such an interaction is colorless. This work demonstrates that introduction of Zn&#8722;Zn interactions to Zn(II) molecules contradicts the common notion that Zn is unresponsive to visible light and expands the photophysical field of zinc chemistry.

         <title>Ultrafluorogenic Monochromophore&#8208;Type BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazine Series for Dual&#8208;Color Bioorthogonal Imaging with a Single Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of ultrafluorogenic BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes, employing a monochromophoric strategy to acheive broad&#8208;spectrum fluorogenicity and effective bioorthogonal cellular imaging. These probes showcase a unique turn&#8208;on pattern with BCN and TCO, pioneering dual&#8208;color live&#8208;cell imaging with a single probe.







Abstract
Various fluorogenic probes utilizing tetrazine (Tz) as a fluorescence quencher and bioorthogonal reaction partner have been extensively studied over the past few decades. Herein, we synthesized a series of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;Tz probes using monochromophoric design strategy for bioorthogonal cellular imaging. The BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes exhibited excellent bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN)&#8208;selective fluorogenicity with three&#8208; to four&#8208;digit&#8208;fold enhancements in fluorescence over a wide range of emission wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes in bioorthogonal fluorescence imaging of cellular organelles without washing steps. We also elucidated the aromatized pyridazine moiety as the origin of BCN&#8208;selective fluorogenic behavior. Additionally, we discovered that the fluorescence of the trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) adducts was quenched in aqueous media via photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process. Interestingly, we observed a distinctive recovery of the initially quenched fluorescence of BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;TCO upon exposure to hydrophobic media, accompanied by a significant bathochromic shift of its emission wavelength relative to that exhibited by the corresponding BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;BCN. Leveraging this finding, for the first time, we achieved dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging with a single BODIPY&#8208;Tz probe.

         <title>Simultaneous Chiral Fixation and Chiral Regulation Endowed by Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality has been achieved by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, reversible [2+2] cycloaddition of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains allows inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and de&#8208;crosslinking to be controlled by light. This approach offers a pattern&#8208;embedded storage and retrieval mechanism for photo&#8208;editing chiral polymers.







Abstract
The construction of chiral superstructures through the self&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral polymers usually relies on the interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonds, which is significantly limited by the memory ability of induced chirality. Although the introduction of covalent crosslinking can undoubtedly enhance the stability of chiral superstructures, the concurrent strong constraining effect hinders the application of chirality&#8208;smart materials. To address this issue, we have made a first attempt at the reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, the reversible [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains can be further controlled by light to manipulate inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and decrosslinking. Based on this photo&#8208;programmable and dynamic chiral fixation strategy, a novel pattern&#8208;embedded storage mechanism of chiral polymeric materials was established for the first time.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost the Electrocatalytic Water Splitting of Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a Ni3N/NiO Heterojunction at Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a Ni3N/NiO heterostructure in Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO results in a highly electroactive surface that ensures high electroactivity and alleviates the overbinding effect. The construction of a high&#8208;density triple&#8208;phase interface is achieved, with highly active catalytic sites for electrochemical water splitting, involving hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER).







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and stable hydrogen production catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (EWS) at industrial current densities remains a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a heterostructure&#8208;induced&#8208;strategy to optimize the metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) and the EWS activity of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations firstly predicted that the Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures can improve the structural stability, electronic distributions, and orbital coupling of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO compared to Ru&#8208;Ni3N and Ru&#8208;NiO, which accordingly decreases energy barriers and increases the electroactivity for EWS. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO catalyst with a 2D Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures nanosheet array, uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles, and strong MSI, was successfully constructed in the experiment, which exhibited excellent HER and OER activity with overpotentials of 190&#8197;mV and 385&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO&#8208;based EWS device can realize an industrial current density (1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 1.74&#8197;V and 1.80&#8197;V under alkaline pure water and seawater conditions, respectively. Additionally, it also achieves a high durability of 1000&#8197;h (@ 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in alkaline pure water.

         <title>Divergent Photosensitizer Controlled Reactions of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins and Unactivated Olefins: Hydroarylation and Subsequent [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins were converted into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, allowing for hydroarylation of unactivated and electron&#8208;rich olefins. Moreover, by tuning the photocatalyst (PC), structurally complex cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products were constructed in a single step via a cascade of hydroarylation and [2+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Nucleophilic 4-hydroxycoumarins were converted into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, allowing for hydroarylation of unactivated and electron-rich olefins. Moreover, by tuning the photocatalyst (&lt;b&gt;PC&lt;/b&gt;), structurally complex cyclobutane-fused pentacyclic products were constructed in a single step via a cascade of hydroarylation and [2+2] cycloaddition.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Porous Cyclodextrin Polymer Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free and Ultra&#8208;Long Life Solid&#8208;State Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A solid polymer electrolyte based on non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect of CD&#8208;Si and double transmission channels is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth and shuttle effect of polyiodide, achieving outstanding cycle&#8208;stability of symmetrical batteries and ultralong&#8208;life solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 battery.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;I2 batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their performance is still limited by the irreversible growth of Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and shuttle effect of polyiodide. In this work, we have prepared a new porous polymer (CD&#8208;Si) by nucleophilic reaction of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with SiCl4, and CD&#8208;Si is applied to the solid polymer electrolyte (denoted PEO/PVDF/CD&#8208;Si) to solve above&#8208;mentioned problems. Through the anchoring of the CD&#8208;Si, a conductive network with dual transmission channels was successfully constructed. Due to the non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect, the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) can reach 1.64&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled symmetrical batteries can achieve highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free galvanizing/stripping (stable cycling for 7500&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1200&#8197;h at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 battery shows an ultra&#8208;long life of over 35,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to elucidate the working mechanism of CD&#8208;Si in the polymer matrix. This work provides a novel strategy towards solid electrolytes for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Controlling Metal&#8208;Oxide Reducibility for Efficient C&#8722;H Bond Activation in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O solution, structural and chemical properties of supported metal oxide species can be controlled because of dissolution&#8208;recrystallization of amorphous or/and low&#8208;crystalline support in the parent catalyst. The method is applicable for tailoring the catalyst reducibility and thus its activity for C&#8722;H activation in hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Knowing the structure of catalytically active species/phases and providing methods for their purposeful generation are two prerequisites for the design of catalysts with desired performance. Herein, we introduce a simple method for precise preparation of supported/bulk catalysts. It utilizes the ability of metal oxides to dissolve and to simultaneously precipitate during their treatment in an aqueous ammonia solution. Applying this method for a conventional VOx&#8722;Al2O3 catalyst, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites was tuned simply by changing the pH value of the solution. These sites affect the strength of V&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds of isolated VOx species and thus the reducibility of the latter. This method is also applicable for controlling the reducibility of bulk catalysts as demonstrated for a CeO2&#8722;ZrO2&#8722;Al2O3 system. The application potential of the developed catalysts was confirmed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene with CO2 and in the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Our approach is extendable to the preparation of any metal oxide catalysts dissolvable in an ammonia solution.

         <dc:description>
A novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered organic&#8211;inorganic manganese bromide with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high thermal quenching resistance was developed and explored as a green phosphor for wide color gamut light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and as a scintillator for sensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging, with performance superior to that of most commercial phosphors and scintillators, respectively.







Abstract
Eco&#8208;friendly lead&#8208;free organic&#8211;inorganic manganese halides (OIMHs) have attracted considerable attention in various optoelectronic applications because of their superior optical properties and flexible solution processibility. Herein, we report a novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered OIMH (MTP)2MnBr4 (MTP: methyltriphenylphosphonium), which exhibits intense green emission under UV/blue or X&#8208;ray excitation, with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, high resistance to thermal quenching (I150&#8201;&#176;C=84.1&#8201;%) and good photochemical stability. These features enable (MTP)2MnBr4 as an efficient green phosphor for blue&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes, demonstrating a commercial&#8208;level luminous efficiency of 101&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and a wide color gamut of 116&#8201;% NTSC. Moreover, these (MTP)2MnBr4 crystals showcase outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties, delivering a light yield of 67000 photon MeV&#8722;1, a detection limit of 82.4&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1, and a competitive spatial resolution of 6.2&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging. This work presents a new avenue for the exploration of eco&#8208;friendly luminescent OIMHs towards multifunctional light&#8208;emitting applications.

         <title>DNA Nanostructures: Self&#8208;Adjuvant Carriers for Highly Efficient Subunit Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we provide a concise overview of the unique properties exhibited by DNA nanostructures. Then we delve into the principles behind using DNA nanostructures as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers and review the latest advancements in efficient subunit vaccines construction, and propose potential directions for future development in this field.







Abstract
Subunit vaccines based on antigen proteins or epitopes of pathogens or tumors show advantages in immunological precision and high safety, but are often limited by their low immunogenicity. Adjuvants can boost immune responses by stimulating immune cells or promoting antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs), yet existing clinical adjuvants struggle in simultaneously achieving these dual functions. Additionally, the spatial organization of antigens might be crucial to their immunogenicity. Hence, superior adjuvants should potently stimulate the immune system, precisely arrange antigens, and effectively deliver antigens to APCs. Recently, precisely organizing and delivering antigens with the unique editability of DNA nanostructures has been proposed, presenting unique abilities in significantly improving the immunogenicity of antigens. In this minireview, we will discuss the principles behind using DNA nanostructures as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers and review the latest advancements in this field. The potential and challenges associated with self&#8208;adjuvant DNA nanostructures will also be discussed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse structural designs has led to the development of chalcone&#8208;flavylium systems that exhibit efficient switching across a wide spectrum of visible light, including long&#8208;wavelength red light in aqueous environments avoiding the typical UV&#8208;induced switches.







Abstract
The chalcone&#8208;flavylium photochromic system switches in aqueous media. However, the chalcone&#8594;flavylium conversion requires detrimental ultra&#8208;violet (UV) light for the switching which deters their applications in the biological domain. To address this issue, we have synthesized strategically modified chalcone scaffolds that can be reversibly switched to the flavylium forms with visible light ranging from 456&#8197;nm (blue) to 640&#8197;nm (red).

         <title>Reversible Boron&#8208;Insertion into Aromatic C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented formation of borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via reversible boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8722;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes. The reaction mechanism was clarified to consist of sequential two electrocyclic reactions with E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety through a highly strained trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.







Abstract
Formation of borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8722;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of triarylboranes bearing an ortho&#8208;phosphino substituent (ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes). The borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives were fully characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses. The dearomatized products were demonstrated to undergo the reverse reaction in the dark at room temperature, realizing photochemical and thermal interconversion between triarylboranes and boron&#8208;doped bicyclic systems. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that sequential two electrocyclic reactions involving E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety proceed via a highly strained trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.

         <title>Nickel(II) Analogues of Phosphorescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Picosecond Excited&#8208;State Decay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Square planar Ni(II) complexes are potential alternatives to well&#8208;established isoelectronic Pt(II) and Au(III) luminophores. We identify the excited&#8208;state decay channels in two prototypical Ni(II) complexes and elucidate why the initially populated excited states decay within 1&#8197;ps. Clear guidelines for how to access long&#8208;lived and potentially luminescent excited states in square planar Ni(II) complexes emerge from this work.







Abstract
Square&#8208;planar NiII complexes are interesting as cheaper and more sustainable alternatives to PtII luminophores widely used in lighting and photocatalysis. We investigated the excited&#8208;state behavior of two NiII complexes, which are isostructural with two luminescent PtII complexes. The initially excited singlet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) excited states in the NiII complexes decay to metal&#8208;centered (3MC) excited states within less than 1 picosecond, followed by non&#8208;radiative relaxation of the 3MC states to the electronic ground state within 9&#8211;21&#8197;ps. This contrasts with the population of an emissive triplet ligand&#8208;centered (3LC) excited state upon excitation of the PtII analogues. Structural distortions of the NiII complexes are responsible for this discrepant behavior and lead to dark 3MC states far lower in energy than the luminescent 3LC states of PtII compounds. Our findings suggest that if these structural distortions could be restricted by more rigid coordination environments and stronger ligand fields, the excited&#8208;state relaxation in four&#8208;coordinate NiII complexes could be decelerated such that luminescent 3LC or 3MLCT excited states become accessible. These insights are relevant to make NiII fit for photophysical and photochemical applications that relied on PtII until now.

         <title>Synthesis of Stereocontrolled Degradable Polymer by Living Cascade Enyne Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereocontrolled degradable polymer was synthesized via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization from highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers, which were prepared by Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of alkoxyallene and ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract
A stereocontrolled degradable polymer was synthesized via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. Highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers were prepared using the Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkoxyallenes and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The resulting chiral polymer exhibited a narrow dispersity window. Block copolymers were prepared not only by sequentially adding nondegradable and degradable monomers but also by using enantiomerically different monomers to produce stereocontrolled blocks. Owing to the hydrolyzable N,O&#8208;acetal moiety in the backbone structure, the resulting polymer could degrade under acidic conditions generated using various acid concentrations to control the degradation. Additionally, the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction modified the polymer without losing the stereochemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Polyethylene with In&#8208;Chain Photolyzable and Hydrolyzable Groups Enabling Recycling and Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;polymerization Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain keto groups (keto&#8208;PE) yields mixed keto&#8208;ester&#8208;PE, which combines photodegradability of the in&#8208;chain ketones with the in&#8208;chain esters as chemical access point for solvolysis, while the basic materials properties of HDPE are fully retained.







Abstract
Polyethylenes endowed with low densities of in&#8208;chain hydrolyzable and photocleavable groups can improve their circularity and potentially reduce their environmental persistency. We show with model polymers derived from acyclic diene metathesis polymerization that the simultaneous presence of both groups has no adverse effect on the polyethylene crystal structure and thermal properties. Post&#8208;polymerization Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of keto&#8208;polyethylenes from non&#8208;alternating catalytic ethylene&#8208;CO chain growth copolymerization yield high molecular weight in&#8208;chain keto&#8208;ester polyethylenes (Mn&#8776;50.000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Oxidation can proceed without chain scission and consequently the desirable materials properties of HDPE are retained. At the same time we demonstrate the suitability of the in&#8208;chain ester groups for chemical recycling by methanolysis, and show that photolytic degradation by extended exposure to simulated sunlight occurs via the keto groups.

A &#8220;chameleon catalyst&#8221; for hydrogenation reactions: The selectivity of an amine&#8208;functionalized ruthenium nanoparticles&#8208;based catalyst can be switched in the hydrogenation of bicyclic heteroaromatics by controlling the feedgas composition, unlocking adaptivity in product formation. The selectivity switch is reversible, rapid, and robust, and originates from the formation of ammonium formate species under H2/CO2, and their decomposition under H2, as reported by Alexis Bordet, Walter Leitner et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202311427).

         <title>Temporal Regulation of PET&#8208;RAFT Controlled Radical Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise temporal control under visible irradiation has been achieved through a photocatalytic RAFT chemical recycling methodology. Depolymerization could be easily initiated by switching &#8220;on&#8221; the light, whereas negligible monomer regeneration was observed in the dark. This outstanding characteristic was possible by fine regulation of the deactivation of the depropagating chain and by finally suppressing thermal initiation of the chains.







Abstract
A photocatalytic RAFT&#8208;controlled radical depolymerization method is introduced for precisely conferring temporal control under visible light irradiation. By regulating the deactivation of the depropagating chains and suppressing thermal initiation, an excellent temporal control was enabled, exemplified by several consecutive &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; cycles. Minimal, if any, depolymerization could be observed during the dark periods while the polymer chain&#8208;ends could be efficiently re&#8208;activated and continue to depropagate upon re&#8208;exposure to light. Notably, favoring deactivation resulted in the gradual unzipping of polymer chains and a stepwise decrease in molecular weight over time. This synthetic approach constitutes a simple methodology to modulate temporal control during the chemical recycling of RAFT&#8208;synthesized polymers while offering invaluable mechanistic insights.

&lt;p&gt;A photocatalytic RAFT-controlled radical depolymerization method is introduced for precisely conferring temporal control under visible light irradiation. By regulating the deactivation of the depropagating chains and suppressing thermal initiation, an excellent temporal control was enabled, exemplified by several consecutive &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; cycles. Minimal, if any, depolymerization could be observed during the dark periods while the polymer chain-ends could be efficiently re-activated and continue to depropagate upon re-exposure to light. Notably, favoring deactivation resulted in the gradual unzipping of polymer chains and a stepwise decrease in molecular weight over time. This synthetic approach constitutes a simple methodology to modulate temporal control during the chemical recycling of RAFT-synthesized polymers while offering invaluable mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A design strategy toward near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes based on utilization of an antiaromatic azepine is reported by Masahito Murai, Takahiro Enoki, and Shigehiro Yamaguchi in their Research Article (e202311445). While benzo&#8208;fused azepines take bent conformations, which undergo large structural relaxation to planar conformations in the excited state, thieno&#8208;fused congeners with electron&#8208;accepting groups at both termini adopt flat conformations even in the ground state, giving rise to NIR&#8208;emissions that exceed 850 nm.

         <title>Merging Visible Light Photocatalysis and P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation by a Single Catalyst: Modular Assembly of P&#8208;Alkyne Hybrid Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation strategies provide an efficient approach for synthesis by minimizing atom, step, and redox economy. Developing milder, greener, and more effective protocols for these strategies is always highly desirable to the scientific community. In this study, the utilization of a single rhodium complex enabled the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H activation of biaryl&#8208;type phosphines with alkynyl bromides, employing inherent phosphorus atoms as directing groups. This chemistry combines P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8211;H activation with visible light photocatalysis, under exogenous photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions, offering a unique platform for ligand design and preparation.Furthermore, this study also explores the asymmetric catalysis and coordination chemistry of the resulting P&#8208;alkyne hybrid ligands with specific transition metals. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate the mechanistic intricacies of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Photoiniferter Polymerization for Dispersity Control in High Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of polymers with high molecular weights, controlled sequence and tunable dispersities remains a challenge. A simple and effective visible&#8208;light controlled photoiniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported here to realize this goal. Key to this strategy is the use of switchable RAFT agents (SRAs) to tune polymerization activities coupled with the inherent high livingness of photoiniferter RAFT polymerization. The polymerization activities of SRAs were in situ adjusted by addition of acid. In addition to switchable chain transfer coefficient, photolysis and polymerization kinetic studies revealed that neutral and protonated SRAs showed different photolysis and polymerization rates, which is unique to photoiniferter RAFT polymerization in dispersity control. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogenous radical source, temporal regulation by visible light, and tunable dispersities in the unprecedented high molecular weight regime (up to ~500 kg mol&#8208;1). Pentablock copolymers with three different dispersity combinations were also synthesized, highlighting that high livingness was maintained even for blocks with large dispersities. Tg was lowered for high&#8208;dispersity polymers of similar MWs due to the existence of more low&#8208;MW polymers. This strategy holds great potential in synthesis of advanced materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Thermal Quenching of Photoluminescence from an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid [MnBr4]2&#8208;&#8208;based Halide Mediated by Crystalline&#8211;Crystalline Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) behavior has been of primary importance for applications in information security. Excavating novel optical effects to create more possibilities for information encoding has become a continuous challenge. Herein, we present an unprecedented PL temporary quenching that highly couples with thermodynamic phase transition in a hybrid crystal (DMML)2MnBr4 (DMML = N,N&#8208;dimethylmorpholinium). Such unusual PL behavior originates from the anomalous variation of [MnBr4]2&#8208; tetrahedrons that leads to non&#8208;radiation recombination near the phase transition temperature of 340 K. Remarkably, suitable detectable temperature, narrow responsive window, high sensibility, and good cyclability of this PL temporary quenching will endow encryption applications with high concealment, operational flexibility, durability, and commercial popularization. Profited from these attributes, a fire&#8208;new optical encryption model is devised to demonstrate high confidential information security. This unprecedented optical effect would provide new insights and paradigms for the development of luminescent materials to enlighten future information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Guest Molecules inside Cation&#8208;Lidded Cucurbiturils Reveals that Hydration of Receptor Sites Can Impede Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Docking of alkali metal ions to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors generally reduces the affinity of guest molecules due to competitive binding. The idea that solvation water molecules could display a larger steric hindrance towards guest binding than cations has not been considered to date. We show that the docking of large cations to cucurbit[5]uril (CB5) unexpectedly increases (by a factor of 5&#8208;8) the binding of hydrophobic guests, methane and ethane. This is due to the removal of water molecules from the carbonyl portals of CB5 during cation binding, which frees up space for hydrophobe encapsulation. In contrast, smaller cations like sodium protrude deeply into the cavity of CB5 and cause the expected decrease in binding, such that the rational selection of alkali cations allows for a variation of up to a factor of 20 in binding of methane and ethane. The statistical analysis of crystallographic data shows that the cavity volume of CB5 can be enlarged by placing large alkali ions (Rb+ and Cs+) centro&#8208;symmetrically at the portals. The results reveal a hitherto elusive steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites, which is pertinent for the design of supramolecular catalysts and the understanding of biological receptors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated ketones have attracted significant attention as valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. Such compounds are generally accessed through trifluoromethylation of ketones. Here we report an alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis.

A wide variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aroyl fluorides bearing a diverse set of functional groups are eligible substrates. Notably, the developed methodology also provides rapid access to mono&#8208; or difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that merging photoredox catalysis with NHC catalysis is essential for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Type I Photosensitizer with Quenched Photosensitization Pre and Post Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as one of the most momentous strategies to ablate cancer cells. However, the phototoxicity of photosensitizers pre and post PDT, and the tumor hypoxia environment, are the two major problems that limit the application of PDT. In this paper, we report an activatable type&#8197;I photosensitizer TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3, which could respond to cycling normoxia&#8208;hypoxia and undergo redox cycles in a fully reversible manner.







Abstract
The phototoxicity of photosensitizers (PSs) pre and post photodynamic therapy (PDT), and the hypoxic tumor microenvironment are two major problems limiting the application of PDT. While activatable PSs can successfully address the PS phototoxicity pre PDT, and type&#8197;I PS can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) effectively in hypoxic environment, very limited approaches are available for addressing the phototoxicity post PDT. There is virtually no solution available to address all these issues using a single design. Herein, we propose a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept on&#8208;demand switchable photosensitizer with quenched photosensitization pre and post PDT, which could be activated only in tumor hypoxic environment. Particularly, a hypoxia&#8208;normoxia cycling responsive type&#8197;I PS TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3 was designed to demonstrate the concept, which was further formulated into TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3 nanoparticles (NPs) using DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;2000 as the encapsulation matrix. The NPs could be activated only in hypoxic tumors to generate type&#8197;I ROS during PDT treatment, but remain non&#8208;toxic in normal tissues, pre or after PDT, thus minimizing side effects and improving the therapeutic effect. With promising results in in vitro and in vivo tumor treatment, this presented strategy will pave the way for the design of more on&#8208;demand switchable photosensitizers with minimized side effects in the future.

         <title>Silver and Copper Nitride Cooperate for CO Electroreduction to Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need of carbon sources for the chemical industry, alternative to fossil sources, has pointed to CO2 as a possible feedstock. While CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) allows production of interesting organic compounds, it suffers from large carbon losses, mainly due to carbonate formation. This is why, quite recently, tandem CO2R, a two&#8208;step process, with first CO2R to CO using a solid oxide electrolysis cell followed by CO electroreduction (COR), has been considered, since no carbon is lost as carbonate in either step. Here we report a novel copper&#8208;based catalyst, silver&#8208;doped copper nitride, with record selectivity for formation of propanol (Faradic efficiency: 45%), an industrially relevant compound, from CO electroreduction in gas&#8208;fed flow cells. Selective propanol formation occurs at metallic copper atoms derived from copper nitride and is promoted by silver doping as shown experimentally and computationally. In addition, the selectivity for C2+ liquid products (Faradic efficiency: 80%) is among the highest reported so far. These findings open new perspectives regarding the design of catalysts for production of C3 compounds from CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Heterometallic Porphyrin Dimer as a Potential Quantum Gate: Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations and Spin Coherence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of two&#8208;qubit quantum gates, precise control over the intramolecular spin&#8208;spin interaction between molecular spin units plays a pivotal role. A weak but measurable exchange coupling is especially important for achieving selective spin addressability that allows controlled manipulation of the computational basis states &#448;00&#10217; &#448;01&#10217; &#448;10&#10217; &#448;11&#10217; by microwave pulses. Here, we report the synthesis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study of a heterometallic meso&#8208;meso (m&#8208;m) singly&#8208;linked VIVO&#8211;CuII porphyrin dimer. X&#8208;band continuous wave EPR measurements in frozen solutions suggest a ferromagnetic exchange coupling of ca. 8 &#8729; 10&#8722;3 cm&#8722;1. This estimation is supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, which also allow disentangling the ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange. Pulsed EPR experiments show that the dimer maintains relaxation times similar to the monometallic CuII porphyrins. The addressability of the two individual spins is made possible by the different g&#8208;tensors of VIV and CuII&#8208;ions, in contrast to homometallic dimers where tilting of the porphyrin planes plays a key role. Therefore, single&#8208;spin addressability in the heterometallic dimer can be maintained even with small tilting angles, as expected when deposited on surface, unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum gates for practical applications.</dc:description>

Therefore, single-spin addressability in the heterometallic dimer can be maintained even with small tilting angles, as expected when deposited on surface, unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum gates for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analogous to electronic transistors, transistor&#8208;like responsive materials undergo sharp structural transitions in response to a very narrow range of microenvironment signals. This kind of material is typically limited in synthetic polymer&#8208;derived nanoscale assembly or disassembly and has profound implications for modern high&#8208;tech applications. Herein, we evolve this system from synthetic polymers to biopolymers and extend the corresponding assembly scale from nanoscale to meso/macro&#8208;scale. We develop unique protein nanocrystals with core&#8208;shell structures through a two&#8208;step nucleation process. The protein nanocrystals exhibit exceptional transistor&#8208;like pH&#8208;responsive mesoscale assembly through formation of inter&#8208;particle &#946;&#8208;sheet linkers. This allows ultrasensitive cross&#8208;linking behavior, such as self&#8208;coacervation at water/water interface, ultrafast gelation in seconds, and ultrasensitive swelling for detection of basic vapors at extremely low concentration. This breakthrough has great promise for broader applications such as drug encapsulation and delivery, biosensing, cytomimetic materials, and microfluidic chemistry</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Extending the &#960;&#8208;skeletons of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) organoboron emitters can feasibly modulate their optoelectronic properties. Here, we first adopt the indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole (32bID) segment as a multi&#8208;nitrogen bridge and develop a high&#8208;efficiency &#960;&#8208;extended narrowband green emitter. This moiety establishes not only a high&#8208;yield one&#8208;shot multiple Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction towards a &#960;&#8208;extended MR skeleton, but a compact N&#8208;ethylene&#8208;N motif for a red&#8208;shifted narrowband emission. An emission peak at 524 nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96% are concurrently obtained in dilute toluene. The extended molecular plane also results in a large horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 87%. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6% and a maximum power efficiency of 135.2 lm/W are thereafter recorded for the corresponding device, also allowing a low efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQEs of 34.5% and 28.1% at luminance of 1,000 cd/m2 and 10,000 cd/m2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e WOR) is gaining surging research traction for sustainable hydrogen peroxide production. However, the strong oxidizing environment and thermodynamically competitive side&#8208;reaction (4e WOR) posit as thresholds for the 2e WOR. We herein report a custom&#8208;crafted covalent triazine network possessing strong oxidizing properties as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept metal&#8208;free functional organic network electrocatalyst for catalyzing 2e WOR. As the first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind, the material shows a maximum of 89.9% Faradaic Efficiency and 1428 &#956;mol/h/cm2 H2O2 production rate at 3.0 V bias potential (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which are either better or comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. We have experimentally confirmed a stepwise 2e WOR mechanism which was further computationally endorsed by density functional theory studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating the Solvating Power of Solvents with the Strength of Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction in Electrolytes of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solvation structure of Li+ plays a significant role in determining the physicochemical properties of electrolytes. However, to date, there is still no clear definition of the solvating power of different electrolyte solvents, and even the solvents that preferentially participate in the solvation structure remain controversial. In this study, we comprehensively discuss the solvating power and solvation process of Li+ ions using both experimental characterizations and computational calculations. Our findings reveal that the solvating power is dependent on the strength of the Li+&#8208;solvent (ion&#8208;dipole) interaction. Additionally, we uncover that anions tend to enter the solvation sheath in most electrolyte systems through Li+&#8208;anion (ion&#8208;ion) interaction, which is weakened by the shielding effect of solvents. The competition between the Li+&#8208;solvent and Li+&#8208;anion interactions ultimately determines the final solvation structures. This insight into the fundamental understanding of the solvation structure of Li+ ions provides inspiration for the design of multifunctional mixed&#8208;solvent electrolytes for advanced batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Na/Cl2 Batteries Through Bicontinuous Electron and Ion Transport&#160;by Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Bicontinuous&#8208;Structured Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable sodium/chlorine (Na/Cl2) batteries are emerging candidates for sustainable energy storage owing to their superior energy densities and the high abundance of Na and Cl elements. However, their practical applications have been plagued by the poor rate performance (e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 150 mA/g), as the widely used carbon nanosphere cathodes show both sluggish electron&#8208;ion transport and reaction kinetics. Here, by mimicking the sufficient mass and energy transport in a sponge, we report a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which allows efficient Na&#8208;ion&#160;and electron transport and promotes Cl2 adsorption and conversion, thus unlocking ultrahigh&#8208;rate Na/Cl2 batteries, e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 16,000 mA/g&#160;that is more than two orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. The optimized solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas (carbon&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;Cl2) triple interfaces further contribute to a maximum reversible capacity and cycle life of 2,000 mAh/g&#160;and 250 cycles, respectively. Our study establishes a universal approach for improving the sluggish kinetics of conversion&#8208;type battery reactions, and provides a new paradigm to resolve the long&#8208;standing dilemma between high energy and power densities in energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo: a Scaffold for Efficient All&#8208;Red&#8208;Light and Near&#8208;Infrared Molecular Photoswitching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular photoswitching with red light is greatly desired to evade photodamage and achieve specific photoresponses. In virtually all cases however, only one switching direction uses red light while for the reverse switching UV or visible light is needed. All&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching brings with it the obvious advantage of pushing photoswitching to the limit of the low&#8208;energy spectrum but no viable system is available currently. Here we report on&#160;peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) as molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with outstanding performance and property profile. The PAT photoswitch provides near infrared (NIR) absorption up to 850 nm, large negative photochromism with more than 140 nm maxima shifts and changes color from green to blue upon irradiation with two shades of red light. Thermal stability of the metastable&#160;Z&#160;isomer is high with a corresponding half&#8208;life of days at 20 &#176;C. Application for red&#8208;light responsive polymers undergoing pronounced and reversible green to blue color changes demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching. The PAT photoswitch thus offers unique responsiveness to very low energy light together with predictable and large geometrical changes within a rigid molecular scaffold. We expect a plethora of applications for PAT in the near future, e.g. in materials, molecular machines or biological context.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Phomactin Platelet Activating Factor Antagonist&#160;Requires a Two&#8208;Enzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phomactin diterpenoids possess a unique bicyclo[9.3.1]&#8208;pentadecane skeleton with multiple oxidative modifications, and are good platelet&#8208;activating factor (PAF) antagonists that can inhibit PAF&#8208;induced platelet aggregation. In this study, we identified the gene cluster (phm) responsible for the biosynthesis of phomactins from a&#160;marine fungus,&#160;Phoma sp. ATCC 74077. Despite the complexity of their structures, phomactin biosynthesis only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA was found to catalyze the formation of the phomactatriene, while PhmC sequentially catalyzes the oxidation of multiple sites, leading to the generation of structurally diverse phomactins. The rearrangement mechanism of the diterpene scaffold was investigated through isotope labeling experiments. Additionally, we obtained the crystal complex of PhmA with its substrate&#8208;analogue FGGPP and elucidated the novel metal ion binding mode and enzymatic mechanism of PhmA through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. This work provides the first insights into the biosynthesis of phomactins, laying the foundation for the efficient production of phomactin natural products using synthetic biology approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Decorated DNA&#8208;Based Scaffolds as Lateral Flow Biosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we develop Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) that employ as functional elements DNA&#8208;based structures decorated with reporter tags and recognition elements. We have rationally re&#8208;engineered tile&#8208;based DNA tubular structures that can act as scaffolds and can be decorated with recognition elements of different nature (i.e. antigens, aptamers or proteins) and with orthogonal fluorescent dyes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle we have developed sandwich and competitive multiplex lateral flow platforms for the detection of several targets, ranging from small molecules (digoxigenin, Dig and dinitrophenol, DNP), to antibodies (Anti&#8208;Dig, Anti&#8208;DNP and Anti&#8208;MUC1/EGFR bispecific antibodies) and proteins (thrombin). Coupling the advantages of functional DNA&#8208;based scaffolds together with the simplicity of LFAs, our approach offers the opportunity to detect a wide range of targets with nanomolar sensitivity and high specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Hybridization of Complementary Aromatic Oligoamide Strands in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared a series of water&#8208;soluble aromatic oligoamide sequences all composed of a segment prone to form a single helix and a segment prone to dimerize into a double helix. These sequences exclusively assemble as antiparallel duplexes. The modification of the duplex inner rim by varying the nature of the substituents borne by the aromatic monomers allowed us to identify sequences that can hybridize by combining two chemically different strands, with high affinity and complete selectivity in water. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the expected antiparallel configuration of the duplexes whereas NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry allowed us to assess precisely the extent of the hybridization. The hybridization kinetics of the aromatic strands was shown to depend on both the nature of the substituents responsible for strand complementarity and the length of the aromatic strand. These results highlight the great potential of aromatic hetero&#8208;duplexes as a tool to construct non&#8208;symmetrical dynamic supramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Quinoline and Isoquinoline Reduction by Energy Transfer Catalysis Enabled Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(Hetero)arene reduction is one of the key avenues for synthesizing related cyclic alkenes and alkanes. While catalytic hydrogenation and Birch reduction are the two broadly utilized approaches for (hetero)arene reduction across academia and industry over the last century, both methods have encountered significant chemoselectivity challenges. We hereby introduce a highly chemoselective quinoline and isoquinoline reduction protocol operating through selective energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, which enables subsequent hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The design of this protocol intelligently bypasses the conventional metric of reduction reaction, i.e., the reductive potential, but instead, relies on chemical moieties&#8217; triplet energies and kinetic barriers of energy and hydrogen atom transfer events. Many reducing labile functional groups which were incompatible with previous (hetero)arene reductions, are retained in this work. We anticipate this protocol to trigger further advancement of chemoselective arene reductions and enable the current arene&#8208;rich drug space escaping from flatland.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Coupling Promoting Directional Photosynthesis of Nitrate from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis, particularly plasmon&#8208;mediated photocatalysis, offers a green and sustainable approach for direct nitrogen oxidation into nitrate under ambient conditions. However, the unsatisfactory photocatalytic efficiency caused by the limited localized electromagnetic field enhancement and short hot carrier lifetime of traditional plasmonic catalysts is a stumbling block to the large&#8208;scale application of plasmon photocatalytic technology. Herein, we design and demonstrate the dual&#8208;plasmonic heterojunction (Bi/CsxWO3) achieves efficient and selective photocatalytic N2 oxidation. The yield of NO3&#8208; over Bi/CsxWO3 (694.32 &#956;g g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) are 2.4 times that over CsxWO3 (292.12 &#956;g g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation. The surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect generates a surge of localized electromagnetic field intensity to boost the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers. Ultimately, electrons participate in the formation of &#8226;O2&#8208;, while holes involve in the generation of &#8226;OH and the activation of N2. The synergistic effect of multiple reactive oxygen species drives the direct photosynthesis of NO3&#8208;, which achieves the overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes in photocatalytic reaction. The concept that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited carriers will pave a new way for the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic catalysis with high efficiency allows them a great prospect in metabolite monitoring in living cells. However, complex tumor microenvironments, such as acidity, H2O2, and hypoxia, are bound to disturb catalytic reactions for misleading results. Here, we report a spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle to correct intratumoral glucose analysis, where the zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 immobilized glucose oxidase&#8208;horseradish peroxidase cascade core and catalase&#8208;directed shell act as signal transduction and guarding rooms respectively. The acid&#8208;digested core and stable shell provide appropriate spaces to boost biocatalytic efficiency with good tolerability. Notably, the endogenous H2O2 is in situ decomposed to O2 by catalase, which not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic states to maximize glucose oxidation. The marked protective effect and biocompatibility render artificial organelles to correct the signal transduction for dynamic monitoring glucose in vitro and in vivo, achieving our goal of accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;assembly of Copolymer&#8208;Capped Nanoparticles into Colloidal Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal molecules (CMs) are precisely defined assemblies of nanoparticles (NPs) that mimic the structure of real molecules, but externally programming the precise self&#8208;assembly of CMs is still challenging. In this work, we show that the photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of complementary copolymer&#8208;capped binary NPs can be precisely controlled to form clustered ABx or linear (AB)y CMs at high yield (x is the coordination number of NP&#8208;Bs, and y is the repeating unit number of AB clusters). Under UV light irradiation, photolabile p&#8208;methoxyphenacyl groups of copolymers on NP&#8208;A*s are converted to carboxyl groups (NP&#8208;A), which react with tertiary amines of copolymers on NP&#8208;B to trigger the directional NP bonding. The x value of ABx can be precisely controlled between 1 and 3 by varying the irradiation duration and hence the amount of carboxyl groups generated on NP&#8208;As. Moreover, when NP&#8208;A* and NP&#8208;B are irradiated after mixing, the assembly process generates AB clusters or linear (AB)y structures with alternating sequence of the binary NPs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Colloidal molecules (CMs) are precisely defined assemblies of nanoparticles (NPs) that mimic the structure of real molecules, but externally programming the precise self-assembly of CMs is still challenging. In this work, we show that the photo-induced self-assembly of complementary copolymer-capped binary NPs can be precisely controlled to form clustered ABx or linear (AB)y CMs at high yield (x is the coordination number of NP-Bs, and y is the repeating unit number of AB clusters). Under UV light irradiation, photolabile p-methoxyphenacyl groups of copolymers on NP-A*s are converted to carboxyl groups (NP-A), which react with tertiary amines of copolymers on NP-B to trigger the directional NP bonding. The x value of ABx can be precisely controlled between 1 and 3 by varying the irradiation duration and hence the amount of carboxyl groups generated on NP-As. Moreover, when NP-A* and NP-B are irradiated after mixing, the assembly process generates AB clusters or linear (AB)y structures with alternating sequence of the binary NPs. This assembly approach offers a simple yet non-invasive way to externally regulate the formation of various CMs on demand without the need of redesigning the surface chemistry of NPs for use in drug delivery, diagnostics, optoelectronics, and plasmonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Nitrogen Cluster Providing a Local Proton for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise Cu clusters are highly desirable as catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and they provide an appropriate model platform for elaborating their structure&#8211;activity relationship. However, an efficient overall photocatalytic CO2RR with H2O using assembled Cu&#8208;cluster aggregates as single component photocatalyst has not been reported. Herein, we report a stable crystalline Cu&#8211;S&#8211;N cluster photocatalyst with local protonated N&#8211;H groups (denoted as Cu6&#8211;NH). The catalyst exhibits suitable photocatalytic redox potentials, high structural stability, active catalytic species, and a narrow bandgap, which account for its outstanding photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light, with ~100% selectivity for CO evolution. Remarkably, systematic isostructural Cu&#8208;cluster control experiments, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed that the protonated pyrimidine N atoms in the Cu6&#8211;NH cluster act as a proton relay station, providing a local proton during the photocatalytic CO2RR. This efficiently lowers the energy barrier for the formation of the *COOH intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step, efficiently enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work lays the foundation for the development of atomically precise metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extensive study on renewable energy storage has been sparked by the growing worries regarding global warming. In this study, incorporating the latest advancements in microbial electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction, a super&#8208;fast charging biohybrid battery was introduced by using pure formic acid as an energy carrier. CO2 electrolyser with a slim&#8208;catholyte layer and a solid electrolyte layer was built, which made it possible to use affordable anion exchange membranes and electrocatalysts that are readily accessible. The biohybrid battery only required a 3&#8208;minute charging to accomplish an astounding 25&#8208;hour discharging phase. In the power&#8208;to&#8208;formate&#8208;to&#8208;bioelectricity process, bioconversion played a vital role in restricting both the overall Faradaic efficiency and Energy efficiency.The CO2 electrolyser was able to operate continuously for an impressive total duration of 164 hours under Gas Stand&#8208;By model, by storing N2 gas in the extraction chamber during stand&#8208;by periods. Additionally, the electric signal generated during the discharging phase was utilized for monitoring water biotoxicity. Functional genes related to formate metabolism were identified in the bioanode and electrochemically active bacteria were discovered. On the other hand, Paracoccus was predominantly found in the used air cathode. These results advance our current knowledge of exploiting biohybrid technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Membraneless Droplets for Synaptic&#8208;Like Clustering of Lipid Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new aqueous droplet as mimic of membraneless organelles (MLOs), which we call segregative&#8208;associative (SA) droplets, apart from the widely known complex coacervates and neutral polymer&#8208;based aqueous two&#8208;phase systems. The SA droplet exhibits MLO&#8208;mimicking complex phase behaviors and can cluster charged lipid vesicles like MLOs at synapse, which has been hitherto unachievable for most current MLO&#8208;mimics.







Abstract
In eukaryotic cells, the membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) are found to interact intimately with membranous organelles (MOs). One major mode is the clustering of MOs by MLOs, such as the formation of clusters of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals mediated by the synapsin&#8208;rich MLOs. Aqueous droplets, including complex coacervates and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems, have been plausible MLO&#8208;mimics to emulate or elucidate biological processes. However, neither of them can cluster lipid vesicles (LVs) like MLOs. In this work, we develop a synthetic droplet assembled from a combination of two different interactions underlying the formation of these two droplets, namely, associative and segregative interactions, which we call segregative&#8208;associative (SA) droplets. The SA droplets cluster and disperse LVs recapitulating the key functional features of synapsin condensates, which can be attributed to the weak electrostatic interaction environment provided by SA droplets. This work suggests LLPS with combined segregative and associative interactions as a possible route for synaptic clustering of lipid vesicles and highlights SA droplets as plausible MLO&#8208;mimics and models for studying and mimicking related cellular dynamics.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8722;N Vinylindole Atropisomers by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylation of 1&#8208;Alkynylindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective hydroarylation of 1&#8208;alkynylindoles with organoborons for the synthesis of chiral C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. A wide variety of vinylindole atropisomers were synthesized in excellent regioselectivity, stereoselectivity (Z&#8208;selectivity), and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Moreover, the enantioselective hydroarylation of alkynes using organoboron reagents has not been reported. Herein, we report for the first time that palladium compounds can catalyze the hydroarylation of 1&#8208;alkynylindoles with organoborons for the synthesis of chiral C&#8722;N atropisomers. A series of rarely reported vinylindole atropisomers was synthesized with excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; (Z&#8208;selectivity), and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The ready availability of organoborons and alkynes and the simplicity, high stereoselectivity, and good functional group tolerance of this catalytic system make it highly attractive.

         <title>Direct Assembly of Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;phenolic network nanoparticles (MPN NPs) with different compositions are directly assembled, without templates or seeding agents, by controlling the coordination kinetics of metal&#8208;phenolic complexes. The strong binding affinity of polyphenols to various guest molecules enables the incorporation of functional cargos (e.g., proteins and drugs) to form cargo&#8208;loaded MPN NPs for potential biomedical applications.







Abstract
Coordination assembly offers a versatile means to developing advanced materials for various applications. However, current strategies for assembling metal&#8208;organic networks into nanoparticles (NPs) often face challenges such as the use of toxic organic solvents, cytotoxicity because of synthetic organic ligands, and complex synthesis procedures. Herein, we directly assemble metal&#8208;organic networks into NPs using metal ions and polyphenols (i.e., metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs)) in aqueous solutions without templating or seeding agents. We demonstrate the role of buffers (e.g., phosphate buffer) in governing NP formation and the engineering of the NP physicochemical properties (e.g., tunable sizes from 50 to 270&#8197;nm) by altering the assembly conditions. A library of MPN NPs is prepared using natural polyphenols and various metal ions. Diverse functional cargos, including anticancer drugs and proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points, are readily loaded within the NPs for various applications (e.g., biocatalysis, therapeutic delivery) by direct mixing, without surface modification, owing to the strong affinity of polyphenols to various guest molecules. This study provides insights into the assembly mechanism of metal&#8208;organic complexes into NPs and offers a simple strategy to engineer nanosized materials with desired properties for diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>Functional Polythioamides Derived from Thiocarbonyl Fluoride
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polythioamides have been successfully synthesized using diboronic acids, secondary diamines, and thiocarbonyl fluoride as the central connective hub. These polythioamides exhibit inherent selectivity in coordinating metal ions, resulting in the formation of PdII&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;chain nanoparticles that can serve as recyclable homogeneous catalysts. This study highlights the potential of thiocarbonyl fluoride as a powerful hub for addressing the challenging synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polythioamide is a unique type of sulfur&#8208;containing polymer with advanced functionalities. Nonetheless, the elemental sulfur commonly used in their synthesis tends to react readily with unsaturated functional groups, thereby limiting the scope of eligible substrates. Inspired by the highly efficient sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) polymerization through discrete hubs, we present herein a pioneering and versatile approach to the synthesis of polythioamides from diboronic acids, secondary diamines, and thiocarbonyl fluoride as the central connective hub. Well&#8208;defined structures, including previously inaccessible unsaturated substrates, were realized. These newly devised polythioamides can efficiently and selectively bind to metal ions and were applied in precious&#8208;metal recovery. Further development resulted in PdII&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;chain nanoparticles serving as recyclable homogeneous catalysts, thus demonstrating the vast potential of these unprecedented polythioamides. We anticipate that thiocarbonyl fluoride could emerge as a potent hub for facilitating the intricate synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers.

         <title>Engineering Nucleotidoproteins for Base&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Assisted Cytosolic Delivery and Genome Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleotidoprotein engineered via facile &#8220;green synthesis&#8221; exhibits strong electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding with complementary base&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine to form salt&#8208;resistant nanocomplexes with robust cytosolic delivery efficiency. The acidic endolysosomal environment enables traceless restoration of the nucleotidoprotein and consequently promotes the intracellular release of native protein.







Abstract
Protein therapeutics targeting intracellular machineries hold profound potential for disease treatment, and hence robust cytosolic protein delivery technologies are imperatively demanded. Inspired by the super&#8208;negatively charged, nucleotide&#8208;enriched structure of nucleic acids, adenylated pro&#8208;proteins (A&#8208;proteins) with dramatically enhanced negative surface charges have been engineered for the first time via facile green synthesis. Then, thymidine&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine is developed, which exhibits strong electrostatic attraction, complementary base pairing, and hydrophobic interaction with A&#8208;proteins to form salt&#8208;resistant nanocomplexes with robust cytosolic delivery efficiencies. The acidic endolysosomal environment enables traceless restoration of the A&#8208;proteins and consequently promotes the intracellular release of the native proteins. This strategy shows high efficiency and universality for a variety of proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points in mammalian cells. Moreover, it enables highly efficient delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins targeting fusion oncogene EWSR1&#8208;FLI1, leading to pronounced anti&#8208;tumor efficacy against Ewing sarcoma. This study provides a potent and versatile platform for cytosolic protein delivery and gene editing, and may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Fluorine Groups in Passivating Defects for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In passivating perovskite defects it is shown that the F group can interact with the passivation groups of the additives, leading to different abilities to passivate defects rather than only introducing additional interactions between F and Pb2+ as previously thought. The efficiencies of perovskite solar cells and modules made with the fluorinated passivators reach 24.70&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.13&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2), respectively, with long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Introducing fluorine (F) groups into a passivator plays an important role in enhancing the defect passivation effect for the perovskite film, which is usually attributed to the direct interaction of F and defect states. However, the interaction between electronegative F and electron&#8208;rich passivation groups in the same molecule, which may influence the passivation effect, is ignored. We herein report that such interactions can vary the electron cloud distribution around the passivation groups and thus changing their coordination with defect sites. By comparing two fluorinated molecules, heptafluorobutylamine (HFBM) and heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), we find that the F/&#8722;NH2 interaction in HFBM is stronger than the F/&#8722;COOH one in HFBA, inducing weaker passivation ability of HFBM than HFBA. Accordingly, HFBA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) provide an efficiency of 24.70&#8201;% with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the efficiency of a large&#8208;area perovskite module (14.0&#8197;cm2) based on HFBA reaches 21.13&#8201;%. Our work offers an insight into understanding an unaware role of the F group in impacting the passivation effect for the perovskite film.

         <title>Forcing Twisted 1,7&#8208;Dibromoperylene Diimides to Flatten in the Solid State: What a Difference an Atom Makes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of CH2 or NH spacers of low stereochemical hindrance on the imide function of heavily twisted 1,7&#8208;dibromoperylene diimides (PDIs), enables, in the solid state, the unexpected flattening of the polyaromatic cores. Powder diffraction and DFT calculations provided reliable structural and energetic details and an estimate of stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of flat PDI cores, counterbalancing the natural tendency toward twisting.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDI) are workhorses in the field of organic electronics, owing to their appealing n&#8208;semiconducting properties. Optimization of their performances is widely pursued by bay&#8208;atom substitution and diverse imide functionalization. Bulk solids and thin&#8208;films of these species crystallize in a variety of stacking configurations, depending on the geometry of the stable conformation of the polyaromatic core. We here demonstrate that 1,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;substituted perylene diimides, PDI(H2Br2), possessing a heavily twisted conformation in the gas phase, in solution and in the solids, can be easily flattened in the solid state into centrosymmetric molecules if the polyaromatic cores form &#960;&#8211;&#960; stabilized chains. This is achieved by using axial residues with low stereochemical hindrance, as guaranteed by a single CH2/NH spacer directly linked to the imide function. Structural powder diffraction and DFT calculations on four newly designed species of the PDI(H2Br2) class coherently show that, thanks to the flexibility of the N&#8722;X&#8722;Ar link (X=CH2/NH), flat cores are indeed obtained by overcoming the interconversion barrier between twisted atropoisomers, of only 26.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This strategy may then be useful to induce &#8220;anomalously flat&#8221; polyaromatic cores of different kinds (substituted acenes/rylenes) in the solid state, towards suitable crystal packing and orbital interactions for improved electronic performances.

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclization in Eunicellane Derived Diterpenoid Biosynthesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three highly oxidized eunicellane&#8208;derived 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8722;C, were discovered through genome mining. In vivo and in vitro investigations and quantum chemical computations systematically established that terpene cyclase (TC) and P450 enzymes work in tandem to create the backbone of aridacins, representing an unprecedented strategy in terpene skeletal construction.







Abstract
Terpene cyclization, one of the most complex chemical reactions in nature, is generally catalyzed by two classes of terpene cyclases (TCs). Cytochrome P450s that act as unexpected TC&#8208;like enzymes are known but are very rare. In this study, we genome&#8208;mined a cryptic bacterial terpenoid gene cluster, named ari, from the thermophilic actinomycete strain Amycolatopsis arida. By employing a heterologous production system, we isolated and characterized three highly oxidized eunicellane derived diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8722;C (1&#8211;3), that possess a 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold. In vivo and in vitro experiments systematically established a noncanonical two&#8208;step biosynthetic pathway for diterpene skeleton formation. First, a class I TC (AriE) cyclizes geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into a 6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic cis&#8208;eunicellane skeleton. Next, a cytochrome P450 (AriF) catalyzes cyclization of the eunicellane skeleton into the 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold through C2&#8722;C6 bond formation. Based on the results of quantum chemical computations, hydrogen abstraction followed by electron transfer coupled to barrierless carbocation ring closure is shown to be a viable mechanism for AriF&#8208;mediated cyclization. The biosynthetic logic of skeleton construction in the aridacins is unprecedented, expanding the catalytic capacity and diversity of P450s and setting the stage to investigate the inherent principles of carbocation generation by P450s in the biosynthesis of terpenoids.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terpene cyclization, one of the most complex chemical reactions in nature, is generally catalyzed by two classes of terpene cyclases (TCs). Cytochrome P450s that act as unexpected TC-like enzymes are known but are very rare. In this study, we genome-mined a cryptic bacterial terpenoid gene cluster, named &lt;i&gt;ari&lt;/i&gt;, from the thermophilic actinomycete strain &lt;i&gt;Amycolatopsis arida&lt;/i&gt;. By employing a heterologous production system, we isolated and characterized three highly oxidized eunicellane derived diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8722;C (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), that possess a 6/7/5-fused tricyclic scaffold. In vivo and in vitro experiments systematically established a noncanonical two-step biosynthetic pathway for diterpene skeleton formation. First, a class I TC (AriE) cyclizes geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into a 6/10-fused bicyclic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-eunicellane skeleton. Next, a cytochrome P450 (AriF) catalyzes cyclization of the eunicellane skeleton into the 6/7/5-fused tricyclic scaffold through C2&#8722;C6 bond formation. Based on the results of quantum chemical computations, hydrogen abstraction followed by electron transfer coupled to barrierless carbocation ring closure is shown to be a viable mechanism for AriF-mediated cyclization. The biosynthetic logic of skeleton construction in the aridacins is unprecedented, expanding the catalytic capacity and diversity of P450s and setting the stage to investigate the inherent principles of carbocation generation by P450s in the biosynthesis of terpenoids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Nitrite (NO2&#8208;) and nitric oxide (NO) interconversion is crucial for maintaining optimum NO flux in mammalian physiology. This report herein demonstrates that [L2CuII(nitrite)]+&#160;moieties (in&#160;2a&#160;and&#160;2b; where,&#160;L&#160;=&#160;Me2PzPy&#160;and&#160;Me2PzQu) with distorted octahedral geometry undergo facile reductions to provide tetrahedral [L2CuI]+&#160;(in&#160;3a&#160;and&#160;3b) and NO in the presence of biologically relevant reductants such as 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (4&#8208;MeO&#8208;2,6&#8208;DTBP, a tyrosine model) and&#160;N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide&#160;(BNAH, a NAD(P)H model). Interestingly, a reaction of excess NO gas with [L2CuII(MeCN)2]2+&#160;(in&#160;1a)&#160;provides a putative {CuNO}10&#160;species, which is effective in mediating nitrosation of various nucleophiles such as thiol and amine. Generation of the transient {CuNO}10&#160;species&#160;in wet acetonitrile leads to&#160;NO2&#8208;&#160;as assessed by Griess assay and&#160;14N/15N&#8208;FTIR analyses. A detailed study reveals that the bidirectional NOx&#8208;reactivity, namely nitrite reductase (NIR) and NO&#160;oxidase (NOO), at a common CuII&#160;site, is governed by the geometric preference driven facile CuII/CuI&#160;redox process. Of broader interest, this study not only highlights the potential strategies to design copper&#8208;based catalysts for nitrite reduction, but also strengthens the previous postulates regarding the involvement of red copper proteins in denitrification.</dc:description>

         <title>Conception and Evaluation of a Library of Cleavable Mass Tags for Digital Polymers Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimal set of phosphoramidite monomers was synthesized herein for facilitating the mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing of digital poly(phosphodiester)s. These molecules contain a cleavable alkoxyamine group and various side&#8208;chain substituents with a distinct mass signature. When incorporated periodically in the polymers, these new molecules enable a controlled MS fragmentation and an easy identification of the resulting fragments.







Abstract
A library of phosphoramidite monomers containing a main&#8208;chain cleavable alkoxyamine and a side&#8208;chain substituent of variable molar mass (i.e. mass tag) was prepared in this work. These monomers can be used in automated solid&#8208;phase phosphoramidite chemistry and therefore incorporated periodically as spacers inside digitally&#8208;encoded poly(phosphodiester) chains. Consequently, the formed polymers contain tagged cleavable sites that guide their fragmentation in mass spectrometry sequencing and enhance their digital readability. The spacers were all prepared via a seven steps synthetic procedure. They were afterwards tested for the synthesis and sequencing of model digital polymers. Uniform digitally&#8208;encoded polymers were obtained as major species in all cases, even though some minor defects were sometimes detected. Furthermore, the polymers were decoded in pseudo&#8208;MS3 conditions, thus confirming the reliability and versatility of the spacers library.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of In&#8208;Situ Hybrid Interface Construction and pH Buffering Enabled Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Anode at High Current Density and Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation concept is developed by introducing taurine into electrolyte. In addition to buffering the pH of the electrolyte, the preferentially adsorbed taurine on the Zn surface reconstructs the electronic double layer (EDL) and subsequently builds an in situ hybrid interface to inhibit side reactions and regulate Zn deposition. This synergistic modulation strategy greatly enhances the performance of Zn anode and full batteries.







Abstract
In aqueous electrolytes, the uncontrollable interfacial evolution caused by a series of factors such as pH variation and unregulated Zn2+ diffusion would usually result in the rapid failure of metallic Zn anode. Considering the high correlation among various triggers that induce the anode deterioration, a synergistic modulation strategy based on electrolyte modification is developed. Benefitting from the unique pH buffer mechanism of the electrolyte additive and its capability to in situ construct a zincophilic solid interface, this synergistic effect can comprehensively manage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Zn anode by inhibiting the pH variation and parasitic side reactions, accelerating de&#8208;solvation of hydrated Zn2+, and regulating the diffusion behavior of Zn2+ to realize uniform Zn deposition. Thus, the modified Zn anode can achieve an impressive lifespan at ultra&#8208;high current density and areal capacity, operating stably for 609 and 209&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Based on this exceptional performance, high loading Zn||NH4V4O10 batteries can achieve excellent cycle stability and rate performance. Compared with those previously reported single pH buffer strategies, the synergistic modulation concept is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Directing the Selectivity of CO Electrolysis to Acetate by Constructing Metal&#8208;Organic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;organic interface constructed by in situ reconstruction of Cu phthalocyanine can direct the selectivity of CO electrolysis to a specific multicarbon product, with an acetate Faradaic efficiency (FE) as high as 84.2&#8201;%, a record acetate partial current density of 605&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and an acetate yield up to 63.4&#8201;%. The impressive acetate selectivity is ascribed to the favorable reaction microenvironment created by the Cu&#8208;organic interface.







Abstract
Electrochemically converting CO2 to valuable chemicals holds great promise for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Owing to complex reaction pathways and shared rate&#8208;determining steps, directing the selectivity of CO2/CO electrolysis to a specific multicarbon product is very challenging. We report here a strategy for highly selective production of acetate from CO electrolysis by constructing metal&#8208;organic interfaces. We demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;organic interfaces constructed by in situ reconstruction of Cu complexes show very impressive acetate selectivity, with a high Faradaic efficiency of 84.2&#8201;% and a carbon selectivity of 92.1&#8201;% for acetate production, in an alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The maximum acetate partial current density and acetate yield reach as high as 605&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 63.4&#8201;%, respectively. Thorough structural characterizations, control experiments, operando Raman spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculation results indicate that the Cu&#8208;organic interface creates a favorable reaction microenvironment that enhances *CO adsorption, lowers the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling, and facilitates the formation of CH3COOH over other multicarbon products, thus rationalizing the selective acetate production.

Delayed fluorescence usually showed much shorter lifetime than phosphorescence in organic afterglow. An effective strategy is presented in this work to prolong the lifetime of delayed fluorescence to approach that of phosphorescence, which enables great color tunability of organic afterglow from yellow to white by changing the temperature.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;mode emission materials, combining phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, offer promising opportunities for white&#8208;light afterglow. However, the delayed fluorescence lifetime is usually significantly shorter than that of phosphorescence, limiting the duration of white&#8208;light emission. In this study, a carbazole&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system that can be activated by both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light is reported to achieve balanced phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, resulting in a long&#8208;lived white&#8208;light afterglow. Our study demonstrated the critical role of a charge transfer state in the afterglow mechanism, where the charge separation and recombination process directly determined the lifetime of afterglow. Simultaneously, an efficient reversed intersystem crossing process was obtained between the singlet and triplet charge transfer states, which facilitating the delayed fluorescence properties of host&#8211;guest system. As a result, delayed fluorescence lifetime was successfully prolonged to approach that of phosphorescence. This work presents a delayed fluorescence lifetime improvement strategy via doping method to realize durable white&#8208;light afterglow.

         <title>Decorating Channel Walls in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Crown Ethers for Efficient and Selective Separation of Radioactive Strontium(II)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOF adsorbent is fabricated for the removal of radioactive strontium(II) from nuclear wastewater. Benefiting from the synergy of the 1D channels for efficient transportation of Sr2+ ions and the decorating of the functional sites on the channel walls to aviod the blocking of the channels, the MOF adsorbent realizes highly efficient and ultrafast separation of strontium(II).







Abstract
Nuclear accidents and the improper disposal of nuclear wastes have led to serious environmental radioactive pollutions. The rational design of adsorbents for the highly efficient separation of strontium(II) is essential in treating nuclear waste and recovering radioactive strontium resources. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential materials for the separation of aqueous metal ions owing to their designable structure and tunable functionality. Herein, a novel 3D MOF material MOF&#8208;18Cr6, in which 1D channels are formed using 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether&#8208;containing ligands as channel walls, is fabricated for strontium(II) separation. In contrast to traditional MOFs designed by grafting functional groups in the framework pores, MOF&#8208;18Cr6 possesses regular 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether cavities on the channel walls, which not only can transport and intake strontium(II) via the channels, but also prevent blockage of the channels after the binding of strontium(II). Consequently, the functional sites are fully utilized to achieve a high strontium(II) removal rate of 99.73&#8201;% in simulated nuclear wastewater. This study fabricates a highly promising adsorbent for the separation of aqueous radioactive strontium(II), and more importantly, can provide a new strategy for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF adsorbents for separating target substances from complex aqueous environments.

         <title>Hydrogen Transport and Evolution in Ni&#8208;MH Batteries by Neutron Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;destructive and high&#8208;resolution methods allowing the investigation of battery systems are provided by operando neutron imaging combined with electrical monitoring of the state of charge. We track the exchange and transport of hydrogen in the electrodes and the evolution of hydrogen gas under operating conditions of a commercial Ni&#8208;mixed metal hydride battery.







Abstract
Efficiency losses due to side reactions are one of the main challenges in battery development. Despite providing valuable insights, the results of standard analysis on the individual components cannot be simply extrapolated to the full operating system. Therefore, non&#8208;destructive, and high resolution approaches that allow the investigation of the full system are desired. Herein, we combined neutron radiography and tomography with electrical monitoring of the state of charge of commercial Ni&#8208;mischmetal hydride batteries, to track the exchange and transport of hydrogen under operating conditions. This non&#8208;destructive approach allowed both the quantification of the hydrogen distribution in the electrodes in 4D, and the distinction between the electrochemically exchanged hydrogen and the hydrogen gas pressure generated by side reactions, as a function of the applied potential and current. One of the most counter&#8208;intuitive observation is that the generation of hydrogen gas during discharge depends on the charging state of the battery. The results presented provide critical new insights in the mechanisms governing the electrochemical processes during Nimischmetal hydride battery operation, and also pave the way for the extrapolation of this approach to the investigation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ions batteries.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pair Induced Polar Tri&#8208;layered Perovskite for Record&#8208;Performance Polarized Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lone&#8208;pair electron in MHy+ (methylhydrazine) results in the generation of a dipole moment. The dipole moments aggregate to give polarization, which is detected with a steady open&#8208;circuit voltage. Polarized detectors using the (IBA)2MHy2Pb3Br10 (IBA=iso&#8208;butylamine) single&#8208;crystal have an ultrahigh polarization ratio of up to 24.6 in self&#8208;powered mode, this ratio is a record for organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite single&#8208;crystals.







Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect, a promising optoelectronic phenomenon for generating polarized dependent steady&#8208;state photocurrent, has been widely applied in various photodetectors. However, incorporating stereochemically active lone pair to construct bulk photovoltage in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) is still elusive and challenging. Herein, bulk photovoltage (1.2&#8197;V) has been successfully achieved by introducing the stereo&#8208;chemically active lone pair perovskitizer to construct a polar tri&#8208;layered hybrid perovskite, namely, (IBA)2MHy2Pb3Br10 (1, IBA=iso&#8208;butylamine, MHy=methylhydrazine). Strikingly, owning to the promising bulk photovoltage, 1&#8208;based detectors exhibit an ultra&#8208;highly sensitive polarized photodetection (polarization ratio of up to 24.6) under self&#8208;powered mode. This ratio surpasses all the reported two&#8208;dimension OIHP single&#8208;crystal photodetectors. In addition, detectors exhibit outstanding responsivity (&#8776;200&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1) and detectivity (&#8776;2.4&#215;1013 Jones). More excitingly, further investigation confirms that lone pair electrons in MHy+ result in the separation of positive and negative charges to produce directional dipoles, which further directional alignment to generate bulk photovoltage, thereby resulting in polarization&#8208;dependent photocurrent. Our findings provide a new demonstration for polar multilayer materials&#8217; construction and may open opportunities for a host of high&#8208;sensitive polarized photodetection.

         <title>Entropy Confinement Promotes Hydrogenolysis Activity for Polyethylene Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical upcycling that catalyzes waste plastics back to high&#8208;purity chemicals holds great promise in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization. One of the main challenges in this process is the thermodynamic limitations imposed by the high intrinsic entropy of polymer chains, which makes their adsorption on catalysts unfavorable and the transition state unstable. Here, we overcome this challenge by inducing the catalytic reaction inside mesoporous channels, which possess a strong confined ability to polymer chains, allowing for stabilizing transition state. This approach involves the synthesis of p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalysts, in which Ru nanoparticles are uniformly distributed within the channels of an SBA&#8208;15 support, using a precise&#8208;impregnation method. The unique design of the p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalyst has demonstrated significant improvements in catalytic performance for the conversion of polyethylene into high&#8208;valued liquid fuels, particularly diesel. The catalyst achieved a high solid conversion rate of 1106 g&#183;gRu&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at 230 &#176;C. Comparatively, this catalytic activity is 4.9 times higher than that of a control catalyst, Ru/SiO2, and 14.0 times higher than that of a commercial catalyst, Ru/C, at 240 &#176;C. This remarkable catalytic activity opens up immense opportunities for the chemical upcycling of waste plastics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With their highly reactive respective C&#8211;Na and N&#8211;Na bonds, organosodium and sodium amide reagents could be viewed as obvious replacements or even superior reagents to the popular, widely utilised organolithiums. However, they have seen very limited applications in synthesis due mainly to poor solubility in common solvents and their limited stability. That notwithstanding in recent years there has been a surge of interest in bringing these sustainable metal reagents into the forefront of organometallics in synthesis.&#160;Showcasing&#160;the growth in utilisation of organosodium complexes within several areas of synthetic chemistry, this Minireview discusses promising new methods that have been recently reported with the goal of taming these powerful reagents. Special emphasis is placed on coordination and aggregation effects in these reagents which can impart profound changes in their solubility and reactivity. Differences in observed reactivity between more nucleophilic aryl and alkyl sodium reagents and the less nucleophilic but highly basic sodium amides are discussed along with current mechanistic understanding of their reactivities. Overall, this review aims to inspire growth in this exciting field of research to allow for the integration of organosodium complexes within common important synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>The Universal Super Cation&#8208;Conductivity in Multiple&#8208;cation Mixed Chloride Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As exciting candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are highly dependent on advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, using cost&#8208;effective LaCl3 and CeCl3 lattice (UCl3&#8208;type structure) as the host and further combined with a multiple&#8208;cation mixed strategy, we report a series of UCl3&#8208;type SSEs with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities over 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 and good compatibility with high&#8208;voltage oxide cathodes. The intrinsic large&#8208;size hexagonal one&#8208;dimensional channels and highly disordered amorphous phase induced by multi&#8208;metal cation species are believed to trigger fast multiple ionic conductions of Li+, Na+, K+, Cu+, and Ag+. The UCl3&#8208;type SSEs enable a stable prototype ASSLB capable of over 3000 cycles and high reversibility at &#8208;30 &#176;C. Further exploration of the brand&#8208;new multiple&#8208;cation mixed chlorides is likely to lead to the development of advanced halide SSEs suitable for ASSLBs with high energy density.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Product Observation for CO2 Electroreduction Using Synchronised Electrochemistry&#8208;Mass Spectrometry with Soft Ionisation (sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanistic understanding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires a rapid and accurate characterisation of product distribution to unravel the activity and selectivity, which is yet hampered by the lack of advanced correlative approaches. Here, we present the time&#8208;resolved identification of CO2RR products by using the synchronised electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry (sEC&#8208;MS). Transients in product formation can be readily captured in relation to electrochemical conditions. Moreover, a soft ionisation (SI) strategy is developed in MS for the direct observation of CO, immune to the interference of CO2 fragments. With the sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI, the kinetic information, such as Tafel slopes and onset potentials, for a myriad of CO2RR products are revealed and we show the hysteresis seen for the evolution of some species may origin from potential&#8208;driven changes in surface coverage of intermediates. This work provides a real&#8208;time picture of the dynamic formation of CO2RR products.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet&#8208;triplet energy inversion in carbon nitride photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Time&#8208;resolved EPR (TR&#8208;EPR) demonstrates the formation of well&#8208;defined spin triplet excitons in carbon nitride. This permits to experimentally probe the extent of the triplet wavefunction which delocalizes over several tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the TR&#8208;EPR signal demonstrates the mobility of the triplet excitons. By employing monochromatic light excitation in the range 430&#8208;600 nm, the energy of the spin triplet is estimated to be &#8776; 0.2 eV above the conduction band edge, proving that the triplet exciton lies above the corresponding singlet.&#160; Comparison between amorphous and graphitic forms establishes the singlet&#8208;triplet inversion as a general feature of carbon nitride materials</dc:description>

         <title>A GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist for Guiding MOF Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a new framework integrating the AI model GPT&#8208;4 into the iterative process of reticular chemistry experimentation, leveraging a cooperative workflow of interaction between AI and a human researcher. This GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist is an integrated system composed of three phases. Each of these utilizes GPT&#8208;4 in various capacities, wherein GPT&#8208;4 provides detailed instructions for chemical experimentation and the human provides feedback on the experimental outcomes, including both success and failures, for the in&#8208;context learning of AI in the next iteration. This iterative human&#8208;AI interaction enabled GPT&#8208;4 to learn from the outcomes, much like an experienced chemist, by a prompt&#8208;learning strategy. Importantly, the system is based on natural language for both development and operation, eliminating the need for coding skills, and thus, make it accessible to all chemists. Our collaboration with GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist guided the discovery of an isoreticular series of MOFs, with each synthesis fine&#8208;tuned through iterative feedback and expert suggestions. This workflow presents a potential for broader applications in scientific research by harnessing the capability of large language models like GPT&#8208;4 to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of research activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Activation Triggered by Cu&#8722;Co Double&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Silane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance catalysts sufficient to significantly reduce the energy barrier of water activation are crucial in facilitating reactions that are restricted by water dissociation. Herein we present a Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom (CuCo&#8208;DAC) catalyst, which possesses a uniform and well&#8208;defined CuCoN6(OH) structure, and works together to promote water activation in silane oxidation. The catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance far exceeding that of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAC). Various functional silanes are converted into silanols with up to 98% yield and 99% selectivity. Kinetic studies show that the activation energy of silane oxidation by CuCo&#8208;DAC is significantly lower than that of Cu&#8208;SAC and Co&#8208;SAC. Theoretical calculations demonstrate two different reaction pathways where water splitting is the rate&#8208;determining step and it is accelerated by CuCo&#8208;DAC, whereas H2 formation is key for its single&#8208;atom counterpart.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase Layers for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a stable and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for achieving dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, maintaining the integrity of SEI during prolonged cycle life under high current densities poses a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an integrated multifunctional SEI layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction (IOHL&#8208;Na) to enhance the durability of sodium metal anodes during reduplicative plating/stripping processes. The inorganic components with high mechanical strength and strong sodiophilicity demonstrate optimized ionic conduction efficiency and dendrite inhibition ability. Simultaneously, the organic component contributes to the formation of a dense and elastic membrane structure, preventing fracture and delamination issues during volume fluctuations. The symmetrical batteries of IOHL&#8208;Na achieve stable cycling over 2000 hours with an extremely low voltage hysteresis of around 15.8 mV at a high current density of 4 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Na&#8208;O2 batteries sustain exceptional long&#8208;term stability and impressive capacity retention, exploiting a promising approach for constructing durable SEI and dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Superstructure&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Assemblies for Nanoconfined Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most attempts to synthesize supramolecular nanosystems are limited to a single mechanism, often resulting in the formation of nanomaterials that lack diversity in properties. Herein, hierarchical assemblies with appropriate variety are fabricated in bulk via a superstructure&#8208;induced organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid strategy. The dynamic balance between substructures and superstructures is managed using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as dual building blocks to regulate the performances of hierarchical assemblies. Significantly, the superstructures resulting from the controlled cascade between COFs and MOFs create highly active photocatalytic systems through multiple topologies. Our designed tandem photocatalysis can precisely and efficiently regulate the conversion rates of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles) via competing redox pathways. Furthermore, benzo[d]imidazoles catalyzed by such supramolecular nanosystems are afforded in isolated yields ranging from 70% to 93% within tens of minutes. The multilayered structural states within the supramolecular systems demonstrate the importance of hierarchical assemblies in facilitating photocatalytic propagation and expanding the structural repertoire of supramolecular hybrids.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Enzymes for Environmental Sustainability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how engineered enzymes have been developed and implemented to help address environmental challenges. Topics include the use of engineered enzymes for improving carbon capture and utilisation, bioremediation, plastic deconstruction, and renewable feedstock generation. Successes, challenges, and opportunities for future enzyme engineering campaigns to improve environmental sustainability are discussed.







Abstract
The development and implementation of sustainable catalytic technologies is key to delivering our net&#8208;zero targets. Here we review how engineered enzymes, with a focus on those developed using directed evolution, can be deployed to improve the sustainability of numerous processes and help to conserve our environment. Efficient and robust biocatalysts have been engineered to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and have been embedded into new efficient metabolic CO2 fixation pathways. Enzymes have been refined for bioremediation, enhancing their ability to degrade toxic and harmful pollutants. Biocatalytic recycling is gaining momentum, with engineered cutinases and PETases developed for the depolymerization of the abundant plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Finally, biocatalytic approaches for accessing petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks and chemicals are expanding, using optimized enzymes to convert plant biomass into biofuels or other high value products. Through these examples, we hope to illustrate how enzyme engineering and biocatalysis can contribute to the development of cleaner and more efficient chemical industry.

         <title>Bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylenes: Facile Synthesis via Radical&#8208;Mediated Coupling Reactions and their Distinctive Electronic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four ribbon&#8208;like bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules were synthesized by intermolecular or intramolecular radical&#8208;mediated coupling reactions. They show electronic structures resembling the typical pyrenacenes rather than quinoidal rylenes, with localized aromatic benzenoid rings along the central long axis.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a one&#8208;dimensional (1D), ribbon&#8208;like structure have the potential to serve as both model compounds for corresponding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and as materials for optoelectronics applications. However, synthesizing molecules of this type with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation presents a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthetic method for a series of bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules, wherein the peri&#8208;positions of perylene, quaterrylene, and hexarylene are fused with naphtho&#8208;units. These molecules were efficiently synthesized primarily through intramolecular or intermolecular radical coupling of in situ generated organic radical species. Their structures were confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which also revealed a slightly bent geometry due to the incorporation of a cyclopentadiene ring at the bay regions of the rylene backbones. Bond lengh analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that their electronic structures resemble pyrenacenes more than quinoidal rylenes. That is, the aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the long axis of the skeletones. As the chain length increases, these molecules exhibit enhanced electronic absorption with a bathochromic shift, and multiple amphoteric redox waves. This study introduces a novel synthetic approach for generating 1D extended PAHs and GNRs, along with their structure&#8208;dependent electronic properties.

         <title>Organic Polymer Dots Photocatalyze CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic poly[(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl)&#8208;co&#8208;(1,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiadiazole)] (PFBT) polymer dots were applied as the CO2 photoreduction catalyst in aqueous solution to yield a CO production rate of 57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of up to 100&#8201;% and promising stability. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photoexcited PFBT was reduced by triethanolamine (TEOA) first, then bound with CO2 before CO production.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost and efficient photocatalysts to convert CO2 into valuable fuels is desirable to realize a carbon&#8208;neutral society. In this work, we report that polymer dots (Pdots) of poly[(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl)&#8208;co&#8208;(1,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiadiazole)] (PFBT), without adding any extra co&#8208;catalyst, can photocatalyze reduction of CO2 into CO in aqueous solution, rendering a CO production rate of 57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a detectable selectivity of up to 100&#8201;%. After 5 cycles of CO2 re&#8208;purging experiments, no distinct decline in CO amount and reaction rate was observed, indicating the promising photocatalytic stability of PFBT Pdots in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. A mechanistic study reveals that photoexcited PFBT Pdots are reduced by sacrificial donor first, then the reduced PFBT Pdots can bind CO2 and reduce it into CO via their intrinsic active sites. This work highlights the application of organic Pdots for CO2 reduction in aqueous solution, which therefore provides a strategy to develop highly efficient and environmentally friendly nanoparticulate photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>On the Electride Nature of Na&#8208;hP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early quantum mechanical models suggested that pressure drives solids towards free&#8208;electron metal behavior where the ions are locked into simple close&#8208;packed structures. The prediction and subsequent discovery of high&#8208;pressure electrides (HPEs), compounds assuming open structures where the valence electrons are localized in interstitial voids, required a paradigm shift. Our quantum chemical calculations on the iconic insulating Na&#8208;hP4 HPE show that increasing density causes a 3s &#8594; 3pd electronic transition due to Coulomb repulsion between the 1s2s and 3s states, and orthogonality of the 3pd states to the core. The large lobes of the resulting Na&#8208;pd hybrid orbitals point towards the center of an 11&#8208;membered penta&#8208;capped trigonal prism and overlap constructively, forming multi&#8208;centered bonds, which are responsible for the emergence of the interstitial charge localization in Na&#8208;hP4. These multi&#8208;centered bonds facilitate the increased density of this phase, which is key for its stabilization under pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Catalytic Production of Hydrogen Peroxide Using Tin&#8208;containing Zeolite Fixed Palladium Nanoparticles with Oxidation Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal surfaces tend to be oxidized in air through dissociation the O&#8208;O bond of oxygen to reduce the performances in various fields. Although several ligand modification routes have alleviated the oxidation of bulky metal surfaces, it is still a challenge for the oxidation resistance of small&#8208;size metal nanoparticles. Herein, we fixed the small&#8208;size Pd nanoparticles in tin&#8208;contained MFI zeolite crystals, where the tin acts as an electron donor to efficiently hinder the oxidation of Pd by weakening the adsorption of molecular oxygen and suppressing the O&#8208;O cleavage. This oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd catalyst exhibited superior performance in directly synthesizing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at ~10,170 mmol gPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, steadily outperforming the catalysts tested previously.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The metal surfaces tend to be oxidized in air through dissociation the O-O bond of oxygen to reduce the performances in various fields. Although several ligand modification routes have alleviated the oxidation of bulky metal surfaces, it is still a challenge for the oxidation resistance of small-size metal nanoparticles. Herein, we fixed the small-size Pd nanoparticles in tin-contained MFI zeolite crystals, where the tin acts as an electron donor to efficiently hinder the oxidation of Pd by weakening the adsorption of molecular oxygen and suppressing the O-O cleavage. This oxidation-resistant Pd catalyst exhibited superior performance in directly synthesizing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at ~10,170 mmol gPd-1 h-1, steadily outperforming the catalysts tested previously. This work leads to the hypothesis that tin is an electron donor to realize oxidation-resistant Pd within zeolite crystals for efficient catalysis to overcome the limitation of generally supported Pd catalysts, and further motivates the use of oxidation-resistant metal nanoparticles in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Lithium Extraction Membranes Derived from Tagged&#8208;modification of Polyamide Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient Mg2+/Li+ separation is crucial to combating the lithium shortage worldwide, yet current nanofiltration membranes suffer from low efficacy and/or poor scalability, because desirable properties of membranes are entangled and trade&#8208;off. This work reported a &#8220;tagged&#8208;modification&#8221; chemistry to tackle the challenge. A mixture of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;trimethylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium bromide (E1) and 3&#8208;aminopropyl&#8208;trimethylazanium (E2) was designed to modify polyethylenimine &#8211; trimesoyl chloride (PEI&#8208;TMC) membranes. E1 and E2 reacted with the PEI and TMC, respectively, and thus, membrane properties (hydrophilicity, pore sizes, charge) were untangled and intensified simultaneously. Permeance (34.3 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1) and Mg2+/Li+ selectivity (23.2) of modified membranes are ~4 times and ~2 times higher than the pristine membrane, and remain stable in a 30&#8208;days test. The permeance is the highest among all analogous nanofiltration membranes. The tagged&#8208;modification method enables the preparation of large&#8208;area membranes and modules that produce high&#8208;purity Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) from simulated brine.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Removal of Antibiotic Resistance Genes through 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d Gradient Orbital Coupling Mediated Fenton&#8208;Like Redox Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) mediated radical and nonradical active substances can synergistically achieve the efficient elimination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, enhancing interface electron cycling and optimizing the coupling of the oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates to improve PMS activation kinetics remains a major challenge. Here, Co doped CeVO4 catalyst (Co&#8208;CVO) with asymmetric sites was constructed based on Ce 4f&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Co 3d gradient orbital coupling. The catalyst achieved approximately 2.51&#215;105 copies/mL of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) removal within 15 minutes, exhibited ultrahigh degradation rate (k = 1.24 min&#8208;1). The effective gradient 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8208;O&#8208;Co active center microenvironment, while optimizing the electronic structure of Co 3d states (especially the occupancy of eg), promoting the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The generated radical and nonradical generated by interfacial electron cycling enhanced by the reduction reaction of PMS at the Ce site and the oxidation reaction at the Co site achieved a significant mineralization rate of ARGs (83.4%). The efficient removal of ARGs by a continuous flow reactor for 10 hours significantly reduces the ecological risk of ARGs in actual wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Low&#8208;temperature Performance and Stability of Na2Ti6O13 Anodes by the Ti&#8211;O Spring Effect through Nb&#8208;doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na2Ti6O13 (NTO) with high safety has been regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In the present study, integrated modification of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies regulation are realized in case of Nb&#8208;doping and have obtained significantly enhanced cycling performance with 92% reversible capacity retained after 3000 cycles at 3000 mA g&#8208;1. Moreover, unexpected low&#8208;temperature performance with a high discharge capacity of 143 mAh g&#8208;1 at 100 mA g&#8208;1 under &#8208;15&#176;C is also achieved in the full cell. Theoretical investigation suggests that Nb preferentially replaces Ti3 sites, which effectively improves structural stability and lowers the diffusion energy barrier. What&#8217;s more important, both the in&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman furtherly confirm the robust spring effect of the Ti&#8208;O bond, making special charge compensation mechanism and respective regulation strategy to conquer the sluggish transport kinetics and low conductivity, which plays a key role in promoting electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging of Single Molecular Behaviors Under Bifurcated Three&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism for interaction and bonding of single guest molecules with active sites fundamentally determines the sorption and subsequent catalytic processes occurring in host zeolitic frameworks. However, no real&#8208;space studies on these significant issues have been reported thus far, since atomically visualizing guest molecules and recognizing single Al T&#8208;sites in zeolites remain challenging. Here, we atomically resolved single thiophene probes interacting with acid T&#8208;sites in the ZSM&#8208;5 framework to study the bonding behaviors between them. The synergy of bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions can &#8220;freeze&#8221; the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and make it stable enough to be imaged. By combining the imaging results with simulations, direct atomic observations enabled us to precisely locate the single Al T&#8208;sites in individual straight channels. Then, we statistically found that the thiophene bonding probability of the T11 site is 15 times higher than that of the T6 site. For different acid T&#8208;sites, the variation in the interaction synergy changes the inner angle of the host&#8208;guest O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;S hydrogen bond, thereby affecting the stability of the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and leading to considerable bonding inhomogeneities.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Modulated Facet&#8208;selective Charge Separation in Bi4NbO8Cl Single Crystal for Boosting Visible&#8208;light Driven Bifunctional Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing bifunctional water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts is meaningful, but challenged by the harsh requirements of specific&#8208;facet single crystals with spatially separated reactive sites and anisotropic charge transfer paths contributed by well&#8208;built charge driving force. Herein, tunable ferroelectric polarization is introduced in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets to strengthen the orthogonal charge transfer channels. By manipulating the in&#8208;plane polarization from octahedral off&#8208;centering of Nb5+ and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization from lone pair electron effect of anisotropic Bi3+, both the fast charge recombination in bulk catalyst and the process of charge trapping into surface states can be effectively modulated. Collaborating with modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, cooperative charge tractive force is constructed, which reinforces the spatial separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to {110} reductive site facet and {001} oxidation site facet, respectively. While excessive polarization charges impair the facet&#8208;selective charge separation characteristics and conversely promote charge recombination on the surface. As a result, polarity&#8208;optimized Bi4NbO8Cl shows an excellent H2 and O2 evolution rate of 54.21 and 36.08 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1 in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation. This work unveils the function of ferroelectric polarization in tuning the intrinsic facet&#8208;selective charge transfer process of photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Protocol for Activated Bioorthogonal Fluorescence Labeling and Imaging of 4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase in Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nutrients needed to maintain optimal plant growth. Its level is closely linked to the extent of abiotic stress experienced by plants. Moreover, it is also the target of commercial herbicides. Therefore, labeling of HPPD in plants not only enables visualization of its tissue distribution and cellular uptake, it also facilitates assessment of abiotic stress of plants and provides information needed for the development of effective environmentally friendly herbicides. In this study, we created a method for fluorescence labeling of HPPD that avoids interference with the normal growth of plants. In this strategy, a perylene&#8208;linked dibenzyl&#8208;cyclooctyne undergoes strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with an azide&#8208;containing HPPD ligand. The activation&#8208;based labeling process results in a significant emission enhancement caused by the change in the fluorescent forms from an excimer to a monomer. Notably, this activated bioorthogonal strategy is applicable to visualizing HPPD in Arabidopsis thaliana, and assessing its response to multiple abiotic stresses. Also, it can be employed to monitor in vivo levels and locations of HPPD in crops. Consequently, the labeling strategy will be a significant tool in investigations of HPPD&#8208;related abiotic stress mechanisms, discovering novel herbicides, and uncovering unknown biological functions.</dc:description>

In this study, we created a method for fluorescence labeling of HPPD that avoids interference with the normal growth of plants. In this strategy, a perylene-linked dibenzyl-cyclooctyne undergoes strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition with an azide-containing HPPD ligand. The activation-based labeling process results in a significant emission enhancement caused by the change in the fluorescent forms from an excimer to a monomer. Notably, this activated bioorthogonal strategy is applicable to visualizing HPPD in Arabidopsis thaliana, and assessing its response to multiple abiotic stresses. Also, it can be employed to monitor in vivo levels and locations of HPPD in crops. Consequently, the labeling strategy will be a significant tool in investigations of HPPD-related abiotic stress mechanisms, discovering novel herbicides, and uncovering unknown biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stability and Crystallinity of Sodium Poly(Heptazine Imide) in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) salts, as crystalline carbon nitrides, exhibit high photocatalytic activity and are being extensively researched, but its photochemical instability has not drawn researchers&#8217; attention yet. Herein, sodium PHI (PHI&#8208;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with increased crystallinity, synthesized by enhancing contact of melamine with NaCl functioning as a structure&#8208;induction agent and hard template, exhibits improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, but low photochemical stability, owing to Na+ loss in the photocatalytic process, which, interestingly, can be enhanced by the common ion effect, e.g., addition of NaCl that is also able to remarkably increase the photoactivity with the apparent quantum yield at 420 nm reaching 41.5%. This work aims at attracting research peers&#8217; attention to photochemical instability of PHI salts and provides a way to enhance their crystallinity.</dc:description>

         <title>From Biomimicking to Bioinspired Design of Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction to C1 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is a promising approach to maintain a carbon cycle balance and produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, CO2RR technology is far from mature, since the conventional CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from low activity (leading to currents &lt; 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in an H&#8208;cell), stability (&lt; 120 h), and selectivity. Hence, they cannot meet the requirements for commercial applications (&gt; 200 mA cm&#8208;2, &gt; 8000 h, &gt; 90 % selectivity). Significant improvements are possible by taking inspiration from nature, considering biological organisms that efficiently catalyze the CO2 to various products. In this minireview, we present recent examples of enzyme&#8208;inspired and enzyme&#8208;mimicking CO2RR electrocatalysts enabling the production of C1 products with high faradaic efficiency (FE). At present, these designs do not typically follow a methodical approach, but rather focus on isolated features of biological systems. To achieve disruptive change, we advocate a systematic design methodology that leverages fundamental mechanisms associated with desired properties in nature and adapts them to the context of engineering applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Allowed H&#8208;type Supramolecular Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of&#160;pi&#8208;conjugated scaffolds with sterically demanding substituents is a widely used tactic to suppress cofacial (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions, which may even inhibit self&#8208;assembly. Contrary to expectations, we demonstrate herein that increasing steric effects can result in an enhanced thermodynamic stability of H&#8208;type supramolecular polymers. In our approach, we have investigated two boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes with bulky phenyl (2) and mesityl (3) meso&#8208;substituents and compared their self&#8208;assembly in nonpolar media with that of a parent meso&#8208;methyl BODIPY 1 lacking bulky groups. While the enhanced steric demand induces pathway complexity, the superior thermodynamic stability of the H&#8208;type pathways can be rationalized in terms of additional enthalpic gain arising from intermolecular C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F&#8208;B interactions of the orthogonally arranged aromatic substituents, which overrule their inherent steric demand. Our findings underline the importance of balancing competing non&#8208;covalent interactions in self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Stable Nickelocenium Dication Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of the nickelocenium cations [NiCp2]&#8226;+ and [NiCp2]2+ as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF = C(CF3)3) salts. Diamagnetic [NiCp2]2+ represents the first example for the isolation of an unsubstituted parent metallocene dication. Both salts were generated by reacting neutral NiCp2 with [NO]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (4FB). The salts were cha&#173;racterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), indicating shorter metal&#8208;ligand bond lengths for the higher charged salt. Powder XRD shows the salts to be phase pure, cyclic voltammetry in 4FB gave qua&#173;si reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.44 (0&#8702;1) and +1.17 V (1&#8702;2) vs Fc/Fc+. The 1H&#8208;NMR of [NiCp2]2+ is a singlet at 8.6 ppm, whereas paramagnetic [NiCp2]&#8226;+ is significantly shifted upfield to &#8722;103.1 ppm.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by Interrupted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitous presence of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous environments has aroused societal concern. Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#181;g&#183;L&#8208;1. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;&#8208;orbitals and is designed to such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer&#8208;ON/dye&#8208;OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin&#8208;coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of &#8764;150 ppb and &#8764;50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.</dc:description>

         <title>Zincophilic Interfacial Manipulation against Dendrite Growth and Side Reactions for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a multifunctional interphase layer to achieve highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer enables the homogenized Zn2+ flux, rapid desolvation kinetics, enhanced Zn2+ transference number, and suppressed side reactions, thus contributing to the high Coulombic efficiency and enhanced cycling performance with dendrite&#8208;free morphology.







Abstract
Constructing multifunctional interphases to suppress the rampant Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions is crucial for Zn anodes. Herein, a phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a versatile interphase layer to stabilize Zn anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer can manipulate Zn2+ flux and promote rapid desolvation kinetics, ensuring the uniform Zn deposition with dendrite&#8208;free morphology. Moreover, the robust PA&#8208;ZnAl protective layer can effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of byproducts, further contributing to the reversible Zn plating/stripping with high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, the Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl electrode shows a lower Zn nucleation overpotential and higher Zn2+ transference number compared with bare Zn. The Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl symmetric cell exhibits a prolonged lifespan of 650&#8197;h tested at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the assembled Zn battery full cell based on this Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl anode also delivers decent cycling stability even under harsh conditions.

Furthermore, the assembled Zn battery full cell based on this Zn@PA-ZnAl anode also delivers decent cycling stability even under harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Depolymerization of Waste Polyesters Enabled by Transesterification/Hydrogenation Relay Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient hydrogenative PET degradation protocol was developed under mild conditions enabled by a novel transesterification/hydrogenation relay strategy and rationally designed catalysts. A broad range of post&#8208;consumer PET sources and other types of polyesters were easily degraded in excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the evolution of catalyst and the important role of methanol for promoting the reaction efficiency.







Abstract
The efficient depolymerization of polyesters under mild conditions remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a highly efficient strategy for the degradation of a diverse array of waste polyesters as low to 80&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar H2. The key to the success of this transformation relied on the initial transesterification of macromolecular polyester into more degradable oligomeric fragments in the presence of CH3OH and the subsequent hydrogenation by the use of the rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based Ru complex. Controlled experiments and preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the quinaldine&#8208;based catalysts could be hydrogenated to the eventually active species, which has been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and directly used as a catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of polyester. The strong viability and high activity of this new species in protic solvent were explained in detail. Besides, the crucial role of CH3OH in promoting reaction efficiency during the whole process was also elucidated. The synthetic utility of this method was further illustrated by preparing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

         <title>A Bismuth&#8208;Based Zeolitic Organic Framework with Coordination&#8208;Linked Metal Cages for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;directing strategy is developed to build a bismuth&#8208;based zeolitic organic framework (Bi&#8208;ZMOFs) with coordination&#8208;linked metal cages for efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH with 91&#8201;% efficiency. The coordination of Bi with pyrazole&#8208;N atom triggers an effective interatomic electron transfer and contributes to the activation of CO2 and stabilization of the active intermediates.







Abstract
Zeolitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ZMOFs) have emerged as one of the most promsing catalysts for energy conversion, but they suffer from either weak bonding between metal&#8208;organic cubes (MOCs) that decrease their stability during catalysis processes or low activity due to inadequate active sites. In this work, through ligand&#8208;directing strategy, we successfully obtain an unprecedented bismuth&#8208;based ZMOF (Bi&#8208;ZMOF) featuring a ACO topological crystal structure with strong coordination bonding between the Bi&#8208;based cages. As a result, it enables efficient reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) with Faradaic efficiency as high as 91&#8201;%. A combination of in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals that the Bi&#8722;N coordination contributes to facilitating charge transfer from N to Bi atoms, which stabilize the intermediate to boost the reduction efficiency of CO2 to HCOOH. This finding highlights the importance of the coordination environment of metal active sites on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. We believe that this work will offer a new clue to rationally design zeolitic MOFs for catalytic reaction

The establishment of a time&#8208;temperature&#8208;transformation (TTT) diagram captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirms stabilization of cubic&#8208;phase LLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C.

Abstract
Efficient and affordable synthesis of Li+ functional ceramics is crucial for the scalable production of solid electrolytes for batteries. Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8722;d (LLZO), especially its cubic phase (cLLZO), attracts attention due to its high Li+ conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. However, high sintering temperatures raise concerns about the cathode interface stability, production costs, and energy consumption for scalable manufacture. We show an alternative &#8220;sinter&#8208;free&#8221; route to stabilize cLLZO as films at half of its sinter temperature. Specifically, we establish a time&#8208;temperature&#8208;transformation (TTT) diagram which captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirm stabilization of thin&#8208;film cLLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C. Our findings pave the way for low&#8208;temperature processing via TTT diagrams, which can be used for battery cell design targeting reduced carbon footprints in manufacturing.
