         <title>Nature of the Active Sites of Copper Zinc Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO  2  reduction to multi&#8208;carbon chemical feedstocks over copper based catalysts is of considerable attraction but suffers with the ambiguous nature of active sites, which hinder the rational design of catalysts and large&#8208;scale industrialization. Herein, combining neural network based global optimization and density functional theory calculations, this paper describes a large&#8208;scale simulation to obtain realistic copper zinc nanoparticles models and investigates the atom&#8208;level structure of C  2+  products active sites on CuZn catalysts in CO  2  ER. After analyzing over 2000 surface sites through high throughput tests based on NN potential, two kinds of active sites are identified, balanced Cu&#8208;Zn sites and Zn&#8208;heavy Cu&#8208;Zn sites, both facilitating C&#8208;C coupling, which are verified by subsequent calculational and experimental results. This work provides a new research paradigm for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;based catalysts and may offer a general strategy to identify accurately the atomic structures of active sites in complex catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconfiguration and Reorganization of Bottlebrush Polymer Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key stages of bottlebrush random copolymer (BRCP) assembly at fluid interfaces are shown in the picture: Diffusion of BRCP from oil solution to the interface, reconfiguration to a hydrophilic&#8208; and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformation and interfacial adsorption (lhs), and reorganization of the BRCPs assembled at the liquid interface by in&#8208;plane diffusion (rhs).







Abstract
Bottlebrush random copolymers (BRCPs), having randomly distributed hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains, are shown to reconfigure into hydrophilic&#8208;rich and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformations at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to reduce interfacial energy. Both the degree of polymerization (NBB) and extent of grafting in these BRCPs were found to impact surface coverage and assembly kinetics. The time&#8208;dependence of the interfacial tension is described as the sum of two exponential relaxation functions characterizing BRCP diffusion, interfacial adsorption, and reorganization. Interfacial tension (&#947;) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) results showed that higher molecular weight BRCPs require longer time to adsorb to the water&#8211;oil interface, but less time for interfacial reorganization. Overall, this work describes fundamental principles of BRCP assembly at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, with implications pertaining to polymer design with enhanced understanding of emulsification, adhesion, and related properties in fluids and at interfaces.

         <title>Spatially Resolved, Error&#8208;Robust Multiplexed MicroRNA Profiling in Single Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;encoded error&#8208;corrected label (FluoEL) for multiplexed microRNA imaging in living cells is developed. Proportionally encoded Cy3 and Cy5 overcome the limitation of spectral overlap. The core&#8211;shell mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) structure avoids FRET between the recognition component of the molecular beacon (MB) and the barcoding dye to provide high accuracy.







Abstract
Simultaneous imaging of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) in individual living cells is challenging due to the lack of spectrally distinct encoded fluorophores and non&#8208;cytotoxic methods. We describe a multiplexed error&#8208;robust combinatorial fluorescent label&#8208;encoding method, termed fluorophores encoded error&#8208;corrected labels (FluoELs), enabling multiplexed miRNA imaging in living cells with error&#8208;correcting capability. The FluoELs comprise proportional dual fluorophores for encoding and a constant quantitative single fluorophore for error&#8208;corrected quantification. Both are embedded in 260&#8197;nm core&#8211;shell silica nanoparticles modified with molecular beacon detection probes. The FluoELs are low cytotoxic and could accurately quantify and spatially resolve nine breast&#8208;cancer&#8208;related miRNAs and evaluate their coordination. The FluoELs enabled a single&#8208;cell analysis platform to evaluate miRNA expression profiles and the molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Designing a Network of Crystalline Polymers for a Scalable, Nonfluorinated, Healable and Amphiphobic Solid Slippery Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A healable amphiphobic solid slippery coating is derived through the formation of a crystalline network of &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymers in a porous polymeric coating, where the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction provided a porous and substrate&#8208;independent polymeric coating to develop a non&#8208;fluorinated and optically transparent slippery interface for sliding beaded droplets of water, crude/refined oils and polar/non&#8208;polar solvents.







Abstract
The fluorinated&#8208;liquid infused amphiphobic slippery interfaces exhibiting superior sliding of the beaded oil/water droplets, often suffer from durability and contamination issues. Here, the ability of 1)&#8197;hexagonal packing of hydrocarbon sides in a selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer and 2)&#8197;its reversible phase transition at 51&#8201;&#176;C was rationally exploited to achieve temperature&#8208;assisted rapid (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitive (50 times) self&#8208;healable amphiphobic solid&#8208;slippery coating on both planar and geometrically&#8208;complex substrates. The selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer was strategically infused in a porous, hydrophilic and thick (&#8776;4.8&#8197;&#956;m) polymeric coating. The resultant solid and smooth interface exhibited sliding of beaded droplets of various liquids, including droplets of water, polar (ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, 1&#8208;hexanol, DMSO, DMF), and non&#8208;polar (decane, dodecane, diiodomethane) organic solvents, edible (vegetable oil), motor, engine (petrol, diesel, kerosene) and crude oils.

         <title>Prodrugs of Persulfide and Sulfide: Is There a Pharmacological Difference between the Two in the Context of Rapid Exchanges among Various Sulfur Species In Vivo?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delivery system which can release pure H2S, hydrogen persulfide, and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide was used to compare the pharmacological difference of sulfide and persulfide. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also exhibited reduced toxicity compared to H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.







Abstract
Sulfide and persulfide are chemically different and one might expect persulfide to be more effective in mediating sulfur signaling because persulfide can directly modify protein cysteine residue. However, rapid scrambling, and interconversions occur among sulfur species. Then there is the question of whether the chemical reactivity differences between sulfide and persulfide would translate into pharmacological differences. Utilizing a delivery system to generate pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen persulfide (H2S2), and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide (N&#8208;CysSSH), we examined the activities of sulfide and persulfide in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug. In particular, the H2S2 prodrug offers much&#8208;elevated analgesic effects compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also possess a reduced level of toxicity compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.

In particular, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; prodrug offers much-elevated analgesic effects compared to the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S prodrug in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also possess a reduced level of toxicity compared to the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Electrophile Synthesis of Di(hetero)arylmethanes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfinative C&#8722;C Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzylic halides and heteroaryl halides are directly coupled using Pd&#8208;catalysis and a simple sulfinate transfer reagent. The reactions proceed by formation of an intermediate benzylic sulfinate, formed in situ, and deliver di(hetero)arylmethane products. The reactions use only commercial components, and no stoichiometric metal reductant is needed.







Abstract
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling to access medicinally relevant di(hetero)arylmethanes is reported. The method is reductant&#8208;free, and involves a sulfinate transfer reagent and a Pd&#8208;catalyst mediating the union of two electrophilic coupling partners; a (hetero)aryl halide and a benzyl halide. We establish for the first time that benzyl sulfinates, generated in situ, undergo efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl halides to generate di(hetero)arylmethanes. The reaction can be extended to benzylic pseudohalides derived from benzyl alcohols. The reactions are straightforward to perform and scalable, and all reaction components are commercially available.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Aminocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of simple imide&#8208;directed intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of aminocyclopropanes enabled by iridium catalysis has been developed. The reaction proceeds via six&#8208;membered metallacycles. The method could tolerate a broad spectrum of functional groups, affording a vast array of chiral aminocyclopropanes (36 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controllable C&#8722;H functionalization remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we disclose the first example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aminocyclopropanes by using simple imides as weakly coordinating directing groups under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded via a six&#8208;membered iridacycle, affording a vast range of chiral aminocyclopropyl boronates. The current method features a broad spectrum of functional groups (36 examples) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%). We also demonstrated the synthetic utility by a preparative scale C&#8722;H borylation, C&#8722;B bond transformations, and conversion of the directing group.

         <title>Activation of CO Using a 1,2&#8208;Disilylene: Facile Synthesis of an Abnormal N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a 1,2&#8208;disilylene with CO under ambient conditions leads to a bis(silylene), the five&#8208;membered heterocycle of which represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (see picture). Reactions of the bis(silylene) with transition metal carbonyls lead to different outcomes, including a chelate complex of the Mo(CO)4 fragment.







Abstract
Reaction of the 1,2&#8208;disilylene, [{ArC(NDip)2}Si]2 1 (Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Ar=4&#8208;C6H4But), with CO proceeds via insertion of CO into one Si&#8722;N bond, and Si&#8722;Si bond cleavage, to cleanly give the bis(silylene), {ArC(NDip)2}Si(:)O
 Ar 2, under ambient conditions. The reaction can be partially reversed when solutions of 2 are subjected to UV irradiation. The five&#8208;membered heterocyclic fragment of 2 represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC), a view which is substantiated by a computational analysis of the compound. Reaction of 2 with [Mo(CO)6] under UV light affords the chelate complex, [Mo(CO)4(&#954;2&#8208;Si,Si&#8208;2)] 3, while reaction with [Fe(CO)5] gives the unusual silyleneyl bridged complex, [{Fe2(CO)6}{&#956;&#8208;Si[(NDip)2CAr]}2] 4. The same coordination complexes can be accessed by reaction of 1 with [Mo(CO)6] or [Fe(CO)5] under UV light. As is the case for aNHCs, d&#8208;block metal complexes of bis(silylene) 2 could prove useful as bespoke catalysts for organic transformations.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Based Complex Fluids as Aqueous Exciton Transport Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions are fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. Complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid in which energy transfer is highly efficient.







Abstract
The ability to assemble artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions is fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Here, we argue that associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. We find that complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid. We interrogate exciton transfer from the donor to the acceptor CPE within the complex fluid and find that transfer is highly efficient. We also find that excess molecular ions can tune the modulus of the inter&#8208;CPE complex fluid. Even at high ion concentrations, CPEs remain complexed with significantly delocalized electronic wavefunctions. Our work lays the rational foundation for complex, tunable aqueous light&#8208;harvesting systems via the intrinsic thermodynamics of associative phase separation.

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;Based Kinematic Theory for Nanocrystal Morphology Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate shape evolution is proposed. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories of NPs. The theory accommodates the conventional theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline nanoparticles (NPs) generally involves three processes: nucleation, growth, and shape evolution. Among them, the shape evolution is less understood, despite the importance of morphology for NP properties. Here, we propose a symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate the process. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus (or seed) symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories. The theory accommodates the conventional criteria of the major existing theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking process during the growth of anisotropic structures. Furthermore, complex dendritic growth is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. Thus, it provides a framework to explain the shape evolution, and extends the morphogenesis prediction to cases, which cannot be treated by other theories.

         <title>Overcoming Spectral Dependence: A General Strategy for Developing Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Ultra&#8208;Fluorogenic Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general tetrazine probe design strategy overcomes the spectral dependence of the energy transfer mechanism, endowing excellent fluorogenicity in the NIR window. The high specificity, signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and photostability of the synthesized probes make them highly suited for live&#8208;cell bioimaging and theranostics.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal fluorogenic dyes are indispensable tools in wash&#8208;free bioimaging of specific biological targets. However, the fluorogenicity of existing tetrazine&#8208;based bioorthogonal probes deteriorates as the emission wavelength shifts towards the NIR window, greatly limiting their applications in live cells and tissues. Herein, we report a generalizable molecular design strategy to construct ultra&#8208;fluorogenic dyes via a simple substitution at the meso&#8208;positions of various far&#8208;red and NIR fluorophores. Our probes demonstrate significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios (102&#8211;103&#8208;fold) in the range 586&#8211;806&#8197;nm. These results will greatly expand the applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in NIR bioimaging and biosensing.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer and Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel donor&#8208;pillar[5]arene&#8208;acceptor structure with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property shows a twisted conformation and intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). Balancing of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission via viscosity and polar guest generates the single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission.







Abstract
The fabrication of single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission (SMWLE) materials has become a highly studied topic in recent years and through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is emerging as an important concept in this field. However, the preparation of ideal TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a bifunctional pillar[5]arene (TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA) with a linear donor&#8208;spacer&#8208;acceptor structure and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. The bulky pillar[5]arene between the donor and acceptor induces a twisted conformation and a non&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in intramolecular TSCT. In addition, the AIE feature and pillar[5]arene cavity endow TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA with responsiveness to viscosity and polar guests, by which the TSCT emission is triggered. The combination of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission of TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA generates SMWLE. Therefore, we provide a new and versatile strategy for the construction of TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials.

         <title>Rhodaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed peri&#8208;Selective Direct Alkenylations with Weak O&#8208;Coordination Enabled by the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative alkenylation of oxidation&#8208;sensitive 1&#8208;naphthols as well as 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;hydroxyquinolines has been developed. It employs readily available starting materials, and the C&#8722;C bond formation proceeds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity, with molecular H2 as the only stoichiometric waste product.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H functionalizations by electrocatalysis is dominated by strongly coordinating N(sp2)&#8208;directing groups. In sharp contrast, direct electrocatalytic transformations of weakly&#8208;coordinating phenols remain underdeveloped. Herein, electrooxidative peri C&#8722;H alkenylations of challenging 1&#8208;naphthols were achieved by versatile rhodium(III) catalysis via user&#8208;friendly constant current electrolysis. The rhodaelectrocatalysis employed readily&#8208;available alkenes and a protic reaction medium and features ample scope, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The strategy was successfully applied to high&#8208;value, nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, thereby providing direct access to uncommon heterocyclic motifs based on the dihydropyranoquinoline skeleton.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating Colloidal Co&#8208;Assemblies That Accelerate Their Own Destruction via Chemo&#8208;Structural Feedback</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;structural feedback mechanism is introduced in co&#8208;assembling microgels (MGs), whereby the co&#8208;assemblies promote their own destruction. The key concept uses co&#8208;assembly&#8208;triggered proximity effects of enzymes immobilized on individual MGs so that the co&#8208;assembly enhances an enzymatic cascade for deactivator production.







Abstract
Biological self&#8208;assemblies self&#8208; and cross&#8208;regulate each other via chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and feedback. Although artificial transient self&#8208;assemblies have been realized via activation/deactivation CRNs, the transient structures themselves do mostly not engage in the CRN. We introduce a rational design approach for chemo&#8208;structural feedback, and present a transient colloidal co&#8208;assembly system, where the formed co&#8208;assemblies accelerate their destruction autonomously. We achieve this by immobilizing enzymes of a deactivating acid&#8208;producing enzymatic cascade on pH&#8208;switchable microgels that can form co&#8208;assemblies at high pH. Since the enzyme partners are immobilized on individual microgels, the co&#8208;assembled state brings them close enough for enhanced acid generation. The amplified deactivator production (acid) leads to an almost two&#8208;fold reduction in the lifetime of the transiently formed pH&#8208;state. Our study thus introduces versatile mechanisms for chemo&#8208;structural feedback.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Erectones A and B, and the Revised Structure of Hyperelodione D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical speculation on the biosynthesis of hyperelodione D leads to its structural reassignment via a concise total synthesis. The key step is a bioinspired, Diels&#8211;Alder cascade reaction between E,E&#8208;&#945;&#8208;farnesene and a naturally occurring quinone that generates three rings and six stereocentres.







Abstract
The field of biomimetic synthesis seeks to apply biosynthetic hypotheses to the efficient construction of complex natural products. This approach can also guide the revision of incorrectly assigned structures. Herein, we describe the evolution of a concise total synthesis and structural reassignment of hyperelodione D, a tetracyclic meroterpenoid derived from a Hypericum plant, alongside some biogenetically related natural products, erectones A and B. The key step in the synthesis of hyperelodione D forms six stereocentres and three rings in a bioinspired cascade reaction that features an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, an intramolecular Prins reaction and a terminating cycloetherification.

     alt="Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Erectones A and B, and the Revised Structure of Hyperelodione D"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical speculation on the biosynthesis of hyperelodione D leads to its structural reassignment via a concise total synthesis. The key step is a bioinspired, Diels&#8211;Alder cascade reaction between &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;span style="color:#0c0c0c"&gt;&#945;&lt;/span&gt;-farnesene and a naturally occurring quinone that generates three rings and six stereocentres.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of biomimetic synthesis seeks to apply biosynthetic hypotheses to the efficient construction of complex natural products. This approach can also guide the revision of incorrectly assigned structures. Herein, we describe the evolution of a concise total synthesis and structural reassignment of hyperelodione D, a tetracyclic meroterpenoid derived from a &lt;i&gt;Hypericum&lt;/i&gt; plant, alongside some biogenetically related natural products, erectones A and B. The key step in the synthesis of hyperelodione D forms six stereocentres and three rings in a bioinspired cascade reaction that features an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, an intramolecular Prins reaction and a terminating cycloetherification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Zirconocene&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s and Its Extension to Synthesis of a Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Nanobarrel</title>

         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valent zirconocene&#8208;mediated cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent treatment with acid affords porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with exocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiene motifs. These porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s can react with dienophiles to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with benzdiyne gives a nanobarrel which can hold two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Rosenthal's&#8208;reagent&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent acid treatment afforded a 1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;embedded porphyrin(2.1.2.1), 6, which served as a reactive diene towards dienophiles such as dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) and benzyne to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 6 and benzdiyne gave adducts 14, 15&#8201;a, and 15&#8201;b along with a trace amount of porphyrin(2.1.2.1) barrel 13. Stepwise routes using 14 or 15&#8201;a/15&#8201;b as a substrate allowed for the synthesis of 13 as a single stereoisomer. The nanobarrel structure for 13 was revealed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, where its cavity held two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. DFT calculations revealed that the electrostatic attraction was dominant with binding energy of 32.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Inert Alkyl Chlorides for the Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling with Aromatic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox activation of inert chloroalkanes for the cross&#8208;coupling reaction with olefins, with a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions is presented. By combining UV/Vis spectroscopy, EPR, radical clock and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments, [Ni(Py2Tstacn)]+ is proposed to be catalytically competent to activate the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond, forming a free radical, which reacts with the alkene.







Abstract
The inertness of chloroalkanes has precluded them as coupling partners for cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Herein we disclose a general strategy for the activation of inert alkyl chlorides through photoredox catalysis and their use as coupling partners with alkenes. The catalytic system is formed by [Ni(OTf)(Py2Tstacn)](OTf) (1Ni), which is responsible for the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond activation, and [Ir(NMe2bpy)(ppy)2]PF6, (PCIrNMe2), which is the photoredox catalyst. Combined experimental and theoretical studies show an in&#8197;situ photogenerated NiI intermediate ([Ni(Py2Tstacn)]+) which is catalytically competent for the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond cleavage via a SN2 mechanism for primary alkyl chlorides, forming carbon&#8208;centered free radicals, which react with the olefin leading to the formation of the Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond. These results suggest inert alkyl chlorides can be electrophiles for developing new intermolecular strategies in which low&#8208;valent aminopyridine nickel complexes act as key catalytic species.

         <title>Endo&#8208;M Mediated Chemoenzymatic Approach Enables Reversible Glycopeptide Labeling for O&#8208;GlcNAcylation Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To selectively enrich O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) peptides in their original form from complex samples, we report the first reversible chemoenzymatic labeling approach for proteomic analysis. In this strategy, the O&#8208;GlcNAc moieties are ligated with long N&#8208;glycans using an Endo&#8208;M mutant, which enables the enrichment of the labeled glycopeptides by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The attached glycans on the enriched glycopeptides are removed by wild&#8208;type Endo&#8208;M/S to restore the O&#8208;GlcNAc moiety. Compared with the classic chemoenzymatic labeling, this approach enables the tag&#8208;free identification, and eliminates the interference of bulky tags in glycopeptide detection. This approach presents a unique avenue for the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation to promote its mechanism research.</dc:description>

         <title>White&#8208;light Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Chiral Copper(I) Coordination Polymer through Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving white&#8208;light emission, especially white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a single&#8208;phase material is challenging. Herein, a pair of chiral Cu(I) coordination polymers (  1&#8208;M  and  1&#8208;P  ) have been prepared by the asymmetrical assembly of achiral ligands and Cu  2  I  2  clusters. The compounds display dual emission bands and can be used as single&#8208;phase white&#8208;light phosphors, achieving a &#8220;warm&#8221;&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode with an ultra&#8208;high color rendering index (CRI) of 93.4 and an appropriate correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3632 K. Meanwhile, corresponding CPL signals with maximum dissymmetry factor |  g  lum  | = 8&#215;10  &#8208;3  have been observed. Hence, intrinsic white&#8208;light emission and CPL have been realized simultaneously in coordination polymers for the first time. This work gains insight into the nature of chiral assembly from achiral units and offers a prospect for the development of single&#8208;phase white&#8208;CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering Self&#8208;Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional Iptycenes on Au(111) by Tuning Molecule&#8208;Surface Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of three&#8208;dimensional molecules is scarcely studied on surfaces. Their modes of adsorption can exhibit far greater variability compared to (nearly) planar molecules that adsorb mostly flat on surfaces. This additional degree of freedom can have decisive consequences for the expression of intermolecular binding motifs, hence the formation of supramolecular structures.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Regioselective C&#8208;H Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Arenes Using Activated and Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct alkylation of the C&#8208;H bond arenes in a selective manner represents one of the long&#8208;standing challenges. Herein, a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic regioselective C&#8208;H alkylation protocol of electron&#8208;rich arenes with both activated and unactivated alkenes was developed. The reaction tolerates a wide range of aromatic rings with diverse substitution patterns, as well as terminal and internal alkenes, providing a general and straightforward metal&#8208;free method for C&#8208;C bond formation from inert C&#8208;H bonds. Moreover, alkynes are also compatible to give the C&#8208;H vinylation of electron&#8208;rich arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;ray Electron Density Study of the Chemical Bonding Origin of Glass Formation in Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glass&#8208;forming metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have novel applications, but the origin of their peculiar melting behavior is unclear. Here, we report synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction electron densities of two zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni. Electron density analysis shows that the Zn&#8210;N bonds are more ionic than Co&#8210;N bond, which have distinct covalent features. Variable temperature Raman spectra reveal onset of significant imidazolate bond weakening in Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni above 673 K. Melting can be controlled by tuning the metal&#8211;ligand and imidazole bonding strength as shown from thermal analysis of nine solid solution Co  x  Zn  1&#8208;x  &#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x = 0.3 to 0.003) MOFs, and a mere 4% Co&#8208;doping into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni results in thermal decomposition instead of melting. The present findings demonstrate the key role of the metal&#8210;ligand bonds and imidazolate bonds in controlling the delicate balance between melting and decomposition processes in this class of ZIF compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here on the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of racemic &#946;&#8208;thiobutyrolactone (rac&#8208;TBL), as the first chemical synthesis of poly(3&#8208;thiobutyrolactone) (P3TB), the thioester analogue of the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB). The ROP reactions proceed very fast (TOF &gt; 12,000 h&#8210;1 at r.t.) in the presence of various metal&#8208;based catalysts. Remarkably, catalyst systems based on non&#8208;chiral yttrium complexes stabilized by tetradentate amino alkoxy&#8208; or diamino&#8208;bis(phenolate) ligands {ONXOR1,R2}2&#8210; (X = O, N) provide access to cyclic P3TB with either high isoselectivity (Pm up to 0.90) or high syndiotactic bias (Pr up to 0.70). The stereoselectivity can be controlled by manipulation of the substituents on the ligand platform and adequate choice of the reaction solvent and temperature as well. The cyclic polymer topology is evidenced by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS, NMR and TGA. Highly isotactic cyclic P3TB is a semi&#8208;crystalline material as revealed by DSC.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The construction of multi&#8208;stereocenters of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction is a stubborn challenge. In the meanwhile, catalytic desymmetric functionalization of unactivated alkene remains largely unexplored.

The leverage of underdeveloped chiral 8&#8208;Quinox enables Ni&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric carbamoylalkylation of both unactivated mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes to forge the pyrrolidinone bearing two uncontinuous stereogenic centers in high enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivitives with broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry Triggers Ultrafast Radiative Recombination in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial chemistry strategy is developed to dramatically increase radiative recombination of perovskites. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite has a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state, exhibiting an unprecedented 5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Efficient radiative recombination is essential for perovskite luminescence, but the intrinsic radiative recombination rate as a basic material property is challenging to tailor. Here we report an interfacial chemistry strategy to dramatically increase the radiative recombination rate of perovskites. By coating aluminum oxide on the lead halide perovskite, lead&#8211;oxygen bonds are formed at the perovskite&#8208;oxide interface, producing the perovskite surface states with a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite exhibits a &#8776;500 fold enhanced photoluminescence with a &#8776;10 fold reduced lifetime, indicating an unprecedented &#8776;5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.

         <title>&#8220;Click&#8221;&#8208;Like &#951;6&#8208;Metalation/Demetalation of Aryl Iodides as a Means of Turning &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; Halogen Bond Donor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click On! &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of cationic cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) moieties is demonstrated to be a convenient, quantitative method for the click&#8208;like activation of aryl iodides as halogen bond donors. Photochemical demetalation using violet LEDs in MeCN returns the metal to its starting material form and supresses halogen bonding functionality. The cycle provides a reversible &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch for controlling the halogen bond donor strength of aryl iodides.







Abstract

         <title>Mapping Ambiphile Reactivity Trends in the Anti&#8208;(Hetero)annulation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkenes via PdII/PdIV Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>

A method to access 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles from non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides and ambiphilic organohalides is described. Under PdII/PdIV catalysis, this [n+2] annulation proceeds in an anti&#8208;selective fashion and tolerates a wide array of ambiphiles, which are systematically benchmarked with respect to nucleophile identity, electrophile identity, and product ring&#8208;size. Otherwise unreactive ambiphilic ortho&#8208;haloacetophenones can be activated using an amine co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
In this study, we systematically evaluate different ambiphilic organohalides for their ability to participate in anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208; or heteroannulation with non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides under PdII/PdIV catalysis. Detailed optimization of the reaction conditions has led to protocols for synthesizing tetrahydropyridines, tetralins, pyrrolidines, and other carbo/heterocyclic cores via [n+2] (n=3&#8211;5) (hetero)annulation. Expansion of scope to otherwise unreactive ambiphilic haloketones through PdII/amine co&#8208;catalysis is also demonstrated. Compared to other annulation processes, this method proceeds via a distinct PdII/PdIV mechanism involving Wacker&#8208;type directed nucleopalladation. This difference results in unique reactivity and selectivity patterns, as revealed through assessment of reaction scope and competition experiments.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Organic Reactions by Resonant Acoustic Mixing**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enables mechanochemical organic synthesis that avoids milling or crushing media, as well as bulk solvents. The RAM methodology enables significant simplification and improvement of mechanochemical olefin metathesis, the first mechanochemical strategy for ene&#8208;yne metathesis, and permits the direct, 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the mechanochemical synthesis of pharmaceutically active sulfonylureas, without any significant changes to reaction conditions or conversion.







Abstract
We demonstrate catalytic organic synthesis by Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM): a mechanochemical methodology that does not require bulk solvent or milling media. Using as model reactions ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis and copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamide&#8208;isocyanate coupling, RAM mechanosynthesis is shown to be faster, operationally simpler than conventional ball&#8208;milling, while also providing the first example of a mechanochemical strategy for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ene&#8208;yne metathesis. Reactions by RAM are readily and directly scaled&#8208;up without any significant changes in reaction conditions, as shown by the straightforward 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the synthesis of the antidiabetic drug Tolbutamide, from hundreds of milligrams directly to 30&#8197;grams.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Influenced Fragmentations in Free&#8208;Standing Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Hydrophobicity Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pre&#8208;synthetically controlled framework growth strategy to tune the hydrophobicity of the 3D&#8208;COF membranes without changing the building blocks or post&#8208;synthetic modifications is demonstrated. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane was utilized for the demulsification of an oil&#8211;water mixture.







Abstract
The ordered open organic frameworks membranes are attractive candidates for flow&#8208;assisted molecular separations. The physicochemical properties of such membranes mostly depend on their selectively chosen functional building blocks. In this work, we have introduced a novel concept of functional switchability of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) membranes through a simple solvent&#8208;influenced fragmentation method. This room&#8208;temperature interfacial synthesis provides free&#8208;standing 3D&#8208;COF membranes with distinct physicochemical properties from the same building monomers. Notably, the change of solvent from chloroform to ethyl acetate switches the membrane property from hydrophilic (water contact angle 60&#176;) to hydrophobic (water contact angle 142&#176;) nature. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane selectively passes oil molecules from an oil&#8211;water emulsion with a gravitational flux of 1536&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Component Excitonic Switch Utilizing High&#8208;Performance Diarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly methylated diarylethenes derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine are reported with high thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and fluorogenicity. With these, an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides has been designed: one containing the fluorogenic diarylethene as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form an efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer pair.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes but have rarely been used in materials science. Here, we have developed doubly methylated DAEs derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine with high thermal stability and fatigue resistance. These new photoswitches not only outperform their predecessors but also rival classical non&#8208;nucleosidic DAEs. To demonstrate the utility of these new DAEs, we have designed an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides: one strand containing a fluorogenic double&#8208;methylated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form a highly efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer (FRET) pair. The system was operated in liquid and solid phases and showed both strong distance&#8208; and orientation&#8208;dependent photochromic FRET. The superior ON/OFF contrast was maintained over up to 100 switching cycles, with no detectable fatigue.

     alt="A DNA-Based Two-Component Excitonic Switch Utilizing High-Performance Diarylethenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubly methylated diarylethenes derived from 2&#8242;-deoxyuridine are reported with high thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and fluorogenicity. With these, an all-optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides has been designed: one containing the fluorogenic diarylethene as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form an efficient conditional F&#246;rster-Resonance-Energy-Transfer pair.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes but have rarely been used in materials science. Here, we have developed doubly methylated DAEs derived from 2&#8242;-deoxyuridine with high thermal stability and fatigue resistance. These new photoswitches not only outperform their predecessors but also rival classical non-nucleosidic DAEs. To demonstrate the utility of these new DAEs, we have designed an all-optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides: one strand containing a fluorogenic double-methylated 2&#8242;-deoxyuridine as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form a highly efficient conditional F&#246;rster-Resonance-Energy-Transfer (FRET) pair.

         <title>Coordinating the Mechanisms of Action of Ferroptosis and the Photothermal Effect for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cancer theranostic nanomedicine (denoted as Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA) was designed by attentively considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and the photothermal effect to promote maximum synergy of the therapeutic effects in combination therapy. The pH/GSH&#8208;responsive therapeutic and imaging characteristics of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles in the tumor enabled safe and reliable cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Combination therapy based on different mechanisms of cell death has shown promise in tumor therapy. However, when different modalities are integrated, the maximum synergy of the therapeutic effects is often lacking in the design. Herein, we report a cancer theranostic nanomedicine formula developed by considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and the photothermal effect in combination therapy. The croconaine molecule was encapsulated as both a photothermal converter and an iron&#8208;chelating agent with BSA, thus leading to biocompatible and stable Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles (NPs). The Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA NPs in the tumor milieu showed an activated photothermal effect leading to enhanced radical formation owing to the temperature&#8208;dependent Fenton reaction kinetics, while radical formation during ferroptosis in turn prevented the heat&#8208;induced formation of heat shock proteins and thus the self&#8208;protection mechanism of cancer cells in response to heat. The activatable photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging performance of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA NPs also enabled safe and reliable cancer theranostics.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery with a Wide Operation&#8208;Temperature Range from &#8722;70 to 100&#8201;&#176;C</title>

A wide&#8208;temperature range sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB), which involves a Bi anode, a NFPP@C cathode and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte is successfully fabricated. Owing to the solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism of the Bi anode, the high Na+ diffusion coefficient of the NFPP@C cathode at low temperature and the electrolyte with a high boiling point and low freezing point, the prepared SIB can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), as one of the potential candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems, are required to tackle extreme weather conditions. However, the all&#8208;weather SIBs with a wide operation&#8208;temperature range are rarely reported. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature range SIB, which involves a carbon&#8208;coated Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na+ can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de&#8208;solvent process. Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na+ diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low&#8208;temperature behavior. Even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C, this battery still delivers 70.19&#8201;% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature of up to 100&#8201;&#176;C. These results are encouraging for the further exploration of wide&#8208;temperature range SIBs.

         <title>A Multiplexed Cell&#8208;Free Assay to Screen for Antimicrobial Peptides in Double Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microfluidic system for the cell&#8208;free production and screening of antimicrobial peptides for their membrane specificity is introduced. On the device, the peptides are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsion droplets. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The droplets can be analyzed via fluorescence microscopy of flow cytometry.







Abstract
The global surge in bacterial resistance against traditional antibiotics triggered intensive research for novel compounds, with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) identified as a promising candidate. Automated methods to systematically generate and screen AMPs according to their membrane preference, however, are still lacking. We introduce a novel microfluidic system for the simultaneous cell&#8208;free production and screening of AMPs for their membrane specificity. On our device, AMPs are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsion droplets, generated at high frequency. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different classes of co&#8208;encapsulated liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The double emulsions can be incubated and observed in a hydrodynamic trapping array or analyzed via flow cytometry. Our approach provides a valuable tool for the discovery and development of membrane&#8208;active antimicrobials.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Observation of Structural Dynamics Triggering Excimer Formation in a Perylene Bisimide Folda&#8208;dimer by Ultrafast Time&#8208;Domain Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The term &#8220;excimer&#8221;, a contraction of an excited dimer, is the most classical photoproduct in organic materials. In this work, vibrational snapshots showing ultrafast structural dynamics triggering the excimer formation and its relaxation are presented based on ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that interchromophore vibrational modes are related to perturbing the excited&#8208;state potential surface of a dimer stack.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic photovoltaic materials, an excimer state has been generally regarded as a trap state which hinders efficient excitation energy transport. But despite wide investigations of the excimer for overcoming the undesirable energy loss, the understanding of the relationship between the structure of the excimer in stacked organic compounds and its properties remains elusive. Here, we present the landscape of structural dynamics from the excimer formation to its relaxation in a co&#8208;facially stacked archetypical perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. We directly captured vibrational snapshots illustrating the ultrafast structural evolution triggering the excimer formation along the interchromophore coordinate on the complex excited&#8208;state potential surfaces and following evolution into a relaxed excimer state. Not only does this work showcase the ultrafast structural dynamics necessary for the excimer formation and control of excimer characteristics but also provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.

         <title>Highly Enhanced Aromatics Selectivity by Coupling of Chloromethane and Carbon Monoxide over H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5</title>

A reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into aromatics by coupling of CH3Cl with CO over H&#8208;zeolites is presented, which achieved 82.2&#8201;% aromatic selectivity with ca. 60&#8201;% BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity over HZSM&#8208;5. 2,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentene&#8208;1&#8208;one is detected as an intermediate generated from acetyl group and olefins resulting in a new aromatization.







Abstract
The transformation of methane into high value&#8208;added chemicals such as aromatics provides a more desired approach towards sustainable chemistry but remains a critical challenge due to the low selectivity of aromatics and poor stability. Herein, we first report a coupling reaction of CH3Cl and CO (CCTA) based on methane conversion, which achieves extremely high aromatics selectivity (82.2&#8201;%) with the selectivity of BTX up to ca. 60&#8201;% over HZSM&#8208;5. The promoting effects have been demonstrated on other zeolites especially 10&#8208;membered rings (10 MR) zeolites. Multiple characterizations show that 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentene&#8208;1&#8208;one (DMCPO) is generated from acetyl groups and olefins. Furthermore, isotopic labeling analysis confirms that CO is inserted into the DMCPO and aromatics rings. A new aromatization mechanism is proposed, including the formation of the above intermediates, which conspicuously weakens the hydrogen transfer reaction, leading to a considerable increase of aromatics selectivity and a dramatic drop in alkanes.

         <title>Finite Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional DNA Hierarchical Nanoarchitectures through Orthogonal and Directional Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing robust orthogonal and directional bonding lays the foundation for the construction of finite DNA origami superstructures with complex shapes. By employing a twelve&#8208;valence hexagonal prism DNA origami as the building block, versatile superstructures were obtained from different combinations of building blocks with appropriate valences. All of these superstructures are fully addressable and could guide the assembly of guest molecules to produce functional devices.







Abstract
Reliable orthogonal bonding with precise and flexible orientation control would be ideal for building finite complex nanostructures via self&#8208;assembly. Employing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA origami, hexagonal prism DNA origami (HDO), as building block, we demonstrate it is practical to construct finite hierarchical nanoarchitectures with complicated conformations through orthogonal and directional bonding. The as&#8208;designed HDO building block has twelve prescribed directional valences in 3D space and each of them supports two opposite orientations, yielding the capability to generate abundant directional bonding. Meanwhile, we minimize the thorny non&#8208;specific interactions among HDOs and enable the orthogonal bonding between any two valences based on self&#8208;similar designing. Consequently, various hierarchical nanostructures are prepared at will simply by the combination of HDOs with appropriate valences. We believe this route towards hierarchically assembly is inspiring and hope it will facilitate the fabrication of functional superstructures.

         <title>Quantification of the Dynamic Interface Evolution in High&#8208;Efficiency Working Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental interplay among Li dynamic loss behavior, electrolyte composition, and the structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer was quantitatively elucidated. The actual dominant form in inactive Li loss is determined by the relative growth rates of dead Li0 and SEI Li+ as the anode interface undergoes processive evolution during cycling. The mechanistic studies shed fresh light on the interfacial dynamics of the Li&#8208;metal anode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has been considered a promising anode for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the low reversibility and intricate Li loss hinder the widespread implementation of Li metal batteries. Herein, we quantitatively differentiate the dynamic evolution of inactive Li, and decipher the fundamental interplay among dynamic Li loss, electrolyte chemistry, and the structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The actual dominant form in inactive Li loss is practically determined by the relative growth rates of dead Li0 and SEI Li+ because of the persistent evolution of the Li metal interface during cycling. Distinct inactive Li evolution scenarios are disclosed by ingeniously tuning the inorganic anion&#8208;derived SEI chemistry with a low amount of film&#8208;forming additive. An optimal polymeric film enabler of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is demonstrated to derive a highly uniform multilayer SEI and decreased SEI Li+/dead Li0 growth rates, thus achieving enhanced Li cycling reversibility.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stannate(II): A Tetraamido Tin(II) Dianion and Strong Metal&#8208;Centered &#963;&#8208;Donor</title>

         <dc:description>
The macrocyclic calix[4]pyrrole enables the synthesis of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion. The compound is a very strong metal&#8208;centered &#963;&#8208;donor with a Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) value exceeding that of carbenes and electron&#8208;rich phosphines. The coordinative and nucleophilic features are demonstrated with transition metals and organic substrates.







Abstract
Anionic, metal&#8208;centered nucleophiles are emerging compounds with unique reactivities. Here, we describe the isolation and full characterization of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion, its behavior as ligand towards transition metals, and its reactivity as a tin&#8208;centered nucleophile. Experimental values such as the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) and computations attest tin&#8208;located &#963;&#8208;donor ability exceeding that of carbenes or electron&#8208;rich phosphines. Against transition metals, the stannate(II) can act as &#951;1&#8208; or &#951;5&#8208;type ligand. With aldehydes, it reacts by hydride substitution to give valuable acyl stannates. The reductive dehalogenation of iodobenzene indicates facile redox pathways mediated by halogen bond interaction. Calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) represents the first example of this macrocyclic ligand in low&#8208;valent p&#8208;block element chemistry.

         <title>Interfacial Atom&#8208;Substitution Engineered Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxide Nanofibers with High&#8208;Valence Fe for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>

An electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber was synthesized by an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to boost the activity of the NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts for efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key for scalable water electrolysis, for instance, NiFe&#8208;based materials. Decorating NiFe catalysts with other transition metals offers a new path to boost their catalytic activities but often suffers from the low controllability of the electronic structures of the NiFe catalytic centers. Here, we report an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to synthesize an electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber to boost the activity of NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The NiFeV nanofiber supported on a carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, along with long&#8208;term stability (&gt;20&#8197;h) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based OER catalysts.

The NiFeV nanofiber supported on a carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, along with long-term stability (&amp;gt;20&#8197;h) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non-noble metal-based OER catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Uptake of an Iridium Complex inside Engineered apo&#8208;Ferritin Nanocages: Study of Structure and Catalysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable hybrid bio&#8208;nanocage with selective immobilization of an iridium complex inside the self&#8208;assembly protein, ferritin has been developed. These hybrid bio&#8208;catalysts reduce substituted acetophenones into the corresponding chiral alcohols with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The effect of the mutation at the core of the ferritin nanocage (apo&#8208;rHLFr) on the uptake of IrCp* has been investigated by structural and spectroscopic methods. Site&#8208;specific mutations of two polar residues viz., Asp38 and Arg52 were investigated. The uptake of IrCp* was increased by about 1.5&#8208;fold on mutation of Arg52 by His compared to the wild&#8208;type variant, while mutation of Asp38 by His had no effect on the uptake. All the variants of the Ir&#8208;embedded ferritin cages remained as stable as the wild&#8208;type analogue. These hybrid bio&#8208;nanocages of ferritin were found to efficiently catalyze transfer hydrogenation of various substituted acetophenones forming the corresponding chiral alcohols with up to 88&#8201;% conversion and 70&#8201;% enantioselectivity. An electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent on the reactant enhanced the Turnover frequency of the reaction. Molecular docking analyses suggested that the substrate binds in different orientations at the active site in different mutants of the nanocage.

&lt;p&gt;The effect of the mutation at the core of the ferritin nanocage (apo-rHLFr) on the uptake of IrCp* has been investigated by structural and spectroscopic methods. Site-specific mutations of two polar residues viz., Asp38 and Arg52 were investigated. The uptake of IrCp* was increased by about 1.5-fold on mutation of Arg52 by His compared to the wild-type variant, while mutation of Asp38 by His had no effect on the uptake. All the variants of the Ir-embedded ferritin cages remained as stable as the wild-type analogue. These hybrid bio-nanocages of ferritin were found to efficiently catalyze transfer hydrogenation of various substituted acetophenones forming the corresponding chiral alcohols with up to 88&#8201;% conversion and 70&#8201;% enantioselectivity.

         <title>Mechanism of the Bifunctional Multiple Product Sesterterpene Synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sesterterpene synthase from Aspergillus calidoustus was characterised that produces calidoustene, a compound with a new skeleton, besides five known compounds. A deep mechanistic investigation through isotopic labelling experiments, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and DFT calculations is presented. The substrate analog 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;FPP was converted into several oxygenated terpenoids.







Abstract
The multiproduct chimeric sesterterpene synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus yielded spirocyclic calidoustene, which exhibits a novel skeleton, besides five known sesterterpenes. The complex cyclisation mechanism to all six compounds was investigated by isotopic labelling experiments in combination with DFT calculations. Chemically synthesised 8&#8208;hydroxyfarnesyl diphosphate was converted with isopentenyl diphosphate and AcAS into four oxygenated sesterterpenoids that structurally resemble cytochrome&#8197;P450 oxidation products of the sesterterpene hydrocarbons. Protein engineering of AcAS broadened the substrate scope and gave significantly improved enzyme yields.

         <title>The Role of Copper Salts and O2 in the Mechanism of C&#8801;N Bond Activation for Facilitating Nitrogen Transfer Reactions**

A detailed theoretical study on the intricate mechanism and electron transfer landscape of oxygen&#8208;assisted copper&#8208;promoted formation of aryl nitrile species starting from aryl aldehyde. In this reaction the major driving force is the redox cycle of the copper center (CuII/CuI), which acts as the electron source and sink whenever necessary along the course of reaction.







Abstract
C&#8801;N bond scission can be a potential avenue for the functionalization of chemical bonds. We have conducted a computational study, using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio multireference CASSCF methods, to unravel the intricate mechanistic pathways traversed in the copper&#8208;promoted, dioxygen&#8208;assisted reaction for the formation of aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehyde. This aryl isocyanate species acts as an active species for C&#8801;N bond cleavage of coordinated cyanide anion enabling nitrogen transfer to various aldehydes. Electronic structure analysis revealed that under all the reaction conditions radical&#8208;based pathways are operative, which is in agreement with the experimental findings. The major driving force is a CuII/I redox cycle initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer from the carbon center of the nitrile moiety. Our study reveals that the copper salts act as the &#8220;electron pool&#8221; in this unique nitrogen transfer reaction forming an aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehydes.

         <title>Dehydrated UiO&#8208;66(SH)2: The Zr&#8722;O Cluster and Its Photocatalytic Role Mimicking the Biological Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF, UiO&#8208;66(SH)2, was found to show efficient conversion of N2 into NH3 under visible light. The revealed synergetic action of the photoelectron supported by the proton was analogous to that in molybdenum nitrogenase, however, with characteristic &#956;&#8208;N&#8722;Zr type interactions inside the [Zr6O6] cluster, which sheds new light on understanding the mechanism of nitrogenase.







Abstract
This work reports the dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF UiO&#8208;66(SH)2 as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalyst to mimic the biological N2 fixation process. The 15N2 and other control experiments demonstrated that the new photocatalyst is highly efficient in converting N2 to ammonia. In&#8208;situ TGA, XPS, and EXAFS as well as first&#8208;principles simulations were used to demonstrate the role of the thermal treatment and the changes of the local structures around Zr due to the dehydration. It was shown that the dehydration opened a gate for the entry of N2 molecules into the [Zr6O6] cluster where the strong N&#8801;N bond was broken stepwise by &#956;&#8208;N&#8722;Zr type interactions driven by the photoelectrons aided by the protonation. This mechanism was discussed in comparison with the Lowe&#8211;Thorneley mechanism proposed for the MoFe nitrogenase, and with emphasis on the [Zr6O6] cluster effect and the leading role of photoelectrons over the protonation. The results shed new light on understanding the catalytic mechanism of biological N2 fixation and open a new way to fix N2 under mild conditions.

         <title>Mapping Dual&#8208;Base&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Aryl Amidations: Application in the Synthesis of 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides with 2&#8242;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones enabled the synthesis of sought&#8208;after 4&#8208;quinolones. The use of a new pre&#8208;catalyst supported by PAd2&#8208;DalPhos in combination with a DBU/NaTFA dual&#8208;base system, along with a thorough mechanistic investigation led to a successful demonstration of room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
The C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides with NH substrates employing nickel catalysts and organic amine bases represents an emergent strategy for the sustainable synthesis of (hetero)anilines. However, unlike protocols that rely on photoredox/electrochemical/reductant methods within NiI/III cycles, the reaction steps that comprise a putative Ni0/II C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling cycle for a thermally promoted catalyst system using organic amine base have not been elucidated. Here we disclose an efficient new nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides and 2&#8242;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones, for the first time where the (pseudo)halide is chloride or sulfonate, which makes use of the commercial bisphosphine ligand PAd2&#8208;DalPhos (L4) in combination with an organic amine base/halide scavenger, leading to 4&#8208;quinolones. Room&#8208;temperature stoichiometric experiments involving isolated Ni0, I, and II species support a Ni0/II pathway, where the combined action of DBU/NaTFA allows for room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed C&#8722;N cross-coupling of amides with 2&#8242;-(pseudo)halide-substituted acetophenones enabled the synthesis of sought-after 4-quinolones. The use of a new pre-catalyst supported by PAd2-DalPhos in combination with a DBU/NaTFA dual-base system, along with a thorough mechanistic investigation led to a successful demonstration of room-temperature amide cross-couplings.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Aminophosphinites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites with esters of hydroxylamines is achieved by means of the dynamic kinetic transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines. A two&#8208;electron redox process is proposed for this reaction based on mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of diarylphosphines and O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamines is developed. In the cases of symmetrical diarylphosphines, a series of aminophosphinites is prepared in high yields. In the cases of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines, an array of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites is synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivity by using a copper(I)&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;Ph&#8208;FOXAP complex as a chiral catalyst. Based on several control experiments and 31P&#8197;NMR studies, a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism involving the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines is proposed for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction. Finally, one representative P&#8208;chiral phosphoric amide generated through the oxidation with H2O2 is transformed to a chiral diarylphosphinate in high yield with retained enantioselectivity, which allows further transformations towards various P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Networks Enable Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl&#8208;Olefin Metathesis**

H&#8208;bonding network: Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can act as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor to enhance the catalytic efficiency of simple Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts in carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by stabilization of all transition states and intermediates along the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Synthetic chemists have learned to mimic nature in using hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions to dictate the spatial arrangement of reaction substrates and to stabilize transition states to enable highly efficient and selective reactions. The activation of a catalyst molecule itself by hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, in order to enhance its catalytic activity to achieve a desired reaction outcome, is less explored in organic synthesis, despite being a commonly found phenomenon in nature. Herein, we show our investigation into this underexplored area by studying the promotion of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) solvent in combination with para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA). Our experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal not only an interesting role of HFIP solvent in assisting pTSA Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, but also insightful knowledge about the current limitations of the carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction.

         <title>Electrochemical Deposition of a Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanorod Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Film with Efficient Charge and Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical film deposition of a single&#8208;crystalline polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon on electrodes, with synthetically controlled crystal structure, film thickness, and crystal orientations is reported. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both charges and excitons, with a free carrier mobility over 30&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, a low exciton binding energy of 118.5&#8197;meV, and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Electrochemical deposition has emerged as an efficient technique for preparing conjugated polymer films on electrodes. However, this method encounters difficulties in synthesizing crystalline products and controlling their orientation on electrodes. Here we report electrochemical film deposition of a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The film is composed of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods, in which the molecules adopt a cofacial stacking arrangement along the &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction. Film thickness and crystal size can be controlled by electrochemical conditions such as scan rate and electrolyte species, while the choice of anode material determines crystal orientation. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both free carriers and excitons: the free carrier mobility reaches over 30&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas the excitons are delocalized with a low binding energy of 118.5&#8197;meV and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45&#8197;nm.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene mediated by conformational switching can be tuned via controllable experimental conditions, leaving behind different largely ordered structures. Such method provides a new alternative and convenient method to influence the self&#8208;assembled structure of NHC&#8208;metal monolayers, a still missing but essential tool towards catalytic applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of cyclohexyl cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (cyCAAC) can be realized and reversibly switched from a close&#8208;packed trimer phase to a chainlike dimer phase, enabled by the ring&#8208;flip of the cyclohexyl wingtip. Multiple methods including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified a distinct isomer (axial or equatorial chair conformer) in each phase, and consequently support the conclusion regarding the determination of molecular surface geometry on the self&#8208;assembly of cyCAAC. Moreover, various substrates such as Ag (111) and Cu (111) are tested to elucidate the importance of cyCAAC&#8208;surface interactions on cyCAAC based nanopatterns. These investigations of patterned surfaces prompted a deep understanding of cyCAAC binding mode, surface geometry and reversible self&#8208;assembly, which are of paramount significance in the areas of catalysis, biosensor design and surface functionalization.

         <title>Engineering Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Oligonucleotides by Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Incorporation of Cathepsin B Sensitive Dipeptide Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide phosphoramidites were developed for automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. The enzymatic cleavage of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 by cathepsin B is efficient in the context of single&#8208;stranded DNA, but is sterically hindered by double&#8208;stranded DNA and short hairpin loops. The design of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone allows the construction of oligonucleotide&#8211;drug conjugates which release their small&#8208;molecule payload after enzymatic cleavage.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides containing cleavable linkers have emerged as versatile tools to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA. However, the limitations of previously reported cleavable linkers including photolabile and disulfide linkers have restricted their applications in vivo. Inspired by the cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide linkers in antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Adcetris, we have developed Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone phosphoramidites for the automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. Cathepsin B digests Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone linkers efficiently, enabling cleavage of oligonucleotides into two components or release of small&#8208;molecule payloads. Based on the prior success of dipeptide linkers in ADCs, we believe that these dipeptide linker phosphoramidites will promote new clinical applications of therapeutic oligonucleotides.

         <title>A Cholesterol Dimer Stabilizes the Inactivated State of an Inward&#8208;Rectifier Potassium Channel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a cholesterol dimer&#8208;inward rectifier (Kir) channel complex using solid&#8208;state NMR and simulated annealing calculations is solved. The identified cholesterol binding pocket is directly linked to the mechanism of cholesterol&#8208;mediated inactivation of Kir channels. This work is one of the most detailed structural&#8208;functional studies of cholesterol dimer&#8208;protein interactions within a biological membrane.







Abstract
Cholesterol oligomers reside in multiple membrane protein X&#8208;ray crystal structures. Yet, there is no direct link between these oligomers and a biological function. Here we present the structural and functional details of a cholesterol dimer that stabilizes the inactivated state of an inward&#8208;rectifier potassium channel KirBac1.1. K+ efflux assays confirm that high cholesterol concentration reduces K+ conductance. We then determine the structure of the cholesterol&#8208;KirBac1.1 complex using Xplor&#8208;NIH simulated annealing calculations driven by solid&#8208;state NMR distance measurements. These calculations identified an &#945;&#8211;&#945; cholesterol dimer docked to a cleft formed by adjacent subunits of the homotetrameric protein. We compare these results to coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations. This is one of the first examples of a cholesterol oligomer performing a distinct biological function and structural characterization of a conserved promiscuous lipid binding region.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Furfural in Aqueous Acetic Acid Media with Enhanced 2&#8208;Methylfuran Selectivity Using CuPd Bimetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Pd enhanced the selectivity of Cu catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran in an aqueous 0.1&#8197;M acidic acid solution. The origin of the superior performance was revealed by in&#8197;situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic measurements and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a series of CuPd catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF or FurCH3 where Fur=furyl) in aqueous 0.1&#8197;M acetic acid (pH&#8197;2.9). The highest faradaic efficiency (FE) for MF reached 75&#8201;% at &#8722;0.58&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode with an average partial current density of 4.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic experiments suggested that electrogenerated adsorbed hydrogen (Hads) was involved in the reaction and incorporation of Pd enhanced the surface coverage of Hads and optimized the adsorption pattern of furfural, leading to a higher FE for MF. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Pd incorporation reduced the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of FurCH2* to FurCH3*. Our study demonstrates that catalyst surface structure/composition plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity in ECH and provides a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for ECH of bio&#8208;derived oxygenates.

         <title>Halogen Bonding: A New Platform for Achieving Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Persistent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) was introduced into the host&#8211;guest room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system, achieving fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emission. The weak intermolecular interactions of the halogen bond are sensitive to external stimuli (heat, mechanical force and X&#8208;rays), realizing the colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli response behaviors.







Abstract
Monotonous luminescence has always been a major factor limiting the application of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Enhancing and regulating the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest is an effective strategy to achieve excellent phosphorescence performance. In this study, intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) was introduced into the host&#8211;guest RTP system. The interaction promoted intersystem crossing and stabilized the triplet excitons, thus helping to achieve strong phosphorescence emission. In addition, the weak intermolecular interaction of halogen bonding is sensitive to external stimuli such as heat, mechanical force, and X&#8208;rays. Therefore, the triplet excitons were easily quenched and colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli responsive behaviors were realized, which greatly enriched the luminescence functionality of the RTP materials. This method provides a new platform for the future design of responsive RTP materials based on weak intermolecular interactions between the host and guest molecules.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Energy&#8208;Storage Nanoagent for Continuously Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative Stress Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The siRNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;ferrocene modified persistent luminescence nanoparticle (siRNA&#8208;ApFe&#8208;PLNP) was designed as an energy&#8208;storage nanoagent to achieve continuous amplification of oxidative stress after photo&#8208;activation, eliminating the need for constant light irradiation and further avoiding the photo&#8208;induced tissue damage.







Abstract
Regulation of cellular oxidative stress plays a critical role in revealing the molecular mechanisms of cellular activities and thus is a potential strategy for tumor treatment. Optical methods have been employed for intelligent regulation of oxidative stress in tumor regions. However, long&#8208;time continuous irradiation inevitably causes damage to normal tissues. Herein, a ferrocene&#8208;containing nucleic acid&#8208;based energy&#8208;storage nanoagent was designed to achieve the continuous photo&#8208;regulation of cellular oxidative stress in the dark. Specifically, the photoenergy stored in the agent could convert effectively and accelerate Fenton&#8208;like reaction continuously, augmenting cellular oxidative stress. This nanoagent could also silence oxidative damage repair genes to further amplify oxidative stress. This strategy not only provides oxidative stress regulation for studying the molecular mechanisms of biological activities, but also offers a promising step toward tumor microenvironment modulation.

Optical methods have been employed for intelligent regulation of oxidative stress in tumor regions. However, long-time continuous irradiation inevitably causes damage to normal tissues. Herein, a ferrocene-containing nucleic acid-based energy-storage nanoagent was designed to achieve the continuous photo-regulation of cellular oxidative stress in the dark. Specifically, the photoenergy stored in the agent could convert effectively and accelerate Fenton-like reaction continuously, augmenting cellular oxidative stress. This nanoagent could also silence oxidative damage repair genes to further amplify oxidative stress. This strategy not only provides oxidative stress regulation for studying the molecular mechanisms of biological activities, but also offers a promising step toward tumor microenvironment modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rewritable Macromolecular Data Storage with Automated Read&#8208;out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rewriting of information stored on synthetic macromolecules is achieved via the introduction of an editable position tag. The automated read&#8208;out is facilitated by making use of an algorithm that is able to decode large portions of macromolecular information without interference from the operator.







Abstract
Rewriting data stored on synthetic macromolecules is an interesting feature, even though it is considered as being quite challenging within the area of digital macromolecules. In this context, we initially studied a strategy for modifying the position tag of sequence&#8208;encoded macromolecules in a reversible manner. The efficiency of this method, which relies on the orthogonal cleavage of a thioester moiety via aminolysis, was demonstrated by modifying parts of an exemplary sentence. Simultaneously, a novel algorithm was developed to ease the read&#8208;out of macromolecular information by means of MS/MS techniques. This program, Oligoreader, can identify potential information&#8208;containing macromolecules from a series of MS1 spectra, analyze the corresponding MS2 spectra, and finally decode the data. Consequently, the algorithm simplifies the entire read&#8208;out process by avoiding any interference from the operator, which increases the potential for blind sequencing of uniform macromolecules.

The excimer (a contraction of the excited&#8208;state dimer) is the most classical photoproduct which has been generally regarded as a trap site. In their Research Article (202114474), Hyungjun Kim, Frank W&#252;rthner, Dongho Kim and co&#8208;workers have captured the vibrational snapshots triggering the excimer formation and relaxation processes of the perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using the ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. Understanding the mechanism of the excimer provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.

Can we tune the physicochemical properties of free&#8208;standing organic membranes without changing the building blocks or post&#8208;synthetic modifications? The Research Article (e202200905) by Dinesh Shetty et&#8197;al. demonstrates a novel pre&#8208;synthetically controlled framework growth strategy to tune the hydrophobicity of 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework (3D&#8208;COF) membranes. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane shows potential use for the demulsification of an oil&#8211;water mixture, a significant environmental and water reuse issue.

The hydrophobic 3D-COF membrane shows potential use for the demulsification of an oil&#8211;water mixture, a significant environmental and water reuse issue.

The coupling of CH3Cl with CO over H&#8208;zeolites is an efficient reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into aromatics, which ensures the sustainable development of natural gas in an environmental pathway. In their Research Article (e202114953), Hongchao Liu, Wenliang Zhu, Zhongmin Liu, and co&#8208;workers report that high aromatics and BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity can be achieved with complete conversion of CH3Cl over HZSM&#8208;5, following a new aromatization mechanism.

Halogen bonding is an effective tool in solid&#8208;state supramolecular chemistry to stabilize crystal structures. In their Research Article (e202200236), Zhengxu Cai and co&#8208;workers introduced intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) into a host&#8212;guest room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system, achieving fluorescence&#8212;phosphorescence dual emission. The weak intermolecular interactions of the halogen bond are sensitive to external stimuli (heat, mechanical force and X&#8208;rays), realizing colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli response behavior.

         <title>Layered Biomimetic Composites from MXenes with Sequential Bridging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered nanocomposites fabricated by techniques other than layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly (e.g. vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration and blade coating) contain voids in their structure, which reduces their performance. Cheng and co&#8208;workers have now found that the problem of voids in Ti3C2Tx MXene composites can be solved by sequential bridging of MXEne platelets with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose combined with covalent bridging by borate ions.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) assembly is a widely used technique for the self&#8208;assembly of layered nanocomposites from clay sheets, carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, nanoparticles, and other materials. Other approaches for fabricating layered nanocomposites include vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration and blade coating. They are simpler than LbL assembly, but they all introduce voids into the layered structure, thereby reducing the performance of the resulting nanocomposites. A team from Beihang University evaluated the void structure in Ti3C2Tx MXene composites and found that the fundamental problem with voids can be solved by the sequential nanoscale bonding of MXEne platelets with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose combined with covalent bridging with borate ions, thereby opening a new path to self&#8208;assemble two&#8208;dimensional platelets into continuous high&#8208;performance layered nanocomposites.

         <title>Planar Chirality: A Mine for Catalysis and Structure Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the benefits of molecules exhibiting planar chirality have recently been recognized in different areas of chemistry, the shortage of available catalytic methods for generating planar chirality has precluded their use. This Minireview aims to highlight the infancy of the area and serve as a source of inspiration for the design of unconventional methods for the generation of three&#8208;dimensional complexity from accessible simple/linear molecules.







Abstract
Planar chirality is one of the most fascinating expressions of chirality, which is exploited by nature to lock three&#8208;dimensional chiral conformations and, more recently, by chemists to create new chiral reagents, catalysts, and functional organic materials. Nevertheless, the shortage of procedures able to induce and secure asymmetry during the generation of these unique chiral entities has dissuaded chemists from exploiting their structural properties. This Minireview intends to illustrate the limited but remarkable catalytic methods that have been reported for the production of planar chirality in strained molecules and serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new unconventional procedures, which are expected to appear in the near future.

         <title>Advances in the Sensing and Treatment of Wound Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wound biofilms are a challenging problem for modern medicine. Advances in the areas of sensors and reporters that can accurately detect early biofilm formation in the wound, and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offer promise for better detection and treatment. This review focuses on novel approaches to biofilm eradication and detection and compares them to conventional methods.







Abstract
Wound biofilms represent a particularly challenging problem in modern medicine. They are increasingly antibiotic resistant and can prevent the healing of chronic wounds. However, current treatment and diagnostic options are hampered by the complexity of the biofilm environment. In this review, we present new chemical avenues in biofilm sensors and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offering promise for better detection, chemical specificity, and biocompatibility. We briefly discuss existing methods for biofilm detection and focus on novel, sensor&#8208;based approaches that show promise for early, accurate detection of biofilm formation on wound sites and that can be translated to point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. We then discuss technologies inspired by new materials for efficient biofilm eradication. We focus on ultrasound&#8208;induced microbubbles and nanomaterials that can both penetrate the biofilm and simultaneously carry active antimicrobials and discuss the benefits of those approaches in comparison to conventional methods.

         <title>Significance of Receptor Mobility in Multivalent Binding on Lipid Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent membrane processes result in numerous receptors being coupled on a diffusive surface. As such, these binding mechanisms depend heavily on the intrinsic mobility on the cell membrane. The Minireview discusses the importance of mobility in multivalent binding, demonstrating that it is crucial for the deeper understanding of receptor interactions, and to guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.







Abstract
Numerous key biological processes rely on the concept of multivalency, where ligands achieve stable binding only upon engaging multiple receptors. These processes, like viral entry or immune synapse formation, occur on the diffusive cellular membrane. One crucial, yet underexplored aspect of multivalent binding is the mobility of coupled receptors. Here, we discuss the consequences of mobility in multivalent processes from four perspectives: (I)&#8197;The facilitation of receptor recruitment by the multivalent ligand due to their diffusivity prior to binding. (II)&#8197;The effects of receptor preassembly, which allows their local accumulation. (III)&#8197;The consequences of changes in mobility upon the formation of receptor/ligand complex. (IV)&#8197;The changes in the diffusivity of lipid environment surrounding engaged receptors. We demonstrate how understanding mobility is essential for fully unravelling the principles of multivalent membrane processes, leading to further development in studies on receptor interactions, and guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.

         <title>Phosphonate/Phosphine Oxide Dyad Additive for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one dyad additive combining phosphonate and phosphine oxide groups for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is demonstrated. Owing to its dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs with maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% is obtained.







Abstract
Additives play a critical role for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we report a novel phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad molecular additive (PE&#8208;TPPO), with unique dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, to boost the device efficiency of metal&#8211;halide perovskites. In addition to the defect passivation effect of the phosphine oxide group to enhance the photoluminescence intensity and homogeneity of perovskite film, the phosphonate group with strong electron affinity can capture the injected electrons to increase local carrier concentration and accelerate the carrier radiative recombination in the electroluminescence process. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs modified by this dyad additive exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 25.1&#8201;%, 100.5&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and 98.7&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies.

         <title>Binary Solvent Regulated Architecture of Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Tunable Polarization for Highly&#8208;Selective Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultra&#8208;microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with controlled open coplanar carboxyl oxygen atoms within the pores have been constructed through an adaptable binary solvent synthetic strategy. Activated HOFs with enhanced surface polarization show highly selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 based on differences of molecule polarizability.







Abstract
A binary solvent synthetic strategy is proposed for the construction of C2&#8208;symmetric molecule&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with permanent ultra&#8208;micropores and surface polarization derived from tunable coplanar open oxygen atoms. The activated HOFs BTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a and PTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a show highly selective separation of CO2/N2 with a record high ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity &gt;2000 under ambient temperature and pressure.

         <title>Gating Effects for Ion Transport in Three&#8208;Dimensional Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown ether&#8208;functionalized 3D COFs can efficiently gate ion transport with an excellent gating ratio up to 23.6 are reported, which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far.







Abstract
The development of bioinspired nano/subnano&#8208;sized (&lt;2&#8197;nm) ion channels is still considered a great challenge due to the difficulty in precisely controlling pore's internal structure and chemistry. Herein, for the first time, we report that three&#8208;dimensional functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can act as an effective nanofluidic platform for intelligent modulation of the ion transport. By strategic attachment of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 groups to the monomers as ion&#8208;driver door locks, we demonstrate that gating effects of functionalized COFs can be activated by lithium ions. The obtained materials exhibit an outstanding selective ion transmission performance with a high gating ratio (up to 23.6 for JUC&#8208;590), which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far. Furthermore, JUC&#8208;590 offers high tunability, selectivity, and recyclability of ion transport proved by the experimental and simulated studies.

3D COFs with a non&#8208;interpenetrated hea net, JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, are designed and successfully synthesized for the first time. Remarkably, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in H2 adsorption up to 305&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (or 2.72&#8197;wt%) at 77&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic polymers reported so far.







Abstract
Owing to the finite building blocks and difficulty in structural identification, it remains a tremendous challenge to elaborately design and synthesize three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with predetermined topologies. Herein, we report the first two cases of 3D COFs with the non&#8208;interpenetrated hea net, termed JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, by using the combination of tetrahedral and triangular prism building units. Due to the presence of triptycene functional groups and fluorine atoms, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in the H2 adsorption up to 305&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (or 2.72&#8197;wt%) at 77&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic materials reported so far. Furthermore, the strong interaction between H2 and COF materials is verified through the DFT theoretical calculations. This work represents a captivating example of rational design of functional COFs based on a reticular chemistry guide and demonstrates its promising application in clean energy storage.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Tamsulosin Utilizing Sequential Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a multistep continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, three C&#8722;N bond formation/cleavage reactions with hydrogen gas over heterogeneous catalysts enabled the efficient construction of the key skeleton. Two different polysilane&#8208;modified Pd catalysts were developed for these transformations, which were followed by a deprotection step under homogeneous catalysis to provide tamsulosin in 60&#8201;% overall yield in a flow stream.







Abstract
We describe the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, a blockbuster therapeutic drug employed for dysuria associated with urinary stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia, by utilizing sequential heterogeneous catalysis. Two heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for the synthesis, and the key step involves reductive amination of nitriles using dimethylpolysilane&#8208;modified Pd on activated carbon/calcium phosphate. Overall, (R)&#8208;tamsulosin was obtained in 60&#8201;% yield and 64&#8201;% ee (99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization) in a flow stream through four catalytic transformations without the need for the isolation or purification of any intermediates or byproduct.

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control over Multicolor Molecular Emission by Temporal Chemical Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor molecular emission is controlled in a dynamic timing manner by introducing a temporal chemical lock. The temporal life&#8208;time of the systems can be encoded by molecularly engineering the structural information.







Abstract
Dynamic control over molecular emission, especially in a time&#8208;dependent manner, holds great promise for the development of smart luminescent materials. Here we report a series of dynamic multicolor fluorescent systems based on the time&#8208;encoded locking and unlocking of individual vibrational emissive units. The intramolecular cyclization reaction driven by adding chemical fuel acts as a chemical lock to decrease the conformational freedom of the emissive units, thus varying the fluorescence wavelength, while the resulting chemically locked state can be automatically unlocked by the hydrolysis reaction with water molecules. The dynamic molecular system can be driven by adding chemical fuels for multiple times. The emission wavelength and lifetime of the locking states can be readily controlled by elaborating the molecular structures, indicating this strategy as a robust and versatile way to modulate multi&#8208;color molecular emission in a time&#8208;encoded manner.

         <title>Genetic Encoding of Cyanopyridylalanine for In&#8208;Cell Protein Macrocyclization by the Nitrile&#8211;Aminothiol Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic encoded cyanopyridylalanines are presented as convenient and highly selective reactive groups for in vivo functionalization, cyclization and stapling of polypeptides. The non&#8208;toxic compounds can be genetically incorporated into proteins with high yields and their biocompatible reaction with amino&#8208;thiol moieties proceeds under physiological conditions to near completion without requiring a catalyst.







Abstract
Cyanopyridylalanines are non&#8208;canonical amino acids that react with aminothiol compounds under physiological conditions in a biocompatible manner without requiring added catalyst. Here we present newly developed aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for genetic encoding of meta&#8208; and para&#8208;cyanopyridylalanine to enable the site&#8208;specific attachment of a wide range of different functionalities. The outstanding utility of the cyanopyridine moiety is demonstrated by examples of i) post&#8208;translational functionalization of proteins, ii)&#8197;in&#8208;cell macrocyclization of peptides and proteins, and iii)&#8197;protein stapling. The biocompatible nature of the protein ligation chemistry enabled by the cyanopyridylalanine amino acid opens a new path to specific in vivo protein modifications in complex biological environments.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Indolenine and Indoline Ring Systems by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes was developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. A stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement was achieved to afford diverse indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
Dearomatized indole derivatives bearing a C3&#8208; or C2&#8208;stereocenter exist ubiquitously in natural products and biologically active molecules. Despite remarkable advances in their synthesis, stereoselective and regio&#8208;divergent methods are still in a high demand. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes has been developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement of these indoline derivatives under acidic conditions afforded indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter, where the migrating group could be controlled by the reaction sequence. The asymmetric spiroannulation together with the subsequent aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement enabled a divergent access to dearomatized indole derivatives with either a C3&#8208; or a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.

         <title>A Facile and Unprecedented Route to a Library of Thermostable Formaldehyde&#8208;Derived Polyesters: Highly Active and Selective Copolymerization of Cyclic Acetals and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>

This work discloses the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 cyclic anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters that can flow at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The development of new strategies for producing polyesters can expand the category of biodegradable materials. Here, we disclose the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals (made from formaldehyde and diols) and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters. At a wide range of reaction temperatures (25 to 140&#8201;&#176;C), diverse metal&#8208;free Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids are highly active catalysts for these copolymerizations via the cationic mechanism. Of interest, kinetic studies indicate that the copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides shifts the chemical equilibrium of &#8220;cyclic acetals &#8652; polyacetals&#8221; to the left, thus yielding polyesters with up to &gt;99&#8201;% alternating degree. The obtained polyesters possess high oxygen content ([O]&#8201;:&#8201;[C] up to 6&#8201;:&#8201;7), molecular weights of 2.0&#8211;33.3&#8197;kDa, narrow polydispersities of 1.2&#8211;1.5, low glass transition temperatures (&#8722;64 to &#8722;27&#8201;&#176;C), as well as high decomposition temperatures (275 to 324&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Pore&#8208;Space Partition and Charge Distribution in Multi&#8208;Modular Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge shifting via pore partition: A nine&#8208;nitrogen ligand simultaneously enables pore&#8208;space partition (via three N's) and charge reallocation (via six N's), thereby paving the way for multi&#8208;modular assembly of a huge family of tunable anionic porous materials with much enhanced chemical stability and selective gas and vapor sorption.







Abstract
We report here a strategy for making anionic pacs type porous materials by combining pore space partition with charge reallocation. The method uses the first negatively charged pore partition ligand (2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene, H&#8208;tph) that simultaneously enables pore partition and charge reallocation. Over two dozen anionic pacs materials have been made to demonstrate their excellent chemical stability and a high degree of tunability. Notably, Ni3&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph (bdt=1,4&#8208;benzeneditetrazolate) exhibits month&#8208;long water stability, while CoV&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph sets a new benchmark for C2H2 storage capacity under ambient conditions for ionic MOFs. In addition to tunable in&#8208;framework modules, we show feasibility to tune the type and concentration of extra&#8208;framework counter cations and their influence on both stability and capability to separate industrial C3H8/C3H6 and C6H6/C6H12 mixtures.

         <title>Preparation of Primary and Secondary Dialkylmagnesiums by a Radical I/Mg&#8208;Exchange Reaction Using sBu2Mg in Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary and secondary dialkylmagnesium reagents were prepared in toluene by the reaction of sBu2Mg with alkyl iodides (25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8211;4&#8197;h). Stereoconvergent I/Mg&#8208;exchanges were observed for secondary cyclohexyl iodides leading after quenching reactions to products with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, including homo&#8208;aldol products. Mechanistic studies confirmed radical pathways for these exchanges.







Abstract
The treatment of primary or secondary alkyl iodides with sBu2Mg in toluene (25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8211;4&#8197;h) provided dialkylmagnesiums that underwent various reactions with aldehydes, ketones, acid chlorides or allylic bromides. 3&#8208;Substituted secondary cyclohexyl iodides led to all&#8208;cis&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexylmagnesium reagents under these exchange conditions in a highly stereoconvergent manner. Enantiomerically enriched 3&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;substituted secondary alkyl iodides gave after an exchange reaction with sBu2Mg stereodefined dialkylmagnesiums that after quenching with various electrophiles furnished various 1,3&#8208;stereodefined products including homo&#8208;aldol products (99&#8201;% dr and 98&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies confirmed a radical pathway for these new iodine/magnesium&#8208;exchange reactions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Reductive Dimerization of Terminal Alkynes to 2,3&#8208;Dibranched Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a combination of pivalic acid and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid proved successful in favoring the selective highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes over the competitive head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization pathway. The target reaction, proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate, presents a facile and straightforward approach for accessing 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes is described for the first time. Aromatic terminal alkynes bearing diverse and sensitive functional groups as well as aliphatic terminal alkynes are efficiently transformed to 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes. The key to achieve a selective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is to control appropriately the acidity of the reaction solution, which is accomplished by a combined use of pivalic acid and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. The tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate under acidic conditions.

An unprecedented system of gold and oxidative NHC relay catalysis was developed, which enables highly enantioselective cascade annulation between readily available &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ynones with enals to afford pyrrole&#8208;fused lactones in high yield and excellent level of enantioselectivity. The lactone products could be readily converted to diverse densely functionalized pyrroles and pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in high yields and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented gold and oxidative NHC relay catalysis that enables highly enantioselective cascade annulation between readily available &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ynones with enals. This method utilizes the in situ&#8208;generated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as a novel and versatile synthon, which engage with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazolium intermediates generated from enals by oxidative NHC catalysis to produce pyrrole&#8208;fused lactones in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity. Synthetic utility of the lactone products is also demonstrated by facile conversion to densely functionalized pyrroles and pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in high yields with excellent stereopurity.

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel with efficient atmospheric water harvesting is developed based on anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel could achieve 0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 water vapor sorption within 120&#8197;minutes at 30&#8201;% relative humidity and produce 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. This tactful designed polyzwitterionic hydrogel provides new insight on how to fabricate efficient atmospheric water harvesting materials.







Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is regarded as one of the promising strategies for freshwater production desirable to provide sustainable water for landlocked and arid regions. Hygroscopic materials have attracted widespread attention because of their water harvesting performance. However, the introduction of many inorganic salts often leads to aggregation and leakage issues in practical use. Here, polyzwitterionic hydrogels are developed as an effective AWH material platform. Via anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, the hygroscopic salt coordinated with polymer chains could capture moisture and enhance the swelling property, leading to a strong moisture sorption capacity. The hydrogel shows superior AWH performance (0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, 120&#8197;minutes for equilibrium at 30&#8201;% relative humidity) and produces 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. It is anticipated that the polyzwitterionic hydrogels with unique salt&#8208;responsive properties could provide new insights into the design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation AWH materials.

The as-prepared hydrogel could achieve 0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; water vapor sorption within 120&#8197;minutes at 30&#8201;% relative humidity and produce 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; freshwater per day. This tactful designed polyzwitterionic hydrogel provides new insight on how to fabricate efficient atmospheric water harvesting materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is regarded as one of the promising strategies for freshwater production desirable to provide sustainable water for landlocked and arid regions. Hygroscopic materials have attracted widespread attention because of their water harvesting performance. However, the introduction of many inorganic salts often leads to aggregation and leakage issues in practical use. Here, polyzwitterionic hydrogels are developed as an effective AWH material platform. Via anti-polyelectrolyte effects, the hygroscopic salt coordinated with polymer chains could capture moisture and enhance the swelling property, leading to a strong moisture sorption capacity. The hydrogel shows superior AWH performance (0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 120&#8197;minutes for equilibrium at 30&#8201;% relative humidity) and produces 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; freshwater per day. It is anticipated that the polyzwitterionic hydrogels with unique salt-responsive properties could provide new insights into the design and synthesis of next-generation AWH materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Facile Potential Hold Method for Fostering an Inorganic Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile potential hold process fosters the growth of a more inorganic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Owing to the various decomposition potentials of the Li&#8208;solvation structures, salt anion&#8208;derived SEI was preferentially established on the current collector while reducing the components from organic solvents.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium batteries are regarded as an ultimate form of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, irreversible lithium loss during cycling plays a major role in degrading the overall cell performance in the anode&#8208;free configuration. To alleviate the deterioration, building a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interface on an anode current collector is an indispensable requirement. Here, we present a facile in&#8208;situ electrochemical method of a potential hold during the first charge to guide more salt&#8208;derived (less solvent&#8208;derived) decomposition on the anode interface. We show the distinctive decomposition potential of lithium salts and ether/carbonate solvents, where the Li&#8208;solvation structures with salt contact&#8208;ion&#8208;pairs preferentially decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich and less organic components, leading to enhanced lithium Coulombic efficiency in Li||Cu cells as well as mitigating the capacity fade of Cu||LiFePO4 and Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells.

         <title>Anchoring Ionic Liquid in Copper Electrocatalyst for Improving CO2 Conversion to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic liquid 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium nitrate (BmimNO3) was anchored into Cu, through which the atomic coordination and electronic properties of Cu can be optimized to facilitate C&#8722;C coupling. This electrocatalyst can reduce CO2 to C2H4 with high selectivity. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 reaches 77.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.49&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in KHCO3 aqueous solution using a H&#8208;type cell, much higher than that over pure Cu catalyst (31.2&#8201;%).







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels is appealing for CO2 fixation and energy storage. The Cu&#8208;based catalysts feature unique superiorities, but achieving high ethylene selectivity is still restricted. In this study, we propose the anchoring of an ionic liquid (IL) on a Cu electrocatalyst for improving the electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene. In a water&#8208;based electrolyte and a commonly used H&#8208;type cell, a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 77.3&#8201;% was achieved at &#8722;1.49&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that an IL can modify the electronic structure of a Cu catalyst through its interaction with Cu, making it more conducive to *CO dimerization for ethylene formation.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Uranyl&#8208;Imprinted Nanocage for Selective Uranium Recovery from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adsorbent was fabricated by the in&#8197;situ construction of a uranyl&#8208;imprinted nanostructure in a MOF material. Impressively, the adsorbent shows highly selective uranium extraction ability in natural seawater, which was attributed to the fitting coordination structure for uranyl.







Abstract
An adaptive coordination structure is vital for selective uranium extraction from seawater. By strategy of molecular imprinting, uranyl is introduced into a multivariate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) during the synthesis process to guide the in situ construction of proper nanocage structure for targeting uranyl binding. Except for the coordination between uranium with four oxygen from the materials, the axial oxygen of uranyl also forms hydrogen bonds with hydrogen from the phenolic hydroxyl group, which enhances the binding affinity of the material to uranyl. Attributing to the high binding affinity, the adsorbent shows high uranium binding selectivity to uranyl against not only the interfering metal ions, but also the carbonate group that coordinates with uranyl to form [UO2(CO)3]4&#8722; in seawater. In natural seawater, the adsorbent realizes a high uranium adsorption capacity of 7.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, together with an 18.38 times higher selectivity to vanadium.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Activated Ester&#8208;Amine Reaction for Enantioselective Multi&#8208;Channel Visual Detection of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral recognition is of pivotal importance not only in living systems but also in estimating the optical purity of enantiomeric drugs and fabricating advanced materials. Herein we report a novel self&#8208;reporting activated ester&#8208;amine reaction that can provide multi&#8208;channel visual detection of organic amines. It relies on the reaction extent dependent  cis&#8208;transoid  to  cis&#8208;cisoid  helical transition of polyphenylacetylene backbone and thus triggered fluorescence. Owing to the high selectivity, this visual process can recognize structurally diverse achiral amines and quantitatively checkout the impurity content. Moreover, it also exhibits an outstanding enantioselectivity towards various chiral amines and can be applied to determine enantiomeric composition. The multiple responses in absorption, circular dichromism, photoluminescence, and circularly polarized luminescence make the helical transition of polymer backbone potential as a novel detection mode for high throughput screening of chiral chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Estimating Phosphorescent Emission Energies in IrIII Complexes Using Large&#8208;Scale Quantum Computing Simulations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) quantum method was used to calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in phosphorescent IrIII complexes. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 logical qubits. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals studied, setting an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.







Abstract
Here we calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in nine phosphorescent iridium complexes using the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method to determine if quantum simulations have any advantages over classical methods. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 fully&#8208;connected logical qubits. Since such devices do not yet exist, we demonstrate the iQCC method using a purpose&#8208;built quantum simulator on classical hardware. The results are compared to a selection of common DFT functionals, ab initio methods, and empirical data. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals, but with a better correlation coefficient, demonstrating that it is better at predicting the structure&#8211;property relationship. Results indicate that the iQCC method has the required accuracy to design organometallic complexes when deployed on emerging quantum hardware and sets an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Promoted ZnMe/ZnPh Exchange in Eight&#8208;Coordinate [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of the 8&#8208;coordinate RuZn4 heterobimetallic complex [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2] with ZnPh2 leads to complete ZnMe/ZnPh exchange to form [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2]. Both species exhibit equilibria in solution with their alternative 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers and DFT calculations define facile isomerisation and hydride&#8208;assisted ZnMe/ZnPh exchange pathways.







Abstract
The syntheses, reactivity and electronic structure analyses of [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2], 1&#8201;a, and [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2], 2&#8201;b, are reported. 1&#8201;a exhibits an 8&#8208;coordinate Ru centre with axial phosphines and a symmetrical (2&#8201;:&#8201;2) arrangement of ZnMe ligands in the equatorial plane. The ZnMe ligands in 1&#8201;a undergo facile, sequential exchange with ZnPh2 to give 2&#8201;b, which shows a 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 arrangement of ZnPh ligands. Both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b exist in equilibrium with their respective 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers. Mechanisms for ZnMe/ZnPh exchange and isomerisation are proposed using DFT calculations. The relationships of these {Ru(ZnR)4H2} species to isoelectronic Group 8 transition metal polyhydrides and related Schlenk equilibria in the Negishi reaction are discussed.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Alkyl (Hetero)Aryl Ketones by an&#160;Engineered Amine Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct asymmetric reductive amination of heteroaryl ketones has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here we report the engineering of an amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) from  Jeotgalicoccus aerolatus  for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl primary amines in excellent conversions (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The best AmDH variant (  Ja  &#8208;AmDH&#8208;M3  3  ) exhibited high activity and specificity toward alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones, even for those bearing a bulky alkyl chain. An efficient directed evolution approach based on molecular docking was implemented to enlarge the active pocket with a more hydrophobic entrance, which is responsible for the high activity. The&#160;  Ja  &#8208;AmDH&#8208;M3  3  &#160;was also used for preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant amines and a key intermediate of chiral pincer ligands, which highlighted its practical application in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalised Cofactor Mimics for Interactome Discovery and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cofactors are required for almost half of all enzyme reactions, but their functions and binding partners are not fully understood even after decades of research. Functionalised cofactor mimics which bind in place of the unmodified cofactor can provide answers, as well as expand the scope of cofactor activity. Through chemical proteomics approaches such as activity&#8208;based protein profiling, the interactome and localisation of the native cofactor in its physiological environment can be unravelled and previously uncharacterised proteins annotated. Furthermore, cofactors which supply functional groups to substrate biomolecules can be hijacked by mimics to site&#8208;specifically label targets and unravel the complex biology of post&#8208;translational protein modification. The diverse activity of cofactors has inspired the design of mimics for use as inhibitors, antibiotic therapeutics and chemo&#8208; and biosensors, and cofactor conjugates have enabled the generation of novel enzymes and artificial DNAzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoionic Imines (MIIs): Strong Donors and Versatile Ligands for Transition Metals and Main Group Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and the reactivity of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine type mesoionic imines (MIIs). The MIIs are accessible by a base&#8208;mediated cycloaddition between a substituted acetonitrile and an aromatic azide, methylation by established routes and subsequent deprotonation. C=O&#8208;stretching frequencies in MII&#8208;CO2 and Rh(CO)2Cl complexes were used to determine the overall donor strength. The MIIs are stronger donors than the N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs). MIIs are excellent ligands for main group elements and transition metals in which they display substituent&#8208;induced fluorine&#8208;specific interactions and undergo C&#8208;H activation. DFT calculations gave insights into the frontier orbitals of the MIIs. The calculations predict a relatively small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap compared to other related ligands. MIIs are potentially able to act as both &#960;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ligands. This report highlights the potential of MIIs to display exciting properties with a huge potential for future development.</dc:description>

The MIIs are accessible by a base-mediated cycloaddition between a substituted acetonitrile and an aromatic azide, methylation by established routes and subsequent deprotonation. C=O-stretching frequencies in MII-CO2 and Rh(CO)2Cl complexes were used to determine the overall donor strength. The MIIs are stronger donors than the N-heterocyclic imines (NHIs). MIIs are excellent ligands for main group elements and transition metals in which they display substituent-induced fluorine-specific interactions and undergo C-H activation. DFT calculations gave insights into the frontier orbitals of the MIIs. The calculations predict a relatively small HOMO-LUMO gap compared to other related ligands. MIIs are potentially able to act as both &#960;-donor and &#960;-acceptor ligands. This report highlights the potential of MIIs to display exciting properties with a huge potential for future development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vitro Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor Verifies the Proposed Biosynthetic Precursors</title>

         <dc:description>In the FeGP cofactor of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, low&#8208;spin Fe(II) is in complex with two CO ligands and a pyridinol derivative; the latter ligates the iron with a 6&#8208;acylmethyl substituent and the pyridinol nitrogen. A guanylylpyridinol derivative, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (  3  ), is produced by the decomposition of the FeGP cofactor under irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light and is also postulated to be a precursor of FeGP cofactor biosynthesis. HcgC and HcgB catalyze consecutive biosynthesis steps leading to  3  . Here, we report an  in vitro  biosynthesis assay of the FeGP cofactor using the cell extract of the &#916;  hcgB  &#916;  hcgC  strain of  Methanococcus maripaludis  , which does not biosynthesize  3  . We chemically synthesized pyridinol precursors  1  and  2  , and detected the production of the FeGP cofactor from  1  ,  2  and  3  . These results indicated that  1  ,  2  and  3  are the precursors of the FeGP cofactor, and the carboxy group of  3  is converted to the acyl ligand. (992 &lt; 1000 characters).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Borepin, a 7&#8208;membered boron&#8208;containing heterocycle, has become an emerging molecular platform for the development of new materials and optoelectronics. While neutral borepins are wellestablished, reduced borepin species have remained elusive. Herein we report the first isolable, crystalline borepin radicals (  2a  ,  2b  ) and anions (  3a  ,  3b  ), which have been synthesized by potassium graphite (KC  8  ) reduction of dibenzo[b,d]borepin in the presence of free cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene. Borepin radicals and anions have been characterized by EPR or NMR, elemental analysis, X&#8208;ray crystallography and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the bonding features have been investigated computationally using density functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Fe(III) and Fe(IV) Cyanide Complexes Using Hypervalent Iodine&#160;Reagents as Cyano&#8208;Transfer One&#8208;Electron Oxidants</title>

         <dc:description>We disclose a new reactivity mode for electrophilic cyano  &#160;  &#160;  l  3  &#8208;iodanes as group transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants to synthesize Fe  III  and Fe  IV  cyanide complexes. The inherent thermal instability of high&#8208;valent Fe  IV  compounds without  pi  &#8208;donor ligands (such as oxido (O  2&#8208;  ), imido (RN  2&#8208;  ) or nitrido (N  3&#8208;  )) makes their isolation and structural characterization a very challenging task. We report the synthesis of an Fe  IV  cyanide complex [(N  3  N&#8217;)FeCN] (  4  ) by two consecutive single electron transfer (SET) processes from Fe  II  precursor [(N  3  N&#8217;)FeLi(THF)] (  1  ) with cyanobenziodoxolone (CBX). The Fe  IV  complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N  3  N&#8217;)Fe  III  ] (  3  ) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of Fe  II  with 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(1H)&#8208;1,2benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of Fe  III  cyanide complex [(N  3  N&#8217;)Fe  III  (CN)(Li)(THF)  3  ] (  2&#8208;Li  THF  ).

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Mammalian Cells by 19F NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate protein behavior in physiologically relevant environments. Although proven valuable for disordered proteins, we show that in commonly used&#160;  1  H&#8208;  15  N HSQC spectra of globular proteins,&#160; interactions with cellular components often broaden resonances beyond detection. This contrasts&#160;  19  F spectra in mammalian cells, in which signals are readily observed. Using several proteins, we demonstrate that surface charges and interaction with cellular binding partners modulate linewidths and resonance frequencies. Importantly, we establish that&#160;  19  Fparamagnetic relaxation enhancements using stable, rigid Ln(III) chelate pendants, attached via non&#8208;reducible thioether bonds, provide an effective means to obtain accurate distances for assessing protein conformations in the cellular milieu.</dc:description>

         <title>Micromechanically&#8208;Powered Rolling Locomotion of Twisted&#8208;Crystal Optical&#8208;Waveguide&#8208;Cavity as a Mobile Light Polarization Rotor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micromechanically&#8208;powered optical polarization rotors have immense potential in robotic sensors, optoelectronics and photonics. Here, we demonstrate precise mechanical rolling locomotion of twisted microcrystal optical waveguide on the substrate displaying a linear&#8208;polarization rotation of the output signal. Self&#8208;assembly of (  E  )&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;(((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenol produces several naturally twisted microcrystals. The twisted crystals exhibit varying pitch lengths because of strain between several intergrowing, orientationally mismatched nanocrystalline fibres along the [100] direction. The mechanical rolling motion of crystals is due to their twisted morphologies. The crystals are also flexible perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Micromechanically-powered optical polarization rotors have immense potential in robotic sensors, optoelectronics and photonics. Here, we demonstrate precise mechanical rolling locomotion of twisted microcrystal optical waveguide on the substrate displaying a linear-polarization rotation of the output signal. Self-assembly of (  E  )-2-bromo-6-(((4-methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)-4-nitrophenol produces several naturally twisted microcrystals. The twisted crystals exhibit varying pitch lengths because of strain between several intergrowing, orientationally mismatched nanocrystalline fibres along the [100] direction. The mechanical rolling motion of crystals is due to their twisted morphologies. The crystals are also flexible perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, C-H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, N-H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and C-H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions. The twisted crystals in their straight and bent geometries self-guide fluorescence along their long-twisted body axes with low loss. Depending upon the degree of mechanical rolling locomotion, the crystal waveguide cavity correspondingly rotates the polarization of output optical modes. The presented, first of its kind, mechanically rollable twisted-crystal with a combination of locomotive and photonic attributes unfolds the new dimension in the field of mechanophotonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Redox Looping of a Rhodium/ CexWO3 Photocatalyst for Highly Active and Robust Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has provided an effective avenue to convert two greenhouse gases, CH  4  and CO  2  , into syngas. Here, we design a DRM photocatalyst Rh/Ce  x  WO  3  that invokes both photothermal and photoelectric processes, which overcomes the thermodynamic limitation of DRM under conventional conditions. In contrast to plasmonic or UV&#8208;response photocatalysts, our photocatalyst produces a superior light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 4.65% with a moderate light intensity. We propose that a light&#8208;induced Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal charge transfer plays a crucial role in the DRM reaction, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species to lower the activation energy. Quantum mechanical studies reveal that a high oxygen mobility of Ce  x  WO  3  , accompanied with the formation of oxo&#8208;bridge species, results in a substantial elimination of deposited C species during the reaction. Our catalyst design strategy could offer a promising energy&#8208;efficient industrial process for DRM.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Symmetry Breaking of Monoacylated Anhydroerythritols and meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols through Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols and acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols with a cis configuration revealed that four compounds crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. All compounds racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals of 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
We developed a chiral symmetry breaking method for monoacylated meso diols. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols, meso cyclic diols with a cis configuration, revealed that the O&#8208;(p&#8208;anisoyl) derivative crystallized as a racemic conglomerate of the P212121 crystal system. It was confirmed that the substrate racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Evaporating the solvent gradually from the solution or Viedma ripening to promote crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals. These results provide the first successful example of asymmetric expression and amplification by deracemization of sugar derivatives without an external chemical chiral source. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols. Three O&#8208;monoacylated substrates were successfully deracemized to 99&#8201;% ee by Viedma ripening. We also developed asymmetric desymmetrization of meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols by combining acylation and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>NIRII&#8208;HDs: A Versatile Platform for Developing Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorogenic Probes for Reliable In Vivo Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;HD&#8208;like dyes (NIRII&#8208;HDs) with bright and stable NIR&#8208;II emission together with proper pKa is reported. By decorating the tunable hydroxyl group, the novel NIR&#8208;II dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 can serve as an effective platform to design various activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for reliable in vivo bioimaging with high contrast.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) activatable fluorescent probes can potentially provide a high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep tissue penetration. However, most of the reported NIR&#8208;II activatable small&#8208;molecule probes exhibit poor versatility owing to the lack of a general and stable optically tunable group. In this study, we designed NIRII&#8208;HDs, a novel dye scaffold optimized for NIR&#8208;II probe development. In particular, dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 showed the best optical properties such as proper pKa value, excellent stability, and high NIR&#8208;II brightness, which can be beneficial for in vivo imaging with high contrast. To demonstrate the applicability of the NIRII&#8208;HD5 dye, we designed three target&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for ROS, thiols, and enzymes. Using these novel probes, we not only realized reliable NIR&#8208;II imaging of different diseases in mouse models but also evaluated the redox potential of liver tissue during a liver injury in vivo with high fidelity.

         <title>Environmentally Benign Biosynthesis of Hierarchical MOF/Bacterial Cellulose Composite Sponge for Nerve Agent Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthesized MOF&#8208;based sponge composite materials feature hierarchical pores and tunable MOF loading. They can be used for efficient nerve agent simulant catalytic hydrolysis and toxic nerve agent capture.







Abstract
The fabrication of MOF polymer composite materials enables the practical applications of MOF&#8208;based technology, in particular for protective suits and masks. However, traditional production methods typically require organic solvent for processing which leads to environmental pollution, low&#8208;loading efficiency, poor accessibility, and loss of functionality due to poor solvent resistance properties. For the first time, we have developed a microbial synthesis strategy to prepare a MOF/bacterial cellulose nanofiber composite sponge. The prepared sponge exhibited a hierarchically porous structure, high MOF loading (up to &#8776;90&#8201;%), good solvent resistance, and high catalytic activity for the liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state hydrolysis of nerve agent simulants. Moreover, the MOF/ bacterial cellulose composite sponge reported here showed a nearly 8&#8208;fold enhancement in the protection against an ultra&#8208;toxic nerve agent (GD) in permeability studies as compared to a commercialized adsorptive carbon cloth. The results shown here present an essential step toward the practical application of MOF&#8208;based protective gear against nerve agents.

         <title>Cystine Knot Peptides with Tuneable Activity and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Separate approaches for tuning the activity of cystine knot peptides are reported. Protease inhibitors were designed that had light&#8208;controlled activity and could be switched ON against new targets, or had an affinity tag that allowed inhibitors to be switched OFF. These peptides enabled modulation of target activity with exquisite temporal control.







Abstract
Knottins are topologically complex peptides that are stabilised by a cystine knot and have exceptionally diverse functions, including protease inhibition. However, approaches for tuning their activity in situ are limited. Here, we demonstrate separate approaches for tuning the activity of knottin protease inhibitors using light or streptavidin. We show that the inhibitory activity and selectivity of an engineered knottin can be controlled with light by activating a second mode of action that switches the inhibitor ON against new targets. Guided by a knottin library screen, we also identify a position in the inhibitor's binding loop that permits insertion of a biotin tag without impairing activity. Using streptavidin, biotinylated knottins with nanomolar affinity can be switched OFF in activity assays, and the anticoagulant activity of a factor XIIa inhibitor can be rapidly switched OFF in human plasma. Our findings expand the scope of engineered knottins for precisely controlling protein function.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knottins are topologically complex peptides that are stabilised by a cystine knot and have exceptionally diverse functions, including protease inhibition. However, approaches for tuning their activity in situ are limited. Here, we demonstrate separate approaches for tuning the activity of knottin protease inhibitors using light or streptavidin. We show that the inhibitory activity and selectivity of an engineered knottin can be controlled with light by activating a second mode of action that switches the inhibitor ON against new targets. Guided by a knottin library screen, we also identify a position in the inhibitor's binding loop that permits insertion of a biotin tag without impairing activity. Using streptavidin, biotinylated knottins with nanomolar affinity can be switched OFF in activity assays, and the anticoagulant activity of a factor XIIa inhibitor can be rapidly switched OFF in human plasma. Our findings expand the scope of engineered knottins for precisely controlling protein function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides Catalyzed by a Single H&#8208;Bond Donor Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple prolinamide bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor urea function catalyzes the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction between tryptamines and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses.







Abstract
The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction (PSR) with aldehydes is well known. However, PSR involving ketones as electrophilic partners is far&#8208;less developed. We report herein the first examples of catalytic enantioselective PSR of tryptamines with &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. A new class of easily accessible prolyl&#8208;urea organocatalysts bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor function catalyzes the title reaction to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic isotope effect using C2&#8208;deuterium&#8208;labelled tryptamine indicates that the rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208; and the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

         <title>A Rational Biphasic Tailoring Strategy Enabling High&#8208;Performance Layered Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational biphasic tailoring strategy to prepare layered composite cathodes with the desired phase ratio is proposed. Benefiting from the reversible phase transition within transition metal slabs and the decreased structure strain at the phase boundary of the intergrowth structure during Na extraction and insertion, the Com&#8208;NaNMFT composite material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes usually exhibit high compositional diversity, thus providing controllable electrochemical performance for Na&#8208;ion batteries. These abundant components lead to complicated structural chemistry, closely affecting the stacking preference, phase transition and Na+ kinetics. With this perspective, we explore the thermodynamically stable phase diagram of various P2/O3 composites based on a rational biphasic tailoring strategy. Then a specific P2/O3 composite is investigated and compared with its monophasic counterparts. A highly reversible structural evolution of P2/O3&#8211;P2/O3/P3&#8211;P2/P3&#8211;P2/Z/O3&#8242;&#8211;Z/O3&#8242; based on the Ni2+/Ni3.5+, Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3.8+/Mn4+ redox couples upon sequential Na extraction/insertion is revealed. The reduced structural strain at the phase boundary alleviates the phase transition and decreases the lattice mismatch during cycling, endowing the biphasic electrode a large reversible capacity of 144&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with the energy density approaching 514&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Structurally Disordered RuO2 Nanosheets with Rich Oxygen Vacancies for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural disorder enhanced catalytic performance is demonstrated for carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets. The improved activity is ascribed to the disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies, which can modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus resulting in a low endothermic potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) and a high efficiency.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate pollutants to ammonia has emerged as an attractive alternative for ammonia synthesis. Currently, many strategies have been developed for enhancing nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) efficiency, but the influence of the degree of structural disorder is still unexplored. Here, carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets with adjustable crystallinity are synthesized by a facile molten salt method. The as&#8208;synthesized amorphous RuO2 displays high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (97.46&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.42&#8201;%), greatly outperforming the crystalline counterparts. The disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies is revealed to modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus lowering the energy of the potential&#8208;determining step (NH2*&#8594;NH3*).

         <title>A Self&#8208;Serviced&#8208;Track 3D DNA Walker for Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Exosomes by Glycoprotein Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting target exosomes (Exos) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track: A self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free and highly sensitive detection of tumor Exos is constructed using split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous walking powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly. This STDW allows the direct detection of tumor Exos in serum and clinical samples.







Abstract
Sensitive and accurate analysis of low&#8208;concentration of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (Exos) in biofluids is essential for noninvasive cancer diagnosis but is still challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;sensitive methods with low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;operation. Herein, exploiting target Exos as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track for the first time, we developed a self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free detection of tumor Exos using exosomal glycoprotein, which was enabled by split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous running powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). Benefiting from high selectivity and sensitivity of the STDW assay, direct detection of tumor Exos in cell culture medium and serum could also be realized. Furthermore, this method exhibited high accuracy in clinical sample analysis, offering the potential for early cancer diagnosis and postoperative response prediction.

         <title>Insights into Dynamic Surface Bromide Sites in Bi4O5Br2 for Sustainable N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic N2 reduction on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 nanosheets reveals a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of the catalyst surface. Creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle.







Abstract
Simulating photosynthesis has long been one of the ideas for realizing the conversion of solar energy into industrial chemicals. Heterogeneous N2 photofixation in water is a promising way for sustainable production of ammonia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the complex aqueous photocatalytic N2 reduction is still lacking. In this study, a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of catalyst surface for N2 reduction are revealed on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 (BOB) nanosheets, in which the creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle. Our rapid scan in situ FT&#8208;IR spectra verify that photocatalytic N2 reduction proceeds through an associative alternating mechanism on BOB surface with bromine vacancies (BrV&#8208;BOB). This work provides a new strategy to combine light&#8208;dependent facilitated reaction with light&#8208;independent regeneration of catalyst for advancing sustainable ammonia production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulating photosynthesis has long been one of the ideas for realizing the conversion of solar energy into industrial chemicals. Heterogeneous N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photofixation in water is a promising way for sustainable production of ammonia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the complex aqueous photocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction is still lacking. In this study, a light-dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light-independent protection of catalyst surface for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction are revealed on ultrathin Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (BOB) nanosheets, in which the creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle. Our rapid scan in situ FT-IR spectra verify that photocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction proceeds through an associative alternating mechanism on BOB surface with bromine vacancies (BrV-BOB). This work provides a new strategy to combine light-dependent facilitated reaction with light-independent regeneration of catalyst for advancing sustainable ammonia production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organoplatinum Compounds as Anion&#8208;Tuneable Uphill Hydroxide Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active and directional hydroxide transport is realized by using PtII organometallic compounds as carriers based on their hydrolysis reaction combined with the different permeability of the neutral form and the charged form PtII aqua species. These compounds can transport hydroxide selectively &#8220;uphill&#8221;, a gradient in a liposomal system producing a transmembrane pH gradient, and tuneable activity is achieved by adding anions through a ligand&#8208;exchange reaction.







Abstract
Active transport of ions uphill, creating a concentration gradient across a cell membrane, is essential for life. It remains a significant challenge to develop synthetic systems that allow active uphill transport. Here, a transport process fuelled by organometallic compounds is reported that creates a pH gradient. The hydrolysis reaction of PtII complexes results in the formation of aqua complexes that established rapid transmembrane movement (&#8220;flip&#8208;flop&#8221;) of neutral Pt&#8722;OH species, leading to protonation of the OH group in the inner leaflet, generating OH&#8722; ions, and so increasing the pH in the intravesicular solution. The organoplatinum complex effectively transports bound hydroxide ions across the membrane in a neutral complex. The initial net flow of the PtII complex into the vesicles generates a positive electric potential that can further drive uphill transport because the electric potential is opposed to the chemical potential of OH&#8722;. The OH&#8722; ions equilibrate with this transmembrane electric potential but cannot remove it due to the relatively low permeability of the charged species. As a result, effective hydroxide transport against its concentration gradient can be achieved, and multiple additions can continuously drive the generation of OH&#8722; against its concentration gradient up to &#916;pH&gt;2. Moreover, the external addition of different anions can control the generation of OH&#8722; depending on their anion binding affinity. When anions displayed very high binding affinities towards PtII compounds, such as halides, the external anions could dissipate the pH gradient. In contrast, a further pH increase was observed for weak binding anions, such as sulfate, due to the increase of positive electric potential.

         <title>Superhydrophilic 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks as Broadband Absorbers for Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>

A 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthr&#8208;acene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) with both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions is developed for solar steam generation (SSG) and delivers an excellent water evaporation up to 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation.







Abstract
The intrinsic hydrophobicity and limited light absorption especially in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of porous organic polymers are two bottlenecks impeding their applications in solar steam generation (SSG). Herein, we develop a 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) (TPAD&#8208;COF) featuring both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering from the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions for SSG. TPAD&#8208;COF serving as a highly efficient photothermal conversion material without any additives displays an excellent water evaporation of 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under 1 sun irradiation. Further extension of the light absorption range of the TPAD&#8208;based COF is realized through post&#8208;synthetic modification by chelating BF2 moieties. Systematic control experiments and analysis confirm that the hydrophilicity of photothermal conversion materials plays a more dominant role in the current TPAD&#8208;based COFs for SSG.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of 2&#8208;Vinylbenzyl Alcohols&#160;with Chiral Boro&#8208;Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of alkenes represents a very important approach to access optically active cyclic ethers. It was found that B(C  6  F  5  )  3  could catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohols with only 0.05 mol % catalyst loading, affording the desired product in high yields. To accomplish the asymmetric reaction, a novel type of chiral boro&#8208;phosphates was developed by treating chiral phosphoric acid with Piers&#8217; borane, in which the oxygen atom of P=O and the boron atom act as Lewis base and acid centers, respectively. A highly enantioselective hydroalkoxylation was successfully realized to give optically active 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives in 78&#8208;99% yields with 60&#8208;97% ee&#8217;s, in which an activation of O&#8208;H bond of alcohols by the boro&#8208;phosphate species is hypothesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and release of OH radicals from the reaction of H2O with O2 over soot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>OH radicals in the air maintain the oxidizing power of the troposphere. A conventional view is that particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere is a major sink of OH radicals, thereby lowering the oxidizing power of atmosphere in the event of high&#8208;level PM. By contrary, our joint experimental/theoretical study reveals a new mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by carbonaceous soot particles. We show that water and O  2  react on carbonaceous surfaces and give rise to gaseous OH radicals under irradiation. With ample delocalized &#960; electrons, carbonaceous surfaces enable the easy desorption of hydroxyl groups to produce gaseous OH radicals, evidenced by direct observation of the steady generation of OH radicals on a carbonaceous surface. Our results reveal a new chemical mechanism for the production of OH radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Mediating Oxidation of Thioethers with Iodine &#8208; A Mild and Versatile Pathway to Trigger the Formation of Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of redox&#8208;triggerable peptide hydrogels poses fundamental challenges, since the highly specific peptide architectures required inevitably limit the versatility of such materials. A powerful, yet rarely applied approach to bypass those barriers is the application of a mediating redox reaction to gradually decrease the pH during hydrogel formation. We report a versatile strategy to trigger the formation of peptide hydrogels from readily accessible acid&#8208;triggerable gelators by generating protons by oxidation of thioethers with triiodide. Adding thiodiglycol as a readily available thioether auxiliary to the basic precursor solution of a peptide gelator efficiently yielded hydrogels after mixing with triiodide, as studied in detail for Nap&#8208;FF and demonstrated for other peptides. Furthermore, incorporation of the thioether moiety in the gelator backbone via the amino acid methionine as shown for the tailormade Nap&#8208;FMDM peptide provides a useful modulation option reducing the number of additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is used to treat solid tumors by locally delivering radiation. However, due to nephro&#8208; and hepato&#8208;toxicity, it is limited by its dosage. To amplify radiation damage to tumor cells, radiolabeled nanogels can be used. We show that by tuning the mechanical properties of nanogels significant enhancement in circulation half&#8208;life of the gel could be achieved. We demonstrate why and how small changes in the mechanical properties of the nanogels influence its cellular fate. Nanogels with a storage modulus of 37 kPa were minimally phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages compared to nanogels with 93 kPa modulus. Using PET/CT a significant difference in the blood circulation time of the nanogels was shown. Computer simulations affirmed the results and predicted the mechanism of cellular uptake of the nanogels. Altogether, this work emphasizes the important role of elasticity even for particles that are inherently soft such as nano&#8208; or microgels.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone and Oxime Olefination via Ruthenium Alkylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the development of an efficient method for the olefination of hydrazones and oximes. The key design approach that enables this transformation is tuning of the energy/polarity of C=N &#960;&#8208;bonds by employing electron withdrawing groups (NR  2  , OR). The resulting hydrazones or oximes facilitate olefination with ruthenium alkylidenes. Through this approach, we show that air&#8208;stable, commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes provide access to functionalized alkenes (20 examples) in ring&#8208;closing reactions with yields up to 88%.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes the design and synthesis of a p&#8209;conjugated telluro[3,2&#8208;  b  ][1]&#8208;tellurophene&#8208;based synthon that, embodying pyridyl and haloaryl chalcogen&#8208;bonding acceptors, self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons through chalcogen bonds. The ribbons &#960;&#8208;stack in a multi&#8208;layered architecture both in single crystals and thin films. Theoretical studies of the electronic states of chalcogen&#8208;bonded material showed the presence of a local charge density between Te and N atoms.

         <title>Theoretical Optimization of Compositions of High&#8208;Entropy Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxides are investigated theoretically as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The energetics of the reaction is calculated on individual active sites following two different pathways, and it is shown that the overpotential and preferred pathway depend on the local atomic environment. A surface model is constructed in order to identify the composition that maximises the catalytic activity.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides are oxides consisting of five or more metals incorporated in a single lattice, and the large composition space suggests that properties of interest can be readily optimised. For applications within catalysis, the different local atomic environments result in a distribution of binding energies for the catalytic intermediates. Using the oxygen evolution reaction on the rutile (110) surface as example, here we outline a strategy for the theoretical optimization of the composition. Density functional theory calculations performed for a limited number of sites are used to fit a model that predicts the reaction energies for all possible local atomic environments. Two reaction pathways are considered; the conventional pathway on the coordinatively unsaturated sites and an alternative pathway involving transfer of protons to a bridging oxygen. An explicit model of the surface is constructed to describe the interdependency of the two pathways and identify the composition that maximizes catalytic activity.

         <title>A Crystalline Partially Fluorinated Triazine Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline, partially fluorinated triazine covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed with broad visible&#8208;light responsiveness, improved charge separation and transfer, and enhanced O2 affinity. The COF exhibited attractive photocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for H2O2 production under visible&#8208;light irradiation, and with higher activity than previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
A partially fluorinated, metal&#8208;free, imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional triazine covalent organic framework (TF50&#8208;COF) photocatalyst was developed. Fluorine (F)&#8208;substituted and nonsubstituted units were integrated in equimolar amounts on the edge aromatic units, where they mediated two&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. F&#8208;substitution created an abundance of Lewis acid sites, which regulated the electronic distribution of adjacent carbon atoms and provided highly active sites for O2 adsorption, and widened the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range of the catalyst, while enhancing charge separation. Varying the proportion of F maximized the interlayer interactions of TF50&#8208;COF, resulting in improved crystallinity with faster carrier transfer and robust photostability. The TF50&#8208;COF catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability in O2 photoreduction into H2O2, with a high H2O2 yield rate of 1739&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 5.1&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, exceeding the performance of previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Induced Emergent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral terpyridine&#8208;based ZnII complex has been developed that forms fluorescent complexes with nucleotides, but only in the presence of ATP. A chiral assembly is generated that exhibits circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum factor as high as 0.20. This discrimination of ATP from other nucleotides should allow applications in encryption.







Abstract
Biomimetic ATP&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly is important to understand various biological processes and dissipative systems. Here, we report an ATP&#8208;driven chiral assembly exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) via the interaction of an achiral terpyridine&#8208;based ZnII complex with nucleotides. It was found that while the metal complexes could co&#8208;assemble with the nucleotides to form fluorescent assemblies, only a combination of furan&#8208;substituted terpyridine complex and ATP showed an intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 0.20. This means that the complex could recognize ATP using CPL as a readout signal, thus providing an example of ATP encryption. Interestingly, when ATP was transferred into ADP or AMP under enzymatic hydrolysis, the CPL decreases or disappears. Addition of ATP generates CPL again, thus producing an ATP&#8208;induced CPL system. This work presents the first example of ATP&#8208;induced CPL and encryption.

         <title>A Pair of Atypical KAS III Homologues with Initiation and Elongation Functions Program the Polyketide Biosynthesis in Asukamycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KAS IIIs are known to be involved in the initiation step of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In vitro reconstitution of the upper triene chain of asukamycin unveils two highly unusual KAS IIIs which both exhibit initiation and iterative elongation activity. Together with the permissive ketoreductase and dehydratase, these C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes can synthesize a large variety of polyenes.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III (KAS III) is a class of important C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes that mostly catalyze the initiation of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we elucidated an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) system that involves two unique KAS IIIs (AsuC3 and C4) in the biosynthesis of the upper triene chain of asukamycin. Significantly, AsuC3 and C4 have both initiation and iterative elongation activity, while being functionally biased toward the elongation and initiation steps, respectively. Mutational analysis revealed that their catalytic activities rely on the catalytic triad Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Asn. Unlike other KAS IIIs, AsuC3 and C4 are very promiscuous and can accept various lengths of acyl&#8208;CoAs with either cyclic, branched or linear acyl moieties. By cooperation with the permissive ketoreductase (AsuC7) and dehydratase (AsuC8/C9), a large variety of polyenes can be efficiently synthesized. This study significantly broadens the understanding of KAS IIIs and polyketide biosynthesis.

         <title>MOF Synthesis Prediction Enabled by Automatic Data Mining and Machine Learning**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to rationalize and accelerate MOF discovery by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure. The prediction is based on machine learning models, trained on the SynMOF database, constructed via automatic data mining of synthesis parameters from the literature. The model outperforms human expert predictions according to a synthesis survey.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress in the field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the potential of using machine learning (ML) methods to predict MOF synthesis parameters is still untapped. Here, we show how ML can be used for rationalization and acceleration of the MOF discovery process by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure. Our approach is based on: i)&#8197;establishing the first MOF synthesis database via automatic extraction of synthesis parameters from the literature, ii)&#8197;training and optimizing ML models by employing the MOF database, and iii)&#8197;predicting the synthesis conditions for new MOF structures. The ML models, even at an initial stage, exhibit a good prediction performance, outperforming human expert predictions, obtained through a synthesis survey. The automated synthesis prediction is available via a web&#8208;tool on https://mof&#8208;synthesis.aimat.science.

         <title>Colloidal Bismuth Chalcohalide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reliable and versatile colloidal synthetic method to prepare mixed anion semiconductor nanocrystals of the V&#8211;VI&#8211;VII group, namely bismuth chalcohalides, is presented. The chemical stability and the optical absorption properties of the colloidal bismuth chalcohalide nanocrystals may set this class of materials as a promising complement to metal chalcogenides and halides for solution&#8208;processed light&#8208;harvesting purposes.







Abstract
Here we present a colloidal approach to synthesize bismuth chalcohalide nanocrystals (BiEX NCs, in which E=S, Se and X=Cl, Br, I). Our method yields orthorhombic elongated BiEX NCs, with BiSCl crystallizing in a previously unknown polymorph. The BiEX NCs display a composition&#8208;dependent band gap spanning the visible spectral range and absorption coefficients exceeding 105&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The BiEX NCs show chemical stability at standard laboratory conditions and form colloidal inks in different solvents. These features enable the solution processing of the NCs into robust solid films yielding stable photoelectrochemical current densities under solar&#8208;simulated irradiation. Overall, our versatile synthetic protocol may prove valuable in accessing colloidal metal chalcohalide nanomaterials at large and contributes to establish metal chalcohalides as a promising complement to metal chalcogenides and halides for applied nanotechnology.

         <title>Characterization of a Nitrogenase Iron Protein Substituted with a Synthetic [Fe4Se4] Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic [Fe4Se4] compound is incorporated into the nitrogenase iron protein, showing redox properties distinct from its [Fe4S4] counterpart that can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.







Abstract
The Fe protein of nitrogenase plays multiple roles in substrate reduction and cluster maturation via its redox&#8208;active [Fe4S4] cluster. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a water&#8208;soluble [Fe4Se4] cluster that is used to substitute the [Fe4S4] cluster of the Azotobacter vinelandii Fe protein (AvNifH). Biochemical, EPR and XAS/EXAFS analyses demonstrate the ability of the [Fe4Se4] cluster to adopt the super&#8208;reduced, all&#8208;ferrous state upon its incorporation into AvNifH. Moreover, these studies reveal that the [Fe4Se4] cluster in AvNifH already assumes a partial all&#8208;ferrous state ([Fe4Se4]0) in the presence of dithionite, where its [Fe4S4] counterpart in AvNifH exists solely in the reduced state ([Fe4S4]1+). Such a discrepancy in the redox properties of the AvNifH&#8208;associated [Fe4Se4] and [Fe4S4] clusters can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements for the substrate reduction and cluster maturation of nitrogenase, pointing to the utility of chalcogen&#8208;substituted FeS clusters in future mechanistic studies of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.

Moreover, these studies reveal that the [Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster in &lt;i&gt;Av&lt;/i&gt;NifH already assumes a partial all-ferrous state ([Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) in the presence of dithionite, where its [Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] counterpart in &lt;i&gt;Av&lt;/i&gt;NifH exists solely in the reduced state ([Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;). Such a discrepancy in the redox properties of the &lt;i&gt;Av&lt;/i&gt;NifH-associated [Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements for the substrate reduction and cluster maturation of nitrogenase, pointing to the utility of chalcogen-substituted FeS clusters in future mechanistic studies of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superstable and Intrinsically Self&#8208;Healing Fibrous Membrane with Bionic Confined Protective Structure for Breathable Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing fibrous membrane with bionic confined protective structure is constructed through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The breathable self&#8208;healing fibrous membrane imitates not only the sensing function, but also the healing process of biological skin, exhibiting great potential for the next&#8208;generation advanced bionic artificial skins.







Abstract
Considerable effort has been devoted to the fabrication of electronic skin that can imitate the self&#8208;healing and sensing function of biological skin. Almost all self&#8208;healing electronic skins are composed of airtight elastomers or hydrogels, which will cause skin inflammation. Fibrous membranes are ideal materials for preparing highly sensitive breathable electronic skins. However, the development of intrinsically self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes with high stability is still a challenge. Here, a novel interface protective strategy is reported to develop intrinsically self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes with a bionic confined structure for the first time, which were further assembled into an all&#8208;fiber structured electronic skin through interfacial hydrogen bonding. The electronic skin is multifunctional with self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;healing, breathability, stretchability, and thermochromism functionalities, which is highly promising for application in intelligent wearable sensing systems.

         <title>Computational Design, Synthesis, and Photochemistry of Cy7&#8208;PPG, an Efficient NIR&#8208;Activated Photolabile Protecting Group for Therapeutic Applications**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The computational design and synthesis of Cy7&#8208;PPG, a new oxygen&#8208;independent novel near&#8208;infrared photolabile protecting group (PPG) is reported. Cy7&#8208;PPG is the most redshifted PPG to date (&#955;max=746&#8197;nm), with unmatched near&#8208;infrared molecular absorptivity and aqueous solubility, and excellent uncaging efficiency, paving the way for the use of PPGs in the clinic.







Abstract
Photolabile Protecting Groups (PPGs) are molecular tools used, for example, in photopharmacology for the activation of drugs with light, enabling spatiotemporal control over their potency. Yet, red&#8208;shifting of PPG activation wavelengths into the NIR range, which penetrates the deepest in tissue, has often yielded inefficient or insoluble molecules, hindering the use of PPGs in the clinic. To solve this problem, we report herein a novel concept in PPG design, by transforming clinically&#8208;applied NIR&#8208;dyes with suitable molecular orbital configurations into new NIR&#8208;PPGs using computational approaches. Using this method, we demonstrate how Cy7, a class of NIR dyes possessing ideal properties (NIR&#8208;absorption, high molecular absorptivity, excellent aqueous solubility) can be successfully converted into Cy7&#8208;PPG. We report a facile synthesis towards Cy7&#8208;PPG from accessible precursors and confirm its excellent properties as the most redshifted oxygen&#8208;independent NIR&#8208;PPG to date (&#955;max=746&#8197;nm).

         <title>Emissive Platinum(II) Macrocycles as Tunable Cascade Energy Transfer Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive PtII macrocycles decorated with hydrophobic alkyl chains are developed as scaffolds for artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems with sequential energy transfer capabilities. These molecules have tunable aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties and form spherical aggregates upon self&#8208;assembly in water&#8211;acetone medium. A strategy to control the light&#8208;harvesting efficiency by changing hydrophobic chain length is shown.







Abstract
Developing artificial light&#8208;harvesting scaffolds with a cascade energy transfer process is significant for better understanding of photosynthesis. Here, we report [3+3] self&#8208;assembled PtII fluorescent macrocycles (3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b) as light&#8208;harvesting platforms with cascade energy transfer. The PtII macrocycles aggregate into nanospheres and show emission&#8208;enhancement characteristics upon increasing water content in acetone medium. These aggregates (3aa and 3ba) serve as energy donors when mixed with the hydrophobic dye Eosin&#8208;Y (ESY). In the presence of a second dye, Nile Red (NiR), an unusual sequential two&#8208;step energy transfer takes place from the macrocycles to NiR. In this case, ESY acts as a bridge in the relay mode. Additionally, a unique strategy to control such an energy transfer process by tuning the chain length of the alkyl group attached to the periphery of the macrocycles is demonstrated.

With the assistance of computational density functional theory calculations, a Sc/Ir bimetallic catalytic cycle was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in highly chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular (3+2) cycloadditions with a range of dienes and olefins. With acyclic dienes, the (3+2) cycloaddition outcompetes the (4+3) pathway traditionally observed in this kind of system almost exclusively. With both conjugated dienes and isolated olefins, excellent diastereoselectivities are observed, and cycloadducts can be obtained in optically&#8208;enriched forms. Computational studies indicate that the stepwise (3+2) cycloaddition involves an activated epoxy/aziridinyl intermediate and the conformational flexibility of the intermediate determines the preference for (3+2) cycloadduct formation. Further transformations of the (3+2) cycloadducts produce densely functionalized  trans  &#8208;hydrindane scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A naphthalene&#8208;embedded conjugated nanobelt is an excellent design for achieving the synthesis of cyclophenacene&#8208;type and chiral&#8208;type carbon nanobelts. A cationic rhodium complex catalyst is a powerful tool for the (asymmetric) synthesis of these analogs, as reported by Ken Tanaka and co&#8208;workers in this Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200800). In the picture, three blue belts in the foreground and the rhodium complex in the back represent the cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene belts and the key catalyst, respectively.

         <title>Integrated Ring&#8208;Chain Design of a New Fluorinated Ether Solvent for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated fluorinated ring&#8208;chain molecular approach was developed through structural modification of a low&#8208;cost, commercial ether for a new solvent 2&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (cFTOF), which served as a single ether solvent for lithium&#8208;metal batteries combining high&#8208;voltage stability up to 6&#8197;V, and regulated Li+ solvation structure, increasing Li+ ion&#8208;pairing with FSI anions in a low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration electrolyte system.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes offer promising features such as high lithium&#8208;ion solvation power and stable interface, yet their limited oxidation stability impedes application in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Whereas the fluorination of the ether backbone improves the oxidative stability, the resulting solvents lose their Li+&#8208;solvation ability. Therefore, the rational molecular design of solvents is essential to combine high redox stability with good ionic conductivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a new high&#8208;voltage fluorinated ether solvent through integrated ring&#8208;chain molecular design, which can be used as a single solvent while retaining high&#8208;voltage stability. The controlled Li+&#8208;solvation environment even at low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration (1&#8197;M or 2&#8197;M) enables a uniform and compact Li anode and an outstanding cycling stability in the Li|NCM811 full cell (20&#8197;&#956;m Li foil, N/P ratio of 4). These results show the impact of molecular design of electrolytes towards the utilization of LMBs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Protein Modification with Reducing Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with diverse reducing carbohydrates was developed. This method enabled the efficient and selective installation of GlcNAc moieties with a stable native&#8208;like linkage and subsequent enzymatic construction of defined oligosaccharides on proteins.







Abstract
Protein glycosylation plays critical roles in many biological processes. However, the fundamental study and application of glycobiology are hindered by the heterogeneousness of oligosaccharides in natural glycoproteins and the difficulty in constructing glycoproteins of human design. Herein, we describe a semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with reducing carbohydrates. The method involves the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified aspartate, which was subsequently quantitatively converted into alanine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydrazide (A&#946;z), and chemoselective conjugation of A&#946;z with a range of readily available reducing carbohydrates. The resulting A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc is a close mimic of native N&#8208;GlcNAc and could be installed on various proteins, including IL&#8208;17A and RNase A. Notably, A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc on proteins reacted with biantennary oligosaccharide oxazoline derivatives through endoglycosidase&#8208;catalyzed transglycosylation reactions to enable the assembly of homogeneous glycans on proteins.

However, the fundamental study and application of glycobiology are hindered by the heterogeneousness of oligosaccharides in natural glycoproteins and the difficulty in constructing glycoproteins of human design. Herein, we describe a semisynthetic method to site-specifically modify proteins with reducing carbohydrates. The method involves the genetic incorporation of a side-chain-esterified aspartate, which was subsequently quantitatively converted into alanine-&#946;-hydrazide (A&#946;z), and chemoselective conjugation of A&#946;z with a range of readily available reducing carbohydrates. The resulting A&#946;z-linked GlcNAc is a close mimic of native N-GlcNAc and could be installed on various proteins, including IL-17A and RNase A. Notably, A&#946;z-linked GlcNAc on proteins reacted with biantennary oligosaccharide oxazoline derivatives through endoglycosidase-catalyzed transglycosylation reactions to enable the assembly of homogeneous glycans on proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cofactor&#8208;Driven Cascade Reactions Enable the Efficient Preparation of Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex de novo biosynthesis of sugar nucleotides was reorganized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through the addition of an excess amount of a cofactor provided by a cofactor regeneration system, thus resulting in high synthetic yields.







Abstract
Glycosylation is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases using sugar nucleotides or occasionally lipid&#8208;linked phosphosugars as donors. However, only very few common sugar nucleotides that occur in humans can be obtained readily, while the majority of sugar nucleotides that exist in bacteria, plants, archaea, or viruses cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by either enzymatic or chemical synthesis. The limited availability of such rare sugar nucleotides is one of the major obstacles that has greatly hampered progress in glycoscience. Herein we describe a general cofactor&#8208;driven cascade conversion strategy for the efficient synthesis of sugar nucleotides. The described strategy allows the large&#8208;scale preparation of rare sugar nucleotides from common sugars in high yields and without the need for tedious purification processes.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticle Library with Precise pH Tunability by Co&#8208;Polymerization with Non&#8208;Ionizable Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy for the development of an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive nanoparticle library with precisely tuned pH transitions (pHt=4.0&#8211;7.4) was proposed through co&#8208;polymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The nanoprobe library exhibits excellent barcode imaging of endosome maturation and precise cancer imaging.







Abstract
Precise monitoring of the subtle pH fluctuation during biological events remains a big challenge. Previously, we reported an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive (UPS) nanoprobe library with a sharp pH response using co&#8208;polymerization of two tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers with distinct pKa. Currently, we have generalized the UPS nanoparticle library with tunable pH transitions (pHt) by copolymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The pHt of nanoparticles is fine&#8208;tuned by the non&#8208;ionizable monomers with different hydrophobicity. Each non&#8208;ionizable monomer presents a constant contribution to pH tunability regardless of tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers. Based on this strategy, we produced two libraries of nanoprobes with continuous pHt covering the entire physiological pH range (5.0&#8211;7.4) for fluorescent imaging of endosome maturation and cancers. This generalized strategy provides a powerful toolkit for biological studies and cancer theranostics.

         <title>Soluble and Perfluorinated Polyelectrolyte for Safe and High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design principle of polymerization and fluorination for salt anions has been proposed and lithiated Nafion (LN) was suggested as a representative soluble lithium salt for the polyelectrolyte solution to improve the Li+ transfer number and produce a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Furthermore, the perfluorinated backbone of LN delivers the polyelectrolyte solution low flammability. Thus, making the Li&#8722;O2 batteries realize all&#8208;round performance amelioration.







Abstract
The severe performance degradation of high&#8208;capacity Li&#8722;O2 batteries induced by Li dendrite growth and concentration polarization from the low Li+ transfer number of conventional electrolytes hinder their practical applications. Herein, lithiated Nafion (LN) with the sulfonic group immobilized on the perfluorinated backbone has been designed as a soluble lithium salt for preparing a less flammable polyelectrolyte solution, which not only simultaneously achieves a high Li+ transfer number (0.84) and conductivity (2.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1), but also the perfluorinated anion of LN produces a LiF&#8208;rich SEI for protecting the Li anode from dendrite growth. Thus, the Li&#8722;O2 battery with a LN&#8208;based electrolyte achieves an all&#8208;round performance improvement, like low charge overpotential (0.18&#8197;V), large discharge capacity (9508&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (225&#8197;cycles). Besides, the fabricated pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;air cells exhibit promising applications to power electronic equipment with satisfactory safety.

The DNA damage response, which includes DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint pathways in cancer cells, has been considered one of the main impediments to traditional chemotherapy. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117075), Na Kong, Xingcai Zhang, Wei Tao, Jong&#8197;Seung Kim, and co&#8208;workers developed a multifunctional construct, M1, to target the DNA damage response of cancer cells. The findings identified a critical role of DNA damage repair pathways during 5&#8208;FU/FUDR therapy and underscored the role of inhibition of these pathways in sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.

         <title>Asymmetric Defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;Trifluoromethylpyridines Enabled by Umpolung C&#8208;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;fluorine bond activation of the trifluoromethyl group represents an important approach to fluorine&#8208;containing molecules. While selective defluorinative functionalization reactions of CF  3  &#8208;containing substrates have been achieved by invoking difluorocarbocation, difluorocarboradical, or difluoroorganometallic species as the key intermediates, the transformations via fluorocarbanion mechanism only achieved limited success. Furthermore, the enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the CF  3  group remained a formidable challenge. Here we report a defluorinative functionalization reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines involving difluoro(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl anion as the key intermediate, which was developed based upon our previous studies on the  N  &#8208;boryl pyridyl anion chemistry. In particular, asymmetric defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines and &#8208;pyrimidines could be achieved by using Ir&#8208;catalysis to forge a difluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted chiral center.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Enzyme Activity by the Modulation of Covalent Interactions in the Confined Channels of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable regulations on the enzyme conformation to optimize catalytic performance are highly desired for the immobilized biocatalysts yet remain challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess confined channels with finely tunable pore environment, offering a promising platform for enzyme encapsulation. Herein, we covalently immobilized the cytochrome  c  (Cyt  c  ) in the size&#8208;matched channels of COFs with different contents of anchoring site, and significant enhancement of the stability and activity (~600% relative activity compared with free enzyme) can be realized by optimizing the covalent interactions. Structural analyses on the immobilized Cyt  c  suggest that covalent bonding could induce conformational perturbation resulting in more accessible active sites. The effectiveness of the covalent interaction modulation together with the tailorable confined channels of COFs offers promise to develop high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>More than a Leaving Group: N&#8208;Phenyltrifluoroacetimidate as a Remote Directing Group for Highly &#945;&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;cis Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anomeric configuration can greatly affect the biological functions and activities of carbohydrates. Herein, we report that N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl (PTFAI), a well&#8208;known leaving group for catalytic glycosylation, can act as a stereodirecting group for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Utilizing rapidly accessible 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;OPTFAI glycosyl donors, TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation occurred with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity and broad substrate scope, and the remaining 6&#8208;OPTFAI group can be cleaved chemoselectively. The remote participation of 6&#8208;OPTFAI is supported by the first characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic oxazepinium ion intermediates by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy. These cations were found to be relatively stable and mainly responsible for the present stereoselectivities. Further application is highlighted in glycosylation reactions toward trisaccharide heparins as well as the convergent synthesis of chacotriose derivatives using a bulky 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional WC&#8208;Supported RuO2 Nanoparticles for Robust Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the strong catalyst&#8208;support interaction in WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2&#8208;WC NPs) anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11 wt.%), which significantly promotes the oxygen evolution reaction activity with &#951;10 of 347 mV and mass activity of 1430 A gRu&#8208;1, eight&#8208;fold higher than that of commercial RuO2 (176 A gRu&#8208;1). Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong catalyst&#8208;support interaction between RuO2 and WC support could optimize the surrounding electronic structure of Ru sites to reduce reaction barrier. Considering the likewise excellent catalytic ability for hydrogen production, an acidic OWS electrolyzer with good stability constructed by bifunctional RuO2&#8208;WC NPs only requires a cell voltage of 1.66 V to afford 10 mA cm&#8208;2. The unique 0D/2D nanoarchitectures rationally combined WC support with precious metal oxides provides a promising strategy to tradeoff the high catalytic activity and low cost for acidic OWS application.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural insight of MOFs under combined mechanical and adsorption stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>External control over the pore size of flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently emerged as an intriguing concept, with possible applications to gas storage and separation. In this work we present a new pressure cell capable for the first time of monitoring through  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray powder diffraction an adsorbent powder under combined uniaxial applied mechanical stress (up to 1 GPa) and gas pressure (up to 20 bar). The combined stress&#8208;pressure clamp (CSPC) cell was successfully exploited to follow the evolution of the CO  2  breathing behaviour of the prototypical complex breathing MIL&#8208;53(Al) system under mechanical compression obtaining structural evidence that this MOF can be maintained in its closed pore state upon compression, precluding its re&#8208;opening at high gas pressure (&gt;7 bar). This novel setup shows potential for the  in&#8208;operando  exploration of flexible systems, in equilibrium and flow configurations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide is a renewable, inexhaustible and cheap alternative to fossil resources for the production of fine chemicals and plastics. This waste can notably be converted into exovinylene cyclic carbonates, unique synthons gaining momentum for preparing an impressive range of important organic molecules and functional polymers following 100% atom economy reactions under mild operating conditions in most cases. This review is summarizing the recent advances made in their synthesis with a particular attention to describe the catalysts needed for their preparation, and discuss the unique reactivity of these CO  2  &#8208;based heterocycles for constructing diverse organic building blocks and (functional) polymers. We also discuss the challenges and the future perspectives in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Biphasic Dye&#8208;sensitized Photosynthesis Cells for TEMPO&#8208;based Oxidation of Glycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This&#160;work reports an aqueous dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPECs) capable of oxidizing glycerol (an archetypical biobased compound) coupled with H  2  &#160;production. We employed a mesoporous TiO  2  &#160;photoanode sensitized with the high potential thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye&#160;  AP11  , encased in an acetonitrile&#8208;based redox&#8208;gel that protects the photoanode from degradation by aqueous&#160;electrolytes. The use of the gel&#160;creates&#160;a biphasic system with an interface at organic (gel) electrode and aqueous anolyte. Embedded in the acetonitrile gel is 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (  TEMPO  ), acting as both a redox&#8208;mediator and a catalyst for oxidative transformations. Upon oxidation of&#160;  TEMPO  &#160;by the photoexcited dye, the in situ generated&#160;  TEMPO  +  &#160;  shuttles through the gel to the acetonitrile&#8211;aqueous interface, where it acts as an oxidant for the selective conversion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde. The introduction of the redox&#8208;gel layer affords a 10&#8208;fold increase in the conversion of glycerol compared to the purely aqueous system. Our redox&#8208;gel protected photoanode yielded stable photocurrent over 48 hours of continuous operation, demonstrating that this DSPEC is compatible with&#160;alkaline&#160;aqueous reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Disproportionation of Nitric Oxide at a Surface&#8208;Bound Nickel Porphyrinoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncommon metal oxidation states in porphyrinoid cofactors are responsible for the activity of many enzymes. The F430 and P450nor co&#8208;factors, with their reduced Ni(I)&#8208; and Fe(III)&#8208;containing tetrapyrrolic cores, are prototypical examples of biological systems involved in methane formation and in the reduction of nitric oxide, respectively. Herein, using a comprehensive range of experimental and theoretical methods, we raise evidence that nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in&#8208;vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation at room temperature.

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Following Repetitive Stimulation Reveals a Mechanism for Plasticity Changes with Iron Deficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deficiency of iron, the most abundant transition metal in the brain and important for neuronal activity, is known to affect synaptic plasticity, causing learning and memory deficits. How iron deficiency impacts plasticity altering neurotransmission at the cellular level is not fully understood. We used electrochemical methods to study the effect of iron deficiency on plasticity with repetitive stimulations. We show that during iron deficiency, repetitive stimulation causes significant decrease in exocytotic release without changing vesicular content. This results in a lower fraction of release, opposite to the control group, upon repetitive stimulation. These changes were partially reversible by iron repletion. This finding suggests that by decreasing the fraction of vesicular release in response to repetitive stimulation iron deficiency has a negative effect on plasticity. This provides a possible mechanism for iron deficiency modulating plasticity. Extended to the central nervous system, this could be highly significant.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An isostructural series of heavy Group 14 E(I) radical anions (Ge, Sn, Pb), stabilized by a bulky xanthene&#8208;based diamido ligand are reported. The radical anions were synthesised by the one&#8208;electron reduction of their corresponding E(II) precursor complexes with sodium naphthalenide in THF, yielding the radical anions as charge&#8208;separated sodium salts. The series of main group radicals have been comprehensively characterized by EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analysis, which reveal that in all cases, the spin density of the unpaired electron almost exclusively resides in a  p  &#8208;orbital of &#960; symmetry located on the group 14 center.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual In&#8208;situ Laser Techniques Underpin the Role of Cations in Impacting Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the electrode/electrolyte interface is crucial for optimizing electrocatalytic performances. Here, we demonstrate that the nature of alkali metal cations can profoundly impact the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8208;organic framework (SURMOF) derived electrocatalysts, which are based on NiFe(OOH). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy results show that Raman shifts of the Ni&#8208;O bending vibration are inversely proportional to the mass activities from Cs+ to Li+. Particularly, a laser&#8208;induced current transient technique was introduced to study the cation&#8208;dependent electric double layer properties and their effects on the activity. The catalytic trend appeared to be closely related to the potential of maximum entropy of the system, suggesting a strong cation impact on the interfacial water layer structure. Our results highlight how the electrolyte composition can be used to maximize the performance of SURMOF derivatives toward electrochemical water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Binding&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Mechanical&#8208;Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogous to allosteric enzymes, guest binding introduces a directional pulling or pushing force that acts on the reverse side of a Zn salen complex. This tunable intramolecular force promotes various degrees of conformational and torsional strain, as predicted by both classical conformational analysis and DFT. This strain energy can be further applied to cleave chemical bonds, and the efficiency can be tuned by the identity of allosteric guest.







Abstract
Recently, polymer mechanochemistry has attracted much scientific interest due to its potential to develop degradable polymers. When the two ends of a polymer chain experience a linear pulling stress, molecular strain builds up, at sufficiently strong force, a bond scission of the weakest covalent bond results. In contrast, bond&#8208;breaking events triggered by conformational stress are much less explored. Here, we discovered that a Zn salen complex would undergo conformational switching upon allosteric complexation with alkanediammonium guests. By controlling the guest chain length, the torsional strain experienced by Zn complex can be modulated to induce bond cleavage with chemical stimulus, and reactivity trend is predicted by conformational analysis derived by DFT calculation. Such strain&#8208;release reactivity by a Zn(salen) complex initiated by guest binding is reminiscent of conformation&#8208;induced reactivity of enzymes to enable chemical events that are otherwise inhibited.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of N&#8208;Propargylamides and Their Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptaaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;hexatrienylrhodium(I) complexes induce well&#8208;controlled polymerization of N&#8208;propargylamides and their derivatives in the presence of PPh3, and the obtained polymers have high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The living nature enables control of molecular weights of the polymers and functionalization of both polymer chain ends, and synthesis of novel block copolymers is also demonstrated.







Abstract
A substantially improved method for living polymerization of N&#8208;propargylamides and their derivatives has been developed. Rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain can work as excellent initiators of the polymerization of such non&#8208;conjugated terminal alkynes to give the corresponding cis&#8208;stereoregular polymers having a narrow molecular weight distribution. The typical living nature has been confirmed by investigating the effects of initial feed ratios of the monomer to the initiator on the molecular weight of the resulting polymers as well as multistage polymerization. Moreover, we demonstrated that the present method enables functionalization of both polymer chain ends and synthesis of novel block copolymers consisting of poly(N&#8208;propargylamide) and poly(phenylacetylene) blocks with a narrow molecular weight distribution.

         <title>In Situ Constructed Nano&#8208;Drug Depots through Intracellular Hydrolytic Condensation for Chemotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ is presented. Based on silicon particles, the nano&#8208;drug depots are capable of sustained drug release, which results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer.







Abstract
Intravesical administration of first&#8208;line drugs has shown failure in the treatment of bladder cancer owing to the poor tumor retention time of chemotherapeutics. Herein, we report an intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ, wherein sustained drug release results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer. Briefly, the designed doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;silane conjugates self&#8208;assemble into silane&#8208;based prodrug nanoparticles, which condense into silicon particle&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug depots inside tumor cells. Significantly, we demonstrate that the IHC system possesses highly potent antitumor efficacy, which leads to the regression and eradication of large established tumors and simultaneously extends the overall survival of air pouch bladder cancer mice compared with that of mice treated with Dox. The concept of intracellular hydrolytic condensation can be extended via conjugating other chemotherapeutic drugs, which may facilitate rational design of novel nanomedicines for augmentation of chemotherapy.

     alt="In Situ Constructed Nano-Drug Depots through Intracellular Hydrolytic Condensation for Chemotherapy of Bladder Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long-term retentive nano-drug depots in situ is presented. Based on silicon particles, the nano-drug depots are capable of sustained drug release, which results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravesical administration of first-line drugs has shown failure in the treatment of bladder cancer owing to the poor tumor retention time of chemotherapeutics. Herein, we report an intracellular hydrolytic condensation (&lt;b&gt;IHC&lt;/b&gt;) system to construct long-term retentive nano-drug depots in situ, wherein sustained drug release results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer. Briefly, the designed doxorubicin (Dox)-silane conjugates self-assemble into silane-based prodrug nanoparticles, which condense into silicon particle-based nano-drug depots inside tumor cells. Significantly, we demonstrate that the &lt;b&gt;IHC&lt;/b&gt; system possesses highly potent antitumor efficacy, which leads to the regression and eradication of large established tumors and simultaneously extends the overall survival of air pouch bladder cancer mice compared with that of mice treated with Dox. The concept of intracellular hydrolytic condensation can be extended via conjugating other chemotherapeutic drugs, which may facilitate rational design of novel nanomedicines for augmentation of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Highly Graphitic Carbon Urchin&#8208;Like Hollow Structures Loaded with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms towards Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous urchin&#8208;like N&#8208;doped carbon structures with abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites (Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)) are fabricated by a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy. The unique hollow thorns on the surface, high accessible surface area and good conductivity enable effective electron/mass transfer and afford numerous singe&#8208;Ni sites towards highly efficient CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
The rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts featuring excellent conductivity, highly accessible discrete active sites and favorable mass transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis but remains challenging. In this study, a reliable Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy is developed to synthesize a single&#8208;atom catalyst by transforming metallic Ni into single&#8208;Ni atoms anchored on hollow porous urchin&#8208;like (HPU) N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)), which possesses high crystallinity and sufficient Ni&#8208;N4 moiety (2.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The unique hollow thorns on the surface, good conductivity and large external surface area facilitate electron/mass transfer and exposure of single&#8208;Ni sites. As a result, the Ni&#8208;NC(HPU) catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and high stability for CO2 electroreduction. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can also be facilely extended to prepare distinct hollow porous architectures with similar components, such as the wire&#8208; and sphere&#8208;like ones.

         <title>Catalytic Substrate&#8208;Selective Silylation of Primary Alcohols via Remote Functional&#8208;Group Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular recognition of the substrate structure by catalyst 3 enabled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of long&#8208;chain primary alcohols. Silylation of A proceeded 11 times faster than that of B by recognition of a one&#8208;carbon difference between primary alcohols A and B. Preferential silylation of A took place over that of C by a factor of 21 owing to discrimination of the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting OH group at C(1).







Abstract
Silylation of alcohols has generally been known to take place at the sterically most accessible less&#8208;hindered hydroxy group. Herein, the catalyst&#8208;controlled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of primary alcohols, in which the selectivity was controlled independently of the innate reactivity of the hydroxy group, based on the steric environment, is reported. The chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective silylation of 1,n&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives was achieved and 1,5&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives showed outstandingly high reactivity in the presence of analogues with a shorter or longer chain length under catalyst&#8208;controlled conditions. A highly substrate&#8208;selective catalytic silylation of pentanol analogues was also developed, in which the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting hydroxy groups was effectively discriminated on silylation.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic (2+1) Cycloaddition of Thioketones to Synthesize Tetrasubstituted Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of catalytic enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides with thioketones is presented, catalyzed by chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co&#921;&#921; complexes. This method provides a rapid and facile access to a series of optically active tetrasubstituted thiiranes with good outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 97&#8201;% ee). The origin of stereoselectivity was well elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of thioketones with &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides for the direct synthesis of tetrasubstituted thiiranes. In the presence of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/cobalt(&#921;&#921;) complexes (2&#8211;5&#8197;mol%), excellent efficiency (up to 99&#8201;% yield within 15&#8197;mins) and high stereoselectivity (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 97&#8201;% ee) are available. Elaborations of thiiranes via desulfuration have also been conducted to deliver tetrasubstituted olefins. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reaction initiates from a doublet state cobalt(&#921;&#921;) carbenoid, which is followed by a quartet cobalt(&#921;&#921;)&#8208;bound thiocarbonyl ylide pathway. This work provides a route for the selective construction of tetrasubstituted thiiranes and olefins that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Deep Downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 by Caged Peptide&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen/miR&#8208;140 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tumor cells, a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe self&#8208;assembled with miR&#8208;140 could release the GO203 peptide binding to MUC1 and miR&#8208;140 degrading the PD&#8208;L1 mRNA, thus, achieving the deep downregulation the of PD&#8208;L1 expression. Subsequently, activated immune cells by PDT&#8208;induced release of TAAs would achieve more effective immunotherapy.







Abstract
Downregulating programmed cell death ligand 1(PD&#8208;L1) protein levels in tumor cells is an effective way to achieve immune system activation for oncology treatment, but current strategies are inadequate. Here, we design a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe (GCP) to self&#8208;assemble with miR&#8208;140 forming GCP/miR&#8208;140 nanoparticles. After entering tumor cells, GCP/miR&#8208;140 disassembles in the presence of Cathepsin B (CB) and releases caged GO203 peptide, miR&#8208;140 and PyTPA. Peptide decages in the highly reductive intracellular environment and binds to mucin 1 (MUC1), thereby downregulating the expression of PD&#8208;L1. Meanwhile, miR&#8208;140 reduces PD&#8208;L1 expression by targeting downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 mRNA. Under the action of PyTPA&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), tumor&#8208;associated antigens are released, triggering immune cell attack on tumor cells. This multiple mechanism&#8208;based strategy of deeply downregulating PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells activates the immune system and thus achieves effective immunotherapy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis enables a desaturative approach for the preparation of aromatic aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic aldehydes are fundamental intermediates that are widely utilised for the synthesis of important materials across the broad spectrum of chemical industries. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult as their functionalizations are generally performed via electrophilic aromatic substitution, SEAr. Here we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach whereby aromatic aldehydes are assembled from saturated precursors via a desaturative process. This novel strategy harnesses the high&#8208;fidelity of Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to quickly construct multi&#8208;substituted cyclohexenecarbaldehyde cores which undergo desaturation via the synergistic interplay of enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis.

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Crystalline Hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 with Open Nanoarchitectures via Anisotropic&#8208;Kinetics Transformation for the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
An anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy is developed to synthesize single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with highly open nanoarchitectures and different compositions. The as&#8208;prepared ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages exhibit remarkably improved catalytic lifetime and reduced coke formation rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction.







Abstract
We report an anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy to prepare single&#8208;crystalline aluminosilicate MFI zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5) with highly open nanoarchitectures and hierarchical porosities. The methodology relies on the cooperative effect of in situ etching and recrystallization on the evolution of pure&#8208;silica MFI zeolite (silicalite&#8208;1) nanotemplates under hydrothermal conditions. The strategy enables a controllable preparation of ZSM&#8208;5 nanostructures with diverse open geometries by tuning the relative rate difference between etching and recrystallization processes. Meanwhile, it can also be extended to synthesize other heteroatom&#8208;substituted MFI zeolite nanocages. Compared with conventional ZSM&#8208;5 microcrystals, nanocrystals, and nanoboxes, the ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages with single&#8208;crystalline nature, highly open nanoarchitectures, and hierarchical porosities exhibit remarkably enhanced catalytic lifetime and low coking rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction.

         <title>Tailoring a Nanochaperone to Regulate &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanochaperone for &#945;&#8208;synuclein was designed and fabricated to prevent the misassembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein. The nanochaperone, termed &#945;S&#8208;nChap, dynamically and transiently captures monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its oligomerization. Moreover, &#945;S&#8208;nChap tightly captures oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its fibrillization.







Abstract
Protein misassembly leads to the formation of dysfunctional and toxic molecular species relating to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tailored a nanochaperone (&#945;S&#8208;nChap) for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to regulate its assembly. The &#945;S&#8208;nChap is capable of i)&#8197;specifically recognizing &#945;&#8208;synuclein; ii)&#8197;dynamically capturing and stabilizing monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and retarding oligomerization; iii)&#8197;tightly capturing oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein to prevent fibrillization; and iv)&#8197;transporting &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers to the lysosomal degradation system. The regulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein assembly by &#945;S&#8208;nChap was studied in vitro. Moreover, the role of &#945;S&#8208;nChap preventing &#945;&#8208;synuclein pathology in cells and protecting neurons from apoptosis was investigated. The strategy of tailoring a nanochaperone to regulate aberrant assembly of pathogenic proteins provides important insights into protein misfolding diseases. We foresee that &#945;S&#8208;nChap has therapeutic value for Parkinson's disease.

         <title>Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]: A Heteroanionic Nonlinear Optical Material Containing Planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and Heteroleptic [SnOSe3] Anionic Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inorganic heteroanionic materials are attracting increasing attention for exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials because they could better satisfy the necessary but conflicting properties of NLO crystals,  e.g.  large SHG response and wide band&#8208;gap. Up to now, the reports on heteroanionic NLO materials are mainly focused on ultraviolet or visible oxide&#8208;based fluoroborates, fluorophosphates, borate&#8208;phosphates and borate&#8208;iodates. However, the chalcogenide containing different kinds of anionic groups is barely reported. Herein, we have synthesized the first oxychalcogenide&#8208;carbonate, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] that contains two different kinds of anionic groups, [SnOSe3] and [CO3]. It crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric space group and exhibits fascinating NLO properties, including large SHG response (~1&#215;AGS), sufficient birefringence (0.12 @1064 nm), wide band&#8208;gap (3.46 eV) and high laser damage threshold (240 MW/cm2). These make Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]  &#160;a promising NLO crystal.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we report the first all thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials based circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;WOLEDs). Two pairs of spiro&#8208;type TADF enantiomers, (R/S)&#8208;SPOCN (5,5'&#8208;((2,2',3,3'&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1,1'&#8208;spirobi [indene]&#8208;7,7'&#8208;diyl)bis(oxy))bis (4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenoxazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phthalonitrile)) and (R/S)&#8208;OSFSO (2'&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) spiro[quinolino [3,2,1&#8208;kl]phenoxazine&#8208;9,9'&#8208;thioxanthene]&#8208;10',10'&#8208;dioxide), serve as emitters with complementary emission. The CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit warm white emission with CIE coordinate of (0.35, 0.46). Besides, decent device performances are observed with external quantum efficiency up to 21.6% at maximum&#160;and 11.8% at 1000 cd/m2. Obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence signals are detected with dissymmetry factor |gEL| around 3.0 &#215; 10&#8208;3. This is the the first report of CP&#8208;WOLEDs that can harvest both of singlet and triplet excitons, which provides a feasible strategy to develop CP&#8208;WOLEDs with remarkable device performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystal via a Persistent Radical Cation Acceptor for Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals for efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion is a long&#8208;sought goal but remains challenging. Here we construct a unique CT cocrystal by using persistent 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3 ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS  +&#8226;  ) as the electron acceptor. The strong persistency and electron affinity of ABTS  +&#8226;  endow a high degree of electron delocalization between ABTS  +&#8226;  and 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine donor. Together with the intrinsic long&#8208;wavelength absorption of ABTS  +&#8226;  , the synthesized cocrystal can effectively capture the full solar spectrum and show distinguished photothermal efficiency. Such cocrystal is further used for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation, and a high evaporation rate of 1.407 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 97.0% have been achieved upon 1 sun irradiation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Designing organic charge-transfer (CT) cocrystals for efficient solar-thermal conversion is a long-sought goal but remains challenging. Here we construct a unique CT cocrystal by using persistent 2,2&#8242;-azino-bis (3 ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS  +&#8226;  ) as the electron acceptor.

Such cocrystal is further used for solar-driven interfacial evaporation, and a high evaporation rate of 1.407 kg m  -2  h  -1  and a remarkable solar-to-vapor efficiency of 97.0% have been achieved upon 1 sun irradiation.

         <title>Enantiomeric Water&#8208;Soluble Octopus[3]arenes for Highly Enantioselective Recognition of Chiral Ammonium Salts in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Study of enantioselective recognition in water by synthetic chiral macrocyclic receptors is undoubtedly of theoretical and practical significance, but it is a big challenge to achieve the enantioselective recognition with both high enantioselectivity and high affinity in water probably due to the deficiency of such water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors with stable chiral cavities. Herein, we report a new class of chiral macrocyclic arenes named octopus[3]arenes. The enantiomeric macrocycles are composed of three homochiral ethenoanthracene subunits, and they can be synthesized by two pathways and then easily converted into water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes  P  &#8208;  1  and  M  &#8208;  1  . Notably,  P  &#8208;  1  and  M  &#8208;  1  with the rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities exhibit highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with association constant up to 10  6  M  &#8208;1  and  S  /  R  selectivity high up to 12.89.</dc:description>

         <title>An Acid&#8208;regulated Self&#8208;blinking Fluorescent Probe for Resolving Whole&#8208;cell Lysosomes with Long&#8208;term Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging appears to be increasingly important for unraveling organelle dynamics at the nanoscale, but is challenging due to the need for highly photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes. Here, we report a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore that achieved 12 nm spatial resolution and 20 ms time resolution under acidic lysosomal conditions. This fluorophore was successfully applied in super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosomal dynamics over 40 min. The pH dependence of the dye during blinking made the fluorophore sensitive to lysosomal pH. This probe enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed us to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosomal distribution, size, and luminal pH. We also observed a variety of lysosome movement trajectories and different types of interactions modes between lysosomes.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Design Strategy Enabling the Synthesis of Hydrolysis&#8208;Resistant, Water&#8208;Stable Titanium(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its prevalence in the environment, the chemistry of the Ti  4+  ion has long been relegated to anhydrous solutions or hydrolyzed TiO  2  polymorphs. A knowledge gap in stabilizing molecular Ti  4+  species in aqueous environments has prevented the use of this ion for various applications such as cancer therapy, radioimaging, design of water&#8208;compatible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and aqueous&#8208;phase molecular catalysis applications. Herein, we demonstrate that a fragment&#8208;based screening approach of bidentate chelators with Ti  4+  in aqueous solution, as well as computational and structural analysis reliably predicts that a hexadentate analogues of catechol (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol) and deferiprone (3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;pyridone), TREN&#8208;CAM and THP  Me  respectively, form mononuclear Ti  4+  complexes resistant against hydrolysis from pH 4&#8208;10. We further validate our findings using radiochemical labeling with the short&#8208;lived isotopeTi&#8208;45, which demonstrates that the [  45  Ti]Ti&#8208;TREN&#8208;CAM complex remains inert against transchelation in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Borylation of Pyridines with Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports a site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H borylation of pyridines at the  ortho&#8208;position with pinacolborane enabled by an yttrocene catalyst. The reaction provides a new family of 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates with a broad substrate scope and high atom efficiency. The resultant boronates were able to undergo a variety of transformations,  e.g., oxidation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, Chan&#8208;Lam amination and etherification. Catalytic intermediates, including  ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H metalated and borylated complexes, were isolated from stoichiometric experiments and confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Borylation Using Silyl&#8208;Bipyridine Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New ligands for the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation of aliphatic compounds were established. In sharp contrast to 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine and 6&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, 2,2&#180;&#8209;bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives bearing a hydrosilylmethyl group (which would give a thermally stable NNSi pincer complex) served as suitable ligands for the reaction. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand was shown to be an excellent ligand, and various aliphatic compounds were efficiently converted to the corresponding borylated products using the Ir/NNSi pincer catalyst system. The NNSi pincer ligand showed unique selectivity and enabled the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation using pinacolborane [H&#8211;B(pin)] instead of B2(pin)2. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2&#160;was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Bonding Model for Gold(I) Species: The Importance of Pauli Repulsion Revealed in a Gold(I)&#8208;Cyclobutadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the bonding of gold(I) species has been central to the development of gold (I) catalysis. Herein, we present the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal characterization of the first gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex, accompanied with bonding analysis by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy decomposition analysis methods. Analysis of possible coordination modes for the new species not only confirms established characteristics of gold(I) bonding, but also suggests that Pauli repulsion is a key yet hitherto overlooked element. Additionally, we obtain a new perspective on gold(I)&#8208;bonding by comparison of the gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene to congeners stabilized by p&#8208;, d&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals. Consequently, we refine the gold(I) bonding model, with a delicate interplay of Pauli repulsion and charge transfer as the key driving force for various coordination motifs. Pauli repulsion is similarly determined as a significant interaction in gold(I)&#8208;alkyne species, corroborating this revised understanding of gold(I) bonding</dc:description>

         <title>Dismutation of Tricyanoboryllead Compounds:&#160;The Homoleptic Tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of unprecedently air&#8208;stable (tricyanoboryl)&#173;plum&#173;bate anions was obtained by the reaction of the boron&#8208;centered nucleophile B(CN)32&#173;&#8211; with triorganyllead halides. Salts of the anions [R3PbB(CN)3]&#8211; (R = Ph, Et) were isolated and found to be stable in air at room temperature. In the case of Me3PbHal (Hal&#160;= Cl, Br), a mixture of the anions [Me4&#8211;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8211;&#160;(n = 1, 2) was obtained. The [Et3Pb&#173;B(CN)3]&#8211;&#160;ion undergoes stepwise dismutation in aqueous solution to yield the plum&#173;bate anions [Et4&#8211;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8211;&#160;(n = 1&#8211;4) and PbEt4&#160;as by&#8208;product. The reaction rate increases with decreasing pH value of the aqueous solution or by bubbling O2&#160;through the reaction mixture. Adjustment of the conditions allowed the selective formation and isolation of salts of all anions of the series [Et4&#8211;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8211;  (n&#160;= 1&#8211;4) including the homoleptic tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8211;.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Allylboration of Alkynes with Allylic gem&#8208;Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic  gem  &#8208;dichlorides are shown to be efficient substrates for catalytic asymmetric allylboration of alkynes. The method employs a chiral NHC&#8208;Cu catalyst capable of generating in a single step chiral skipped dienes bearing a  Z  &#8208;alkenyl chloride, a trisubstituted  E  &#8208;alkenyl boronate and a bis&#8208;allylic stereocenter with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. This high degree of functionalization makes these products versatile building blocks as illustrated with the synthesis of several optically active compounds. DFT calculations support the key presence of a metal cation bridge ligand&#8208;substrate interaction and account for the stereoselectivity outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;binary Encoded Nucleic Acid Barcodes Directly Readable by a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A large collection of unique molecular barcodes is useful in the simultaneous sensing or screening of molecular analytes. Though the sequence of DNA has been widely applied to encode for molecular barcodes, decoding of these barcodes is normally assisted by sequencing. We here demonstrate a barcode system based solely on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic nucleic acids and direct nanopore decoding. Each molecular barcode is composed of &#8220;n&#8221; distinct information nodes in a non&#8208;binary manner and can be sequentially scanned and decoded by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. Nanopore events containing step&#8208;shaped features were consistently reported. 14 unique information nodes were developed which in principle could encode for 14  n  unique molecular barcodes in a barcode containing &#8220;n&#8221; information nodes. These barcode probes were adapted to detect different antibody proteins or cancer&#8208;related microRNAs, suggesting their immediate application in a wide variety of sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>PO43&#8208; Coordinated Robust Single&#8208;Atom Platinum&#160;Catalyst for Selective Polyol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient catalytic conversion over heterogeneous catalyst with excellent resistance against leaching is still a grand challenge for sustainable chemical synthesis in aqueous solution. Herein, we devised a single&#8208;atom Pt  1  /hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst via a simple hydrothermal strategy. Gratifyingly, this robust Pt  1  /HAP catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability for the selective oxidation of C  2  &#8208;C  4  polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids. It is found that the Pt&#8208;(O&#8208;P) linkages with strong electronic&#8208;withdrawing function of PO  4  3&#8208;  (Pt  1  &#8208;OPO  4  3&#8208;  pair active site) not only realize the activation of C&#8208;H bond, but also destabilize the transition state from adsorbed hydroxy acids toward the C&#8208;C cleavage, resulting in the sharply increased selectivity of hydroxy acids. Moreover, the strong PO  4  3&#8208;  &#8208;coordination effect provides electrostatic stabilization for single&#8208;atom Pt, ensuring the highly efficient catalysis of Pt  1  /HAP for over 160 hours with superior leaching resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;throughput approach to repurposing olefin polymerization catalysts for polymer upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and economical plastic waste upcycling to prevent environmental accumulation relies on the development of catalysts capable of polymer degradation. A systematic high&#8208;throughput screening of twenty&#8208;eight polymerization catalysts precursors, belonging to the catalyst families of metallocenes, ansa&#8208;metallocenes, and hemi&#8208; and post&#8208;metallocenes, in cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polybutadiene (PB) degradation reveals, for the first time, important structure&#8208;activity correlations. The upcycling conditions involve activation of the catalysts (at 0.18% catalyst loading) with 15&#8208;30 equiv of tri&#8208;iso&#8208;butyl aluminum at 50 &#176;C in toluene. The data indicate the ability to degrade PB is a general reactivity profile of neutral group 4 metal hydrides. A simple quantitative&#8208;structure activity relationship (QSAR) model utilizing two descriptors for the distribution of steric bulk in the active pocket and one descriptor measuring the electrophilicity of the metal ion reveals that the degradation ability increases with an a) increased but not overbearing steric congestion and b) lower electrophilicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8211;H Silylation of Heteroarenes for the Synthesis of Acyclic Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation for the synthesis of acyclic silanes bearing silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in one enantiomeric form remains unknown to date. Herein, we report the first enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes. This process undergoes a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of acyclic heteroarylated silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, including bis&#8208;Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes, in decent yields with excellent  chemo  &#8208;,  regio  &#8208;, and  stereo  &#8208;control, which significantly enlarge the chemical space of the optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomer&#8208;assisted&#160;Photoactive Layers Enable&#160;&gt;18% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have unique advantages in improving device performance, the morphology assembly in ternary&#8208;phase would be more uncertain or complex than that in binary&#8208;phase. Here, we propose a new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted photoactive layers for high&#8208;performance OSCs. The formed alloy&#8208;like phase of the oligomer:host polymer blend enabled the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs fusing the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, exhibiting substantially enhanced performance and stability compared to the control devices. With the addition of oligomers, outstanding efficiencies of 17.33% for PM6:Y6 device, 18.32% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 device, and 17.13% for PM6/Y6 pseudo&#8208;bilayer device were achieved, all of which are one of the highest values in their corresponding fields. The improved performance originated from the downshift energy levels, enhanced light absorption, optimized blend morphology, favorable charge dynamics, and reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C(sp2)&#8211;Si Coupling of Chlorohydrosilanes via Si&#8211;Cl Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a new method for the synthesis of organohydrosilanes from phenols and ketones. This method is established through reductive C&#8211;Si coupling of chlorohydrosilanes via unconventional Si&#8211;Cl cleavage. The reaction offers access to aryl&#8208; and alkenylhydrosilanes with a scope that is complementary to those of the established methods. Electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled successfully. Functionalities, including Grignard&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., primary amine, amide, phenol, ketone, ester, and free indole), acid&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., ketal and THP protection), alkyl&#8211;Cl, pyridine, furan, thiophene, Ar&#8211;Bpin, and Ar&#8211;SiMe3, were tolerated. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, incorporation of &#8208;Si(H)R2 into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organohydrosilanes are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Nonlinearity Induced by Coaxial Alignment of Polar Chain and Dense [BO3] Units in CaZn2(BO3)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of new efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with large second&#8208;order nonlinearity for short&#8208;wave UV spectral region (&#955;  PM  &#8804; 266 nm, PM = phase&#8208;matching) is still very challenging. Herein, by applying tetrahedra substitution strategy based on Sr  2  Be  2  B  2  O  7  (SBBO), a new beryllium&#8208;free borate CaZn  2  (BO  3  )  2  with double&#8208;layered configuration was rationally designed, which not only preserves the structural merits but also eliminates the limitations of SBBO crystal. CaZn  2  (BO  3  )  2  shows a large PM second harmonic generation (SHG) reponse of 3.8&#215;KDP, which is 38 times higher than its barium analogue. This enhancement originates from the  1  [Zn  2  O  6  ]  &#8734;  polar chains with large net dipole moment and [BO  3  ] units with high NLO active density. Our findings show the great significance of [ZnO  4  ] tetrahedra introduced strategy to design beryllium&#8208;free SBBO&#8208;type NLO crystals and also verify the feasibility of using simple non&#8208;isomorphic substitution to induce giant second&#8208;order nonlinearity enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Topochemical Postulates: Are They Relevant for Topochemical Reactions Occurring at Elevated Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rigid&#160;inositol derived monomer functionalized with azide and alkyne as the complementary reactive groups (CRGs) crystallized as three distinct polymorphs&#160;  I&#8208;III  . Despite the unsuitable orientation of CRGs in the crystals for complete polymerization, all the three polymorphs underwent regiospecific and quantitative topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization upon heating to yield three different polymorphs of 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl&#8208;linked&#8208;poly&#8208;  neo  &#8208;inositol. The molecules in these polymorphs exploit the weak intermolecular interactions, free space in the crystal lattice, and heat energy for their large and cooperative molecular motion to attain a transient reactive orientation, ultimately leading to the regiospecific TAAC reaction yielding distinct crystalline polymers. This study cautions that the overreliance on topochemical postulates for the prediction of topochemical reactivity at high temperatures could be misleading.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Quantification of a Highly Biocompatible Dinuclear Iridium(III) Complex for Photocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantification of intracellular content of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs in a single cancer cell remains a challenge. Here, we used single&#8208;cell inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry to study the uptake and retention of mononuclear (Ir1) and dinuclear (Ir2) Ir(III) photo&#8208;redox catalysts in every single cancer cell. This method allowed rapid and precise quantification of drug in individual cancer cells. Importantly, Ir2 showed a significant synergism but not an additive effect for NAD(P)H photocatalytic oxidation. The lysosome&#8208;targeting Ir2 showed low dark toxicity in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo. Ir2 exhibited high photocatalytic therapeutic efficiency at 525 nm with an excellent photo&#8208;index in&#8208;vitro and against tumor&#8208;bearing mice model in vivo. Interestingly, the photocatalytic anticancer profile of the dinuclear Ir2 was much better than the mononuclear Ir1, indicating for the first time that dinuclear metal&#8208;based photocatalysts can be applied for photocatalytic anticancer research.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric&#160;&#946;&#8208;Oxygen Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination reaction is reported in the form of a zirconium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric opening of  meso  &#8208;ketene acetals. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is demonstrated. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, at low catalyst loadings, and produces chiral monoprotected  cis  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diols in good yield and enantiomeric excess. The combination with a Mitsunobu reaction or a one&#8208;pot hydroboration/Suzuki reaction sequence then give&#160;access to additional diol and aminoalcohol building blocks. A stereochemical analysis supported by DFT calculations reveals that a high selectivity in the hydrozirconation step is also important for achieving high enantioselectivity, although it does not constitute the asymmetric step. This insight is crucial for the future development of related asymmetric &#946;&#8208;elimination reactions.</dc:description>
