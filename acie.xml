         <title>1D/2D/3D Reversible Dimensional Transformation in Cu(II) Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reversible transformation between 1D, 2D, and 3D is demonstrated for the first time in coordination polymers comprising Cu(II) ions and bidentate terephthalate (BDC  2&#8211;  ). 1D uniform chains were reversibly transformed into 2D layers with the construction of Cupaddlewheels by eliminating water molecules. 2D/3D reversible transformation was achieved by removing/rebinding  N  ,  N&#8208;  dimethylformamide coordinated to the paddlewheels. These dimensional transformations significantly changed chemical and physical properties such as gas sorption and magnetism. Although the uptake in open&#8208;framework 1D and 2D Cu&#8208;BDC was insignificant, pronounced absorption was observed for 3D Cu&#8208;BDC. Drastic difference in magnetic behavior is consistent with their coordination structures; uniform 1D chain of Cu(II) in 1D Cu&#8208;BDC and 2D sheet based on Cu(II)&#8208;paddlewheel dimers in 2D Cu&#8208;BDC. Ferromagnetic behavior observed in air&#8208;exposed 3D Cu&#8208;BDC is attributed to the 3D structure formed by the connection of 2D sheets.</dc:description>

         <title>Record Aluminum Molecular Rings for Optical Limiting and Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline cluster materials, a class of functional motif aggregations, provide a great opportunity for tuning the properties stemming from the flexible and accurate variation of inorganic and organic compositions. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of functional ligand and ring size regulation on the structures and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Revealed by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis results, aluminum molecular ring expansion is achieved by 2 &#215; 9 and 3 &#215; 6 strategies. In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0 nm to 1.7 nm. The picosecond Z&#8208;scan measurements results revealed that the third&#8208;order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics field.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Ambiphile Reactivity Trends in the Anti&#8208;(Hetero)annulation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkenes via PdII/PdIV Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to access 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles from non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides and ambiphilic organohalides is described. Under PdII/PdIV catalysis, this [n+2] annulation proceeds in an anti&#8208;selective fashion and tolerates a wide array of ambiphiles, which are systematically benchmarked with respect to nucleophile identity, electrophile identity, and product ring&#8208;size. Otherwise unreactive ambiphilic ortho&#8208;haloacetophenones can be activated using an amine co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
In this study, we systematically evaluate different ambiphilic organohalides for their ability to participate in anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208; or heteroannulation with non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides under PdII/PdIV catalysis. Detailed optimization of the reaction conditions has led to protocols for synthesizing tetrahydropyridines, tetralins, pyrrolidines, and other carbo/heterocyclic cores via [n+2] (n=3&#8211;5) (hetero)annulation. Expansion of scope to otherwise unreactive ambiphilic haloketones through PdII/amine co&#8208;catalysis is also demonstrated. Compared to other annulation processes, this method proceeds via a distinct PdII/PdIV mechanism involving Wacker&#8208;type directed nucleopalladation. This difference results in unique reactivity and selectivity patterns, as revealed through assessment of reaction scope and competition experiments.

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Reveals Sex Difference in Vesicular Storage and Release of Catecholamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantitative measurements of sex difference in vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at a single vesicle level are very essential to understand sex differences in cognitive behaviors; however, such measurements are very challenging to conventional analytical methods. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the duration of single exocytotic events of chromaffin cells prepared from male rats is statistically longer than that from female rats, leading to more neurotransmitter released in male group. Further analysis reveals that a higher percentage of vesicles in female group release part of neurotransmitter, i.e., partial release, during exocytosis than that in male group. This sex dimorphism in neurotransmitter release in exocytosis might relate to the sex difference in the expression of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. Our finding offers the first experimental evidence that sex dimorphism even exists in vesicle chemistry, providing a brand new viewpoint for understanding the sex dimorphism in cognitive behaviors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An enantioselective synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;C10&#8208;hydroxyacutuminine is reported. Central to our strategy is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition that forges two of the quaternary stereocenters present in the acutumine alkaloids. A subsequent retro&#8208;aldol/Dieckmann sequence furnishes the spirocyclic cyclopentenone.

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Arylation of Tertiary C&#8210;H Bonds of Cyclobutylmethyl Ketones Using Transient Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first example of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed selective tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group. The electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand is identified as an external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers were readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups in up to 81% yield and &gt;95:5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8210;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8210;H arylation. In the presence of a &#946;&#8208;methyl C&#8210;H bond, the desired arylation of the tertiary C&#8211;H bond can still proceed as the predominant pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote C(sp3)&#8208;H Acylation of Amides and Cascade Cyclization via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of inert C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds under environmentally benign catalytic conditions remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an organocatalytic remote C(sp  3  )&#8208;H acylation of amides and cascade cyclization through a radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism using  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as the catalyst. Notably, a diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates, including simple linear aliphatic carbamates and  ortho  &#8208;alkyl benzamides, can be successfully applied to this organocatalytic system. With the established protocol, over 120 examples of functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were facilely synthesized in up to 99% yield under mild conditions. The robustness and generality of the organocatalytic strategy was further highlighted by the successful acylation of unactivated C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules. The attempt for asymmetric control of the radical reaction proved to be feasible by using a newly designed chiral thiazolium catalyst, and moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at the current stage. Preliminary mechanistic investigations including several control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Dominance of Cyclobutadienyl Over Cyclopentadienyl in the Crystal Field Splitting in Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacing a monoanionic cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand in dysprosium single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with a dianionic cyclobutadienyl (Cb) ligand in the sandwich complexes [(&#951;  4  &#8208;Cb'''')Dy(&#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  Me  4  t  Bu)(BH  4  )]&#8315; (  1  ), [(&#951;  4  &#8208;Cb'''')Dy(&#951;  8  &#8208;Pn  &#8224;  )K(THF)] (  2  ) and [(&#951;  4  &#8208;Cb'''')Dy(&#951;  8  &#8208;Pn  &#8224;  )]&#8315; (  3  ) leads to larger energy barriers to magnetization reversal (Cb'''' = C  4  (SiMe  3  )  4  , Pn  &#8224;  = 1,4&#8208;di(tri&#8208;isopropylsilyl)pentalenyl). Short distances to the Cb'''' ligands and longer distances to the Cp ligands in  1  &#8208;  3  are consistent with the crystal field splitting being dominated by the former. Theoretical analysis shows that the magnetic axes in the ground Kramers doublets of  1  &#8208;  3  are oriented towards the Cb'''' ligands. The theoretical axiality parameter and the relative axiality parameter  Z  and  Z  rel  are introduced to facilitate comparisons of the SMM performance of  1  &#8208;  3  with a benchmark SMM.

         <title>Access to a Labile Monomeric Magnesium Radical by Ball&#8208;Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to isolate a monometallic Mg radical, the precursor (Am)MgI&#183;(CAAC) (  1  ) was prepared (Am =  t  BuC(N&#8208;DIPP)  2  , DIPP = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, CAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene). Reduction of a solution of  1  in toluene with the reducing agent K/KI led to formation of a deep purple complex that rapidly decomposed. Ball&#8208;milling of  1  with K/KI gave the low&#8208;valent Mg(I) complex (Am)Mg&#183;(CAAC) (  2  ) which after rapid extraction with pentane and crystallization was isolated in 15% yield. Although a benzene solution of  2  decomposes rapidly to give Mg(Am)  2  (  3  ) and unidentified products, the radical is stable in the solid state. Its crystal structure shows planar trigonal coordination at Mg. The extremely short Mg&#8208;C distance of 2.056(2) &#197; indicates strong Mg&#8208;CAAC bonding. Calculations and EPR measurements show that most of the spin density is in a p* orbital located at the C&#8208;N bond in CAAC, leading to significant C&#8208;N bond elongation. This is supported by calculated NPA charges in  2  : Mg +1.73, CAAC &#8208;0.82. Similar metal&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer was calculated for M  0  (CAAC)  2  and [M  I  (CAAC)  2  +  ] (M = Be, Mg, Ca) complexes in which the metal charges range from +1.50 to +1.70. Although the spin density of the radical is mainly located at the CAAC ligand, complex  2  reacts as a low&#8208;valent Mg(I) complex: reaction with a I  2  solution in toluene gave (Am)MgI&#183;(CAAC) (  1  ) as the major product.</dc:description>

         <title>Emissive Platinum(II) Macrocycles as Tunable Cascade Energy Transfer Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing artificial light&#8208;harvesting scaffolds with cascade energy transfer process is significant for better understanding of photosynthesis. Here, we report [3+3] self&#8208;assembled Pt(II) fluorescent macrocycles (  3a  and  3b  ) as light&#8208;harvesting platforms with cascade energy transfer. The Pt(II) macrocycles aggregate into nanospheres and show emission enhancement characteristics upon increasing water content in acetone medium. These aggregates (  3a  a  and  3b  a  ) serve as energy donors when mixed with the hydrophobic dye Eosin&#8208;Y (ESY).&#160; In the presence of a second dye, Nile Red (NiR), an unusual sequential two&#8208;step energy transfer takes place from the macrocycles to NiR. In this case, ESY acts as a bridge in the relay mode. Additionally, a unique strategy to control such an energy transfer process by tuning the chain length of the alkyl group attached to the periphery of the macrocycles is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Encoding Enantiomeric Molecular Chiralities on Graphene Basal Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene has demonstrated broad applications due to its prominent properties. Its molecular structure makes graphene achiral. Here, we propose a direct way to prepare chiral graphene by transferring chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto graphene basal plane through &#928;&#8208;&#928; interaction followed by thermal fusion. Using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy, we estimated an areal coverage of the molecular imprints (chiral regions) up to 64% on the basal plane of graphene (grown by chemical vapor deposition). The high concentration of molecular imprints in their single layer points to a close packing of the deposited amino acid molecules prior to &#8220;thermal fusion&#8221;. Such &#8220;molecular chirality&#8208;encoded graphene&#8221; was tested as an electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition. The chirality&#8208;encoded graphene might find use for other chirality&#8208;related studies and the encoding procedure might be extended to other two&#8208;dimensional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Widefield SERS for High&#8208;Throughput Nanoparticle Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a powerful technology with unprecedent potential for ultrasensitive chemical analysis. Point&#8208;by&#8208;point scanning and often excessively long spectral acquisition&#8208;times hamper the broad exploitation of the full analytical potential of SERS. Here, we introduce large scale SERS particle screening (LSSPS), a multiplexed widefield screening approach to particle&#8208;characterization, which is 500&#8208;1000 times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations. Beyond its higher throughput, LSSPS simultaneously quantifies both the sample&#8217;s Raman and Rayleigh scattering, allowing for an unprecedented correlation of SERS activity with the particle&#8208;size and to directly quantify the fraction of SERS active particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Catalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Arenes: Expeditious Synthesis of the Remdesivir Nucleoside**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars is presented. A silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which are cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The utility of the method is showcased in the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 by a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.







Abstract
Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, in particular by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stages of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air&#8208;sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, thus impeding a cost&#8208;efficient supply to patients. We have, therefore, focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation that initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 after a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.

         <title>Accelerating Radiative Decay in Blue Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters by Minimizing the Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorophores are constructed with strong through&#8208;space donor&#8211;acceptor interactions by minimizing their face&#8208;to&#8208;face distance of 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, realizing efficient blue emission and fast radiative decay. The materials show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with relieved efficiency roll&#8208;off and CIEy coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15, when used as emitter and sensitizer in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorophors (TADF) featuring through&#8208;space charge transfers (TSCT) suffer from low radiative decay rates (krs), especially for blue emitters. Here, a xanthene bridge is adopted to construct space&#8208;confined face&#8208;to&#8208;face donor&#8211;acceptor alignment and minimize their distances down to 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, even shorter than the interlayer distance of graphite and thus strengthening the electronic interactions. The resulting blue TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit peaks around &#8776;460&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90&#8201;%, and krs of nearly 107&#8197;s&#8722;1, almost 2&#8211;10&#8197;times higher than previously observed values with comparable reverse intersystem crossing rates. The corresponding blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15 using those molecules as emitters and sensitizers, respectively.

         <title>CLIPON: A CRISPR&#8208;Enabled Strategy that Turns Commercial Pregnancy Test Strips into General Point&#8208;of&#8208;Need Test Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational integration of the human chorionic gonadotropin, CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a/crRNA system, and large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies, a portable sensing platform termed CLIPON has been developed, which can transduce both nucleic acid and non&#8208;nucleic acid targets into commercial pregnancy test strip readout. The detection is sensitive, selective, instrument&#8208;free, and allows future integration into a microchip.







Abstract
Desirable biosensing assays need to be sensitive, specific, cost&#8208;effective, instrument&#8208;free, and versatile. Herein we report a new strategy termed CLIPON (CRISPR and Large DNA assembly Induced Pregnancy strips for signal&#8208;ON detection) that can deliver these traits. CLIPON integrates a commercial pregnancy test strip (PTS) with four biological elements: the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a, crRNA and cauliflower&#8208;like large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies (CLD). CLIPON uses the Cas12a/crRNA complex both to recognize a target of interest and to release CLD&#8208;bound hCG so that target presence can translate into a colorimetric signal on the PTS. We demonstrate the versatility of CLIPON through sensitive and specific detection of HPV genomic DNA, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA and adenosine. We also engineer a cell phone app and a hand&#8208;held microchip to achieve signal quantification. CLIPON represents an attractive option for biosensing and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylcyanation of Ynamides: Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Access to Tetrasubstituted 3&#8208;Silyl&#8208;2&#8208;Aminoacrylonitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles (&#945;&#8208;enaminonitriles) are underinvestigated building blocks due to the lack of methodologies to synthesize them in a controlled manner. A general access to these valuable scaffolds accompanied by mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations is described. This highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective strategy relies on the use of the first intermolecular silylcyanation of ynamides.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed silylcyanation of ynamides is described. This reaction is fully regioselective, delivering tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles derivatives exclusively. Unexpectedly, the nature (aryl or alkyl) of the substituent located at the &#946;&#8208;position of the ynamide directly controls the stereoselectivity. The reaction tolerates a number of functional groups and can be considered as the first general access to fully substituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles. Given the singular reactivity observed, a computational study was performed to shed light on the mechanism of this intriguing transformation. Relying on the specific reactivity of the newly installed vinylsilane functionality, the scope of 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles has been enlarged by postfunctionalization.

         <title>Coordinating the Mechanisms of Action of Ferroptosis and the Photothermal Effect for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cancer theranostic nanomedicine (denoted as Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA) was designed by attentively considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and the photothermal effect to promote maximum synergy of the therapeutic effects in combination therapy. The pH/GSH&#8208;responsive therapeutic and imaging characteristics of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles in the tumor enabled safe and reliable cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Combination therapy based on different mechanisms of cell death has shown promise in tumor therapy. However, when different modalities are integrated, the maximum synergy of the therapeutic effects is often lacking in the design. Herein, we report a cancer theranostic nanomedicine formula developed by considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and the photothermal effect in combination therapy. The croconaine molecule was encapsulated as both a photothermal converter and an iron&#8208;chelating agent with BSA, thus leading to biocompatible and stable Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles (NPs). The Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA NPs in the tumor milieu showed an activated photothermal effect leading to enhanced radical formation owing to the temperature&#8208;dependent Fenton reaction kinetics, while radical formation during ferroptosis in turn prevented the heat&#8208;induced formation of heat shock proteins and thus the self&#8208;protection mechanism of cancer cells in response to heat. The activatable photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging performance of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA NPs also enabled safe and reliable cancer theranostics.

         <title>A Class of Rigid&#8211;Flexible Coupling Crystalline Crosslinked Polymers as Vapomechanical Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of rigid&#8211;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers is fabricated for the first time. The polymers can form self&#8208;standing membranes showing outstanding vapomechanically responsive performance.







Abstract
Fabricating mechanically responsive actuators that can efficiently convert external stimuli into mechanical work is of great significance for real&#8208;world applications. Herein, we rationally design a class of rigid&#8211;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers (CCPs) to fabricate vapomechanically responsive actuators. Interfacial condensation reactions of flexible macromers with rigid monomers afford a series of freestanding CCP membranes. Notably, it is the first example where crosslinked polymers show high crystallinity and porosity. Moreover, the CCP membranes exhibit good mechanical properties and interesting vapor&#8208;triggered actuation performance, which is reversible and repeatable. We find that the unusual polymer structures, high vapor sorption, and anisotropic membranes contribute to the directional deformation performance of the CCP actuators. The synthesis approach in this work provides new insights into the design and fabrication of smart materials for advanced applications.

         <title>A Descriptor for Accurate Predictions of Host Molecules Enabling Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Guest Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although doping can induce room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom free organic systems, it is often challenging to match the host and guest components to achieve efficient intersystem crossing for activating RTP. In this work, we developed a simple descriptor &#916;  E  to predict host molecules for matching the guest RTP emitters, based on the intersystem crossing  via  higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism. This descriptor successfully predicted five commercially available host components to pair with naphthalimide (NA) and naphtho[2,3&#8208;c]furan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione (2,3&#8208;NA) emitters with high accuracy of 83%. The yielded pairs exhibited bright yellow and green RTP with the quantum efficiency up to 0.4 and lifetime up to 1.67 s, respectively. Using these RTP pairs, we successfully achieved multi&#8208;layer message encryption. The &#916;  E  descriptor could provide an efficient way for developing doping&#8208;induced RTP materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover in a Cobalt Complex on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover is induced in self&#8208;assembled tetramers of a Co&#8208;complex on Ag(111) surfaces via the injection of electrons or holes with a scanning tunneling microscope. The resulting memristive current&#8211;voltage characteristic is analysed in terms of the electron transport through the molecular d&#8208;orbitals.







Abstract
The Co&#8208;based complex [Co(H2B(pz)(pypz))2] (py=pyridine, pz=pyrazole) deposited on Ag(111) was investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy at &#8776;5&#8197;K. Due to a bis(tridentate) coordination sphere the molecules aggregate mainly into tetramers. Individual complexes in these tetramers undergo reversible transitions between two states with characteristic image contrasts when current is passed through them or one of their neighbors. Two molecules exhibit this bistability while the other two molecules are stable. The transition rates vary linearly with the tunneling current and exhibit an intriguing dependence on the bias voltage and its polarity. We interpret the states as being due to S=1/2 and 3/2 spin states of the Co2+ complex. The image contrast and the orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude variations of the switching yields can be tentatively understood from the calculated orbital structures of the two spin states, thus providing first insights into the mechanism of electron&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (ELIESST).

         <title>The Orbital Origins of Chemical Bonding in Ge&#8722;Sb&#8722;Te Phase&#8208;Change Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wavefunction analysis of phase&#8208;change materials in terms of interacting atomic orbitals reveals the decisive role of electron&#8208;rich multicenter interactions, similar yet different from the molecular case. The rather uncommon properties of these phases such as bond&#8208;breaking behavior and other structural peculiarities arise as a natural consequence of electron&#8208;rich multicenter bonding in condensed matter.







Abstract
Layered phase&#8208;change materials in the Ge&#8722;Sb&#8722;Te system are widely used in data storage and are the subject of intense research to understand the quantum&#8208;chemical origin of their unique properties.

&lt;p&gt;Wavefunction analysis of phase-change materials in terms of interacting atomic orbitals reveals the decisive role of electron-rich multicenter interactions, similar yet different from the molecular case. The rather uncommon properties of these phases such as bond-breaking behavior and other structural peculiarities arise as a natural consequence of electron-rich multicenter bonding in condensed matter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered phase-change materials in the Ge&#8722;Sb&#8722;Te system are widely used in data storage and are the subject of intense research to understand the quantum-chemical origin of their unique properties. To uncover the nature of the underlying periodic wavefunction, we have studied the interacting atomic orbitals including their phases by means of crystal orbital bond index and fragment crystal orbital analysis. In full accord with findings based on projected force constants, we demonstrate the role of multicenter bonding along straight atomic connectivities. While the resulting multicenter bonding resembles three-center-four-electron bonding in molecules, its solid-state manifestation leads to distinct long-range consequences, thus serving to contextualize the material properties usually termed &#8220;metavalent&#8221;. Eventually we suggest multicenter bonding to be the origin of their astonishing bond-breaking and phase-change behavior, as well as the too small &#8220;van-der-Waals&#8221; gaps between individual layers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery with a Wide Operation&#8208;Temperature Range from &#8722;70 to 100&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide&#8208;temperature range sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB), which involves a Bi anode, a NFPP@C cathode and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte is successfully fabricated. Owing to the solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism of the Bi anode, the high Na+ diffusion coefficient of the NFPP@C cathode at low temperature and the electrolyte with a high boiling point and low freezing point, the prepared SIB can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), as one of the potential candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems, are required to tackle extreme weather conditions. However, the all&#8208;weather SIBs with a wide operation&#8208;temperature range are rarely reported. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature range SIB, which involves a carbon&#8208;coated Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na+ can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de&#8208;solvent process. Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na+ diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low&#8208;temperature behavior. Even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C, this battery still delivers 70.19&#8201;% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature of up to 100&#8201;&#176;C. These results are encouraging for the further exploration of wide&#8208;temperature range SIBs.

         <title>Regulation of High Miscibility for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transport in n&#8208;doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong interchain interactions of conjugated polymers usually result in poor miscibility with molecular dopants, limiting the doping efficiency because of uncontrolled phase separation. We develop a strategy to achieve efficient charge&#8208;transport and high doping miscibility in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. We solve the miscibility issue through disorder side&#8208;chains containing dopants better. Systemic structural characterization reveals a farther side&#8208;chain branching point will lead to higher disorders, which provides appropriate sites to accommodate extrinsic molecular dopants without harming original chain packings and charge&#8208;transport channels. Therefore, better sustainability of solid&#8208;state microstructure is obtained, yielding a stable conductivity even when overloading massive dopants. This work highlights the importance of realizing high host&#8211;dopant miscibility in molecular doping of conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Local Atomic Environments of Indium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Production of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination engineering strategy based on a p&#8208;block In single&#8208;atom catalyst with N,S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination on hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC) has been developed. DFT results and electrochemical analysis show a superior 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction performance of the In SAs/NSBC catalyst in alkaline and neutral solutions, which is ascribed to synergistic effects between first&#8208;coordinated N/S, second&#8208;coordinated B, and single In atoms.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth understanding of local atomic environment&#8211;property relationships of p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalysts toward the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has rarely been reported. Here, guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, we develop a heteroatom&#8208;modified In&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;assisted approach to accurately synthesize an optimal catalyst, in which single In atoms are anchored by combined N,S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination supported by the hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC). The In SAs/NSBC catalyst exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity of above 95&#8201;% in a wide range of pH. Furthermore, the In SAs/NSBC&#8208;modified natural air diffusion electrode exhibits an unprecedented production rate of 6.49&#8197;mol peroxide&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and 6.71&#8197;mol&#8201;peroxide&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M PBS electrolyte. This strategy enables the design of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom materials, and provides practical guidance for H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Switchable Polymerization Organocatalysis: From Monomer Mixtures to Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot production of sequence&#8208;controlled block copolymer from mixed monomers is a crucial but rarely reached goal. Using a switchable Lewis&#8208;Pair organocatalyst, we have accomplished sequence&#8208;selective polymerization from a mixture of  O  &#8208;carboxyanhydride (OCA) and epoxide. Polymerization of OCA monomer occurs first and exclusively because of its exceedingly high polymerizability. When OCA is fully consumed, alternating copolymerization of epoxide and CO  2  liberated in OCA polymerization is triggered from the termini of the first block. The two polymerizations thus occur tandemly, both in chemoselective fashions, so that sequence&#8208;controlled block polymer with up to 99% CO  2  conversion is furnished in this one&#8208;pot protocol. Calculations and experimental results demonstrate a chemoselective and cooperative mechanism, where the high polymerizability of OCA monomers guarantees exquisite sequence selectivity and the cooperative decarboxylation partly arose from the stabilization effect by triethylborane, facilitates the smooth transformation of the chain end from carbonate to alkoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Fluorescent Dinuclear Aluminium Complex with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high natural abundance of aluminium makes the respective fluorophores attractive for various optical applications, but photoluminescence quantum yields above 0.7 have yet not been reported for solutions of aluminium complexes. In this contribution, a dinuclear aluminium(III) complex featuring enhanced photoluminescence properties is described. Its facile one&#8208;pot synthesis originates from a readily available precursor and trimethyl aluminium. In solution, the complex exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescence

quantum yield near unity (&#934;absolute 1.0 &#177; 0.1) and an excited&#8208;state lifetime of 2.3 ns. In the solid state, J&#8208;aggregation and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching are noticed, but still quantum yields of 0.6 are observed. Embedding the complex in electrospun non&#8208;woven fabrics yields a highly fluorescent fleece possessing a quantum yield of 0.9 &#177; 0.04.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high natural abundance of aluminium makes the respective fluorophores attractive for various optical applications, but photoluminescence quantum yields above 0.7 have yet not been reported for solutions of aluminium complexes. In this contribution, a dinuclear aluminium(III) complex featuring enhanced photoluminescence properties is described. Its facile one-pot synthesis originates from a readily available precursor and trimethyl aluminium. In solution, the complex exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescence

quantum yield near unity (&#934;absolute 1.0 &#177; 0.1) and an excited-state lifetime of 2.3 ns. In the solid state, J-aggregation and aggregation-caused quenching are noticed, but still quantum yields of 0.6 are observed. Embedding the complex in electrospun non-woven fabrics yields a highly fluorescent fleece possessing a quantum yield of 0.9 &#177; 0.04.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Additions of C&#8208;F Bonds to the Silanide Anion [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds exhibiting main group elements in low oxidation states were found to mimic the reactivity of transition metal complexes. Like the latter, such main group species show a proclivity of changing their oxidation state as well as their coordination number by +2, therefore fulfilling the requirements for oxidative additions. Prominent examples of such main group compounds that undergo oxidative additions with organohalides R&#8208;X (R = alkyl, aryl, X = F, Cl, Br, I) are carbenes and their higher congeners. Aluminyl anions, which like carbenes and silylenes oxidatively add to strong &#963;&#8208;bonds in R&#8208;X species, have been recently discovered. We present the first anion based upon a group 14 element, namely the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide anion, [Si(C  2  F  5  )  3  ]  &#8722;  , which is capable of oxidative additions towards C&#8208;F bonds. This enables the isolation of non&#8208;chelated tetraorganofluorosilicate salts, which to the best of our knowledge had only been observed as reactive intermediates before.</dc:description>

         <title>Drastic Events and Gradual Change Define the Structure of an Active Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Alumina Catalyst for Methanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;zinc&#8208;alumina (CZA) catalyst is one of the most important catalysts. Nevertheless, the still limited understanding of the complex CZA structure hampers further optimization. Critical to the production of a highly active and stable catalyst are optimal start&#8208;up procedures in hydrogen. Here, by employing operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, we follow how the industrial CZA precursor evolves into the working catalyst. Two major events in the activation drastically alter the copper&#8208; and zinc&#8208;containing components in the CZA catalyst and define the final working catalyst structure: the reduction of the starting copper(II) oxide and the switch to catalytic conditions. These drastic structural changes are accompanied by the gradual structural change. Understanding what happens during these events is key to develop tailored start&#8208;up protocols that are aimed at maximal longevity and activity of the catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for Chaperone&#8208;Independent Ubiquitination of Tau Protein by its E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau protein found in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease filaments hints at the failed attempt of neurons to remove early toxic species. The ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of Tau is regulated in vivo by the E3 ligase CHIP, a quality controller of the cell proteome dedicated to target misfolded proteins for degradation. In our study, by using site&#8208;resolved NMR, biochemical and computational methods, we elucidate the structural determinants underlying the molecular recognition between the ligase and its intrinsically disordered substrate. We reveal a multi&#8208;domain dynamic interaction that explains how CHIP can direct ubiquitination of Tau at multiple sites even in the absence of chaperones, including its typical partner Hps70/Hsc70. Our findings thus provide mechanistic insight into the chaperone&#8208;independent engagement of a disordered protein by its E3 ligase.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolution of High Mechanical Strength Dry&#8208;Network Polythiourethane Thermosets into Neat Macroscopic Hollow Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organism&#8208;inspired hollow structure attracts increasing interest to construct various bionic functional hollow materials. Next&#8208;generation self&#8208;evolution hollow material tends to combine simple synthesis, high mechanical strength, and regular shape. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermoset with excellent mechanical performance. The polymer film could evolve into a neat and well&#8208;organized object with a macroscopic hollow interior structure after being immersed in aqueous NaOH solution. The self&#8208;evolution hollow structure originated from a hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network, which was later transformed into a network bearing both hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. The swelling and thickness growth of this material could be controlled by the NaOH concentration and the immersion time. This unique self&#8208;evolution behavior was further utilized to produce a series of macroscopic 3D hollow&#8208;containing molds, which could be potentially applied in the production of smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Polymeric Nanobeacon for Monitoring the Fluctuation of Hydrogen Polysulfides During Fertilization and Embryonic Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fertilization  and early  embryonic development  as the beginning of a new life are key biological events. Hydrogen polysulfide (  H  2  S  n  ) plays important roles during physiological regulation, such as antioxidation&#8208;protection. However, no report studied  in situ  H  2  S  n  fluctuation during early embryonic development because of the low abundance of  H  2  S  n  and inadequate sensitivity of probes. We herein construct a polymeric nanobeacon  from H  2  S  n  &#8208;responsive polymer and  fluorophores, which is capable of detecting H  2  S  n  selectively and signal amplification. Taking the zebrafish as a model, the polymeric nanobeacon revealed that H  2  S  n  level was significantly elevated after fertilization due to the activation of cell multiplication,  suppressed  partially during embryonic development, and finally keep  steady  up to  zebrafish  emergence. This strategy is generally accessible for biomarkers by altering the responsive unit on and significant for facilitating biological analysis during life development.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Solid&#8208;State Multiple Phase Changes with Tuned Photoemission in a Gold Thiolate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of an universal memory that exhibits fast access speed, high&#8208;density storage, and non&#8208;volatility has fueled research into phase&#8208;change materials over the past decades. In spite of the efficiency of the inorganic chalcogenides for Phase&#8208;Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM), they still have some inherent drawbacks, such as high temperature required for phase change and difficulty to control the domain size of the phase change, because of their brittleness. Here we present a Au(I)&#8208;thiolate coordination polymer which undergoes two successive phase changes on application of mild heating (&lt; 200 &#176;C) from amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline1&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline2 phases. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding. More importantly, each phase exhibits different photoluminescent properties for an efficient optical read&#8208;out. We believe that the ability of the Au(I)&#8208;thiolate coordination polymer to have reversible phase changes under soft conditions but at the same time display district optical signals can pave the way for the next generation of PCRAM.</dc:description>

         <title>A TMEDA&#8208;Iron Adduct Reaction Manifold in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we expand the current molecular&#8208;level understanding of one of the most important and effective additives in iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). Focusing on relevant phenyl and ethyl Grignard reagents and slow nucleophile addition protocols commonly used in effective catalytic systems, TMEDA&#8208;iron(II)&#8208;aryl intermediates are identified via in situ spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and detailed reaction studies to be a part of an iron(II)/(III)/(I) reaction cycle where radical recombination FePhBr(TMEDA) (2Ph) results in selective product formation in high yield. These results differ from prior studies with mesityl Grignard reagent, where poor product selectivity and low catalytic performance can be attributed to homoleptic iron&#8208;ate species. Overall, this study represents a critical advance in how amine additives such as TMEDA can modulate selectivity and reactivity of organoiron species in cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Rewritable Macromolecular Data Storage with Automated Read&#8208;out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rewriting data stored on synthetic macromolecules is an interesting feature, even though it is considered as being quite challenging within the area of digital macromolecules. In this context, we initially studied a strategy for modifying the position tag of sequence&#8208;encoded macromolecules in a reversible manner. The efficiency of this method, which relies on the orthogonal cleavage of a thioester moiety  via  aminolysis, was demonstrated by modifying parts of an exemplary sentence. Simultaneously, a novel algorithm was developed to ease the read&#8208;out of macromolecular information by means of MS/MS techniques. This program, Oligoreader, can identify potential information&#8208;containing macromolecules from a series of MS  1  spectra, analyze the corresponding MS  2  spectra, and finally decode the data. Consequently, the algorithm simplifies the entire read&#8208;out process by avoiding any interference from the operator, which increases the potential for blind sequencing of uniform macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Asymmetric Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with EQE of 32.8% and Extremely Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters show great potentials for high color purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the simultaneous realization of high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel asymmetric MR&#8208;TADF emitter (2Cz&#8208;PTZ&#8208;BN) is designed that fully inherits the high PLQY and large kRISC values of the properly selected parent molecules. The resonating extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton with peripheral protection can achieve high PLQY of 96% and fast kRISC of above 1.0&#215;105 s&#8208;1, and boost the performance of corresponding pure green device with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 32.8% without utilizing any sensitizing hosts. Remarkably, the device sufficiently maintains high EQE of exceeding 23% at a high luminance of 1000 cd m&#8208;2, representing the highest value for reported green MR&#8208;TADF materials at the same luminescence.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contemporary years, the increasing demand for high&#8208;capacity and safe energy storage has spurred wide attentions in zinc batteries featuring either high voltage, high capacity or both. Despite the extensive research progress, achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc batteries is still challenging and requires a synergy of the multiple factors including reaction mechanisms, electrodes, and electrolytes. In this Review, we comprehensively summarize the rational design strategies, and critically analyze the positive effects and potential issues in optimizing the electrochemistry, cathode materials, electrolytes and device architecture. At the end, the challenges and prospects for the further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc batteries are outlined to guide the research towards new&#8208;generation batteries for household appliance, low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage system.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Lock Label Based on Thermosensitive Polymer Hydrogels for Information Camouflage and Multi&#8208;level Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing extra safety encryption technologies to prevent information leakage and combat fakes is highly demanded but challenging. Herein, we propose a &#8220;double lock&#8221; strategy based on both lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer hydrogels for information camouflage and multilevel encryption. Two types of hydrogels were synthesized by the method of random copolymerization. The number of &#8208;CO&#8208;NH2 groups in the network structure of the hydrogels changed the enthalpic or entropic of thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels, and ultimately precisely controlled their phase transition temperature. The crosslink density of the polymer hydrogels governs the diffusion kinetics, resulting in difference in the time for their color change. The combination of multiple LCST and UCST hydrogels in one label realized information encryption and dynamic information identification in the dimensions of both time and temperature. This work is of high inspiration for the fields of information encryption, anticounterfeiting, and smart responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Single Atom Coating Strategy Based on Tannic Acid Chemistry for Multifunctional Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a universal single atom coating (SAC) strategy by taking advantage of rich chemistry of tannic acid (TA). TA units not only self&#8208;assemble into a cross&#8208;linked porous polyphenolic framework, but also can grip on different substates via multiple binding modes. Benefiting from the diverse chelating ability of TA, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic SACs can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.g., carbon, SiO  2  , TiO  2  , MoS  2  ), dimensions (0D &#8211; 3D) and sizes (50 nm &#8211; 5 cm). By contrast, uniform SAC cannot be achieved using common approaches such as pyrolysis of metal&#8208;dopamine complex or metal organic frameworks. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, two Co SACs immobilized on the graphene and TiO  2  were prepared. The previous one shows six&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C toward oxygen reduction. The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owning to the high activity of single atoms and the formation of SAC coating&#8208;TiO  2  heterojunction.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enhanced Aromatics Selectivity by Coupling of Chloromethane and Carbon Monoxide over H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation of methane into high value&#8208;added chemicals such as aromatics provides a more desired approach towards sustainable chemistry but remains a critical challenge due to the low selectivity of aromatics and poor stability. Herein, we first report a coupling reaction of CH3Cl and CO (CCTA) based on methane conversion, which achieves extremely high aromatics selectivity (82.2%) with the selectivity of BTX up to ca. 60% over HZSM&#8208;5. The promoting effects have been demonstrated on other zeolites especially 10&#8208;membered rings (10 MR) zeolites. Multiple characterizations show that 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentene&#8208;1&#8208;one&#160;(DMCPO) is generated from acetyl groups and olefins.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transformation of methane into high value-added chemicals such as aromatics provides a more desired approach towards sustainable chemistry but remains a critical challenge due to the low selectivity of aromatics and poor stability. Herein, we first report a coupling reaction of CH3Cl and CO (CCTA) based on methane conversion, which achieves extremely high aromatics selectivity (82.2%) with the selectivity of BTX up to ca. 60% over HZSM-5. The promoting effects have been demonstrated on other zeolites especially 10-membered rings (10 MR) zeolites. Multiple characterizations show that 2,3-dimethyl-2-cyclopentene-1-one&#160;(DMCPO) is generated from acetyl groups and olefins. Furthermore, isotopic labeling analysis confirms that CO is inserted into the DMCPO and aromatics rings. A new aromatization mechanism is proposed, including the formation of the above intermediates, which conspicuously weakens the hydrogen transfer reaction, leading to a considerable increase of aromatics selectivity and a dramatic drop of alkanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing the Development of Recyclable Aromatic Polyesters by Functionalization and Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of innovative synthetic polymer systems to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer&#8217;s depolymerizability and performance properties is highly demanded for advanced material applications and sustainable development. In this contribution, we prepared a class of aromatic cyclic esters (  M1  &#8208;  M5  ) from thiosalicylic acid and epoxides by facile one&#8208;pot synthesis. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of  M  s afforded aromatic polyesters P(  M  )s with high molecular weights and narrow dispersities. The physical and mechanical properties of P(  M  )s can be modulated by stereocomplexation and regulation of the side&#8208;chain flexibility of the polymers, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance properties such as high thermal stability and crystallinity (  T  m  up to 209 &#176;C), as well as polyolefin&#8208;like high mechanical strength, ductility, and toughness. Furthermore, the functionalizable moieties of P(  M  )s have driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access to value&#8208;added materials. More importantly, the P(  M  )s were able to selectively depolymerize into monomers in excellent yields, thus establishing its circular life cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ON&#8208;OFF Switchable Hydrogenation Using a Molecular Shuttle based on a [2]Rotaxane with a Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel pH&#8208;responsive molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand,  [2]Rotaxane&#8208;H&#8208;Phos  , was designed and synthesized. In the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides, ON&#8208;OFF switchable catalysis was accomplished in high ON&#8208;OFF ratios upon acid/base&#8208;adjusting the movements of the rotaxane wheels located at the catalyst terminals. Mechanistic studies by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and quasi  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that Rh(III)&#8208;hydride species were possibly formed under H  2  atmosphere in the catalyst OFF&#8208;state. In this process, a heterolytic activation of dihydrogen occurred by the interlocked rotaxane dibenzylamine and Rh(I) catalytic center, acting as a frustrated Lewis pair. Subsequent homolytic splitting of dihydrogen with the newly formed Rh(I)&#8208;H species generated Rh(III)&#8208;hydride species. On the basis of these findings, a substrate selective hydrogenation was achieved by using the OFF&#8208;state catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes is described for the first time. Aromatic terminal alkynes bearing diverse and sensitive functional groups as well as aliphatic terminal alkynes are efficiently transformed to 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes. The key to achieve selective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is to control appropriately the acidity of the reaction solution, which is accomplished by a combined use of pivalic acid and  para  &#8208;toluenesulfonic acid.

         <title>Flexible Soft&#8208;Solid Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for H2/CO2&#160;Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a facile strategy to construct defect&#8208;free and flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membrane with high selectivity and good scalability holds great appeal. Here we report the fabrication of soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes on polyvinylidene fluoride substrates. A representative membrane comprised of quasi&#8208;vertically grown lamellar Zn  2  (Bim)  4  (Bim = benzimidazolate) and lateral ultrathin polyamide film adhering to the MOF side facets. The straight interlayer galleries within unwrapped Zn  2  (Bim)  4  &#160;acted as predominant pathways, while polyamide served the function of defect elimination, synergistically inducing an unprecedented H  2  /CO  2  &#160;selectivity as high as 1084. Separation performance was held constant after membrane rolling up into a tube with a diameter of 3 mm or folding and unfolding at 90&#176; for 50 times. ZIF&#8208;67 and ZIF&#8208;8 composite membranes based on this strategy also realized extremely high H  2  /CO  2  &#160;separation accuracies. These results which may demonstrate the intrinsic molecular sieving capability of MOFs will promote the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes in practical separation applications.</dc:description>

The D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 4&#8208;((9&#8208;phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethynyl)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D was smartly designed and synthesized to fabricate self&#8208;assembled CZNI nanoribbons for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. It was revealed that the molecular dipole field could significantly reduce the exciton binding energy of the organic semiconductor and drive exciton dissociation to free charges for reducing protons to H2.







Abstract
D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 4&#8208;((9&#8208;phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethynyl)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D and A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type bis[(4,4&#8242;&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl]ethyne (NINI) with a negligible dipole moment of 0.28&#8197;D, were smartly designed and synthesized to demonstrate the evidence of a molecular dipole as the dominant mechanism for controlling charge separation of organic semiconductors. In aqueous solution, these two novel naphthalimides can self&#8208;assemble to form nanoribbons (NRs) that present significantly different traces of exciton dissociation dynamics. Upon photoexcitation of NINI&#8208;NRs, no charge&#8208;separated excitons (CSEs) are formed due to the large exciton binding energy, accordingly there is no hydrogen evolution. On the contrary, in the photoexcited CZNI&#8208;NRs, the initial bound Frenkel excitons are dissociated to long&#8208;lived CSEs after undergoing ultrafast charge transfer within ca. 1.25&#8197;ps and charge separation within less than 5.0&#8197;ps. Finally, these free electrons were injected into Pt co&#8208;catalysts for reducing protons to H2 at a rate of ca. 417&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, correspondingly an apparent quantum efficiency of ca. 1.3&#8201;% can be achieved at 400&#8197;nm.

&lt;p&gt;The D-&#960;-A type 4-((9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)ethynyl)-N-dodecyl-1,8-naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D was smartly designed and synthesized to fabricate self-assembled CZNI nanoribbons for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. It was revealed that the molecular dipole field could significantly reduce the exciton binding energy of the organic semiconductor and drive exciton dissociation to free charges for reducing protons to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D-&#960;-A type 4-((9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)ethynyl)-N-dodecyl-1,8-naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D and A-&#960;-A type bis[(4,4&#8242;-1,8-naphthalimide)-N-dodecyl]ethyne (NINI) with a negligible dipole moment of 0.28&#8197;D, were smartly designed and synthesized to demonstrate the evidence of a molecular dipole as the dominant mechanism for controlling charge separation of organic semiconductors. In aqueous solution, these two novel naphthalimides can self-assemble to form nanoribbons (NRs) that present significantly different traces of exciton dissociation dynamics. Upon photoexcitation of NINI-NRs, no charge-separated excitons (CSEs) are formed due to the large exciton binding energy, accordingly there is no hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Dendritic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Structure, Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with radial pores is provided. Perspectives into their formation mechanisms, synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships and future research directions with a focus on biomedical applications are presented.







Abstract
Recently, dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles with widespread applications have attracted great interest. Despite many publications (&gt;800), the terminology &#8220;dendritic&#8221; is ambiguous. Understanding what possible &#8220;dendritic structures&#8221; are, their formation mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationship is fundamentally important. With the advance of characterization techniques such as electron tomography, two types of tree&#8208;branch&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like structures can be distinguished, both described as &#8220;dendritic&#8221; in the literature. In this Review, we start with the definition of &#8220;dendritic&#8221;, then provide critical analysis of reported dendritic silica nanoparticles according to their structural classification. We update the understandings of the formation mechanisms of two types of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; nanoparticles, highlighting how to control their structural parameters. Applications of dendritic mesoporous nanoparticles are also reviewed with a focus on the biomedical field, providing new insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship in this family of nanomaterials.

         <title>Asymmetric Cyclopropanation and Epoxidation via a Catalytically Formed Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric installation of a chiral auxiliary gives access to enantioenriched oxazolidines bearing a tetra&#8208;substituted olefin from readily available propargylic amines. In this work, we extend the use of the catalytically formed chiral auxiliary, previously limited to hydrogenation, to asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation using simple and robust reaction conditions for accessing highly substituted products.







Abstract
For the enantioselective diversification of a single starting material, a different chiral catalyst is usually required for each transformation. Herein, we extend the concept of catalytically formed chiral auxiliary from hydrogenation to the asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation of tetra&#8208;substituted olefins, alleviating the need for different chiral catalysts in the alkene functionalization step. The chiral auxiliary is catalytically constructed from propargylic amines in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective carboetherification step using a commercially available trifluoroacetaldehyde hemiacetal tether. The installed auxiliary is then controlling the stereochemistry of the cyclopropanation and the epoxidation using standard highly reactive reagents to give enantioenriched spirocyclic aminomethylcyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.

         <title>Highly Efficient Polarizing Agents for MAS&#8208;DNP of Proton&#8208;Dense Molecular Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polarizing agent is introduced to efficiently polarize proton&#8208;dense solids through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) ssNMR. This work shows that this new biradical can be used on organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies at high field and fast magic angle spinning (MAS). It notably unlocks the rapid acquisition of 13C&#8211;13C and 15N&#8211;13C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.







Abstract
Efficiently hyperpolarizing proton&#8208;dense molecular solids through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR is still an unmet challenge. Polarizing agents (PAs) developed so far do not perform well on proton&#8208;rich systems, such as organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies. Herein we introduce a new PA, cAsymPol&#8208;POK, and report outstanding hyperpolarization efficiency on 12.76&#8197;kDa U&#8208;13C,15N&#8208;labeled LecA protein and pharmaceutical drugs at high magnetic fields (up to 18.8&#8197;T) and fast magic angle spinning (MAS) frequencies (up to 40&#8197;kHz). The performance of cAsymPol&#8208;POK is rationalized by MAS&#8208;DNP simulations combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). This work shows that this new biradical is compatible with challenging biomolecular applications and unlocks the rapid acquisition of 13C&#8211;13C and 15N&#8211;13C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Chemodivergent Allenylic Alkylation of Vinyl Azides for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Allenylic Amides and Ketones**

         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective allenylic alkylation of unstabilized enolates is enabled by cooperative iridium and Lewis acid catalysis using vinyl azide as an amide and ketone enolate surrogate. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, these desiccant&#8208;controlled chemodivergent fragment&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;:&#8201;0.1 e.r.







Abstract
The first enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones through allenylic alkylation of vinyl azides is reported. In these chemodivergent reactions, cooperatively catalyzed by a IrI/(phosphoramidite,olefin) complex and Sc(OTf)3, vinyl azides act as the surrogate for both amide enolates and ketone enolates. The desiccant (molecular sieves) plays a crucial role in controlling the chemodivergency of this enantioconvergent and regioselective reaction: Under otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of the desiccant led to &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides, while its absence resulted in &#945;&#8208;allenylic ketones. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, the overall process represents a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT), where both the products are formed with the same absolute configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of vinyl azide as the ketone enolate surrogate in an enantioselective transformation.

         <title>Inhibition of ACE2&#8208;Spike Interaction by an ACE2 Binder Suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Entry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein could be limited in inhibiting viral entry via the RBD&#8211;ACE2 interaction due to the emerging spike mutations. Instead, targeting ACE2 with a small molecule could suppress the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into the host cells, without impairing the enzymatic activity of ACE2, which is necessary for the physiological function of the host cells.







Abstract
The emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants is a significant concern in developing effective therapeutics and vaccines in the middle of the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we have identified a novel small molecule that inhibited the interactions between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBDs and ACE2 by modulating ACE2 without impairing its enzymatic activity necessary for normal physiological functions. Furthermore, the identified compounds suppressed viral infection in cultured cells by inhibiting the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our study suggests that targeting ACE2 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry into host cells and prevent the development of COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Transient Plasmonic Imaging of Ion Migration on Single Nanoparticles and Insight for Double Layer Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion migration on single nanoparticles was directly measured by using a transient microscopy method. Under nanoscale and transient conditions, the electric double layer (EDL) dynamics can deviate significantly from the prediction made by using the classical resistance&#8211;capacitance model. A new model was proposed to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation.







Abstract
Single&#8208;nanoparticle electrochemistry offers electrochemical behaviors of individual entities beyond the ensemble system. An electric double layer (EDL) exists on any charged particle&#8211;liquid interface because of counter&#8208;ion accumulation, while direct measuring of the interfacial ion migration remains a challenge. Herein, a plasmonic&#8208;based transient microscopic method, with a temporal resolution of 1&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;s, was demonstrated to directly track the ion migration dynamics on single charged nanoparticles. We found that the dynamics of EDL formation might deviate significantly from the prediction made by using the classical resistance&#8211;capacitance (RC) model under nanoscale and transient conditions. Under ultrafast charging, due to the limit migration rate of ions in the solution, the actual time scale of the EDL formation could be up to 5&#8197;times slower than the predicted value from the RC model. We then proposed a new theoretical model to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation. These results may expand our current knowledge about nano&#8208;electrochemistry and transient electrochemistry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric reductive cyclization/coupling reaction of 1,6&#8208;dienes and alkyl bromides is reported. A chiral tertiary alcohol and a quaternary stereocenter are constructed by a single operation with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We have developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric reductive cyclization/coupling of 1,6&#8208;dienes. The reaction provides an efficient method for constructing a chiral tertiary alcohol and a quaternary stereocenter by a single operation. The method has excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, a broad substrate scope, as well as good tolerance of functional groups. Preliminary mechanism studies show that alkyl nickel(I) species are involved in the reaction.

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Bipolar Hosts for RGB Phosphorescent OLEDs: Boosted by a &#8220;Butterfly&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Medium&#8208;Ring Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;medium&#8208;ring&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design structurally nontraditional host molecules. A brand&#8208;new type of bipolar hosts with a twisted &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; heptagonal acceptor (EtBP), which features an electron&#8208;deficient benzophenone fragment with a flexible ethylidene bridge, enables the assembly of high&#8208;performance RGB phosphorescent OLEDs.







Abstract
The emitting layer based on a host&#8211;guest system plays a crucial role in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While emitters have witnessed rapid progress in structural diversity, hosts still rely heavily on traditional structures and are underdeveloped. Herein a &#8220;medium&#8208;ring&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design structurally nontraditional host molecules, which are not only rotatable enough to suppress close &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thus reducing exciton annihilation, but also rigid enough to prevent excessive conformational flipping, thus inhibiting non&#8208;radiative decay. Accordingly, a brand&#8208;new type of bipolar hosts with a twisted &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped heptagonal acceptor (EtBP), which features an electron&#8208;deficient benzophenone fragment with a flexible ethylidene bridge, has been developed. With satisfactory morphological stability and well&#8208;balanced hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting properties, the EtBP&#8208;based bipolar hosts enable high&#8208;performance RGB phosphorescent OLEDs with small efficiency roll&#8208;off, which are superior to those of acyclic benzophenone&#8208;based devices.

         <title>WSe2 Flakelets on N&#8208;Doped Graphene for Accelerating Polysulfide Redox and Regulating Li Plating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elaborately designed WSe2 flakelets decorated on the N&#8208;doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with an abundant active site can not only act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and significantly alleviate the shuttling effect, but also as a regulator for enabling uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is still limited by the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling effect on the S cathode and uncontrollable Li&#8208;dendrite growth on the Li anode. Herein, elaborately designed WSe2 flakelets immobilized on N&#8208;doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with abundant active sites are employed to be a dual&#8208;functional host for satisfying both the S cathode and Li anode synchronously. On the S cathode, the WSe2/NG with a strong interaction towards LiPSs can act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of LiPSs. On the Li anode, the WSe2/NG with excellent lithiophilic features can regulate the uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite. Taking advantage of these merits, the assembled Li&#8722;S full batteries exhibit remarkable rate performance and stable cycling stability even at a higher sulfur loading of 10.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a negative to positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio of 1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1.

&lt;p&gt;Elaborately designed WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flakelets decorated on the N-doped graphene (WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NG) with an abundant active site can not only act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and significantly alleviate the shuttling effect, but also as a regulator for enabling uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is still limited by the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling effect on the S cathode and uncontrollable Li-dendrite growth on the Li anode. Herein, elaborately designed WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flakelets immobilized on N-doped graphene (WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NG) with abundant active sites are employed to be a dual-functional host for satisfying both the S cathode and Li anode synchronously. On the S cathode, the WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NG with a strong interaction towards LiPSs can act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of LiPSs. On the Li anode, the WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NG with excellent lithiophilic features can regulate the uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite. Taking advantage of these merits, the assembled Li&#8722;S full batteries exhibit remarkable rate performance and stable cycling stability even at a higher sulfur loading of 10.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a negative to positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio of 1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Diyne Cyclization via [1,2]&#8208;Stevens&#8208;Type Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Chiral Chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrroles</title>

A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade cyclization/[1,2]&#8208;Stevens&#8208;type rearrangement is disclosed, affording valuable chiral chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrroles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents the first catalytic asymmetric [1,2]&#8208;Stevens&#8208;type rearrangement based on alkynes and the first asymmetric formal carbene insertion into the Si&#8722;O bond.







Abstract
Here, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade cyclization/[1,2]&#8208;Stevens&#8208;type rearrangement via a non&#8208;diazo approach, leading to the practical and atom&#8208;economic assembly of various valuable chiral chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrroles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to good yields with wide substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first example of catalytic asymmetric [1,2]&#8208;Stevens&#8208;type rearrangement based on alkynes but also constitutes the first asymmetric formal carbene insertion into the Si&#8722;O bond.

Half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts serve as a unique platform for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation, affording a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aldimines and alkenes with broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208;, diastereoselectivity and 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency.







Abstract
Here we report for the first time the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation of a wide range of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via the activation of an unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts. This protocol offers a straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aliphatic aldimines and alkenes. The annulation of aldimines with styrenes exclusively afforded the 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane derivatives with excellent diastereoselectivity through the 2,1&#8208;insertion of a styrene unit. The annulation of aldimines with aliphatic alkenes selectively gave the 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane products in a 1,2&#8208;insertion fashion. A catalytic amount of an appropriate amine such as adamantylamine (AdNH2) or dibenzylamine (Bn2NH) showed significant effects on the catalyst activity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Manipulation of Multiple Cell&#8211;Cell Interactions by Tunable DNA Scaffold Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and effective living cell encapsulation strategy is developed for reversible manipulation of cell&#8211;cell interactions. The controllable cell&#8211;cell interactions and molecular transportation between cells was achieved by fabricating functional DNA scaffold networks on cell surface. This DNA scaffold network&#8208;based strategy holds great potential in cell surface engineering, synthetic biology, and cell&#8208;based biomedicine.







Abstract
Manipulation of cell&#8211;cell interactions via cell surface engineering has potential biomedical applications in tissue engineering and cell therapy. However, manipulation of the comprehensive and multiple intercellular interactions remains a challenge and missing elements. Herein, utilizing a DNA triangular prism (TP) and a branched polymer (BP) as functional modules, we fabricate tunable DNA scaffold networks on the cell surface. The responsiveness of cell&#8211;cell recognition, aggregation and dissociation could be modulated by aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA scaffold networks with high accuracy and specificity. By regulating the DNA scaffold networks coated on the cell surface, controlled intercellular molecular transportation is achieved. Our tunable network provides a simple and extendible strategy which addresses a current need in cell surface engineering to precisely manipulate cell&#8211;cell interactions and shows promise as a general tool for controllable cell behavior.

         <title>Preparing Two&#8208;Dimensional Ordered Li0.33La0.557TiO3 Crystal in Interlayer Channel of Thin Laminar Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte towards Ultrafast Li+ Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
2D LLTO crystal with large&#8208;size, oriented, and crystal defect&#8208;free structure was obtained by controlling the LLTO crystal growth and arrangement in the confined space of 2D laminar channels, which achieved faster Li+ transfer than LLTO Pellet.







Abstract
Inorganic superionic conductor holds great promise for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the ionic conductivity of traditional inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is always unsatisfactory owing to the grain boundary resistance and large thickness. Here, a 13&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;thick laminar framework with &#8776;1.3&#8197;nm interlayer channels is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling rigid, hydrophilic vermiculite (Vr) nanosheets. Then, Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) precursors are impregnated in interlayer channels and afterwards in situ sintered to large&#8208;size, oriented, and defect&#8208;free LLTO crystal. We demonstrate that the confinement effect permits ordered arrangement of LLTO crystal along the c&#8208;axis (the fastest Li+ transfer direction), permitting the resultant 15&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;thick Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte an ionic conductivity of 8.22&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and conductance of 87.2&#8197;mS at 30&#8201;&#176;C. These values are several times&#8217; higher than that of traditional LLTO&#8208;based electrolytes. Moreover, Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte has a compressive modulus of 1.24&#8197;GPa. Excellent cycling performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery.

         <title>Indomethacin Polymorph &#948; Revealed To Be Two Plastically Bendable Crystal Forms by 3D Electron Diffraction: Correcting a 47&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Misunderstanding**

         <dc:description>
The structures of the third polymorph of indomethacin, Form &#948;, crystallized from both melt and solution are reported. The two crystallization methods were believed to produce the same polymorph since its discovery in 1974. Through combining microdroplet melt crystallization with 3D electron diffraction, we reveal that the two crystallization methods produce two different polymorphs and correct this 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding.







Abstract
Indomethacin is a clinically classical non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form &#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. &#948;&#8208;indomethacin cannot be cultivated as large single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray crystallography and, therefore, its crystal structure has not yet been determined. Here, we report the structure elucidation of &#948;&#8208;indomethacin by 3D electron diffraction and reveal the truth that melt&#8208;crystallized and solution&#8208;crystallized &#948;&#8208;indomethacin are in fact two polymorphs with different crystal structures. We propose to keep the solution&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#948; and name the melt&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#952;. Intriguingly, both structures display plastic flexibility based on a slippage mechanism, making indomethacin the first drug to have two plastic polymorphs. This discovery and correction of a 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding signify that 3D electron diffraction has become a powerful tool for polymorphic structural studies.

         <title>Refining of Particulates at Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Interfaces: Label&#8208;Free Sorting and Isolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;to&#8208;adsorbent&#8208;based sorting of fine particles, including cells, is engineered by minimizing the masking effect of non&#8208;specific interactions. Due to a high contact area and hence high detachment energy, even non&#8208;specifically and weakly interacting particulates are quasi&#8208;irreversibly bound to adsorbents. Microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic interfaces provide a solution for sorting highly asymmetric cell and particle mixtures.







Abstract
The mechanism of separation methods, for example, liquid chromatography, is realized through rapid multiple adsorption&#8208;desorption steps leading to the dynamic equilibrium state in a mixture of molecules with different partition coefficients. Sorting of colloidal particles, including protein complexes, cells, and viruses, is limited due to a high energy barrier, up to millions kT, required to detach particles from the interface, which is in dramatic contrast to a few kT for small molecules. Such a strong interaction renders particle adsorption quasi&#8208;irreversible. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption equilibrium is approached very slowly, if ever attainable. This limitation is alleviated with a local oscillating repulsive mechanical force generated at the microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer interface to switch between adsorption and mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;facilitated desorption of the particles. Such a dynamic regime enables the separation of colloidal mixtures based on the particle&#8208;polymer interface affinity, and it could find use in research, diagnostics, and industrial&#8208;scale label&#8208;free sorting of highly asymmetric mixtures of colloids and cells.

         <title>Transformation Pathways in Colloidal CdTeSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ternary magic&#8208;size cluster (MSC), CdTeSe MSC&#8208;422 evolved at room temperature while CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399 decreased in a mixture of toluene (Tol) and octylamine (OTA). The transformation goes through corresponding precursor compounds (PCs), with step&#8197;1 transforming PC&#8208;399 to PC&#8208;422, which is rate&#8208;determining and features first&#8208;order reaction kinetics.







Abstract
A rarely studied transformation in colloidal ternary magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) is addressed. We report the first observation of the transformation from ternary CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399 to MSC&#8208;422, which occurs at room temperature. These two MSC types display sharp optical absorption resonances at 399 and 422&#8197;nm, respectively, and are related in that they are quasi isomers, together with their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs). Binary CdTe and CdSe samples were prepared in the prenucleation stage also called the induction period (IP). After they were mixed and placed in a mixture of toluene and octylamine, the transformation was found to take place and to be assisted by the addition of the CdSe IP sample. A binary IP sample contains corresponding binary PCs and monomers (Mo) and fragments (Fr). We argue that the transformation pathway is enabled by the corresponding ternary PCs, involving the substitution reaction, namely CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;1 &#8658; CdTeSe PC&#8208;422 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;2. The present study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the formation characteristics of the MSCs.

         <title>Surface Gelation on Disulfide Electrocatalysts in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface gelation on disulfide electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;S batteries is identified for the first time. The gel layer, formed through the solvent polymerization triggered by the Lewis acid sites, covers the active electrocatalytic sites and renders reduced redox kinetics. Herein, a Lewis base triethylamine is introduced to suppress the surface gelation and promote the electrocatalytic activity of disulfide electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are deemed as future energy storage devices due to ultrahigh theoretical energy density. Cathodic polysulfide electrocatalysts have been widely investigated to promote sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Probing the surface structure of electrocatalysts is vital to understanding the mechanism of polysulfide electrocatalysis. In this work, we for the first time identify surface gelation on disulfide electrocatalysts. Concretely, the Lewis acid sites on disulfides trigger the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the dioxolane solvent to generate a surface gel layer, covering disulfides and reducing the electrocatalytic activity. Accordingly, a Lewis base triethylamine (TEA) is introduced as a competitive inhibitor. Consequently, Li&#8211;S batteries with disulfide electrocatalysts and TEA afford high specific capacity and improved rate responses. This work affords new insights on the actual surface structure of electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>The Crystal Plane is not the Key Factor for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methane Electrosynthesis on Reconstructed Cu2O Microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;depth mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on in&#8197;situ reconstructed Cu2O microparticles is still ambiguous. Now strong evidence shows that the Cu2O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane production rather than the initial crystal planes of the Cu2O microparticles.







Abstract
Cu2O microparticles with controllable crystal planes and relatively high stability have been recognized as a good platform to understand the mechanism of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we demonstrate that the in&#8197;situ generated Cu2O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane formation, rather than the initial crystal plane of the reconstructed Cu2O microparticles. Experimental results indicate that the methane evolution is dominated on all three different crystal planes with similar Tafel slopes and long&#8208;term stabilities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that *CO is protonated via a similar bridge configuration at the Cu2O/Cu interface, regardless of the initial crystal planes of Cu2O. The Gibbs free energy changes (&#916;G) of *CHO on different reconstructed Cu2O planes are close and more negative than that of *OCCOH, indicating the methane formation is more favorable than ethylene on all Cu2O crystal planes.

Now strong evidence shows that the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane production rather than the initial crystal planes of the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O microparticles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O microparticles with controllable crystal planes and relatively high stability have been recognized as a good platform to understand the mechanism of the electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). Herein, we demonstrate that the in&#8197;situ generated Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane formation, rather than the initial crystal plane of the reconstructed Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O microparticles. Experimental results indicate that the methane evolution is dominated on all three different crystal planes with similar Tafel slopes and long-term stabilities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that *CO is protonated via a similar bridge configuration at the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu interface, regardless of the initial crystal planes of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The Gibbs free energy changes (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;) of *CHO on different reconstructed Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O planes are close and more negative than that of *OCCOH, indicating the methane formation is more favorable than ethylene on all Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O crystal planes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Visualization of Monogenic RNA G&#8208;quadruplex and Occupied G&#8208;quadruplex Ratio through a Module&#8208;Assembled Multifunctional Probes Assay (MAMPA)</title>

Recognizing monogenic RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) in vivo is challenging. We developed a module&#8208;assembled multifunctional probes assay (MAMPA) for visualizing endogenous G4s in individual genes in single cells.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid secondary structure, regulate many biological functions and are considered potential molecular targets for cancer therapeutics. However, due to the lack of analytical methods, the regulating mechanism of monogenic G4s is still unclear. Here, we developed a Module Assembled Multifunctional Probes Assay (MAMPA) for visualizing endogenous G4s in individual genes in single cells. Two modular probes separately recognize G4 structures and the adjacent RNA sequences, and the module assembly enables imaging of G4s in an individual RNA with high specificity. Through imaging G4s in several individual genes, we found that G4s were steadily occupied by G4 Binding Proteins (G4BPs) in various mRNAs in every cell line and defined &#8220;Occupied G4 Ratio&#8221;. We demonstrated MAMPA was suitable for most experimental situations and found that Occupied G4 Ratios had the potential to become a new parameter for the study of G4s in living cells.

         <title>Lactone Backbone Density in Rigid Electron&#8208;Deficient Semiconducting Polymers Enabling High n&#8208;type Organic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers, P&#8208;0, P&#8208;50, and P&#8208;75 are developed, in which the lactone group densities were maximized by increasing the benzene content from 0&#8201;% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50&#8201;% (P&#8208;50), and 75&#8201;% (P&#8208;75), to enable co&#8208;planar polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level. As a result, the polymer of P&#8208;75 exhibits a good thermoelectric performance with a maximum electrical conductivity of 12&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8208;1 and figure of merit power factor of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8208;1&#8197;K&#8208;2.







Abstract
Three lactone&#8208;based rigid semiconducting polymers were designed to overcome major limitations in the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics, namely electrical conductivity and air stability. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated that increasing the lactone group density by increasing the benzene content from 0&#8201;% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50&#8201;% (P&#8208;50), and 75&#8201;% (P&#8208;75) resulted in progressively larger electron affinities (up to 4.37&#8197;eV), suggesting a more favorable doping process, when employing (N&#8208;DMBI) as the dopant. Larger polaron delocalization was also evident, due to the more planarized conformation, which is proposed to lead to a lower hopping energy barrier. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity increased by three orders of magnitude, to achieve values of up to 12&#8197;S&#8201;cm and Power factors of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8722;1&#8197;K&#8722;2 were thereby enabled. These findings present new insights into material design guidelines for the future development of air stable n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

         <title>Rational Design of Axially Chiral Styrene&#8208;Based Organocatalysts and Their Application in Catalytic Asymmetric (2+4) Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts has been rationally designed. They enable the chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines. This work represents the first design of styrene&#8208;based chiral thiourea tertiary amine catalysts and the first catalytic asymmetric (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines, and it gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts.







Abstract
A new class of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based thiourea tertiary amine catalysts, which have unique characteristics such as an efficient synthetic route, multiple chiral elements, and multiple activating groups, has been rationally designed. These new chiral catalysts have proven to be efficient organocatalysts, enabling the chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines with homophthalic anhydrides in good yields (up to 96&#8201;%) with excellent stereoselectivities (all &gt;95:5 dr, up to 98&#8201;% ee). More importantly, theoretical calculations elucidated the important role of an axially chiral styrene moiety in controlling both the reactivity and enantioselectivity. This work not only represents the first design of styrene&#8208;based chiral thiourea tertiary amine catalysts and the first catalytic asymmetric (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines, but also gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts.

         <title>Unexpected Role of a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Family Protein in Type II Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family protein, MrqM, was revealed as a cyclase in the biosynthesis of murayaquinone by the in vivo genetic experiment, which is a new strategy used in type II polyketide cyclization. This finding not only broadens the functions of the short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins, but also paves the way for future work in polyketide cyclization and engineering.







Abstract
We investigated the biosynthetic pathway of type II polyketide murayaquinone. The murayaquinone biosynthetic cluster contains genes for three putative short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family enzymes including MrqF and MrqH with known functions and MrqM with unclear function. We report the functional characterization of MrqM for its role in murayaquinone biosynthesis. Our gene deletion experiment and structural elucidation of the accumulated intermediates revealed that MrqM is related with the second polyketide ring cyclization, because the inactivation of mrqM resulted in the accumulation of an off&#8208;pathway intermediate SEK43 and disrupted the second and third ring cyclization. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies showed that two conserved residues in MrqM and homologous proteins Y151 and K155 are essential for its activity. The previously proposed second/third ring cyclase, MrqD, might instead play another important role in the chain releasing step of the murayaquinone biosynthesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Expanding Ion&#8208;Transport Channels on Anodes for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A concept of self&#8208;expanding Li&#8208;ion transport channels is demonstrated to construct a fast&#8208;charging anode and realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The self&#8208;expanded Li&#8208;ion transport channels, which are enabled by a self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode, allow a fast Li&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics and effectively eliminate Li metal plating under fast&#8208;charging conditions.







Abstract
We propose self&#8208;expanding lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to construct a fast&#8208;charging anode and realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The self&#8208;expanded Li&#8208;ion transport channels can be enabled by a self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode driven by the interactions with Li ions during cycling, reduce the energy barrier of Li&#8208;ion transport and allow a fast Li&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state diffusion, whereby the severe voltage polarization and Li metal plating are effectively eliminated. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds on the surface of graphdiyne successfully verifies the self&#8208;expanded Li&#8208;ion transport channels, self&#8208;accelerated Li in&#8208;plane/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration, and superior fast&#8208;charging capability with a high capacity (342&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan (22&#8201;000 cycles) under extremely fast&#8208;charging conditions (6&#8201;C rate, 1&#8201;C=744&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), even at low temperatures (&#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Transformation of Crowded Oligoarylene into Perylene&#8208;Cored Chiral Nanographene by Sequential Oxidative Cyclization and 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crowded perylene&#8208;cored oligoarylene processively transforms into &#960;&#8208;extended chiral nanographenes with two helical breaches under Scholl's conditions. The acquisition of various intermediates implies a distinctive reaction pathway mainly involving the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the peri&#8208; and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1&#8208;phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration.







Abstract
Synthetic innovation for constructing sophisticated nanographenes is of fundamental significance for a variety of advanced applications. Herein, we report a distinctive method to prepare &#960;&#8208;extended chiral nanographenes with 29 benzenoid rings and two helical breaches from a highly crowded perylene&#8208;cored oligoarylene precursor. Under Scholl's conditions, the reaction predominantly involves the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the peri&#8208; and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1&#8208;phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. The resulting chiral nanographenes are configurationally stable at 180&#8201;&#176;C due to the high diastereomerization barriers of ca. 45&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. These molecules also possess globally delocalized &#960;&#8208;systems with low HOMO/LUMO gaps, leading to nearly panchromatic absorption, intensive electronic circular dichroism signals and deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence.

Episulfide&#8208;involved self&#8208;switchable polymerization to produce well&#8208;defined sulfur&#8208;rich triblock thermoplastic elastomers has been achieved via an ammonium salt mediated copolymerization of episulfide/isothiocyanate together with an air&#8208;assisted oxidative coupling strategy.







Abstract
Construction of well&#8208;defined sulfur&#8208;rich macromolecules in a facile manner is an interesting but challenging topic. Herein, we disclose how to readily construct well&#8208;defined triblock sulfur&#8208;rich thermoplastic elastomers via a self&#8208;switchable isothiocyanate/episulfide copolymerization and air&#8208;assisted oxidative coupling strategy. During self&#8208;switchable polymerization, alternating copolymerization of isothiocyanate and episulfide occurs initially due to the lower energy barrier for isothiocyanate insertion with respect to successive episulfide ring&#8208;opening. After exhaustion of isothiocyanate, ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfide begins, providing diblock polymers. Subsequent exposure of the reaction to air leads to a transformation of diblock copolymers into triblock thermoplastic elastomers. This protocol can be extended to diverse isothiocyanates and episulfides, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of the performance of the produced sulfur&#8208;rich thermoplastic elastomers.

         <title>A Carbene Strategy for Progressive (Deutero)Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroalkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbene strategy for the sequential (deutero)hydrodefluorination of fluoroalkyl ketones is reported. This method allowed for the controllable preparation of difluoroalkyl&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl ketones from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted perfluoroalkyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Hydrodefluorination is one of the most promising chemical strategies to degrade perfluorochemicals into partially fluorinated compounds. However, controlled progressive hydrodefluorination remains a significant challenge, owing to the decrease in the strength of C&#8722;F bonds along with the defluorination. Here we describe a carbene strategy for the sequential (deutero)hydrodefluorination of perfluoroalkyl ketones under rhodium catalysis, allowing for the controllable preparation of difluoroalkyl&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl ketones from aryl&#8208; and even alkyl&#8208;substituted perfluoro&#8208;alkyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The reaction mechanism and the origin of the intriguing chemoselectivity of the reaction were rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of Poly(silylether)s: Access to Degradable Polymers from Renewable Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of renewable polymers has been synthesized from easily accessible biobased hydroxyaldehydes and dihydrosilanes. Using low catalyst loadings of platinum complexes, different polymer architectures were obtained, from random to alternated copolymers. The intrinsic chemical recyclability of these poly(silylether)s is also highlighted.







Abstract
The design of new materials with tunable properties and intrinsic recyclability, derived from biomass under mild conditions, stands as a gold standard in polymer chemistry. Reported herein are platinum complexes which catalyze the formation of poly(silylether)s (PSEs) at low catalyst loadings. These polymers are directly obtained from dual&#8208;functional biobased building blocks such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) or vanillin, coupled with various dihydrosilanes. Access to different types of copolymer architectures (statistical or alternating) is highlighted by several synthetic strategies. The materials obtained were then characterized as low Tg materials (ranging from &#8722;60 to 29&#8201;&#176;C), stable upon heating (T&#8722;5% up to 301&#8201;&#176;C) and resistant towards uncatalyzed methanolysis. Additionally, quantitative chemical recycling of several PSEs could be triggered by acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis or methanolysis. These results emphasize the interest of biobased poly(silylether)s as sustainable materials with high recycling potential.

The materials obtained were then characterized as low &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; materials (ranging from &#8722;60 to 29&#8201;&#176;C), stable upon heating (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#8722;5%&lt;/sub&gt; up to 301&#8201;&#176;C) and resistant towards uncatalyzed methanolysis. Additionally, quantitative chemical recycling of several PSEs could be triggered by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or methanolysis. These results emphasize the interest of biobased poly(silylether)s as sustainable materials with high recycling potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Boronate&#8208;Affinity Crosslinking&#8208;Amplified Dynamic Light Scattering Immunoassay for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Glycoprotein Detection</title>

Herein, we report a universal boronate&#8208;affinity crosslinking&#8208;amplified dynamic light scattering immunosensing strategy and demonstrate its potential for the rapid and sensitive field detection of glycoproteins in complex samples.







Abstract
Herein, we report a universal boronate&#8208;affinity crosslinking&#8208;amplified dynamic light scattering (DLS) immunoassay for point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) glycoprotein detection in complex samples. This enhanced DLS immunoassay consists of two elements, i.e., antibody&#8208;coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNP@mAb) for target capture and DLS signal transduction, and phenylboronic acid&#8208;based boronate&#8208;affinity materials as crosslinking amplifiers. Upon the addition of targets, glycoproteins are first captured by MNP@mAb and amplified by target&#8208;induced crosslinking stemming from the selective binding between the boronic acid ligand and cis&#8208;diol&#8208;containing glycoprotein, thereby resulting in a remarkably increased DLS signal in the average nanoparticle size. Benefiting from the multivalent binding and fast boronate&#8208;affinity reaction between glycoproteins and crosslinkers, the proposed immunosensing strategy has achieved the ultrasensitive and rapid quantitative assay of glycoproteins at the fM level within 15&#8197;min. Overall, this work provides a promising and versatile design strategy for extending the DLS technique to detect glycoproteins even in the field or at POC.

         <title>Branched Poly(Aryl Piperidinium) Membranes for Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) membranes with high conductivity (147&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent mechanical (26&#8201;% swelling ratio) and chemical stability have been prepared. Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) using these membranes exhibit high peak power density (2.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durability (500&#8197;h).







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a promising, next&#8208;generation fuel cell technology. AEMFCs require highly conductive and robust anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs), which are challenging to develop due to the tradeoff between conductivity and water uptake. Here we report a method to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) AEMs. We show that branching reduces water uptake, leading to improved dimensional stability. The optimized membrane, b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5, exhibits simultaneously high OH&#8722; conductivity (&gt;145&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C), high mechanical strength and dimensional stability, good processability, and excellent alkaline stability (&gt;1500&#8197;h) in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C. AEMFCs based on b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 reached peak power densities of 2.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8722;O2 and 1.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;air at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The AEMFCs can run stably under a constant current of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 500&#8197;h, during which the b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 membrane remains stable.

         <title>Initiating Electron Transfer in Doubly Curved Nanographene Upon Supramolecular Complexation of C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave&#8211;convex interactions between negatively and positively curved molecular nanographene with C60 allow the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms solvent dependent electron transfer after photo&#8208;excitation.







Abstract
The formation of supramolecular complexes between C60 and a molecular nanographene endowed with both positive and negative curvatures is described. The presence of a corannulene moiety and the saddle shape of the molecular nanographene allows the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. The association constants for the three possible supramolecular complexes were determined by 1H&#8197;NMR titration. Furthermore, the stability of the three complexes was calculated by theoretical methods that also predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption measurements on the ns&#8208;time scale showed that the addition of C60 to NG&#8208;1 solutions and photo&#8208;exciting them at 460&#8197;nm leads to the solvent&#8208;dependent formation of new species, in particular the formation of the one&#8208;electron reduced form of C60 in benzonitrile was observed.

         <title>An Activatable Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Nanocomposite as Early Evaluation System of Therapy Effect</title>

In&#8197;vivo &#8220;Turn&#8208;On&#8221; NIR&#8208;II FL and NIR&#8208;II PA signals by using activated caspases&#8208;3 after radiotherapy to proteolytically cleave the peptide sequence of an AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048 nanoprobe, in addition to integrating living imaging information with a radiotherapy effect using the caspase&#8208;3 enzyme as &#8220;matchmaker&#8221; and developing the relationship between each other, enable real&#8208;time evaluation and early prediction of radiotherapy effects.







Abstract
Delays in evaluating cancer response to radiotherapy (RT) usually reduce therapy effect or miss the right time for treatment optimization. Hence, exploring timely and accurate methods enabling one to gain insights of RT response are highly desirable. In this study, we have developed an apoptosis enzyme (caspase&#8208;3) activated nanoprobe for early evaluation of RT efficacy. The nanoprobe bridged the nanogapped gold nanoparticles (AuNNPs) and the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) molecules (IR&#8208;1048) through a caspase&#8208;3 specific peptide sequence (DEVD) (AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048). After X&#8208;ray irradiation, caspase&#8208;3 was activated to cut DEVD, turning on both NIR&#8208;II FL and PA imaging signals. The increased NIR&#8208;II FL/PA signals exhibited a positive correlation with the content of caspase&#8208;3. Moreover, the amount of the activated caspase&#8208;3 was negatively correlated with the tumor size. The results underscore the role of the caspase&#8208;3 activated by X&#8208;ray irradiation in bridging the imaging signals variation and tumor inhibition rate. Overall, activatable NIR&#8208;II FL/PA imaging was successfully used to timely predict and evaluate the RT efficacy. The evaluation system based on biomarker&#8208;triggered living imaging has the capacity to guide treatment decisions for numerous cancer types.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Regulation of Defect Sites and Vertical Conduction by Spiral Domain for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we proposed a structural model of a spiral MoTe2 domain to optimize collectively active site and vertical conduction. A single spiral MoTe2&#8208;based electrocatalytic microdevice was fabricated to extract HER activity and displayed exceptional activity with an ultrahigh current density of 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 0.4&#8197;V.







Abstract
Insufficient active sites and weak vertical conduction are the intrinsic factors that restrict the electrocatalytic HER for transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides. As a prototype, we proposed a model of spiral MoTe2 to optimize collectively the above issues. The conductive atomic force microscopy of an individual spiral reveals that the retentive vertical conduction irrespective of layer thickness benefits from the connected screw dislocation lines between interlayers. Theoretical calculations uncover that the regions near the edge step of the spiral structures more easily form Te vacancies and have lower &#916;GH* as extra active sites. A single spiral MoTe2&#8208;based on&#8208;chip microcell was fabricated to extract HER activity and achieved an ultrahigh current density of 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 0.4&#8197;V, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the exfoliated counterpart. Profoundly, this unusual spiral model will initiate a new pathway for triggering other inert catalytic reactions.

         <title>Remote Amino Acid Recognition Enables Effective Hydrogen Peroxide Activation at a Manganese Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid supramolecular recognition in the 2nd coordination sphere of a bioinspired manganese catalyst allows efficient enzyme&#8208;like activation of H2O2 by locating the carboxylic acid moiety in proper position to access the 1st coordination sphere of the metal.







Abstract
Precise delivery of a proton plays a key role in O2 activation at iron oxygenases, enabling the crucial O&#8722;O cleavage step that generates the oxidizing high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species. Such a proton is delivered by acidic residues that may either directly bind the iron center or lie in its second coordination sphere. Herein, a supramolecular strategy for enzyme&#8208;like H2O2 activation at a biologically inspired manganese catalyst, with a nearly stoichiometric amount (1&#8211;1.5&#8197;equiv) of a carboxylic acid is disclosed. Key for this strategy is the incorporation of an &#945;,&#969;&#8208;amino acid in the second coordination sphere of a chiral catalyst via remote ammonium&#8208;crown ether recognition. The properly positioned carboxylic acid function enables effective activation of hydrogen peroxide, leading to catalytic asymmetric epoxidation. Modulation of both amino acid and catalyst structure can tune the efficiency and the enantioselectivity of the reaction, and a study on the oxidative degradation pathway of the system is presented.

         <title>Reversible Covalent Headpiece Enables Interconversion between Double&#8208; and Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) encoding method featuring a &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221; is described, which allows efficient interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA forms. Hybridization and covalent crosslinking of ssDEL with diversified complementary functionalized DNAs enables multiple DEL applications.







Abstract
The use of a proper encoding methodology is one of the most important aspects when practicing DEL technology. A &#8220;headpiece&#8221;&#8208;based double&#8208;stranded DEL encoding method is currently the most widely used for productive DEL. However, the robustness of double&#8208;stranded DEL construction conflicts with the versatility presented by single&#8208;stranded DEL applications. We here report a novel encoding method, which is based on a &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221;. The RCHP allows reversible interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA formats, providing an avenue to robust synthesis and allowing for the applications in distinct setups. We have validated the versatility of this encoding method with encoded self&#8208;assembled chemical library and DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic library technology. Notably, based on the RCHP&#8208;settled library construction, a unique &#8220;ternary covalent complex&#8221; mediating ligand isolation methodology against non&#8208;immobilized targets was developed.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction Kinetics on Atomically Dispersed Monovalent ZnI Sites by Rationally Engineering Proton&#8208;Feeding Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed twisted ZnI&#8208;N3+1 structure was developed to accelerate a proton&#8208;feeding process that reduces the energy barrier of, and thereby promotes, the kinetics of the CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for CO2 utilization, however the CO2RR process involving multi&#8208;electron and proton transfer is greatly limited by poor selectivity and low yield. Herein, We have developed an atomically dispersed monovalent zinc catalyst anchored on nitrogenated carbon nanosheets (Zn/NC NSs). Benefiting from the unique coordination environment and atomic dispersion, the Zn/NC NSs exhibit a superior CO2RR performance, featuring a high current density up to 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;95&#8201;%. The center ZnI atom coordinated with three N atoms and one N atom that bridges over two adjacent graphitic edges (Zn&#8208;N3+1) is identified as the catalytically active site. Experimental results reveal that the twisted Zn&#8208;N3+1 structure accelerates CO2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *CO2 to *COOH, while theoretical calculations elucidate that atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N3+1 moieties decrease the potential barriers for intermediate COOH* formation, promoting the proton&#8208;coupled CO2RR kinetics and boosting the overall catalytic performance.

         <title>A General Approach to Design Dual Ratiometric Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Probes for Quantitatively Visualizing Tumor Hypoxia Levels In&#8197;Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described a general energy balance approach by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized platform, the first dual&#8208;ratio NIRF/PA response probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2 was designed for quantitatively and precisely monitoring of tumor hypoxia levels in vivo.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an energy balance strategy between fluorescence and photoacoustic effects by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized scaffold, we reported the first dual&#8208;ratio response of nitroreductase probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2, which allows quantitative visualization of tumor hypoxia in&#8197;vivo. AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2, composed of a new NIRF/PA scaffold thioxanthene&#8208;hemicyanine (AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;1) and a 4&#8208;nitrobenzene moiety, showed a 10&#8208;fold ratiometric NIRF enhancement (I773/I733) and 2.4&#8208;fold ratiometric PA enhancement (PA730/PA670) upon activation by a biomarker (nitroreductase, NTR) associated with tumor hypoxia. Moreover, the dual ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging accurately quantified the hypoxia extent with high sensitivity and high imaging depth in xenograft breast cancer models. More importantly, the 3D maximal intensity projection (MIP) PA images of the probe can precisely differentiate the highly heterogeneous oxygen distribution in solid tumor. Thus, this study provides a promising NIRF/PA scaffold that may be generalized for the dual ratiometric imaging of other disease&#8208;relevant biomarkers.

     alt="A General Approach to Design Dual Ratiometric Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Probes for Quantitatively Visualizing Tumor Hypoxia Levels In&#8197;Vivo"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have described a general energy balance approach by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized platform, the first dual-ratio NIRF/PA response probe AS-Cy-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was designed for quantitatively and precisely monitoring of tumor hypoxia levels in vivo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we describe an energy balance strategy between fluorescence and photoacoustic effects by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized scaffold, we reported the first dual-ratio response of nitroreductase probe AS-Cy-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which allows quantitative visualization of tumor hypoxia in&#8197;vivo. AS-Cy-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, composed of a new NIRF/PA scaffold thioxanthene-hemicyanine (AS-Cy-1) and a 4-nitrobenzene moiety, showed a 10-fold ratiometric NIRF enhancement (I&lt;sub&gt;773&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;733&lt;/sub&gt;) and 2.4-fold ratiometric PA enhancement (PA&lt;sub&gt;730&lt;/sub&gt;/PA&lt;sub&gt;670&lt;/sub&gt;) upon activation by a biomarker (nitroreductase, NTR) associated with tumor hypoxia. Moreover, the dual ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging accurately quantified the hypoxia extent with high sensitivity and high imaging depth in xenograft breast cancer models. More importantly, the 3D maximal intensity projection (MIP) PA images of the probe can precisely differentiate the highly heterogeneous oxygen distribution in solid tumor. Thus, this study provides a promising NIRF/PA scaffold that may be generalized for the dual ratiometric imaging of other disease-relevant biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The concept of self&#8208;expanding lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to construct a fast&#8208;charging anode is proposed by Guoxing Li, Yuliang Li, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202113313). The self&#8208;expanding lithium&#8208;ion transport channels can be achieved by a self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode driven by the interactions with lithium ions during cycling. They reduce the energy barrier of lithium&#8208;ion transport, accelerate lithium&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state diffusion, and thus enable an excellent fast&#8208;charging performance.

Indomethacin is an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form&#8197;&#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. By using a combination of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED or MicroED) and microdroplet melt crystallization, Ming Lu, Hongyi Xu et&#8197;al. reveal in their Research Article (e202114985) that Form&#8197;&#948; consists of two plastically bendable crystal forms. This discovery and the correction of a 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding signify that MicroED diffraction has become a powerful tool for polymorphic structural studies.

A loop deletion mutant of outer membrane protein&#8197;F (OmpF) that facilitates the cellular uptake of decoy molecules into Escherichia coli has been developed. In their Communication (e202111612), Osami Shoji and co&#8208;workers report that co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type CYP102A1 enables an E.&#8197;coli&#8208;based whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst to efficiently oxidise benzene, alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes with the help of decoy molecules, bringing this system a significant step closer to practical applications.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Peptide and Protein Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine reagents are commonly used for the development of novel transformations. As they are highly reactive and biocompatible, they have been employed more recently for the functionalization of biomolecules. This Minireview discusses the development of hypervalent iodine reagents for the modification of peptides and proteins as well as their application, such as for labeling and peptide stapling.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds are powerful reagents for the development of novel transformations. As they exhibit low toxicity, high functional group tolerance, and stability in biocompatible media, they have been used for the functionalization of biomolecules. Herein, we report recent advances up to June 2021 in peptide and protein modification using hypervalent iodine reagents. Their use as group transfer or oxidizing reagents is discussed in this Minireview, including methods targeting polar, aromatic, or aliphatic amino acids and peptide termini.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Monofluoroalkylation: Strategies for the Synthesis of Alkyl Fluorides by C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides an overview of recent developments in the synthesis of chiral (enantioenriched or racemic) secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides by monofluoroalkylation catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes. Strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity&#8208;generating, but they have been studied less than strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;F bond formation (fluorination).







Abstract
Alkyl fluorides modulate the conformation, lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and pKa of compounds containing aliphatic motifs and, therefore, have been valuable for medicinal chemistry. Despite significant research in organofluorine chemistry, the synthesis of alkyl fluorides, especially chiral alkyl fluorides, remains a challenge. Most commonly, alkyl fluorides are prepared by the formation of C&#8722;F bonds (fluorination), and numerous strategies for nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical fluorination have been reported in recent years. Although strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity&#8208;generating, they have been studied less than methods based on fluorination. This Review provides an overview of recent developments in the synthesis of chiral (enantioenriched or racemic) secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides by monofluoroalkylation catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes. We expect this contribution will illuminate the potential of monofluoroalkylations to simplify the synthesis of complex alkyl fluorides and suggest further research directions in this growing field.

         <title>Chemical Batteries with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable energy systems cannot exist without the storage of volatile renewable electricity. Whereas electrical batteries can be used for small amounts of energy, chemical batteries are required for large amounts of energy. The hydrogenation of CO2 is one promising option for chemical batteries. The intricate material science of Cu catalysts to control the selectivity of this reaction is discussed in detail in this Review.







Abstract
Efforts to obtain raw materials from CO2 by catalytic reduction as a means of combating greenhouse gas emissions are pushing the boundaries of the chemical industry. The dimensions of modern energy regimes, on the one hand, and the necessary transport and trade of globally produced renewable energy, on the other, will require the use of chemical batteries in conjunction with the local production of renewable electricity. The synthesis of methanol is an important option for chemical batteries and will, for that reason, be described here in detail. It is also shown that the necessary, robust, and fundamental understanding of processes and the material science of catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 does not yet exist.

         <title>Controlling the Complexity and Interconversion Mechanisms in Self&#8208;Assembled [Fe2L3]4+ Helicates and [Fe4L6]8+ Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic system of interconverting helicates and cages was prepared and characterized. The presence of steric bulk on the central ring of the ligand was found to control both the complexity and interconversion mechanism.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled coordination cages and metal&#8211;organic frameworks have relied extensively on symmetric ligands in their formation. Here we have prepared a relatively simple system employing an unsymmetric ligand that results in two distinct self&#8208;assembled structures, a [Fe2L3]4+ helicate and a [Fe4L6]8+ cage composed of 10 interconverting diastereomers and their enantiomers. We show that the steric profile of the ligand controls the complexity, thermodynamics and kinetics of interconversion of the system.

         <title>Relating Conformational Equilibria to Conformer&#8208;Specific Lipophilicities: New Opportunities in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catching conformations: Lipophilicity (logP) is a molecular property which is nevertheless the weighted average of the lipophilicities of the individual conformers. The first direct measurement of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicity values is presented, together with the introduction of a new avenue for rational lipophilicity optimization of drug candidates which is focused on modification of conformational equilibria in water and in octanol.

Efficient drug discovery is based on a concerted effort in optimizing bioactivity and compound properties such as lipophilicity, and is guided by efficiency metrics that reflect both aspects. While conformation&#8211;activity relationships and ligand conformational control are known strategies to improve bioactivity, the use of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicities (logp) is much less explored. Here we show how conformer&#8208;specific logp values can be obtained from knowledge of the macroscopic logP value, and of the equilibrium constants between the individual species in water and in octanol. This is illustrated with fluorinated amide rotamers, with integration of rotamer 19F NMR signals as a facile, direct method to obtain logp values. The difference between logp and logP optimization is highlighted, giving rise to a novel avenue for lipophilicity control in drug discovery.

&lt;p&gt;Catching conformations: Lipophilicity (log&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;) is a molecular property which is nevertheless the weighted average of the lipophilicities of the individual conformers. The first direct measurement of conformer-specific lipophilicity values is presented, together with the introduction of a new avenue for rational lipophilicity optimization of drug candidates which is focused on modification of conformational equilibria in water and in octanol.

         <title>Mechanochemical Solvent&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amides via Highly Chemoselective N&#8722;C Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8722;C bond activation is reported. The protocol advances the biorelevant amide bond cross&#8208;coupling manifold to solid&#8208;state solventless cross&#8208;coupling methods.







Abstract
Although cross&#8208;coupling reactions of amides by selective N&#8722;C cleavage are one of the most powerful and burgeoning areas in organic synthesis due to the ubiquity of amide bonds, the development of mechanochemical, solid&#8208;state methods remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8722;C bond activation. The method is conducted in the absence of external heating, for short reaction time and shows excellent chemoselectivity for &#963; N&#8722;C bond activation. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance and can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs and sequential orthogonal cross&#8208;couplings exploiting double solventless solid&#8208;state methods. The results extend mechanochemical reaction environments to advance the chemical repertoire of N&#8722;C bond interconversions to solid&#8208;state environmentally friendly mechanochemical methods.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Lithium Conducting Polymers with High Ionic Conductivity Based on Borate Pendant Groups</title>

A new family of lithium&#8208;conducting methacrylic polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is discussed. The optimized borate homopolymer shows the highest ionic conductivity reported for a single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte for lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
A family of single&#8208;ion lithium conducting polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is reported. The effect of the nature of the substituents on the boron atom on the ionic conductivity of the resultant methacrylic polymers was analyzed. To the best of our knowledge the lithium borate polymers endowed with flexible and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents presents the highest ionic conductivity reported for a lithium single&#8208;ion conducting homopolymer (1.65&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C). This together with its high lithium transference number t
=0.93 and electrochemical stability window of 4.2&#8197;V vs Li0/Li+ show promise for application in lithium batteries. To illustrate this, a lithium borate monomer was integrated into a single&#8208;ion gel polymer electrolyte which showed good performance on lithium symmetrical cells (&lt;0.85&#8197;V at &#177;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 175&#8197;h).

         <title>Two Giant Calixarene&#8208;Like Polyoxoniobate Nanocups {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} Built from Mixed Macrocyclic Cluster Motifs</title>

Calixarene&#8208;like polyoxoniobates: Two unprecedented giant calixarene&#8208;like polyoxoniobate (PONb) nanocups based on multiple macrocyclic clusters have been made, showing the fusion of two areas of metallacalixarene and PONb chemistry. The two molecular nanocups are by far the largest two inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONbs and hold promise for developing largely unexplored inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONb chemistry.







Abstract
Cup&#8208;shaped molecules are of great interest due to their appealing architectures and properties. Compared with widely studied calixarenes, polyoxometalate&#8208;based cup&#8208;shaped molecules currently remain a virgin land waiting for exploration. In this work, we report the first discovery of two giant cup&#8208;shaped inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs) of {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128}. The former integrates three tricyclic Nb24 clusters and a hexacyclic Nb48 cluster into a cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a Cu12 metallacalixarene, while the latter unifies two tricyclic Nb24 clusters and a brand&#8208;new pentacyclic Nb40 cluster into another cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a hybrid Cd16 unit. With 132 and 144 metal centers, {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} show the largest two inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONbs known to date.

         <title>Deoxygenation of Nitrous Oxide and Nitro Compounds Using Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene)Amido Iron Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient catalytic degradation of N2O to N2 by well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complexes under mild conditions involving the cooperative effect between the iron and silylene ligands is reported. Selective reductions of nitro compounds to amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity have been developed using the same approach.







Abstract
Herein, we report the efficient degradation of N2O with a well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complex as catalyst. The deoxygenation of N2O using the iron silanone complex 4 as a catalyst and pinacolborane (HBpin) as a sacrificial reagent proceeds smoothly at 50&#8201;&#176;C to form N2, H2, and (pinB)2O. Mechanistic studies suggest that the iron&#8211;silicon cooperativity is the key to this catalytic transformation, which involves N2O activation, H atom transfer, H2 release and oxygenation of the boron sites. This approach has been further developed to enable catalytic reductions of nitro compounds, producing amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Identification of Cyclopropane Formation in the Biosyntheses of Hormaomycins and Belactosins: Sequential Nitration and Cyclopropanation by Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of amino/nitro&#8208;cyclopropylalanine moieties in hormaomycin and belactosin was fully elucidated. The pathway involves six&#8208;electron oxidation of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine by heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes (HrmI/BelK) and C&#8722;C bond formation by iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases (HrmJ/BelL). This is the first example of Fe/&#945;&#8208;KG oxygenase&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropane formation.







Abstract
Hormaomycins and belactosins are peptide natural products that contain unusual cyclopropane moieties. Bioinformatics analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters showed that two conserved genes, hrmI/belK and hrmJ/belL, were potential candidates for catalyzing cyclopropanation. Using in vivo and in vitro assays, the functions of HrmI/BelK and HrmJ/BelL were established. HrmI and BelK, which are heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes, catalyze oxidation of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine to afford l&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine. Subsequently, HrmJ and BelL, which are iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases, effectively convert l&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine into 3&#8208;(trans&#8208;2&#8208;nitrocyclopropyl)&#8208;alanine through C4&#8722;C6 bond installation. These observations disclose a novel pathway of cyclopropane ring construction and exemplify the new chemistry involving metalloenzymes in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Preparation of Potassium Acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from Carboxylic Acids by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Mixed Anhydrides**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids are rapidly converted into potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) by copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of their mixed anhydrides. This scalable method is compatible with a broad range of functional groups and allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic and aromatic KATs, including KATs derived from Fmoc&#8208; and Boc&#8208;protected amino acids.







Abstract
We report the preparation of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from widely available carboxylic acids. Mixed anhydrides of carboxylic acids were prepared using isobutyl chloroformate and transformed to the corresponding KATs using a commercial copper catalyst, B2(pin)2, and aqueous KHF2. This method allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic, aromatic, and amino acid&#8208;derived KATs and is compatible with a variety of functional groups including alkenes, esters, halides, nitriles, and protected amines.

         <title>A Heme&#8208;Acquisition Protein Reconstructed with a Cobalt 5&#8208;Oxaporphyrinium Cation and Its Growth&#8208;Inhibition Activity Toward Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations were synthesized, and a cobalt(II) 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reconstructed protein strongly inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa and multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.







Abstract
Using artificial hemes for the reconstruction of natural heme proteins represents a fascinating approach to enhance the bioactivity of the latter. We report the synthesis of various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations as cofactors, and a cobalt 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We hypothesize that the oxaporphyrinium cation strongly binds to the HasA&#8208;specific outer membrane receptor (HasR) due to its cationic charge, which prevents the subsequent acquisition of heme. In fact, the reconstructed HasA inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and even of multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.

         <title>Formation of Super&#8208;Assembled TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Inverse Opal Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon inverse opal (TZNC IO) structure is designed through a multi&#8208;step method to regulate Zn deposition for Zn metal anodes. Benefitting from the ordered open structure with abundant zincophilic sites, the TZNC host can realize a preferential Zn nucleation and growth in the confined space. As expected, the dendrite&#8208;free TZNC@Zn composite anode enables long&#8208;term cycling in both symmetric and full cells.







Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions are the major restrictions for the commercialization of Zn metal anodes. Herein, we develop a TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon inverse opal (denoted as TZNC IO) host to regulate the Zn deposition. Amorphous TiOx and Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon can serve as the zincophilic nucleation sites to prevent the parasitic reactions. More importantly, the highly ordered IO host homogenizes the local current density and electric field to stabilize Zn deposition. Furthermore, the three&#8208;dimensional open networks could regulate Zn ion flux to enable stable cycling performance at large current densities. Owing to the abundant zincophilic sites and the open structure, granular Zn deposits could be realized. As expected, the TZNC IO host guarantees the steady Zn plating/stripping with a long&#8208;term stability over 450&#8197;h at the current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a TZNC@Zn||V2O5 full cell shows long lifespan over 2000&#8197;cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>An Unusual Pair: Facile Formation and In Vivo Validation of Robust Sc&#8211;18F Ternary Complexes for Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot water&#8208;compatible and high&#8208;yielding radiofluorination approach by the displacement of a labile, inner&#8208;sphere water of a seven&#8208;coordinate Sc chelate with a 18F&#8722; ion to form the first fully inert and water&#8208;compatible Sc&#8211;18F ternary coordination complex. The corresponding complex is fully in vivo compatible and can be the diagnostic PET imaging partner to the corresponding 47Sc&#8208;labeled endoradiotherapeutic.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;18 remains the most widely clinically utilized radionuclide globally for positron emission tomography (PET). The emergence of therapeutic isotopes for the management of disease has produced a pronounced interest in matched, theranostic isotope pairs that can be employed in tandem for the diagnosis and stratification of patients for subsequent radiotherapy. 18F, however, does not have a suitable therapeutic isotopologue. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of [18F][Sc&#8722;F] ternary complexes is feasible under mild, aqueous conditions, producing chemically robust radiopharmaceuticals in high radiochemical yield and specific activity. A corresponding in vivo study with a cancer&#8208;targeting [18F][Sc&#8722;F] tracer indicates excellent in vivo stability and produces exquisite PET image quality, rendering the 18F/47Sc isotope pair an unusual, yet chemically matched theranostic pair with excellent potential for clinical translation.

&lt;p&gt;We report a two-step, one-pot water-compatible and high-yielding radiofluorination approach by the displacement of a labile, inner-sphere water of a seven-coordinate Sc chelate with a &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion to form the first fully inert and water-compatible Sc&#8211;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F ternary coordination complex. The corresponding complex is fully in vivo compatible and can be the diagnostic PET imaging partner to the corresponding &lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;Sc-labeled endoradiotherapeutic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorine-18 remains the most widely clinically utilized radionuclide globally for positron emission tomography (PET). The emergence of therapeutic isotopes for the management of disease has produced a pronounced interest in matched, theranostic isotope pairs that can be employed in tandem for the diagnosis and stratification of patients for subsequent radiotherapy. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, however, does not have a suitable therapeutic isotopologue. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F][Sc&#8722;F] ternary complexes is feasible under mild, aqueous conditions, producing chemically robust radiopharmaceuticals in high radiochemical yield and specific activity. A corresponding in vivo study with a cancer-targeting [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F][Sc&#8722;F] tracer indicates excellent in vivo stability and produces exquisite PET image quality, rendering the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F/&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;Sc isotope pair an unusual, yet chemically matched theranostic pair with excellent potential for clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designer Outer Membrane Protein Facilitates Uptake of Decoy Molecules into a Cytochrome P450BM3&#8208;Based Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) that facilitates the cellular uptake of amino acid derivatives as decoy molecules has been developed. Co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 enabled the Escherichia coli&#8208;based whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst to efficiently oxidise benzene with the assistance of decoy molecules. Moreover, whole&#8208;cell&#8208;catalysed stereoselective hydroxylation was achieved by changing the decoy molecule.







Abstract
We report an OmpF loop deletion mutant, which improves the cellular uptake of external additives into an Escherichia coli whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst. Through co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 in the presence of decoy molecules, the yield of the whole&#8208;cell biotransformation of benzene could be considerably improved. Notably, with the decoy molecule C7AM&#8208;Pip&#8208;Phe the yield duodecupled from 5.7&#8201;% to 70&#8201;%, with 80&#8201;% phenol selectivity. The benzylic hydroxylation of alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes was also examined, and with the aid of decoy molecules, propylbenzene and tetralin were converted to 1&#8208;hydroxylated products with 78&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% (R) ee for propylbenzene and 92&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% (S) ee for tetralin. Our results suggest that both the decoy molecule and substrate traverse the artificial OmpF channel, synergistically boosting whole&#8208;cell bioconversions.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Oxazaborolidines by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H Double Activation of 1,2&#8208;Azaborines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;azaborines has been demonstrated. A wide variety of 1,2&#8208;azaborines underwent cycloaddition with vinylethylene carbonate through N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H bond cleavage to produce unique polycyclic oxazaborolidines under mild conditions. Furthermore, highly enantioselective direct functionalization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines afforded chiral tricyclic oxazaborolidines.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines proceeded via cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonate to produce polycyclic oxazaborolidines in 31&#8211;96&#8201;% yield. The key step in this process is the release of molecular hydrogen from a borate intermediate. Using a SPINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidite as a chiral ligand, chiral oxazaborolidines were synthesized in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% ee). The vinyl group of the resulting oxazaborolidine underwent metathesis, Heck reaction, and Wacker oxidation without affecting the oxazaborolidine framework.

         <title>Crossed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Iron&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Unactivated Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of unactivated branched and linear dienes is described. The illustrated process provides a very efficient and atom&#8208;economic access to chiral 1,3&#8208;substituted vinyl&#8208;cyclohexenes under very mild reaction conditions. The development of a chiral bis&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline ligand class was essential to obtain excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The cyclohexene motif is ubiquitous in nature and specialty chemicals. A straightforward selective access to chiral cyclohexenes from unactivated dienes and dienophiles is not feasible by classical Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and constitutes an unsolved synthetic challenge. We report a mild and enantioselective iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of unactivated dienes providing access to chiral 1,3&#8208;substituted vinyl&#8208;cyclohexenes. The development of bis&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline ligands was vital to obtain iron complexes that display high reactivities and excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities towards the targeted cyclohexenes. A range of diene substrates is well accommodated including feedstocks like butadiene, isoprene and myrcene. The structures of different iron complexes are mapped by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and linked to their performance.

         <title>Collateral Damage Occurs When Using Photosensitizer Probes to Detect or Modulate Nucleic Acid Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifications of DNA/RNA impact their properties including susceptibility to oxidation. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine and N6&#8208;methyladenine were competed for photooxidation by riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal against dA, dG, dC, and dT in DNA. This confirmed dG is more oxidation prone, representing collateral damage during photosensitized probing for the base methylations.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are chemically modified to fine&#8208;tune their properties for biological function. Chemical tools for selective tagging of base modifications enables new approaches; the photosensitizers riboflavin and anthraquinone were previously proposed to oxidize N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A) or 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mdC) selectively. Herein, riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal were allowed to react with the canonical nucleosides dA, dC, dG, and dT, and the modified bases 5mdC, m6A, 8&#8208;oxoguanine (dOG), and 8&#8208;oxoadenine (dOA) to rank their reactivities. The nucleoside studies reveal that dOG is the most reactive and that the native nucleoside dG is higher or similar in reactivity to 5mdC or m6A; competition in both single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA of dG vs. 5mdC or 6mdA for oxidant confirmed that dG is favorably oxidized. Thus, photosensitizers are promiscuous nucleic acid oxidants with poor chemoselectivity that will negatively impact attempts at targeted oxidation of modified nucleotides in cells.

         <title>2D Active Nanobots Based on Soft Nanoarchitectonics Powered by an Ultralow Fuel Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Truly&#8221; two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanobots based on graphene oxide and powered by enzymes have been fabricated by facile noncovalent interactions. The 2D nanobots can be propelled at ultralow H2O2 concentrations and show chemotactic behavior. Furthermore, in the presence of fuel, they showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye for environmental remediation.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis to power micro/nanomotors has received tremendous attention because of the vast potential in applications ranging from biomedicine to environmental remediation. However, the current design is mainly based on a complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architecture, with limited accessible surface areas for the catalytic sites, and thus requires a higher fuel concentration to achieve active motion. Herein we report for the first time an enzyme&#8208;powered 2D nanobot, which was designed by a facile strategy based on soft nanoarchitectonics for active motion at an ultralow fuel concentration (0.003&#8201;% H2O2). The 2D nanobots exhibited efficient positive chemotactic behavior and the ability to swim against gravity by virtue of solutal buoyancy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the 2D nanobots showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye with an efficiency of 85&#8201;%.

         <title>Optical Cell Tagging for Spatially Resolved Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
OpTAG (optical cell tagging) is a novel chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. In combination with cell sorting and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq), OpTAG&#8208;seq enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for profiling gene expression of distinct cell populations at the single&#8208;cell level. However, the information of the positions of cells within the multicellular samples is missing in scRNA&#8208;seq datasets. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop OpTAG (optical cell tagging) as a new chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. With OpTAG, we establish OpTAG&#8208;seq, which enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq. We apply OpTAG&#8208;seq to investigate the spatially defined transcriptional program in migrating cancer cells and identified a list of genes that are potential regulators for cancer cell migration and invasion. OpTAG&#8208;seq provides a convenient method for mapping cellular heterogeneity with spatial information within multicellular biological systems.

         <title>Taming the Lewis Superacidity of Non&#8208;Planar Boranes: C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Non&#8208;Classical Binding Modes at Boron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taming the Lewis superacidity of a pyramidal borane by weakly coordinated anion dissociation enabled the activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds and resulted in an unusual coordination mode at boron.







Abstract
The rational design of a geometrically constrained boron Lewis superacid featuring exceptional structure and reactivity is disclosed. It enabled the formation of non&#8208;classical electron deficient B&#8722;H&#8722;B type of bonding, which was supported by spectroscopic and structural parameters as well as computational studies. Taming the pyramidal Lewis acid electrophilicity through weak coordinating anion dissociation enabled a series of highly challenging chemical transformations, such as Csp2&#8722;H and Csp3&#8722;H activation under a frustrated Lewis pair regime and the cleavage of Csp3&#8722;Si bonds. The demonstration of such rich chemical behaviour and flexibility on a single molecular compound makes it a unique mediator of chemical transformations generally restricted to transition metals.

         <title>Reversible Three&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching of an Organic Molecule in the Solid State via &#8220;Pump&#8208;Trigger&#8221; Optical Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photoswitches that undergo fluorescence switching upon ultraviolet irradiation, photoluminescence and photoisomerization often occur simultaneously, leading to unstable fluorescence properties. Here, we successfully demonstrated reversible solid&#8208;state triple fluorescence switching through "Pump&#8208;Trigger" multiphoton manipulation. A novel fluorescence photoswitch, BOSA&#8208;SP, achieved green, yellow, and red fluorescence under excitation by pump light and isomerization induced by trigger light. The energy ranges of photoexcitation and photoisomerization did not overlap, enabling appropriate selection of the multiphoton light for &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; photoswitching, respectively. Additionally, the large free volume of the spiropyran (SP) moiety in the solid state promoted reversible photoisomerization. Switching between &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; light is useful for three&#8208;color tunable switching cell imaging, which can be exploited in programmable fluorescence switching. Furthermore, we exploited reversible dual&#8208;fluorescence switching in a single molecular system to successfully achieve two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Shizukaol J, Trichloranoid C and Trishizukaol A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric total synthesis of three lindenane sesquiterpenoid oligomers, i.e. shizukaol J, trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A, has been accomplished concisely in 15, 16 and 18 longest linear steps respectively. The expeditious construction of molecular architectures was facilitated by Nelson&#8217;s catalytic asymmetric ketene&#8208;aldehyde cycloaddition, a sequence of allylic alkylation/reduction/acidic cyclization to forge a lactone, and a double aldol condensation cascade to construct the 5/6 bicyclic system. Diastereoselective nucleophilic substitution promoted by a phase transfer catalyst constructed the C  11  quaternary stereogenic center, thus prompting synthetic efficacy toward shizukaol J. The synthesis of trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A was achieved after a cascade involving furanyl diene formation and a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, as well as a one&#8208;pot sequence involving furan oxidation and global deprotection. Furthermore, our biological evaluation revealed that two compounds exhibited unexpected toxicity against tumor cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Helicenes by a Tailored Chiral Benzo[ghi]perylene Trisimide &#960;&#8208;Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective molecular recognition of chiral molecules that lack specific interaction sites for hydrogen bonding or Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions remains challenging. Here we introduce the concept of tailored chiral &#960;&#8208;surfaces toward the maximization of shape complementarity. As we demonstrate for helicenes it is indeed possible by pure van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions (&#960;&#8722;&#960;&#8208;interactions and CH&#8722;&#960;&#8208;interactions) to accomplish enantioselective binding. This is demonstrated for a novel benzo[ghi]perylene trisimide (BPTI) receptor whose &#960;&#8208;scaffold is contorted into a chiral plane by functionalization with 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL). Complexation experiments of enantiopure  (P)&#8208;  BPTI with  (P)&#8208;  and  (M)&#8208;  [6]helicene afforded binding constants of 10700 M  &#8722;1  and 550 M  &#8722;1  , respectively, thereby demonstrating the pronounced enantiodifferentiation by the homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold of the BPTI host. The enantioselective recognition is even observable by the bare eye due to a specific exciplex&#8208;type emission originating from the interacting homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffolds of electron&#8208;rich [6]helicene and electron&#8208;poor BPTI.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging electron&#8208;deficient iminium intermediates in a general synthesis of valuable amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of reactions converting alkenes and alkynes into valuable building blocks remains one of the main goals of synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present the leveraging of highly electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions, rare and fleeting intermediates, into a general amine synthesis. This enables the preparation of amines bearing e.g. valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl moieties under mild conditions. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of Quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported Lanthanum Borohydride Catalyzes CH Borylation Inside Zeolite Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanide La(BH  4  )  x  &#8208;HY  30  catalyzes C&#8722;H borylation of benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), providing a complementary approach to precious, late transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylations. The reactive catalytic species are generated from La grafted at the Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in micropores of the zeolite, whereas silanoate&#8208; and aluminoate&#8208;grafted sites are inactive under the reaction conditions. During typical catalytic borylations, conversion to phenyl pinacolborane (PhBpin) is zero&#8208;order in HBpin concentration. A turnover number (TON) of 167 is accessed by capping silanols, selectively grafting at BAS sites, and adding HBpin slowly to the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Recording of Fermentation and Lipid Metabolism&#160;Processes&#160;in Live Microalgae Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time recording of processes in living cells has been limited to detection of small cellular components such as soluble proteins and metabolites. Here we report a multiphase NMR approach using Magic&#8208;Angle Spinning NMR to synchronously follow microbial processes of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamic changes in live microalgae cells.  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  green algae were highly concentrated, introducing dark fermentation and anoxia conditions. Single&#8208;pulse NMR experiments were applied to obtain temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic profiles of the formed fermentation products. Through dynamics&#8208;based spectral editing NMR, simultaneous conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids was observed and rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. This suggests that lipolysis under dark and anoxia conditions finally results in the breakdown of cell and organelle membranes, which could be beneficial for recovery of intracellular microbial useful products.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Boric Acid Does Not Show Room Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boric acid (BA) has been used as a transparent glass matrix for optical materials for over 100 years. However, recently, apparent room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from BA (crystalline and powder states) was reported (Zheng et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.2021, 60, 9500) when irradiated at 280 nm under ambient conditions. We suspected that RTP from their BA sample was induced by an unidentified impurity. Our experimental results show that pure BA synthesized from B(OMe)3 does not luminesce in the solid state when irradiated at 250&#8208;400 nm, while commercial BA indeed (faintly) luminesces. Our theoretical calculations show that neither individual BA molecules nor aggregates would absorb light at &gt;175 nm, and we observe no absorption of solid pure BA experimentally at &gt;200 nm. Therefore, it is not possible for pure BA to be excited at &gt;250 nm even in the solid state. Thus, pure BA does not display RTP whereas trace impurities can induce RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF Synthesis Prediction Enabled by Automatic Data Mining and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite rapid progress in the field of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the potential of using machine learning (ML) methods to predict MOF synthesis parameters is still untapped. Here, we show how ML can be used for rationalization and acceleration of the MOF discovery process by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure. Our approach is based on: (i) establishing the first MOF synthesis database via automatic extraction of synthesis parameters from the literature, (ii) training and optimizing ML models by employing the MOF database, and (iii) predicting the synthesis conditions for new MOF structures. The ML models, even at an initial stage, exhibit a good prediction performance, outperforming human expert predictions, obtained through a synthesis survey. The automated synthesis prediction is available via a web&#8208;tool on https://mof&#8208;synthesis.aimat.science.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold is a scarce element in the Earth&#8217;s crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco&#8208;social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I  2  oxidizes Au  0  and forms [Au  I  I  2  ]  &#8208;  species, which undergoes subsequent ligand&#8208;exchange reactions and forms a stable bis&#8208;ligand Au(I) complex. H  2  O  2  oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I  2  returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding: A New Platform for Achieving Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Persistent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monotonous luminescence has always been a major factor limiting the application of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Enhancing and regulating the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest is an effective strategy to achieve excellent phosphorescence performance. In this study, intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8230;Br) was introduced into the host&#8208;guest RTP system. The interaction promoted intersystem crossing and stabilized the triplet excitons, thus helping to achieve strong phosphorescence emission. In addition, the weak intermolecular interaction of halogen bonding is sensitive to external stimuli such as heat, mechanical force, and X&#8208;rays. Therefore, the triplet excitons were easily quenched and colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli responsive behaviors were realized, which greatly enriched the luminescence functionality of the RTP materials. This method provides a new platform for the future design of responsive RTP materials based on weak intermolecular interactions between the host and guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Aldehydes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization Followed by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially  chiral aldehydes have received increasing attention in enantioselective catalysis. However, only very few catalytic methods have been developed to construct structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes. We herein describe an NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of biaryl dialdehydes as a general and practical strategy for the construction of axially chiral aldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that coupling proceeds through a novel combination of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes and kinetic resolution. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization and provides a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of controllable artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems based on liquid crystal (LC) materials,  i.e., anisotropic fluids, remains a challenge. Herein, an annulene&#8208;based discotic LC compound  6  with a saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene core has been synthesized to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform. The LC material shows typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which can act as a suitable light&#8208;harvesting donor. By loading Nile red (NiR) as an acceptor, an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system is achieved. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of  6  with variable molecular order, the efficiency of such  6  &#8208;NiR system can be controlled by temperature. This light&#8208;harvesting system works sensitively at a high donor/acceptor ratio as 1000:1, and exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100:1 donor/acceptor ratio. This thermochromic artificial light&#8208;harvesting LC system could find potential applications in smart devices employing soft materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous emulsion copolymerizations of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) were performed with&#160;  n  &#8208;butyl acrylate (BA), styrene (S) and a combination of both. In all cases, stable latexes were obtained in less than two hours under conventional conditions; that is in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) used as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. A limited solubility of DOT in BA was observed compared to S, yielding to a more homogeneous integration of DOT units in the PS latex. In both cases, the copolymer could be easily degraded under basic conditions. Emulsion terpolymerization between DOT, BA and S allowed to produce stable latexes not only composed of degradable chains but also featuring a broad range of glass transition temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling charge separation mechanisms in photocatalyst particles by spatially resolved surface photovoltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Promoted Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Aliphatic Ketoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust and highly active homogeneous chiral nickel&#8208;phosphine complex for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;ketoacids has been discovered. The hydrogenation could be smoothly proceeded in the presence of 0.0133 mol% catalyst loading (S/C = 7500). The coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of Ni(OTf)  2  with (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE were explored by  1  H NMR and HRMS. The mechanistic studies revealed that proton promoted the activation of the substrate C=O bond and controlled stereoselectivity through hydrogen bonds. A series of chiral &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;alkyl substituted lactones were obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and 99% ee). In addition, this catalytic system was also demonstrated that levulinic acid produced from biomass feedstock was converted into chiral &#947;&#8208;valerolactone without loss of ee value.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic&#8208;Organic Hybrid Membrane based on Pillararene&#8208;intercalated MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discharge of antibiotic&#8208;containing wastewater causes environmental pollution and  threatens biological  and human health. An efficient treatment method for this wastewater is urgently required.  We  prepared inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid pillararene&#8208;MXene nanosheets with a large lateral size  (5&#8211;8  &#956;  m). The hybrid nanosheets were stacked on supports via vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration to prepare membranes with regular parallel slits and an interlayer spacing of 1.36 nm, which were used to purify antibiotic&#8208;containing water. Permeance through the membrane increased 100&#8208;fold compared with most polymeric and other two&#8208;dimensional nanofiltration membranes with similar rejection. This high permeance and rejection was attributed to the large lateral size of the nanosheets, regular interlayer spacing, and electrostatic interaction between the membrane and antibiotics. These membranes will broaden the applications of lamellar materials for the separation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added drugs in academia and industry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The Stille cross&#8208;coupling polymerization is one of the most efficient synthetic methods for donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs).

Here, a room temperature Stille type polymerization was developed, of which the utility and generality were demonstrated by synthesis of twelve D&#8208;A CPs with high molecular weights. Importantly, the resultant copolymers possessed no homocoupling (hc) structural defects, while hc reactions were observed in the thermal&#8208;activation Stille reactions. Thus, the former one based organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) exhibited twice higher charge transport mobility (2.10 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  ), since it possessed stronger crystallinity and less trap density of states (tDOS).</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Carbonyls and &#960;&#8208;Cation Effect for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepare a polyimide covalent organic framework composite anode by effective in&#8208;situ condensation of anhydride and amine on the surface of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. The construction of the conductive network accelerates the transport of electron. Dual electroactive sites in the framework, carbonyls and aromatic naphthalene rings, could storage more potassium ions by the enolization and &#960;&#8208;K+ effect.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COF) possess a robust and porous crystalline structure, making them an appealing candidate for energy storage. Herein, we report an exfoliated polyimide COF composite (P&#8208;COF@SWCNT) prepared by an in situ condensation of anhydride and amine on the single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes as advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Numerous active sites exposed on the exfoliated frameworks and the various open pathways promote the highly efficient ion diffusion in the P&#8208;COF@SWCNT while preventing irreversible dissolution in the electrolyte. During the charging/discharging process, K+ is engaged in the carbonyls of imide group and naphthalene rings through the enolization and &#960;&#8208;K+ effect, which is demonstrated by the DFT calculation and XPS, ex&#8208;situ FTIR, Raman. As a result, the prepared P&#8208;COF@SWCNT anode enables an incredibly high reversible specific capacity of 438&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and extended stability. The structural advantage of P&#8208;COF@SWCNT enables more insights into the design and versatility of COF as an electrode.

         <title>Picking on Carbonate: Kinetic Selectivity in the Encapsulation of Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexapodal capsule has been shown to trap inorganic anions over a large span of time. Whereas small spherical and cylindrical ions enter the cage at a rapid rate (seconds), it takes longer (minutes) for medium&#8208;sized and tripodal species, and larger and tetrahedral anions need hours to days to fully populate the host. Such a kinetic selection could be used for sequestering anions from solution and/or controlling their chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular hosts bind to inorganic anions at a fast rate and select them in proportion with thermodynamic stability of the corresponding [anion&#8834;host] complexes, forming in a reversible manner. In this study, we describe the action of hexapodal capsule 1 and its remarkable ability to select anions based on a large span of rates by which they enter this host. The thermodynamic affinity of 1 toward eighteen anions extends over eight orders of magnitude (0&lt;Ka&lt;108&#8197;M&#8722;1; 1H NMR spectroscopy). The capsule would retain CO32&#8722; (Ka=107&#8197;M&#8722;1) for hours in the presence of eleven competing anions, including stronger binding SO42&#8722;, HAsO42&#8722; and HPO42&#8722; (Ka=107&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). The observed selection resulted from 1 possessing narrow apertures (ca. 3&#215;6&#8197;&#197;) comparable in size to anions (d=3.5&#8211;7.1&#8197;&#197;) slowing down the encapsulation to last from seconds to days. The unorthodox mode of action of 1 sets the stage for creating hosts that pick anions by their ability to access the host.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Templated Palladium Nanoparticles for Water Purification by Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density palladium nanocatalyst is successfully immobilized on bulk electrodes via a 3D&#8208;structured amyloid fibrils template. The novel hybrid electrodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for detoxification of wastewater and drinking water.







Abstract
Electrocatalysis offers great promise for water purification but is limited by low active area and high uncontrollability of electrocatalysts. To overcome these constraints, we propose hybrid bulk electrodes by synthesizing and binding a Pd nanocatalyst (nano&#8208;Pd) to the electrodes via amyloid fibrils (AFs). The AFs template is effective for controlling the nucleation, growth, and assembly of nano&#8208;Pd on the electrode. In addition, the three&#8208;dimensional hierarchically porous nanostructure of AFs is beneficial for loading high&#8208;density nano&#8208;Pd with a large active area. The novel hybrid cathodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for the detoxification of hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), 4&#8208;chlorophenol, and trichloroacetic acid in wastewater and drinking water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of an AFs&#8208;templated nano&#8208;Pd&#8208;based hybrid electrode, which constitutes a paradigm shift in electrocatalytic water purification, and broadens the horizon of its potential engineered applications.

         <title>Synergy Effect of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ionic Compound: Dual Interfacial Energy Level Regulation and Passivation to Promote Voc and Stability of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic multifunctional additive (QAPyBF4) was developed and introduced into perovskite solar cells (PSCs). QAPyBF4 passivated defect states in the perovskite layer, adjusted energy level alignment at the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces, and prevented the decomposition of perovskite crystals. Therefore, a planar PSC with QAPyBF4 delivered an efficiency of 23.1&#8201;% with a remarkable Voc of 1.2&#8197;V and operational stability.







Abstract
Defects and energy offsets at the bulk and heterojunction interfaces of perovskite are detrimental to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed an amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound (QAPyBF4), implementing simultaneous defects passivation and interface energy level alignments. The p&#8208;type conjugated cations passivated the surface trap states and optimized energy alignment at the perovskite/hole transport layer. The highly electronegative [BF4]&#8722; enriched at the SnO2 interface featured desired band alignment due to the dipole moment of this interlayer. The planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSC had an efficiency of 23.1&#8201;% with Voc of 1.2&#8197;V. Notably, the synergy effect elevated the intrinsic endothermic decomposition temperature of the perovskite. The modified devices showed excellent long&#8208;term thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C) and operational stability at the maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h at 45&#8201;&#176;C under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination with no appreciable efficiency loss.

         <title>Clusters Induced Electron Redistribution to Tune Oxygen Reduction Activity of Transition Metal Single&#8208;Atom for Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy of metal clusters regulating metal single&#8208;atom sites is developed to boost the activities of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts (Fe, Co, Ni). Benefiting from the electron redistribution between active sites and substrate, the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and achieves high discharge voltages in various metal&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity can be effectively tuned by modulating the electron configuration and optimizing the chemical bonds. Herein, a general strategy to optimize the activity of metal single&#8208;atoms is achieved by the decoration of metal clusters via a coating&#8211;pyrolysis&#8211;etching route. In this unique structure, the metal clusters are able to induce electron redistribution and modulate M&#8722;N species bond lengths. As a result, M&#8208;ACSA@NC exhibits superior ORR activity compared with the nanoparticle&#8208;decorated counterparts. The performance enhancement is attributed to the optimized intermediates desorption benefiting from the unique electronic configuration. Theoretical analysis reinforces the significant roles of metal clusters by correlating the ORR activity with cluster&#8208;induced charge transfer. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, various metal&#8211;air batteries assembled with Fe&#8208;ACSA@NC deliver remarkable power densities and capacities. This strategy is an effective and universal technique for electron modulation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, which shows great potential in application of energy storage devices.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based COF 2D Materials: Variable Modification of Sensing Performances by Post&#8208;Metallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metalloporphyrin covalent organic framework based nanosheets has been synthesized and successfully applied in specific sensing of NO2 at room temperature.







Abstract
2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surfaces are highly sought after for various applications, especially in room&#8208;temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin&#8208;based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific&#8208;sensing of NO2 at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H2&#8208;TPCOF was designed with a largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post&#8208;metallization. After post&#8208;metallization, the metallized M&#8208;TPCOF (M=Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co&#8208;TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO2 with one of the highest sensitivities of all reported 2D materials and COF materials, with an ultra&#8208;low limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6.8&#8197;ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface&#8208;highly&#8208;modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Directed Formation of Anisotropic Kettlebell and Tadpole Nanostructures in the Absence of a Swelling&#8208;Induced Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic kettlebell and tadpole polymer nanostructures formed through a single protrusion from spheres. This method obviates the commonly used solvent swelling&#8208;induced method to form anisotropic particles by driving tail assembly through enhanced chain mobility by tuning the glass transition temperature of the polymer core. Further, the kettlebells could be isolated and transformed to tadpoles on&#8208;demand with temperature.







Abstract
Anisotropic Janus (&#8220;snowman&#8221;) nanoparticles with a single protrusion are currently made via the solvent swelling&#8208;induced method. Here, we demonstrate without the aid of toxic solvents a generally applicable method for the formation of anisotropic polymer nanoparticles directly in water by controlling polymer mobility through tuning its glass transition temperature (Tg). Spherical structures, formed immediately after the emulsion polymerization, transformed into uniform tadpoles (with head diameter &#8776;60&#8197;nm and tail length &#8776;130&#8197;nm) through the protrusion of a single cylindrical tail when cooled to a temperature above the Tg of the polymer. Cooling the spheres to below the Tg produced kinetically trapped kettlebell structures that could be freeze&#8208;dried and rehydrated without any structural change.

     alt="Temperature-Directed Formation of Anisotropic Kettlebell and Tadpole Nanostructures in the Absence of a Swelling-Induced Solvent"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anisotropic kettlebell and tadpole polymer nanostructures formed through a single protrusion from spheres. This method obviates the commonly used solvent swelling-induced method to form anisotropic particles by driving tail assembly through enhanced chain mobility by tuning the glass transition temperature of the polymer core. Further, the kettlebells could be isolated and transformed to tadpoles on-demand with temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anisotropic Janus (&#8220;snowman&#8221;) nanoparticles with a single protrusion are currently made via the solvent swelling-induced method. Here, we demonstrate without the aid of toxic solvents a generally applicable method for the formation of anisotropic polymer nanoparticles directly in water by controlling polymer mobility through tuning its glass transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;). Spherical structures, formed immediately after the emulsion polymerization, transformed into uniform tadpoles (with head diameter &#8776;60&#8197;nm and tail length &#8776;130&#8197;nm) through the protrusion of a single cylindrical tail when cooled to a temperature above the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; of the polymer. Cooling the spheres to below the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; produced kinetically trapped kettlebell structures that could be freeze-dried and rehydrated without any structural change. These unique kettlebells could transform into uniform tadpoles by heating above the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, representing a triggered and on-demand structural reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrocarbon Macrocycle Conformer Ensembles and 13C&#8208;NMR spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NMR as a routine analytic method provides important three&#8208;dimensional structure information of compounds in solution. Here we apply the recently released  crenso  computational workflow for the automated generation of conformer ensembles to the quantum mechanical calculation of  13  C&#8208;NMR spectra of a series of flexible cylcoalkanes up to C  20  H  40  . We evaluate the computed chemical shifts in comparison with corresponding experimental data in chloroform. It is shown that accurate and properly averaged theoretical NMR data can be obtained in about a day of computation time on a standard workstation computer. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables to deduce preferred conformations of large, non&#8208;rigid macrocylces under ambient&#160; conditions from our automated procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Encoding of Cyanopyridylalanine for In&#8208;Cell Protein Macrocyclization by the Nitrile&#8208;Aminothiol Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanopyridylalanines are non&#8208;canonical amino acids that react with aminothiol compounds under physiological conditions in a biocompatible manner without requiring added catalyst. Here we present newly developed aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for genetic encoding of  meta  &#8208; and  para  &#8208;cyanopyridylalanine to enable the site&#8208;specific attachment of a wide range of different functionalities. The outstanding utility of the cyanopyridine moiety is demonstrated by examples of (i) post&#8208;translational functionalization of proteins, (ii) in&#8208;cell macrocyclization of peptides and proteins, and (iii) protein stapling. The biocompatible nature of the protein ligation chemistry enabled by the cyanopyridylalanine amino acid opens a new path to specific  in vivo  protein modifications in complex biological environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework (COF) derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Unraveling Fundamental Kinetic and Structural Parameters of the Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction is a potential approach to convert CO  2  into valuable chemicals using electricity as feedstock. Abundant and affordable catalyst materials are needed to upscale this process in a sustainable manner. Nickel&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) is an efficient catalyst for CO  2  electro&#8208;reduction to CO, and the single&#8208;site Ni&#8208;N  x  motif is believed as the active site. However, critical metrics for its catalytic activity, such as active site density and intrinsic turnover frequency, so far lack systematic discussion. In this work, we prepared a set of covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, for which the Ni&#8208;N  x  content could be adjusted by the pyrolysis temperature. The combination of high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure evidenced the presence of Ni single&#8208;sites, and quantitative X&#8208;ray photoemission addressed the relation between active site density and turnover frequency.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Pore&#8208;Space Partition and Charge Distribution in Multi&#8208;Modular Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a strategy for making anionic pacs type porous materials by combining pore space partition with charge reallocation. The method uses the first negatively charged pore partition ligand (2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene, H&#8208;tph) that simultaneously enables pore partition and charge reallocation. Over two dozen anionic  pacs  materials have been made to demonstrate their excellent chemical stability and a high degree of tunability. Notably, Ni  3  &#8208;bdt&#8208;tph (bdt = 1,4&#8208;benzeneditetrazolate) exhibits month&#8208;long water stability, while CoV&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph sets a new benchmark for C  2  H  2  storage capacity under ambient conditions for ionic MOFs. In addition to tunable in&#8208;framework modules, we show feasibility to tune the type and concentration of extra&#8208;framework counter cations and their influence on both stability and capability to separate industrial C  3  H  8  /C  3  H  6  and C  6  H  6  /C  6  H  12  mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Millisecond&#8208;Range Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging Enabled through Ultralong Aqueous Phosphorescence Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Probes featuring room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising tools for time&#8208;resolved imaging. It is worth noting that the time scale of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging generally ranges microsecond level, because of the short&#8208;lived emission. In this report, the first example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through a kind of ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes (i.e., cyclo&#8208;(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;AspD&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Cys)&#8208;conjugated zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres), with RTP emission lasting for ~5 s and lifetime as long as 743.7 ms. We demonstrate that the live cells and deep tumor tissue in mice can be specifically targeted through immune&#8208;phosphorescence imaging, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) value of ~69 for in vitro imaging, and ~627 for in vivo imaging, respectively. We further show that, compared to that of fluorescence imaging, the SBR enhancement of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved in vivo bioimaging is up to 105&#8208;times.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Computationally Guided Synthesis of SSZ&#8208;43: A One&#8208;Dimensional 12&#8208;Ring Zeolite with Unique Sinusoidal Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 was determined by 3D electron diffraction, synchrotron X&#8209;ray powder diffraction, and high&#8209;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The SSZ&#8208;43 framework forms one&#8208;dimensional, sinusoidal 12&#8208;ring channels from 5461 butterfly units commonly found in other zeolites, but with unique 6.5 &#215; 6.5 &#197; apertures and 12&#8208;ring 6.5 &#215; 8.9 &#197; windows perpendicular to the channels. SSZ&#8208;43 crystals are intergrowths of two polytypes: ~90% orthorhombic polytype A with ABAB stacking of the 12&#8208;rings, and ~10% monoclinic polytype B with ABCABC stacking. Molecular modeling performed on the idealized Si&#8208;SSZ&#8208;43 structure along with empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity in boron&#8208; and aluminum&#8208;containing synthesis gels were used in a combined approach to design new di&#8208;quaternary ammonium organic structure&#8209;directing agents (OSDAs). Experimental trials demonstrated that the new OSDAs produced SSZ&#8208;43 over a broader range of compositions than previous mono&#8208;quaternary OSDAs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The structure of zeolite SSZ-43 was determined by 3D electron diffraction, synchrotron X&#8209;ray powder diffraction, and high&#8209;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The SSZ-43 framework forms one-dimensional, sinusoidal 12-ring channels from 5461 butterfly units commonly found in other zeolites, but with unique 6.5 &#215; 6.5 &#197; apertures and 12-ring 6.5 &#215; 8.9 &#197; windows perpendicular to the channels. SSZ-43 crystals are intergrowths of two polytypes: ~90% orthorhombic polytype A with ABAB stacking of the 12-rings, and ~10% monoclinic polytype B with ABCABC stacking. Molecular modeling performed on the idealized Si-SSZ-43 structure along with empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity in boron- and aluminum-containing synthesis gels were used in a combined approach to design new di-quaternary ammonium organic structure&#8209;directing agents (OSDAs). Experimental trials demonstrated that the new OSDAs produced SSZ-43 over a broader range of compositions than previous mono-quaternary OSDAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Finite Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional DNA Hierarchical Nanoarchitectures through Orthogonal and Directional Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reliable orthogonal bonding with precise and flexible orientation control would be ideal for building finite complex nanostructures via self&#8208;assembly. Employing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA origami, hexagonal prism DNA origami (HDO), as building block, we demonstrate it is practical to construct finite hierarchical nanoarchitectures with complicated conformations through orthogonal and directional bonding. The as&#8208;designed HDO building block has twelve prescribed directional valences in 3D space and each of them supports two opposite orientations, yielding the capability to generate abundant directional bonding. Meanwhile, we minimize the thorny non&#8208;specific interactions among HDOs and enable the orthogonal bonding between any two valences based on self&#8208;similar designing. Consequently, various hierarchical nanostructures are prepared at will simply by the combination of HDOs with appropriate valences. We believe this route towards hierarchically assembly is inspiring and hope it would facilitate the fabrication of functional superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Precision Synthesis of AB, ABA and ABC Block Copolymers via Switchable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined block copolymers with molecular complexity by simple techniques has always been a meaningful but rarely achieved task. Here, a commercial switchable catalysis is reported comprising a delicate &#8220;double switch&#8221; process. This unique switch can be applied up to pentacomponent mixtures to prepare sequence&#8208;controlled AB, ABA, and ABC copolymers.







Abstract
The switchable catalysis using a commercial salenMn catalyst was firstly developed and applied in the one&#8208;pot selective copolymerization from anhydrides, epoxides, CO2 and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL) mixtures for the precise synthesis of AB, ABA and novel ABC block copolymers. The observed unique double switch process comprising three different polymerization cycles was rationalized by theoretical calculations. Surprisingly, the first block turned out to be an efficient macromolecular initiator for the consecutive introduction of carbonate linkages into copolymers, albeit with dominant cyclization with the catalyst alone. Further, through the selective reaction on different epoxides, the switchable copolymerization of up to five monomers was achieved yielding well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block copolymers with structural diversity and functionality.

         <title>Transforming Escherichia coli Proteomembranes into Artificial Chloroplasts Using Molecular Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cofactors: Like the chloroplasts of green plants, a hybrid system consisting of heterodinuclear photocatalysts and inverted E. coli vesicles generates reduced nicotinamides and adenosine triphosphate simultaneously.







Abstract
During the light&#8208;dependent reaction of photosynthesis, green plants couple photoinduced cascades of redox reactions with transmembrane proton translocations to generate reducing equivalents and chemical energy in the form of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), respectively. We mimic these basic processes by combining molecular ruthenium polypyridine&#8208;based photocatalysts and inverted vesicles derived from Escherichia coli. Upon irradiation with visible light, the interplay of photocatalytic nicotinamide reduction and enzymatic membrane&#8208;located respiration leads to the simultaneous formation of two biologically active cofactors, NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and ATP, respectively. This inorganic&#8208;biologic hybrid system thus emulates the cofactor delivering function of an active chloroplast.

         <title>Transforming Electrocatalytic Biomass Upgrading and Hydrogen Production from Electricity Input to Electricity Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coupling anodic low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation with the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction, a multipurpose electrocatalytic system was assembled for biomass upgrading, hydrogen production, and electricity generation. This system could generate about 2&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced, instead of requiring electricity input.







Abstract
Integrating biomass upgrading and hydrogen production in an electrocatalytic system is attractive both environmentally and in terms of sustainability. Conventional electrolyser systems coupling anodic biosubstrate electrooxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction usually require electricity input. Herein, we describe the development of an electrocatalytic system for simultaneous biomass upgrading, hydrogen production, and electricity generation. In contrast to conventional furfural electrooxidation, the employed low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation enabled the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group to be released as gaseous hydrogen at the anode at a low potential of approximately 0&#8197;VRHE (vs. RHE). The integrated electrocatalytic system could generate electricity of about 2&#8197;kWh per cubic meter of hydrogen produced. This study may provide a transformative technology to convert electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from a process requiring electricity input into a process to generate electricity.

         <title>Internal Electric Field and Interfacial Bonding Engineered Step&#8208;Scheme Junction for a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Involved Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8722;N bonding in S&#8208;scheme Fe2O3/C3N4 significantly boosts the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;excited carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers. These enable the light&#8208;involved Li&#8211;O2 battery with a Fe2O3/C3N4 cathode to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13&#8197;V under illumination and a charge voltage of 3.19&#8197;V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability.







Abstract
Li&#8211;O2 batteries have aroused considerable interest in recent years, however they are hindered by high kinetic barriers and large overvoltages at cathodes. Herein, a step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) junction with hematite on carbon nitride (Fe2O3/C3N4) is designed as a bifunctional catalyst to facilitate oxygen redox for a visible&#8208;light&#8208;involved Li&#8211;O2 battery. The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8722;N bonding in the heterojunction boost the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers, at which the photoelectrons on C3N4 and holes on Fe2O3 remarkably accelerate the discharge and charge kinetics. These enable the Li&#8211;O2 battery with Fe2O3/C3N4 to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13&#8197;V under illumination, higher than the equilibrium potential 2.96&#8197;V in the dark, and a charge voltage of 3.19&#8197;V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability. This work will shed light on rational cathode design for metal&#8211;O2 batteries.

         <title>Discrete Stacked Dimers of Aromatic Oligoamide Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking of aromatic foldamer helices in water gives rise to thermodynamically and kinetically stable discrete dimers. The association can be used to convey helix handedness from one helix to the next and be designed to form heterodimers exclusively.







Abstract
Tight binding was observed between the C&#8208;terminal cross section of aromatic oligoamide helices in aqueous solution, leading to the formation of discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimers in slow exchange on the NMR timescale with the corresponding monomers. The nature and structure of the dimers was evidenced by 2D NOESY and DOSY spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The binding interface involves a large hydrophobic aromatic surface and hydrogen bonding. Dimerization requires that helices have the same handedness and the presence of a C&#8208;terminal carboxy function. The protonation state of the carboxy group plays a crucial role, resulting in pH dependence of the association. Dimerization is also influenced by neighboring side chains and can be programmed to selectively produce heteromeric aggregates.

         <title>Significance of Receptor Mobility in Multivalent Binding on Lipid Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent membrane processes result in numerous receptors being coupled on a diffusive surface. As such, these binding mechanisms depend heavily on the intrinsic mobility on the cell membrane. The Minireview discusses the importance of mobility in multivalent binding, demonstrating that it is crucial for the deeper understanding of receptor interactions, and to guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.







Abstract
Numerous key biological processes rely on the concept of multivalency, where ligands achieve stable binding only upon engaging multiple receptors. These processes, like viral entry or immune synapse formation, occur on the diffusive cellular membrane. One crucial, yet underexplored aspect of multivalent binding is the mobility of coupled receptors. Here, we discuss the consequences of mobility in multivalent processes from four perspectives: (I)&#8197;The facilitation of receptor recruitment by the multivalent ligand due to their diffusivity prior to binding. (II)&#8197;The effects of receptor preassembly, which allows their local accumulation. (III)&#8197;The consequences of changes in mobility upon the formation of receptor/ligand complex. (IV)&#8197;The changes in the diffusivity of lipid environment surrounding engaged receptors. We demonstrate how understanding mobility is essential for fully unravelling the principles of multivalent membrane processes, leading to further development in studies on receptor interactions, and guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.

         <title>A Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;Anchored Rhenium(I) Photosensitizer Evokes Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyroptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death that is essentially proinflammatory and critical for immunity. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115800), Qian Cao, Zong&#8208;Wan Mao and co&#8208;workers developed a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored photosensitizer CA&#8208;Re capable of inducing and self&#8208;reporting membrane rupture upon irradiation, as well as evoking pyroptosis to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity. CA&#8208;Re is the first metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer, and this work provides a tantalizing angle for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.

         <title>Engineering Dual Single&#8208;Atom Sites on 2D Ultrathin N&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheets Attaining Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A Fe/Mn dual single&#8208;atom catalyst with an excellent bifunctional activity is prepared as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). Profiting from the combined Fe/Mn dual&#8208;site effect as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure, the ZAB could operate efficiently at the ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, a novel dual single&#8208;atom catalyst comprising adjacent Fe&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4 sites on 2D ultrathin N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with porous structure (FeMn&#8208;DSAC) was constructed as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). FeMn&#8208;DSAC exhibits remarkable bifunctional activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Control experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the catalytic activity arises from the cooperative effect of the Fe/Mn dual&#8208;sites aiding *OOH dissociation as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure promoting active sits exposure and mass transfer during the reaction process. The excellent bifunctional activity of FeMn&#8208;DSAC enables the ZAB to operate efficiently at ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, delivering 30&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 peak power density and retaining up to 86&#8201;% specific capacity from the room temperature counterpart.

         <title>Interfacial Atom&#8208;Substitution Engineered Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxide Nanofibers with High&#8208;Valence Fe for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber was synthesized by an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to boost the activity of the NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts for efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key for scalable water electrolysis, for instance, NiFe&#8208;based materials. Decorating NiFe catalysts with other transition metals offers a new path to boost their catalytic activities but often suffers from the low controllability of the electronic structures of the NiFe catalytic centers. Here, we report an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to synthesize an electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber to boost the activity of NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The NiFeV nanofiber supported on a carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, along with long&#8208;term stability (&gt;20&#8197;h) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based OER catalysts.

         <title>Unifying Scheme for the Biosynthesis of Acyl&#8208;Branched Sugars: Extended Substrate Scope of Thiamine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of bacteria have branched sugars in their outer cell membrane with long, highly modified side chains. LPSs are often crucial factors in the pathogenesis of the bacteria. A unifying explanation of the biosynthesis of these highly interesting structures is introduced, based on the investigation of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes responsible for the linkage of the side chain and the sugar core.







Abstract
Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) dependent enzymes are useful catalysts for asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation through benzoin&#8208;type condensation reactions that result in &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. A wide range of aldehydes and ketones can be used as acceptor substrates; however, the donor substrate range is mostly limited to achiral &#945;&#8208;keto acids and simple aldehydes. By using a unifying retro&#8208;biosynthetic approach towards acyl&#8208;branched sugars, we identified a subclass of (myco)bacterial ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes with a greatly extended donor substrate range, namely functionalized chiral &#945;&#8208;keto acids with a chain length from C4 to C8. Highly enantioenriched acyloin products were obtained in good to high yields and several reactions were performed on a preparative scale. The newly introduced functionalized &#945;&#8208;keto acids, accessible by known aldolase&#8208;catalyzed transformations, substantially broaden the donor substrate range of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes, thus enabling a more general use of these already valuable catalysts.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Zero and Low&#8208;Valent Metal Nodes Connected by Tetratopic Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, tetratopic phosphine linkers were used to realize MOFs with Pd0 and Pt0 metal nodes, which represent the first MOFs constructed using only metal&#8211;phosphine coordination bonds. In addition, a RhI coordination solid was synthesized, highlighting the versatility of these phosphine linkers. A total of six new materials are reported using unique triphenylphosphine&#8208;modulated syntheses and their luminescent properties are described.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed with M0 nodes are attractive targets due to the reactivity of these low&#8208;valent metals, but examples of these MOFs remain exceedingly rare. The rational design of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs with Pd0 and Pt0 nodes using tetratopic phosphine ligands is reported. Five new MOFs have been synthesized by systematic variation of the phosphine ligands and metal precursors employed, and these represent the first examples of MOFs constructed using phosphine&#8211;metal bonds as the sole structural component. The MOFs display solid&#8208;state luminescence, with emission maxima that are significantly red&#8208;shifted compared to Pd(PPh3)4. In addition, a RhI low&#8208;valent coordination solid based on the same linker design is reported, which displays solid&#8208;state luminescence that is not observed for the molecular analogue.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Nitric Acid from Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) has drawn widespread attention due to its potential for the green synthesis of nitric acid. Since a prerequisite for the favorable development of this emerging field is the rational testing of NOR performance, a recommended protocol is presented in this Minireview. In addition, possible reaction mechanisms and future perspectives, as well as challenges related to NOR, are discussed.







Abstract
Nitric acid is widely applied in agriculture and industry. The present manufacturing process via a combination of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process and the Ostwald oxidation process is accompanied by massive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The direct electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitric acid is a promising alternative, especially when it is driven by renewable energy sources. The standardization of performance evaluation is the prerequisite for the design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for NOR. In this context, this Minireview first discusses the history of the development of HNO3 manufacturing and the possible reaction mechanisms for electrocatalytic NOR. Then, a strict protocol for electrochemical NOR experiments is recommended. Finally, general research targets associated with techno&#8208;economic analysis, challenges, and prospects for NOR are summarized for future studies.

         <title>A Molecular Pump Facilitates Mechanical Adsorption Away from Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attaching or embedding biological or artificial molecular pumps to or into a surface or interface to achieve compartmentalization enables their unidirectional molecular motion to be organized in a confined environment. This approach led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way towards building highly complex organized molecular architectures.







Abstract
Artificial molecular pumps that perform unidirectional motion on the molecular scale have been used to design systems operating away from equilibrium. Crafting such pumps onto a surface allows their unidirectional movement to be organized in a confined environment as well as the active pumping of adsorbents from the bulk solution to the surface. This study led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way for the construction of highly complex organized molecular architectures.

         <title>Coordinated Anionic Inorganic Module: An Efficient Approach Towards Highly Efficient Blue&#8208;Emitting Copper Halide Ionic Hybrid Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper halide based organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid structures exhibit great potential as light&#8208;emitting materials. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115225), Wei Liu, Gangfeng Ouyang et&#8197;al. report a facile strategy for the synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating a coordinated anionic inorganic module with a neutral organic ligand molecule. By using this approach, a family of blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures has been prepared with high internal quantum yields up to 98&#8201;%.

         <title>A &#8220;Blockchain&#8221; Synergy in Conductive Polymer&#8208;Filled Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Plating/Stripping with High Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; matrix Li storage is proposed by utilizing the N&#8208;rich polypyrrole (PPy) as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to fill and interlink the &#8220;blocks&#8221; of MOF cavities. The lithiophilic PPy helps to guide fast infiltration/extrusion of Li+ ions and serve as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li deposition, while the MOF pores enable the compartmentalization of the otherwise bulk Li deposition and provide spatial confinement for accommodating 3D matrix Li storage.







Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume expansion on the metal anodes. Inspired by the &#8220;blockchain&#8221; concept in data mining, here we utilize a conductive polymer&#8208;filled metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as the lithium host, in which polypyrrole (PPy) serves as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to interlink Li &#8220;blocks&#8221; stored in the MOF pores. While the N&#8208;rich PPy guides fast Li+ infiltration/extrusion and serves as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li growth, the MOF pores compartmentalize bulk Li deposition for 3D matrix Li storage, leading to low&#8208;barrier and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping with superb Coulombic efficiency. The as&#8208;fabricated lithium&#8208;metal anodes operate over 700&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and 800 cycles at 1&#8197;C in full cells with a per&#8208;cycle capacity loss of only 0.017&#8201;%. This work might open a new chapter for Li&#8208;metal anode construction by introducing the concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; management of Li plating/stripping.

         <title>Generic Rules for Distinguishing Autophoretic Colloidal Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;diffusiophoretic motors slow down sharply with population density while self&#8208;electrophoretic motors maintain an almost constant speed regardless of their population density. Self&#8208;diffusiophoretic motors form continuously growing clusters, while self&#8208;electrophoretic motors form dynamic clusters with limited sizes.







Abstract
Distinguishing the operating mechanisms of nano&#8208; and micromotors powered by chemical gradients, i.e. &#8220;autophoresis&#8221;, holds the key for fundamental and applied reasons. In this article, we propose and experimentally confirm that the speeds of a self&#8208;diffusiophoretic colloidal motor scale inversely to its population density but not for self&#8208;electrophoretic motors, because the former is an ion source and thus increases the solution ionic strength over time while the latter does not. They also form clusters in visually distinguishable and quantifiable ways. This pair of rules is simple, powerful, and insensitive to the specific material composition, shape or size of a colloidal motor, and does not require any measurement beyond typical microscopy. These rules are not only useful in clarifying the operating mechanisms of typical autophoretic micromotors, but also in predicting the dynamics of unconventional ones that are yet to be experimentally realized, even those involving enzymes.

         <title>A Chemical Biology Toolbox Targeting the Intracellular Binding Site of CCR9: Fluorescent Ligands, New Drug Leads and PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the intracellular CCR9 antagonist vercirnon, we developed the first small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based fluorescent ligand targeting the intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) of a GPCR. This tool enabled binding studies via NanoBRET, fluorescence microscopy, and the discovery of a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To induce CCR9 degradation, we developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Starting from vercirnon, an intracellular C&#8722;C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) antagonist and previous phase III clinical candidate for the treatment of Crohn's disease, we developed a chemical biology toolbox targeting the IABS of CCR9. We first synthesized a fluorescent ligand enabling equilibrium and kinetic binding studies via NanoBRET as well as fluorescence microscopy. Applying this molecular tool in a membrane&#8208;based setup and in living cells, we discovered a 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine analogue as a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To chemically induce CCR9 degradation, we then developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we succeeded in showing that our CCR9&#8208;PROTAC is able to reduce CCR9 levels, thereby offering an unprecedented approach to modulate GPCR activity.

         <title>Planar Chirality: A Mine for Catalysis and Structure Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the benefits of molecules exhibiting planar chirality have recently been recognized in different areas of chemistry, the shortage of available catalytic methods for generating planar chirality has precluded their use. This Minireview aims to highlight the infancy of the area and serve as a source of inspiration for the design of unconventional methods for the generation of three&#8208;dimensional complexity from accessible simple/linear molecules.







Abstract
Planar chirality is one of the most fascinating expressions of chirality, which is exploited by nature to lock three&#8208;dimensional chiral conformations and, more recently, by chemists to create new chiral reagents, catalysts, and functional organic materials. Nevertheless, the shortage of procedures able to induce and secure asymmetry during the generation of these unique chiral entities has dissuaded chemists from exploiting their structural properties. This Minireview intends to illustrate the limited but remarkable catalytic methods that have been reported for the production of planar chirality in strained molecules and serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new unconventional procedures, which are expected to appear in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;Planar chirality is one of the most fascinating expressions of chirality, which is exploited by nature to lock three-dimensional chiral conformations and, more recently, by chemists to create new chiral reagents, catalysts, and functional organic materials. Nevertheless, the shortage of procedures able to induce and secure asymmetry during the generation of these unique chiral entities has dissuaded chemists from exploiting their structural properties. This Minireview intends to illustrate the limited but remarkable catalytic methods that have been reported for the production of planar chirality in strained molecules and serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new unconventional procedures, which are expected to appear in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Developing an Effective Glycan&#8208;Based Vaccine for Streptococcus Pyogenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infectious diseases are a human welfare threat. This Review outlines the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation of subunit vaccines developed against S.&#8197;pyogenes, highlighting the different glycotope constructs and carrier systems used as well as shedding light on some recent interventions which were developed to overcome the limitations of carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.







Abstract
Streptococcus pyogenes is a primary infective agent that causes approximately 700&#8197;million human infections each year, resulting in more than 500&#8201;000 deaths. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines are proven to be one of the most promising subunit vaccine candidates, as the bacterial glycan pattern(s) are different from mammalian cells and show increased pathogen serotype conservancy than the protein components. In this Review we highlight reverse vaccinology for use in the development of subunit vaccines against S.&#8197;pyogenes, and report reproducible methods of carbohydrate antigen production, in addition to the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation between group&#8197;A carbohydrate epitopes and alternative vaccine antigen carrier systems. We also report recent advances used to overcome hurdles in carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.

         <title>Surface Modification of Nano&#8208;Cu2O for Controlling CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Ethylene and Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controllable production of important carbon resources was achieved by a surface modification strategy of nano&#8208;Cu2O catalysts. Through facet controlling the highest C2H4 selectivity among Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts was achieved, while the products were completely converted to syngas with an appropriate H2:CO ratio via a MOF coating on the surface of the nano&#8208;Cu2O.







Abstract
In the surroundings of carbon neutrality, nano&#8208;Cu2O is considered a promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR), whose improvements in product selectivity still require considerable efforts. Here, we present an efficient strategy for controlling the ECO2RR product by modifying the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O, i.e., by controlling the exposed facets via a reductant&#8208;controlled method to achieve the highest C2H4 selectivity (Faradic efficiency=74.1&#8201;%) for Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts in neutral electrolytes, and introducing a well&#8208;suited metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coating on the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O to obtain syngas completely with an appropriate H2:CO ratio. Detailed mechanism and key intermediate have been illustrated by DFT calculations. Our systematic strategy is expected to control the ECO2RR product, improve the selectivity, and provide a reliable method for CO2 management and the green production of important carbon resources.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Encoded Integration of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported that integrates silica&#8208;metal (Au/Ag) heterostructures by programming the density and length of protruding dsDNA strands on a DNA origami template. The binding energy differences between silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules achieves a heterogeneous integration process.







Abstract
Integrating dissimilar materials at the nanoscale is crucial for modern electronics and optoelectronics. The structural DNA nanotechnology provides a universal platform for precision assembly of materials; nevertheless, heterogeneous integration of dissimilar materials with DNA nanostructures has yet to be explored. We report a DNA origami&#8208;encoded strategy for integrating silica&#8208;metal heterostructures. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal distinctive mechanisms for the binding and aggregation of silica and metal clusters on protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) strands that are prescribed on the DNA origami template. In particular, the binding energy differences of silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules underlies the accessibilities of dissimilar material areas on DNA origami. By programming the densities and lengths of protruding dsDNA strands on DNA origami, silica and metal materials can be independently deposited at their predefined areas with a high vertical precision of 2&#8197;nm. We demonstrate the integration of silica&#8208;gold and silica&#8208;silver heterostructures with high site addressability. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy is thus applicable for integrating various types of dissimilar materials, which opens up new routes to bottom&#8208;up electronics.

         <title>Vanadium&#8208;Incorporated CoP2 with Lattice Expansion for Highly Efficient Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust V&#8722;CoP2 porous nanowire was fabricated by incorporating vanadium into a CoP2 lattice. The V incorporation results in an upshift of the d&#8208;band center, boosting HER activity. Meanwhile, V promotes the generation of a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances the acidic OER stability. It presents a low voltage (1.47&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable stability toward acidic water splitting.







Abstract
A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) in acidic medium is a hopeful scenario for hydrogen production using renewable energy, but the grand challenge lies in substituting noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, a robust electrocatalyst of V&#8722;CoP2 porous nanowires arranged on a carbon cloth is successfully fabricated by incorporating vanadium into the CoP2 lattice. Structural characterizations and theoretical analysis indicate that lattice expansion of CoP2 caused by V incorporation results in the upshift of the d&#8208;band center, which is conducive to hydrogen adsorption for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, V promotes surface reconstruction to generate a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances acid&#8208;corrosion resistance and optimizes the adsorption of water and oxygen&#8208;containing species, thus improving activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Accordingly, it presents a superior acidic overall water splitting activity (1.47&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to Pt&#8722;C/CC||RuO2/CC (1.59&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and remarkable stability. This work proposes a new route to design efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for PEMWE.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Permeable and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) Enrichable Cross&#8208;Linking Reagent to Advance In&#8197;Vivo Cross&#8208;Linking Mass Spectrometry</title>

A phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX, has been developed that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The optimized tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) system enables the time&#8208;efficient and detailed characterization of protein interaction landscapes in intact human cells.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) is an attractive method for the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein structures and interactions. Currently, the depth of in&#8197;vivo XL&#8208;MS studies is lagging behind the established applications to cell lysates, because cross&#8208;linking reagents that can penetrate intact cells and strategies to enrich cross&#8208;linked peptides lack efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we have developed a phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX, that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. We have established a tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo XL&#8208;MS approach that enables cross&#8208;links in intact human cells to be identified in high numbers with substantially reduced analysis time. Collectively, the developed cross&#8208;linker and XL&#8208;MS approach pave the way for the comprehensive XL&#8208;MS characterization of living systems.

         <title>Moderated Basicity of Endohedral Amine Groups in an Octa&#8208;Cationic Self&#8208;Assembled Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endohedrally functionalized self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex with 12 internal amines in the cavity acts as an acid host, and shows differential basicity, moderated by the cage superstructure.







Abstract
A self&#8208;assembled FeII4L6 cage was synthesized with 12 internal amines in the cavity. The cage forms as the dodeca&#8208;ammonium salt, despite the cage carrying an overall 8+ charge at the metal centers, extracting protons from displaced water in the reaction. Despite this, the basicity of the internal amines is lower than their counterparts in free solution. The 12 amines have a sliding scale of basicity, with a &#8776;6&#8197;pKa unit difference between the first and last protons to be removed. This moderation of side&#8208;chain basicity in an active site is a hallmark of enzymatic catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Oligosaccharides through Versatile C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation of Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation of glycosides is disclosed. This saccharide assembly by C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation featured excellent site&#8208; and stereoselectivity and enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse C&#8208;disaccharides and C&#8208;trisaccharides.







Abstract
C&#8208;oligosaccharides are pharmacologically relevant because they are more hydrolysis&#8208;resistant than O&#8208;oligosaccharides. Despite indisputable advances, C&#8208;oligosaccharides continue to be underdeveloped, likely due to a lack of efficient and selective strategies for the assembly of the interglycosidic C&#8722;C linkages. In contrast, we, herein, report a versatile and robust strategy for the synthesis of structurally complex C&#8208;oligosaccharides via catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activations. Thus, a wealth of complex interglycosidic (2&#8594;1)&#8208; and (1&#8594;1)&#8208;C&#8208;oligosaccharides becomes readily available by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H glycoside glycosylation. The isolation of key palladacycle intermediates and experiments with isotopically&#8208;labeled compounds identified a trans&#8208;stereoselectivity for the C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation. The glycoside C(sp3)&#8722;H activation manifold was likewise exploited for the diversification of furanoses, pyranoses and disaccharides.

         <title>A Br&#248;nsted Acidic Gallium Hydride: Facile Interconversion of NNNN&#8208;Macrocycle Supported [GaI]+ and [GaIIIH]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of an NNNN&#8208;macrocycle chelated gallium(I) cation provides a rare dicationic gallium(III) hydride. This process is easily reversed by treatment of the Br&#248;nsted acidic (pKa=24.5) hydride with a neutral base. Similar facile redox cycling was not observed for analogous aluminium, indium, or thallium systems.







Abstract
Protonolysis of [Cp*M] (M=Ga, In, Tl) with [(Me4TACD)H][BAr4Me] (Me4TACD=N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane; [BAr4Me]&#8722;=[B{C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CH3)2}4]&#8722;) provided monovalent salts [(Me4TACD)M][BAr4Me], whereas [Cp*Al]4 yielded trivalent [(Me4TACD)AlH][BAr4Me]2. Protonation of [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me] with [Et3NH][BAr4Me] gave an unusually acidic (pKa(CH3CN)=24.5) gallium(III) hydride dication [(Me4TACD)GaH][BAr4Me]2. Deprotonation with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;ylidene) returned [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me]. These reversible processes occur with formal two&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction of gallium. DFT calculations suggest that gallium(I) protonation is facilitated by strong coordination of the tetradentate ligand, which raises the HOMO energy. High nuclear charge of [(Me4TACD)GaH]2+ facilitates hydride&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer during deprotonation. Attempts to prepare a gallium(III) dihydride cation resulted in spontaneous dehydrogenation to [(Me4TACD)Ga]+.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An attractive deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of amides with polyfluoroarenes was successfully achieved. Aromatic amides act as readily available carbene precursors through a Sm/SmI2&#8208;mediated deoxygenation process, and the insertion of the carbene into the C&#8722;H bond of polyfluoroarene affords architecturally complex and functionally diverse &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines in a single step.







Abstract
Considering the ubiquitous nature and ready synthesis of amides, and the great significance of organofluorine&#8208;containing species, the cross&#8208;coupling of amides and polyfluoroarenes, leading to new carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming methodologies, would find useful applications in synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and rapid generation of molecular diversity. Herein, we present a novel synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines via Sm/SmI2&#8208;mediated deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of aromatic amides with polyfluoroarenes through direct C&#8722;H functionalization. The structural and functional diversity of these readily available precursors provides a versatile and flexible strategy for the streamlined synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, a novel plausible mechanism of the &#945;&#8208;aminocarbene&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H insertion has been revealed, which may stimulate future work for the development of novel methods in amine synthesis.

         <title>Rational Design of ZnMn2O4 Quantum Dots in a Carbon Framework for Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnMn2O4 quantum dots homogeneously embedded in a carbon framework (ZMO QD@C) are prepared by in&#8208;situ electrochemically inducing a Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived precursor. Owing to the formation of Mn&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds at the interface between the ZMO QDs and the carbon matrix, the composite reveals superior cycling stability in a pure ZnSO4 electrolyte by inhibiting the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and the disproportional reaction of the discharge product.







Abstract
Manganese oxides are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high energy density and low cost. However, in their discharging processes, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and Mn3+ disproportionation often lead to irreversible structural transformation and Mn2+ dissolution, deteriorating the cycling stability of ZIBs. Herein, ZnMn2O4 quantum dots (ZMO QDs) were introduced into a porous carbon framework by in&#8208;situ electrochemically inducing Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived Mn3O4 quantum dots and the carbon composite. In such ZMO QDs and carbon composite, the quantum dot structure endows ZnMn2O4 with a shorter ion diffusion route and more active sites for Zn2+. The conductive carbon framework is beneficial to the fast transport of electrons. Furthermore, at the interface between the ZMO QDs and the carbon matrix, the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds are formed. They can effectively suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and manganese dissolution of discharge products. Therefore, Zn/ZMO QD@C batteries display remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF)&#8208;Based Multifunctional Cargo Vehicle for Reactive&#8208;Gas Delivery and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifaceted metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can act as a food truck to adsorb, store, and deliver toxic gases to organic reactions. We showcase the versatility of MOFs by employing them as a safe&#8208;delivery tool, while simultaneously catalyzing organic reactions, producing yields and conversions that are comparable to the reactions utilizing the toxic gases directly.







Abstract
The efficient delivery of reactive and toxic gaseous reagents to organic reactions was studied using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The simultaneous cargo vehicle and catalytic capabilities of several MOFs were probed for the first time using the examples of aromatization, aminocarbonylation, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions. These reactions highlight that MOFs can serve a dual role as a gas cargo vehicle and a catalyst, leading to product formation with yields similar to reactions employing pure gases. Furthermore, the MOFs can be recycled without sacrificing product yield, while simultaneously maintaining crystallinity. The reported findings were supported crystallographically and spectroscopically (e.g., diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy), foreshadowing a pathway for the development of multifunctional MOF&#8208;based reagent&#8208;catalyst cargo vessels for reactive gas reagents as an attractive alternative to the use of toxic pure gases or gas generators.
